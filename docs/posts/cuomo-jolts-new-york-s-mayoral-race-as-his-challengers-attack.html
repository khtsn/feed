Not anymore.</p><p>The contest was expected to lurch into motion on Sunday with a new front-runner: former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. He, Mayor Eric Adams and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/nyregion/nyc-mayor-candidates-2025.html" title="">seven fellow Democrats</a> will face off in a four-month fight to Primary Day.</p><p>Fresh off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-mayor-nyc.html" title="">announcing his candidacy</a>, Mr. Cuomo, 67, planned a burst of activity to reintroduce himself to New Yorkers and show the range of his appeal. Among other events, he was expected to pick up his first labor endorsement as a candidate at a rally with the carpenters’ union in Lower Manhattan.</p><p>The events marked Mr. Cuomo’s first experience as a bona fide candidate since 2018, and the start of a bid to convince voters to give him a second chance after he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-resigns.html" title="">resigned the governorship</a> in 2021 amid accusations of sexual harassment. Mr. Cuomo has denied wrongdoing, but his opponents are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/nyregion/cuomo-sexual-harassment-women.html" title="">determined to remind voters of the scandal</a>.</p><p>His comeback attempt was met with immediate blowback from political forces as diverse as women’s rights organizations and The New York Post. The right-leaning tabloid <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/01/opinion/behold-biggest-liar-in-new-york-wants-to-be-mayor/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slammed him</a> on Saturday as “colossus of canards, a freak of fabrication, a behemoth of balderdash,” while the other candidates argued he had failed New York City as governor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A left-leaning super PAC was already engaged to stop Mr. Cuomo, an avowed moderate. The group, New Yorkers for Better Leadership, held a call on Saturday to highlight stains on Mr. Cuomo’s record, including criticism from a woman who lost her mother at a nursing home during the pandemic and blamed Mr. Cuomo’s leadership.</p><p>Lauren Hitt, a spokeswoman for the group, said that Mr. Cuomo had worsened problems like subway delays and street homelessness.</p><p>“We cannot trust Andrew Cuomo with our subways or our streets, our grandmothers or our granddaughters,” she said.</p><p>While other candidates hustled out statements bashing Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Adams remained silent on Saturday. The mayor has faced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/nyregion/eric-adams-resign.html" title="">growing calls to resign</a> over concerns that he is beholden to President Trump after his administration moved to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/nyregion/eric-adams-drop-charges-sdny.html" title="">drop federal corruption charges</a> against Mr. Adams.</p><p>Mr. Adams has kept his resolve to remain in office, and maintains that he has a path to re-election. Yet his campaign has been almost nonexistent. He recently set up a <a href="https://ericadamsformayor.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">simple campaign website</a> but has not hired a campaign manager and his fund-raising has slowed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker, is expected to decide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/nyregion/adrienne-adams-mayor-nyc.html" title="">whether she will run for mayor</a> in the coming days. She recently created a campaign fund-raising committee and has support from Letitia James, the state attorney general, who has been a fierce critic of Mr. Cuomo.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo made his first campaign stop on Saturday at a restaurant in the Bronx and was endorsed by Yudelka Tapia, a state lawmaker and ally of Representative Adriano Espaillat. Mr. Espaillat endorsed Mr. Adams in the 2021 mayoral race and met recently with Mr. Cuomo.</p><p>“All too often the needs of my constituents are ignored — that wasn’t the case when Andrew Cuomo was governor,” Ms. Tapia said, citing his efforts to raise the minimum wage as governor.</p><p>Each mayoral campaign sought to make their strongest arguments against Mr. Cuomo. Scott Stringer, the former city comptroller, <a href="https://x.com/scottmstringer/status/1895904278675599549" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a combative video</a>, comparing Mr. Cuomo’s comeback campaign to that of Eliot Spitzer, the former governor who lost to Mr. Stringer in the 2013 comptroller’s race.</p><p>“We shocked a lot of people when we won that race,” Mr. Stringer said. “You’ll forgive me if I’m not shaking in my boots when people say Andrew Cuomo is the front-runner for mayor, the same Cuomo who has always put his ego and his interests ahead of our city.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Zellnor Myrie, a state senator from Brooklyn, said that Mr. Cuomo’s policies often hurt Black New Yorkers, through funding cuts to schools and the subway.</p><p>“New York City deserves a mayor who cares about our city, lives in our city and puts our city first,” he said.</p><p>Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens, took the opportunity to knock both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Adams in the same breath.</p><p>“If New Yorkers want a corrupt bully with a record of alleged sexual misconduct, supporting Republicans, selling out to developers, and exacerbating crises, they can just stick with the current mayor,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
