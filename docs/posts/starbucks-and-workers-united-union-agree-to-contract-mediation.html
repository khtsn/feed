But Starbucks did not offer a substantial wage increase during the latest bargaining session in December, the union said. At the time, the company called the union’s wage proposals “not sustainable.”</p><p>The standoff prompted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/business/starbucks-strike.html" title="">a five-day strike that began</a> in about 10 to 15 stores in Los Angeles, Seattle and Chicago and spread to dozens more in major cities during the busy holiday season, union representatives said at the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The union effort at Starbucks began in Buffalo in 2021, and about 5 percent of the chain’s company-owned U.S. locations have now organized. Federal regulators have accused the company of violating labor law hundreds of times in its efforts to clamp down on union organizing. Starbucks has denied the accusations.</p><p>Last February, after months of stalled talks, Starbucks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/business/economy/starbucks-workers-united-union.html" title="">signaled a shift</a> in its approach to the labor campaign under a newly installed chief executive, Laxman Narasimhan, who agreed to begin contract discussions.</p><p>But what the union viewed at the time as a notable change in strategy has failed to yield an agreement. After monthly bargaining sessions began in April, both sides said they hoped to complete a framework for a national contract by the end of the year — a deadline they ultimate did not meet. Mr. Narasimhan left the company in August.</p><p>In the most recent bargaining session in December, the company offered to guarantee baristas a wage increase of at least 1.5 percent a year.</p><p>“We are optimistic that Starbucks will move off of their fixed position on wage and benefits improvements in this next phase of negotiations,” Michelle Eisen, a longtime Starbucks barista who has helped lead the organizing, said in a statement on Thursday.</p><p>Noam Scheiber<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
