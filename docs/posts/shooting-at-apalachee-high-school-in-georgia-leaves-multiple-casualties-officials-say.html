Federal investigators, as well as the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, were on the scene. </p><p>Parents, some parking more than a mile away, walked toward the school, anxious to reconnect with their children. Hundreds of students, who had been evacuated from the school, were waiting on the school’s football field. </p><p>Gov. Brian P. Kemp said on social media that he was directing all available state resources “to respond to the incident” at the school in Barrow County.</p><p>The White House said in a statement that President Biden had been briefed on the shooting and that the administration would continue coordinating with federal, state, and local officials.</p><p>The shooting happened on the fifth full week of school at Apalachee High School, a rural campus with roughly 1,800 students in ninth through 12th grades. </p><p>Several schools in the area were under lockdown on Wednesday morning as the authorities responded to the shooting on Wednesday morning, according to a spokeswoman for the school and the sheriff’s department. </p><p>The shooting has also prompted schools across the region to ramp up security as a precaution. In Atlanta, which is more than an hour away, Mayor Andre Dickens said that the police force for the city’s public schools would “bolster patrols” for the rest of the day “out of an abundance of caution.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
