    <h1>Signal Clone Used by Waltz Suspends Service After ‘Security Incident’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The application that the Trump White House has been using to collect and securely store messages sent on popular commercial encrypted apps has temporarily suspended service in the wake of a security breach, the application’s owner said on Monday.</p><p>The application, TeleMessage, is owned by Smarsh, a company based in Portland, Ore., which provides tools for governments to comply with record-keeping regulations and laws. Last week, a Reuters photograph of Mike Waltz, then the national security adviser, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/mike-waltz-signal-photo.html" title="">showed that he was using the application</a> to read Signal messages on his phone.</p><p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">404 Media reported</a> that a hacker had breached the Israeli company that makes TeleMessage and stolen the contents of some direct messages and group chats sent using its Signal clone, as well as modified versions of WhatsApp, Telegram and WeChat.</p><p>Smarsh declined to answer questions, but in a statement, a spokeswoman said that it was investigating “a recent security incident” and that, “Out of an abundance of caution, all TeleMessage services have been temporarily suspended.”</p></div></div>
