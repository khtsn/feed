The agreement, which still needs formal approval in Lebanon, is supposed to take effect at 4 a.m. local time tomorrow, said President Biden, who pushed Israel to agree to the deal.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/26/world/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-cease-fire" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>Under the deal, Israel would withdraw its forces from Lebanon over the next 60 days and Hezbollah would move its fighters north. Biden said it is intended “to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.”</p><p>Hezbollah did not immediately comment on the announcement. Lebanon’s government, which does not control Hezbollah but whose approval is essential, was set to meet tomorrow morning to discuss the cease-fire agreement. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-lebanon-invasion-map.html" title="">Here’s a map of what the truce would look like</a>.</p><p>Approval from Israeli ministers, in a 10 to 1 vote, came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraced the proposal in a televised speech.
