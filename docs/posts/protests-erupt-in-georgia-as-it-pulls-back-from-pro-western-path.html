Mr. Kobakhidze also said that Georgia would decline all grants from the European Union, which has allocated more than $500 million to the country since 2019.</p><p>Demonstrators blocked the main avenue in Tbilisi, chanting “slaves” and “Russians,” before they were dispersed by riot police, whose officers used water cannons and tear gas to push the crowd away from the Parliament building.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs said in <a href="https://police.ge/en/shinagan-saqmeta-saministros-gantskhadeba/16475" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> that its law enforcement officers had detained 43 protesters. The police also said that 32 officers were injured.</p><p>A mountainous country of 3.7 million, Georgia has been at the crossroads of great power interests for centuries. The current political crisis was prompted by the disputed victory of the Georgian Dream in parliamentary elections in October.</p><p>The opposition, which received 61 out of 150 seats, said the election had been rigged and has since followed through on its vow to boycott the new Parliament.</p><p>Mr. Kobakhidze said that Georgia was not abandoning its goal of joining the European Union, but was pausing to reconsider the terms of accession.
