He was 70.</p><p>A spokesman for his youngest sister, the singer Janet Jackson, said in a statement on Monday that Mr. Jackson died of a heart attack while driving to Oklahoma from New Mexico. The statement did not say where he died. Mr. Jackson <a href="https://tulsaworld.com/life-entertainment/local/music/why-tito-jackson-of-the-jackson-5-now-lives-in-claremore/article_4d04b964-2908-11ef-9307-e734e6f99c80.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Tulsa World in June</a> that he had recently moved to a ranch in Claremore, Okla., about 25 miles northeast of Tulsa.</p><p>The Jackson 5, one of the most popular musical acts of their era, were responsible for launching the solo career of Michael Jackson, who earned the title “King of Pop” and became one of the most emulated musicians of all time. Michael Jackson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/arts/music/26jackson.html" title="">died in 2009</a> at 50.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The story of the Jackson 5, from their humble beginnings in Gary, Ind., to their various levels of success, has been well documented and was the subject of a five-hour ABC mini-series in 1992 called “The Jacksons: An American Dream.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Jackson 5 in an undated photo.

Tito is largely remembered for being the guitarist in the group, a skill he picked up by watching his father. The elder Mr. Jackson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/obituaries/joseph-jackson-dies.html" title="">died in 2018</a>.</p><p>In a 2019 interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A_w198VMUI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with Vlad TV</a>, Tito Jackson said that as a child he would play his father’s guitar behind his back.</p><p>“One day I broke the string and I didn’t know what to do about it,” he said. “He came home and saw the string broke and was really upset about it.”</p><p>After punishing him, Mr. Jackson said, his father asked him to demonstrate what he knew. His father then gave him the guitar with the instructions to learn every song on the radio.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The family soon formed the Jackson Brothers, a group that included young Michael, who was given a spot after impressing the family with a performance of “Climb Every Mountain” at a talent show. The band’s name was later changed to the Jackson 5 after someone suggested it after a performance at a wedding.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Jackson 5 was a household name in the 1970s, regularly appearing on television, sometimes next to Cher or Diana Ross. Their music, through more than a dozen albums, provided a soundtrack for a young generation and incited a level of fandom that is perhaps now reserved only for elite pop stars like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.</p><p>“I remember the very first time we went to the U.K. and we had something like 10,000 screaming fans to greet us at the airport,” Mr. Jackson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIaiuxv8HM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Sister Circle TV in 2019</a>. “I got lost in the airport and 1,000 fans chasing me, pulling everywhere. It was crazy.”</p><p>Three of the Jackson 5’s biggest songs — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niXNQ5dEcEA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“ABC,”</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2bVIBwpCTA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“I Want You Back”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRdG9vEJOKY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“I’ll Be There”</a> —were inducted into the <a href="https://www.grammy.com/awards/hall-of-fame-award" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grammy Hall of Fame</a>. The group was inducted into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS6lw2DbcVI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1997 alongside the Bee Gees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Jackson continued to work in the music business over the years, releasing a solo album, “Tito Time,” in 2016, and touring alongside some of his brothers. The group, now called The Jacksons, was scheduled to perform in Atlantic City, N.J., in October and in Cincinnati in November.</p><p>“We’ve always said that it’s the fans that make the artist,” Mr. Jackson told Sister Circle TV. “We go to work, we make music and we do all these other things, but it’s actually the fans who love it and buy it.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
