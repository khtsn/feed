    <h1>For Families of Those Missing After Israeli Strike in Beirut, an Agonizing Wait</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The scenes playing out on the streets of Beirut mirrored similar signs of desperation on social media, where families posted pictures of missing loved ones, labeled with phone numbers in case anyone spotted them. Others posted the names and pictures of dazed, wounded children who had arrived alone at hospitals for treatment.</p><p>Across Beirut on Saturday, as people traded stories of missing loved ones, some residents said they hoped Hezbollah would strike back fiercely in revenge. Others wondered quietly among themselves how a group seen as Israel’s most formidable regional foe had seen its operations so deeply penetrated.</p><p>Hezbollah is not only a militia that is one of Iran’s most powerful allies in the region. It is also a political organization that retains broad support from many of Lebanon’s Shiite Muslims, a community that was historically poor and marginalized.</p><p>The group has retained their support throughout previous wars with Israel, even as cross-border clashes become ever more costly in this current conflict — not just in lives, but also in the displacement of thousands who fled the near daily exchange of rocket fire between Israel and Hezbollah on Lebanon’s southern border.</p><p>That is in part because of Hezbollah’s influence in Lebanon, where the group has become the most powerful force in the country, and also because of the broad range of services it provides, including quality health care and free education.</p><p>Despite growing anger and calls for revenge against Israel, many Hezbollah supporters said they would stand by whatever the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, deemed the best path forward.</p><p>On Saturday, videos shared by journalists close to Hezbollah showed cranes and bulldozers sifting through scattered debris around a cratered blast site, with clouds of dust hanging overhead.</p><p>Outside the destroyed buildings on Saturday, Ms. Qubaisi did not demand that Hezbollah take revenge. But she called for other Arab countries to act to thwart Israel’s escalating attacks: “We want Arab countries to break their silence, to do something against these crimes.”</p></div></div>
