Counterterrorism specialists pointed to several telltale signs.</p><p>“By carrying an ISIS flag with him during the attack, the suspect wanted to show that he was a true believer, aligned with the ISIS cause, and perhaps hoping to trigger others into following suit,” said Colin P. Clarke, a counterterrorism analyst at the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm based in New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-46482dd4">History</h2><p>The Islamic State is a Sunni Muslim insurgent group that traces its origins to Al Qaeda in Iraq, which nearly pushed Iraq into civil war before it was defeated by local militias and American troops. </p><p>Fighters from the group rebranded as the Islamic State by 2013.
