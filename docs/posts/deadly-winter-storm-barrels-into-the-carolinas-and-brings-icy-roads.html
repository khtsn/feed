And that intense snowfall, he added, could refreeze and make roads dangerous.</p><p>In Louisiana, where Gulf Coast communities received as much as nine inches of snow over the past day, the authorities on Wednesday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/louisiana-snow-blizzard-i10-road-closure.html" title="">closed a 100-mile stretch of Interstate 10</a> that spans nearly half the state.</p><p>The <a href="https://wwwapps.dotd.la.gov/administration/announcements/Announcement.aspx?key=37557" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement</a> shortly after midnight meant that 200 miles of the highway in Louisiana were closed because of deteriorating conditions. The authorities had previously closed a 50-mile stretch between Baton Rouge and Lafayette, and another 50 miles in and around New Orleans since early Tuesday.</p><p>Most of the stills <a href="https://www.511la.org/cctv?start=0&amp;length=10&amp;filters%5B0%5D%5Bi%5D=2&amp;filters%5B0%5D%5Bs%5D=I-10&amp;order%5Bi%5D=1&amp;order%5Bdir%5D=asc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted by the Louisiana traffic department</a> from cameras along Interstate 10 at around 2 a.m. local time showed deserted, snow-covered stretches of the highway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Late Tuesday, the Florida Department of Transportation also shut down a 65-mile stretch of Interstate 10 in the western Panhandle, citing “hazardous winter weather conditions.” It is rare for the Florida part of the highway — it stretches all the way to Los Angeles — to close outside of the natural disasters that the state is more used to dealing with: hurricanes.</p><p>Cities and towns from Houston to New Orleans were blanketed this week with snowfall totals unseen in decades. At least two people died of exposure in Austin, and one in Atlanta. Five people died in a vehicle crash on an icy road in Zavala County, Texas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Record Snowfall Blankets New Orleans</h2><h4>A powerful winter storm tore across the Gulf Coast on Tuesday, bring record snowfall to parts of Louisiana and Texas.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“This is absolutely crazy.” “The last time I remember it snowing was right before Katrina in 2004, but it wasn’t anything significant. It hit the ground and melted. I don’t think I’ve ever seen snow actually stick to the ground out in New Orleans.” “It’s been unusual. This is my first time seeing all this snow.

Mobile, Ala., a coastal city, received more than eight inches of snow by Tuesday evening, breaking a record from 1895. Just across the border, Florida had a taste of snowfall too and potential local and state records broken, as nearly nine inches was recorded in the far west of the panhandle in areas including, Milton and Oriole Beach. Meanwhile, Chalmette, La., just east of New Orleans, had recorded 11.5 inches of snow by Tuesday evening.</p><p>Victoria Oliva, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Wilmington, N.C., said that travel conditions would remain hazardous across Eastern North Carolina through at least late Wednesday night, when temperatures were expected to still be hovering in the teens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The last time that Wilmington had more than four inches of snow was in 2000, Ms. Oliva said, and the last time it received more than six inches was in 1989.</p><p>“So this is definitely a rare event for us,” she said.</p><p>The reality of so much snow in a coastal town that typically relishes sunny beach days was not exactly welcome news.
