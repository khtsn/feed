Nissan has been reckoning with a drop in sales that has pushed it to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/nissan-job-cuts.html" title="">make deep cuts</a> to its global operations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Honda viewed Nissan making progress with its restructuring plans as a condition for a potential merger to move forward. As it performed its own analysis, examining factors including projections of the profitability of Nissan models, the company decided it needed to lay down “strict” conditions for a merger, the person said.</p><p>It remains uncertain where Nissan and Honda will stand if the merger talks are formally suspended. The deal was viewed as a lifeline for Nissan in particular. Honda retains a profitable two-wheeler business, but both automakers are struggling under the weight of the difficult and expensive transition toward electric and software-laden vehicles.</p><p>Honda and Nissan had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/business/honda-nissan-talks-merger.html" title="">pitched</a> their combination as a way to share the financial burden by developing and investing in next-generation vehicles together. Nissan sells more than three million vehicles a year, while Honda sells nearly four million. A merger would position them as the world’s third-largest automaker group, behind Toyota and Volkswagen.</p><p>Talks are continuing, the two people familiar with the negotiations said. Nothing formal is likely to be announced by the companies until at least next week, when Honda and Nissan report their earnings for the recent October-December quarter.</p><p>Nissan’s shares fell nearly 5 percent in trading on Wednesday. Honda’s shares gained more than 8 percent.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
