I was just like, ‘It’s all going to be OK.’ But in my head, I was like, ‘I don’t know if it’s going to bring up anything that I felt when I was younger.’ And it did, a little bit.

One is, because it’s been played by so many iconic women, and I bow down to all of them, the main challenge was to get them out of my head so that I could find my own. And the other big, big challenge that I’m facing every night, aside from just doing this mammoth role, is being a mother at the same time in real life. And so that’s been weighing on my mind and my heart quite a bit.” — Audra McDonald</p><p>“I had the thought for the first time yesterday, during the show, ‘Oh, I know what this is. I know what I’m doing. I don’t have to be afraid.’ For the past six to eight months, it’s been a big thing of proving to myself that I belonged there. That I could do it, amongst giants. I felt so small. I feel like I’m in my body, and I’m my size now.” — Joy Woods</p><p>“My whole career has been hard. No matter who you are as an actor, you’re always told you’ll never make it. You’re always told there’s no slot for you, that you don’t fit into any category, that you’re not tall enough, or good-looking enough, or you’re too whatever. But still you persevere because you know that there’s some important story you need to tell.” — Danny Burstein</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><hr/><p>‘just in time’</p><h2 id="link-15fafe0b">Gracie Lawrence</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>“I get nervous before every performance, and a journey for me has been learning how to manage it, and how to use it to my advantage, which often comes in the form of jumping around onstage, and people being like, ‘Oh my God, she’s such a physical performer!’ and me being like, ‘That is me working out my nerves.’”</p><hr/><p>‘Sunset Boulevard’</p><h2 id="link-605ab896">Tom Francis</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-43"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/TONYS--84003-cover/TONYS--84003-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/TONYS--84003-cover/TONYS--84003-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/06/04/141347_1_TONYS--84003_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>“The hardest thing is sustaining eight shows a week.
