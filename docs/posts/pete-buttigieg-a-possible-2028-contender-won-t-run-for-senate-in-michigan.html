Mr. Buttigieg determined he could not run for both the Senate and the White House, according to one of the people familiar with his planning. The news was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/13/pete-buttigieg-michigan-senate-run-00227583" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier reported by Politico</a>.</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg, who ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, was seen as the most prominent potential contender in next year’s marquee Senate contest, a proven fund-raiser with strong name recognition and a devoted fan base in his party.</p><p>But he also would have been vulnerable to “carpetbagger” attacks, and was plainly aware of that risk. Mr. Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind., became a Michigan resident in 2022, moving to Traverse City, where <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pete-buttigieg-on-fatherhood/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he lives</a> with his husband, Chasten, and their twin toddlers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I have a lot of humility about having only moved to Michigan a few years ago,” he said when asked in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/22/us/politics/democrats-religion-shapiro-warnock-buttigieg.html" title="">interview in December</a> about a possible run for governor there. “Although, of course, I did grow up in the neighborhood.”</p><p><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/22/michigan-term-limits-governor-proposal-b/74497692007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Term limits</a> will preclude Gov. Gretchen Whitmer from running for a third time next year, and Mr. Buttigieg is <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/01/mayor-pete-buttigieg-eyes-senate-bid-as-he-passes-on-run-for-michigan-governor/78131367007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not expected</a> to pursue that office.</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg’s Senate candidacy would have tested voters’ appetites for elevating a member of the Biden administration. Former Vice President Kamala Harris lost Michigan to President Trump in November, and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was unpopular for much of his presidency.</p><p>Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/michigan-senate-gretchen-whitmer.html" title="">who are eyeing the Senate race</a> include Representative Haley Stevens, a moderate from suburban Detroit; State Senator Mallory McMorrow, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/us/politics/mallory-mcmorrow-michigan.html" title="">won national Democratic acclaim</a> in 2022 with a speech defending liberal values; and Abdul El-Sayed, a progressive health director in Wayne County who ran unsuccessfully against Ms. Whitmer in the 2018 primary.</p><p>The race for governor has already prompted a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/garlin-gilchrist-michigan-governor-campaign.html" title="">crowded</a> and contentious Democratic primary. Both it and the Senate contest are expected to be competitive in the general election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the meantime, another Buttigieg is stepping into the spotlight in Michigan.</p><p>This spring, Chasten Buttigieg will release a children’s book whose title features <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pete-buttigieg-on-fatherhood/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the name</a> their children use for his husband. The book, “Papa’s Coming Home,” tells of children celebrating their father’s return from a trip. A book tour is scheduled to begin in Traverse City in mid-May.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J. Epstein covers campaigns and elections from Washington.
