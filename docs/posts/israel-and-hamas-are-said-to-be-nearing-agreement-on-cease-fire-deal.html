    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Israel and Hamas are engaging in another round of talks in Qatar on Tuesday as they near an agreement for a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages, according to a diplomat and a Palestinian in touch with Hamas leaders.</p><p>The new talks were a sign that the negotiations, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, were making progress after months of failed attempts to achieve a breakthrough.</p><p>If Hamas and Israel conclude a deal, it would bring some respite to Palestinians in Gaza, who have endured miserable conditions in displacement camps and relentless bombardments by Israel, and for the families of hostages abducted from Israel, who have worried for more than a year about the fate of their loved ones.</p><p>The diplomat said the talks would focus on addressing outstanding issues, while the Palestinian said they would center on details of how to implement an agreement.</p></div></div>
