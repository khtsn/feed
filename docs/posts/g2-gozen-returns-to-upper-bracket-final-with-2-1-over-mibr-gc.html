</span>. The loss came in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/287393/g2-gozen-vs-team-liquid-brazil-game-changers-2023-championship-s-o-paulo-main-event-lf" target="_blank">GCC 2023 lower final</a>, where Gozen was eliminated from the tournament and left unable to defend their title. MIBR <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/407936/mibr-gc-vs-team-liquid-brazil-game-changers-2024-brazil-series-3-gf" target="_blank">defeated Liquid</a> twice on their qualifying run, taking Brazil&#39;s sole slot in this year&#39;s Championship.</p>

<p>The match began on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/417795/g2-gozen-vs-mibr-gc-game-changers-2024-championship-berlin-ubsf/?game=190485&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>, with G2 barely taking the opening pistol round. MIBR was able to win a couple of rounds thanks to their economic advantage from previous rounds, but a thrifty win from G2 led to a timeout from the Brazilian squad. This started a back-and-forth between the teams, as MIBR adapted with utility-heavy strongholds and G2 responded in kind with patient site takes. </p>

</span> gets an ace as she tries to keep her team in the game</em></p>

<p>The first half ended 6-6, but MIBR kept their pace going into the second pistol, taking the lead for the first time in the series. Their success continued, as MIBR was able to string together a handful of rounds, forcing their opponent&#39;s second pause of the map. The timeout helped G2 get back on the scoreboard, capped off by a <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/17320/petra">

</span> ace. In the end, MIBR overwhelmed B site to win their last two rounds, ending their map 13-8.</p>

<p>“We were having issues on defense, we were very passive,” <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/20064/vania">

</span> said after the match regarding G2&#39;s Bind. </p>

<p>Moving on to Gozen&#39;s map pick, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/417795/g2-gozen-vs-mibr-gc-game-changers-2024-championship-berlin-ubsf/?game=190486&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>, the 2022 champions won their second opening round of the series with a solid retake on the A site. MIBR&#39;s continued aggression helped them take the bonus round, but G2 was able to stifle their pushes the next rounds. An <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/24149/amy">
		amy	</a>
</span> spawn crunch preceded MIBR&#39;s first tactical pause of the map, but the Brazilian team&#39;s low funds and a triple kill from Petra continued extending G2&#39;s lead. It took heavy aggression from MIBR for them to return get back on board, led by <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/31574/srn">
		srN	</a>
</span>&#39;s Raze to an additional three round wins for an 8-4 half. </p>

<p>Despite losing the pistol round, MIBR was able to secure their eco round with a Classic deathball stack. They continued scoring rounds, thanks in part to individual heroics, but G2 remained in the lead throughout the half. In the end, Gozen was able to identify their opponent&#39;s weak A setup, and they were able to exploit MIBR&#39;s alternating retake and early ramp hold to seal their map 13-8 </p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/417795/g2-gozen-vs-mibr-gc-game-changers-2024-championship-berlin-ubsf/?game=192924&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Sunset</a> extended G2&#39;s lead in pistol wins, but the anti-eco was once again countered by an MIBR set play. Both teams won one round each, but early mid holds from Petra led to a timeout for their opponents. Her heroics continued, however, as she won a 1v2 clutch to further extend the score gap. Seemingly inspired by her teammate, Vania stepped up to bat, setting a retake up for success with a triple kill and winning the next in a clutch of her own. The duo closed out the last round of the half with 2 kills each on a B hold, sending the decider into halftime with a 10-2 score.</p>

</span> extends G2&#39;s lead with a 1v3</em></p>

<p>MIBR was able to win the second pistol of the decider map, taking the anti-eco with a Mel 3K, but G2 was set on ending the series in their favor. A methodical push gave the former champions their 11th round, and <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/17323/mimi">
		mimi	</a>
</span> took her team to match point with a 1v2 win. MIBR&#39;s second timeout came and went, as <span data-ref-id="14">

		rezq	</a>
</span>&#39;s Neon disrespected MIBR&#39;s B setup with the help of her team&#39;s utility, ending the map 13-4 and closing out the series 2-1.</p>

<p>“We just continued playing our own game, the way we practiced,” Vania said after the series. “When [Petra] won that was the most exciting clutch,” she added. </p>

<p>The victory marks G2 Gozen&#39;s return to a Game Changers Championship upper final, the first and only team to make the event&#39;s podium via the upper bracket three different times. They will next play against the winner of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/417796/shopify-rebellion-vs-xipto-esports-game-changers-2024-championship-berlin-ubsf" target="_blank">Shopify Rebellion vs Xipto Esports</a> for a place in the grand final. MIBR GC will need to win two more series if they wish to continue Brazil&#39;s streak of top three finishes, first established by Team Liquid Brazil in 2022 and upheld in 2023 with Liquid&#39;s grand final appearance. </p>
