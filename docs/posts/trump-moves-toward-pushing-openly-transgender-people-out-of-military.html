Monday moved toward pushing openly transgender people out of the military, directed the Pentagon to end diversity programs and ordered the reinstatement of many service members dismissed for refusing the coronavirus vaccine as he sought to reshape America’s armed forces.</p><p>The directives, contained in a batch of executive orders, advanced what Mr. Trump and his new defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have described as an effort to return the military to an unapologetically masculine professional culture, while rejecting the sorts of equitable hiring and staffing practices that Mr. Hegseth has blamed for lowering the military’s standards and warfighting capacity.</p><p>In some respects, the orders on Monday mirrored others Mr. Trump signed last week aimed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/trump-federal-workers.html" title="">eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion</a> programs across the federal government and limiting government recognition of an individual’s gender to their sex at birth.</p><p>But the new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/prioritizing-military-excellence-and-readiness-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guidance related to gender</a> went much further by authorizing the Defense Department to potentially bar transgender soldiers by considering identifying as a gender other than the one assigned at birth an impediment to the physical and mental well-being necessary for military service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Consistent with the military mission and longstanding DoD policy, expressing a false ‘gender identity’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service,” the order said. “Beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life.”</p><p>“A man’s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member,” the order added.</p><p>While the order did not immediately exclude anyone from military service, it gave the Pentagon 60 days to update its policy on medical standards and 30 days to come forward with revised guidance on how to implement the vision in the order.</p><p>In separate orders, Mr. Trump also directed the Pentagon to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-americas-fighting-force/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reverse course on diversity, equity and inclusion</a> policies, and to offer many of the 8,000 service members <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reinstating-service-members-discharged-under-the-militarys-covid-19-vaccination-mandate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discharged from the military over vaccine mandates</a> back pay.</p><p>The three actions from the president came as Mr. Hegseth, following his confirmation on Saturday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/hegseth-defense.html" title="">pledged to preside over more profound changes</a>, including reorienting the military into an expanded role enforcing Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and deportation campaigns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Whatever is needed at the border will be provided,” Mr. Hegseth told reporters after arriving at the Pentagon on Monday for his first full day on the job. “This is a shift. It’s not the way business has been done in the past.”</p><p>Mr. Trump also signed a fourth order on Monday that set in motion plans to develop a next-generation missile defense system that the order likened to Israel’s iron dome — the air defense capabilities that intercept rockets and missiles frequently fired into Israel’s airspace.</p><p>In public remarks on Monday, both Mr. Trump and Mr. Hegseth hailed the new system as a significant expansion of the United States’ defense capabilities, which would likely be among the most sophisticated in the world given the geographic area it would cover.</p><p>According to the order, titled “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/prioritizing-military-excellence-and-readiness/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Iron Dome for America</a>,” the new system was conceived of as finalizing a vision first pursued by former President Ronald Reagan, whose Strategic Defense Initiative missile defense system, <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/march-23-1983-reagan-proposes-star-wars-missile-defense-system/" title="">nicknamed “Star Wars,”</a> involved overambitious objectives and was never completed.</p><p>The proposed system would be designed to guard against a variety of ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles, which have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/world/europe/hypersonic-missiles-russia-ukraine.html" title="">successfully deployed by adversaries</a> such as Russia, and which the White House described as “the most catastrophic threat facing the United States.”</p><p>The order granted the Pentagon 60 days to submit details for the plan, which included accelerating development of U.S. hypersonic missiles and “space-based interceptors.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-department-of-defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Upending the Federal Bureaucracy:</strong> President Trump’s rapid push to overhaul government agencies in his first days in office has been met with a mix of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/trump-federal-workers.html">fear, fury and confusion throughout the work force</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Icy Exchange Over Greenland:</strong> Trump told Denmark’s leader he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/europe/trump-greenland-denmark.html">wanted to take over Greenland</a>, European officials say.
