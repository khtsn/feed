In Canada, the incumbent Liberal Party has a chance to win an election long thought out of reach. In Germany, the incoming center-right chancellor is dominating the agenda after an election many feared would be a breakthrough for the hard right.</p><p>As President Trump’s “shock and awe” policies radiate around the world, they are reshaping global politics in unforeseen ways.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs and threats to the trans-Atlantic alliance have breathed life into centrist leaders, who are regaining popularity for their willingness to stand up to the American president. His clash with Ukraine and tilt toward Russia have thrown right-wing populists from Britain to Germany off balance, blunting, for the moment, their efforts to capitalize on Mr. Trump’s restoration to the White House.</p><p>“One of the great ironies of Trump is that he turns out to be the great unifier of Europe,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller, an expert in trans-Atlantic relations at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “It is impossible to overstate how shocked Europeans are by what’s happening.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The “Trump bump” goes beyond Europe. In Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum has won praise, and stratospheric poll numbers, for her coolheaded handling of Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/americas/trump-mexico-tariffs-sheinbaum.html" title="">tariffs</a>. Mark Carney, a former central banker, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/canada/mark-carney-trump.html" title="">catapulted to the leadership</a> of Canada’s Liberal Party with 86 percent of the vote on the belief that he can manage a trade war with the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico has gained popularity over her handling of Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Luis Antonio Rojas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Carney’s party, which lagged the Conservatives by double digits under the premiership of Justin Trudeau, has recently closed the gap, putting the Liberals within striking distance of a victory in an election that Mr. Carney is expected to call soon. The Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, has struggled to regain momentum, and Liberals have been quick to paint him as a Canadian Trump.</p><p>In Europe, which has appeared vulnerable to the same populist tide that swept Mr. Trump back into power, the president’s policies have steadied mainstream leaders who were struggling with stagnant economies and restless electorates. Facing down American tariffs and drawing together to confront an ally that is behaving more like an adversary has proved to be good politics.</p><p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/europe/starmer-zelensky-meeting-europe-ukraine-trump.html" title="">whirlwind of diplomacy</a> — trying to marshal a European peacekeeping force for Ukraine while also working to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/world/europe/trump-starmer-king-charles.html" title="">salvage the alliance</a> with Washington — has won praise across the political spectrum in Britain. Mr. Starmer’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/08/keir-starmers-poll-ratings-leap-after-trump-withdraws-support-for-ukraine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poll numbers</a> have bounced back from what was a dismal first six months in government, though he is still underwater in net approval ratings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“He desperately needed something, and this appears to be it,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. “It’s not nothing if a prime minister performs well on the world stage.”</p><p>Equally significant, Nigel Farage, the populist leader of the insurgent, anti-immigration party Reform U.K, has stumbled for the first time since he won election to the British Parliament last July.</p><p>Mr. Farage, a longtime Trump ally, has struggled to fend off accusations that he sympathizes with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. He criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for not wearing a suit to his meeting with Mr. Trump at the White House, even amid signs that the British public overwhelmingly sided with Mr. Zelensky in his clash with the American president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nigel Farage, a British right-wing populist, addressing a conference of conservatives in the United States last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Farage’s party was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/europe/nigel-farage-rupert-lowe-police.html" title="">thrown into turmoil</a> last Friday after it reported one its own lawmakers, Rupert Lowe, to the police for threatening a senior colleague — an allegation that Mr. Lowe denies.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Farage, analysts said, might feel threatened because Elon Musk, the billionaire who is Mr. Trump’s close ally, praised Mr. Lowe in January while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/world/europe/musk-farage-starmer-uk.html" title="">withdrawing his endorsement</a> of Mr. Farage, saying he “does not have what it takes.” Mr. Lowe complained in a recent newspaper interview that under Mr. Farage’s leadership, Reform has become a “protest party led by the Messiah.”</p><p>“To some extent, Farage has made himself quite vulnerable,” Professor Bale said.</p><p>In Parliament last week, Mr. Starmer won raucous whoops and cheers from Labour and Conservative backbenchers alike when he scolded Mr. Farage for his history of friendly statements about Mr. Putin and reaffirmed Britain’s steadfast support for Ukraine.</p><p>“Zelensky is a war leader whose country has been invaded,” Mr. Starmer said, as a chastened-looking Mr. Farage nodded in agreement. “We should all be supporting him and not fawning over Putin.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Starmer during a visit to the White House last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Tying Mr. Farage to Mr. Putin, analysts said, is more effective than going after him as an enemy of the political system, since like other populist politicians, he thrives on being vilified by the establishment.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The strategy that has not worked is to point at the populists and say they are the enemy,” said Ben Ansell, a professor of comparative democratic institutions at the University of Oxford. “What works much better is to point at an external enemy and try to lash them to that enemy.”</p><p>Mr. Farage’s alliance with Mr. Trump is also becoming a burden, Professor Ansell said, not just because the president is unpopular in Britain but also because his chaotic approach to governing deprives his allies abroad of conspicuous successes — on immigration, say, or economic policy — to which they can point.</p><p>Despite hard-right election gains<span>  </span>in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Austria, Professor Ansell said, there is a chance that Europe may have passed its moment of “<a href="https://benansell.substack.com/p/twilight-of-the-populists" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">peak populism</a>.” In Austria, the far-right Freedom Party was locked out of government despite winning the most votes, after three mainstream parties stitched together an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/europe/austria-government.html" title="">alternative coalition</a>.</p><p>In Germany, the hard-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, emerged as second-largest party in elections last month, trailing only the Christian Democrats, which are led by Friedrich Merz, the presumptive chancellor. But some analysts had expected the party to perform even better than it did, given that Mr. Musk and Vice President JD Vance endorsed it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany’s Christian Democrats.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ralf Hirschberger/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“It’s still bad enough that 20 percent of the people voted for an anti-system, pro-Russia party,” said Ms. Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution, “but it’s clear the AfD didn’t gain from Musk’s and Vance’s efforts to campaign on its behalf.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Nor has the AfD been a central player since the election, as Mr. Merz tries to engineer a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/europe/germany-military-merz-trump.html" title="">landmark relaxation</a> of Germany’s debt laws to enable it to fund a mammoth increase in military spending. Mr. Merz has staked a claim to leadership with his call for Europe to take charge of its own security because of the threat posed by Russia and the unreliability of the United States.</p><p>To be sure, Mr. Merz is scrambling to act now because he would have more trouble getting such an increase through the next Parliament, in which the AfD, which opposes the spending, would have enough votes to block it.</p><p>It is not clear that Mr. Merz has the votes to pass the measures, which will also need significant support from the Green Party to clear a two-thirds hurdle in Parliament. Privately, Mr. Merz’s aides contend that Mr. Trump has given the would-be chancellor the only argument he needs to prevail. He is the first American president to so explicitly threaten to pull American support.</p><p>In Britain as in Germany, analysts said the political landscape could shift again. Mr. Starmer’s pledge to increase military spending, they said, will force the Labour Party into painful trade-offs on taxes and spending that are already exposing rifts within the party. And Mr. Starmer’s recent success on the world stage could prove fleeting if he cannot turn around the economy and rebuild public services.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In that sense, Mr. Starmer’s up-and-down government has something in common with Mr. Trump’s, even if the president’s chaotic debut has so far played to the advantage of the prime minister and other centrists.</p><p>“The shine, such as it was, of Trump’s first few weeks has emphatically worn off, and in both foreign policy and economic outcomes, the picture has turned very dark,” Professor Ansell said.</p><p>Jim Tankersley<!-- --> contributed reporting from Berlin</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
