Putin of Russia to unleash one of the largest offensives in Russia’s war against Ukraine, and said he was considering imposing more sanctions on Russia in response.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in New Jersey before boarding Air Force One, Mr. Trump said he was “not happy” with Mr. Putin escalating his attacks, especially as the two countries negotiate a cease-fire deal to bring the three-year war to an end.</p><p>“He’s killing a lot of people, and I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin,” Mr. Trump said. “I’ve known him a long time. Always gotten along with him. But he’s sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don’t like it at all.”</p><p>He added, “We’re in the middle of talking, and he’s shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities.”</p><p>The remarks came after Russia carried out one of its largest drone and missile barrages of the war on Ukraine overnight, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens across the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Asked whether he was considering levying additional sanctions against Russia, which he has threatened several times, Mr. Trump responded: “Absolutely, he’s killing a lot of people.”</p><p>Mr. Trump, who has largely sided with Russia in the war, said he was “surprised” by the escalation, continuing to downplay the fact that it was Russia that initiated the war with an unprovoked invasion.</p><p>On Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1926540328242229428" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">condemned Russia’s attacks in a social media post</a>, and said they warranted punishment.</p><p>“Each such terrorist Russian strike is a sufficient reason for new sanctions against Russia,” Mr. Zelensky wrote. “Russia is dragging out this war and continues to kill every day.” He added, “The world may go on a weekend break, but the war continues, regardless of weekends and weekdays. This cannot be ignored. Silence of America, silence of others around the world only encourage Putin.”</p><p>Hours later, Mr. Trump turned his ire against Mr. Zelensky in a social media post, accusing him of “doing his country no favors by talking the way he does.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Everything out of his mouth causes problems, Mr. Trump said of Mr. Zelensky. “I don’t like it, and it better stop.”</p><p>Mr. Trump also reiterated the criticism of Mr. Putin, saying his Russian counterpart “has gone absolutely CRAZY” and was shooting missiles and drones into Ukraine’s cities, “for no reason whatsoever.”</p><p>”He is needlessly killing a lot of people, and I’m not just talking about soldiers,” Mr. Trump wrote.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who has largely focused on trade and other benefits to Russia if it ended its war against Ukraine, also wrote that Mr. Putin’s continued incursion could have dire consequences.</p><p>“I’ve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that’s proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!” he wrote.</p><p>Mr. Trump also continued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia.html" title="">steps toward absolving himself of any responsibility for ending the war</a>, which he once said he could do in 24 hours, saying that it was ultimately Mr. Putin, Mr. Zelensky and former President Joe Biden who were responsible for it.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Erica L.
