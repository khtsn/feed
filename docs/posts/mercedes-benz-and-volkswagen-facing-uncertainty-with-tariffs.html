The company, which owns Audi, Porsche and the Volkswagen brand, cautioned that the initial calculations had been made before the tariffs were introduced in early April.</p><p>All three companies have factories in the United States. Mr. Trump on Tuesday announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-auto-tariffs-executive-order.html" title="">changes to the tariffs</a> in what he called “a little flexibility” toward automakers that produce cars in the United States and are concerned about the damage the import taxes will do to their business.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Under the latest version, carmakers that pay a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, like, for example, on steel and aluminum, or on certain imports from Canada and Mexico. However, the rules do not appear to protect automakers from tariffs on steel and aluminum that their suppliers pay and may pass on.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Volkswagen, which has a factory in the United States, scaled back its profit expectations to the lower end of its forecast, to between 5 and 6 percent. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The leading group representing German automakers welcomed the move by Mr. Trump, but called it “a small step” that only slightly eases the burden caused by the tariffs.</p><p>German carmakers operating in the United States have been caught off guard by the imposition of import taxes on parts and vehicles coming in from Canada and Mexico, where many set up operations after Mr. Trump reworked the free-trade agreement with those countries during his first term in office.</p><p>“Companies urgently need more clarity in order to be able to assess the exact impact and implement the measures with legal certainty,” said Hildegard Müller, the president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry.</p><p>Porsche has been among the German brands hardest hit by the tariffs. It relies on the U.S. market for 40 percent of its sales, but manufactures its sports cars exclusively in Germany, leaving it heavily exposed to the duties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The sports car maker’s dismal performance in the first three months of the year dragged down its parent company, Volkswagen Group, which said Wednesday that its earnings dropped more than 40 percent in the first quarter.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Volkswagen automobile factory, in Wolfsburg, Germany.

Audi produces cars in Europe and Mexico, as well as Europe, but not in the United States. Oliver Blume, Volkswagen’s chief executive, has said that the company is considering shifting manufacturing of another one of its models to Chattanooga to avoid tariffs.</p><p>German media has reported that Mr. Blume and his counterparts at Mercedes-Benz and BMW met with Mr. Trump in an effort to work out a deal. German automakers and their suppliers employ some 138,000 people in the United States, according to the German industry trade group.</p><p>The tariffs are causing other European carmakers to rethink their strategy in the United States. The British automaker Aston Martin said Wednesday that it was holding back on imports to the United States because of the tariffs. Instead, the company plans to use up existing inventory that has already been shipped, the company’s chief executive said in a statement. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/business/jaguar-land-rover-tariffs-shipments.html" title="">Jaguar Land Rover</a> has also said that it is pausing shipments to the United States.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Walking Back Some Auto Tariffs:</strong> President Trump signed a pair of executive orders that walked back some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors and others have complained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-auto-tariffs-executive-order.html">would backfire on U.S. manufacturing</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Key Tariff Loophole Closes:</strong> A loophole that has allowed American shoppers to buy lots of cheap goods from mainland China and Hong Kong without paying tariffs and filling customs forms is closing. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/trump-tariffs-shein-temu-de-minimis.html">Prices have already gone up</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Fearing Toy Shortages:</strong> Toy makers, children’s shops and specialty retailers are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/trump-tariffs-christmas-china.html">pausing orders for the winter holidays</a> as the import taxes cascade through supply chains.</p></li><li><p><strong>UPS Cuts Jobs:</strong> The mail service said that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/ups-layoffs-trump-tariffs.html">cut 20,000 jobs this year</a> as part of a long-term plan to reduce costs and bolster profit. The cuts come as tariffs are prompting some customers to ship fewer goods.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ports Bracing for Tariff Fallout:</strong> U.S. retailers and manufacturers, faced with sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods, are pausing and reducing shipments from China. The pullback is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/tariffs-china-ports-imports.html">expected to hit West Coast ports</a> within days.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chinese Factories Slow:</strong> An official report on manufacturing activity signaled that in April, Chinese factories experienced the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/business/china-pmi-factory-manufacturing.html">sharpest monthly slowdown</a> in more than a year.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Economy Shrinks:</strong> The chaotic start to President Trump’s second term roiled the economy at the beginning of the year, as consumers and businesses scrambled to react to a constant stream of tariff announcements and policy shifts.
