The targets included an oil storage base, as well as military production facilities, the General Staff said in a statement.</p><p>The drone strikes forced at least six cities to restrict their airspace on Tuesday morning, according to a statement from Russia’s Federal Aviation Agency. Those included the cities of Saratov and Engels, which were attacked overnight.</p><p>Two industrial plants sustained damage, Roman V. Busargin, the governor of the Saratov region, <a href="https://t.me/busargin_r/7891" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on the Telegram</a> messaging app. “Today Saratov and Engels were subjected to a massive UAV attack,” he said, using the initials for unmanned aerial vehicle. “Air defenses eliminated a large number of targets.”</p><p>It was the second time in a week that Engels, which is the site of an airfield for some of Russia’s long-range, nuclear-capable bombers, was attacked. Emergency crews recently extinguished a large fire sparked by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/world/europe/ukraine-russia-oil-depot.html" title="">a strike on Jan. 8</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Busargin <a href="https://t.me/busargin_r/7890" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that, in the wake of the attacks, schools would be closed and classes in Engels and Saratov would be held remotely on Tuesday.</p><p>The authorities in the Tula region of western Russia similarly confirmed a large drone attack. Dmitry V. Milyaev, the regional governor, <a href="https://t.me/dmilyaev/2272" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> air defenses had shot down 16 drones and that falling debris had damaged some cars and buildings. There were no casualties, officials said.</p><p>Local news media in Kazan, the capital of the republic of Tatarstan, in southwestern Russia, <a href="https://t.me/eveningkzn/16891" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that a tanker at a liquefied natural gas base had been struck, igniting a large fire.</p><p>The head of the republic, Rustam N. Minnikhanov, <a href="https://t.me/rustamminnikhanov/2464" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on Telegram</a> that firefighters had put out the blaze and that there had been no casualties or “significant damage.”</p><p>In the border region of Bryansk, which has come under more regular attack, powerful explosions were reported. The Russian independent news organization Astra said that a chemical plant had been struck; the report could not be independently verified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had <a href="https://t.me/mod_russia_en/18870" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shot down</a> 31 drones, six ATACMS and six Storm Shadow missiles targeting Bryansk.</p><p>From the start, Kyiv’s strikes in Russia have aimed at limiting Moscow’s ability to attack Ukrainian cities. But in recent weeks, they have taken on added weight as Kyiv has apparently attempted to project strength before President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inauguration next week, amid concerns he might temper U.S. support for Ukraine.</p><p>European leaders have assured Ukraine that they will not abandon it in the face of continued Russian aggression.</p><p>On Tuesday, Germany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, made an unannounced visit to Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky in a show of solidarity.</p><p>“It is important for me to show with this trip that we continue to actively support Ukraine,” Mr. Pistorius said upon arriving in the Ukrainian capital, according to German news media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky said the two men had discussed a range of topics, including military assistance to Ukraine, strengthening air defenses and ammunition supplies.</p><p>“I am grateful to Germany for its unwavering support, which has not only strengthened Ukraine’s defense, but also played a crucial role in enhancing Europe’s security as a whole,” Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1879216795535516118" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump has vowed to end the war swiftly. While he has not said how, many in Ukraine fear that he could make concessions to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that have been red lines for Kyiv.</p><p>Ahead of Mr. Trump’s inauguration on Monday, the Russian military has also been putting on a show of force. While Kyiv’s drones were targeting regions of Russia overnight, Moscow’s forces were carrying out an aerial assault on Ukraine that put much of the country under air-raid alerts.</p><p>Ukraine’s Air Force <a href="https://t.me/kpszsu/26788" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Tuesday morning that nearly 80 drones were involved in the attack but that it had managed to shoot down 60. Apartment buildings and cars sustained damage from downed drones in several regions, it added, but there were no casualties.</p><p>Nataliia Novosolova<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nataliya Vasilyeva<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
