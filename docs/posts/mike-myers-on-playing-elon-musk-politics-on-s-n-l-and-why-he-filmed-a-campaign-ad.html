But when he stood onstage for the closing credits of the show, he said, “I got angrier and angrier.”</p><p>He thought about Mr. Musk’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/canada-musk-petition-revoke-citizenship-00205964" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remark</a> that Canada is “not a real country,” and about how President Trump had called the former Canadian prime minister <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-1XWfMLhJU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Governor Trudeau”</a> and rudely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/canada-trump-statehood-attacks.html" title="">referred to Canada</a> as “the 51st state.” He thought about tariffs, and about graffiti he’d seen in Winnipeg: “There’s no greater pain than being betrayed by a friend.”</p><p>And he thought about the legendary Canadian hockey player <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/sports/hockey/gordie-howe-dies-detroit-red-wings.html" title="">Gordie Howe</a> and his famous “elbows up” response to aggression on the ice.</p><p>And so Mr. Myers, the 61-year-old star of the “Wayne’s World,” “Austin Powers” and “Shrek” films and a beloved figure on both sides of the Canadian-American border, boldly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amUPuVHaUO0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opened his down vest</a> and flashed his “Canada Is Not for Sale” T-shirt on live television. “Elbows up,” he mouthed into the camera, twice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“What happened came from my ankles and from my brain and from my heart, and it was not about me — it was about my country,” he said. “I wanted to send a message home to say that I’m with you, you know.”</p><p>As public acts of defiance on “S.N.L.” go, the unveiling of Mr. Myers’s T-shirt was less shocking than, say, the Irish singer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/arts/music/sinead-oconnor-snl-pope.html" title="">Sinead’s O’Connor’s dramatic destruction</a> of a photo of Pope John Paul II in 1992. But for the mild-mannered Mr. Myers, an expatriate who said that “no one is more Canadian than a person who no longer lives in Canada,” it was the moment the gloves came off.</p><p>“What’s happened has really hurt our feelings,” he said in a recent telephone interview that began when, in what felt like a classically Canadian move, he apologized for having hay fever and perhaps sounding a bit snuffly. “We love America. We love you guys. We don’t understand what this madness is.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Myers appeared as Elon Musk, seen here in the Oval Office, on “S.N.L.” in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NBC</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Myers moved to the United States in 1988 because “America is the entertainment capital of the world” and it was where his career took off, he said. Though he divides his time between New York and Vermont, he said he travels back home to Toronto often. He has an American wife, three American children and an American passport (alongside his Canadian one).</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I am also an American citizen, and I took my oath very seriously,” he said. “That’s what’s so crazy. Americans are the last people you would think would ever be a threat to us.”</p><p>In Canada, Mr. Myers has two streets named after him, appears on a postage stamp and in 2017 was named an <a href="https://www.gg.ca/en/honours/recipients/146-16540" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">officer of the Order of Canada</a> for his work in comedy. He published <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/548777/canada-by-mike-myers/9780385689250" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Canada,</a>” a memoir-cum-Valentine to his native country, in 2016.</p><p>Emboldened by how his “elbows up” defiance on “S.N.L.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amUPuVHaUO0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">caught on up north</a>, Mr. Myers plotted an escalation of his political involvement.</p><p>“I consulted with my brothers, who are both, obviously, Canadian, as well as being very savvy politically and smart and funny,” he said. The result was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al9yWA4TUII" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">television ad</a> for the Liberal Party, featuring Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mr. Myers — wearing a “Never 51” jersey — chatting beside a hockey rink. Though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/canada/liberals-carney-trump-tariffs-election.html" title="">the race has been tightening</a>, the Liberals have been buoyed by a surge of anger at Mr. Trump’s bellicose behavior, and pollsters say they are favored to defeat the Conservatives in Monday’s federal elections.</p><p>Inspired by “those World War II movies where they ask the fake Americans who won the World Series” as a way to unmask them, Mr. Myers said, he wanted the ad to be a reaffirmation of his own Canadianness as well as an endorsement of Mr. Carney.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“I wanted it to be like, ‘I know I don’t live there anymore, and let’s talk about that,’” he said. “I thought it would be funny if the prime minister of Canada ran an identity test on me.” (The part in which Mr. Myers correctly identifies Toronto’s “two seasons” as “winter and construction” was contributed by Mr. Myers’s best friend since childhood, David Mackenzie, he said.)</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I think he’s very reasonable,” Mr. Myers said of Prime Minister Mark Carney.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rich Lam/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The ad shows that Mr. Carney, in addition to being a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/business/mark-carney-bank-of-england-brexit.html" title="">former governor of the Bank of England</a>, has fine comic timing. “I think he’s very reasonable,” Mr. Myers said of Mr. Carney. “He’s taken a calm, resolute, articulate stance in defense of our sovereignty.”</p><p>Mr. Myers was an “S.N.L.” cast member from 1989 to 1995. He’s now appeared three times this season as Mr. Musk, who is originally from South Africa but who was raised in Canada. (At one point, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8E3arXq75Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Myers had Mr. Musk make a classic Dr. Evil pinkie gesture</a>.)</p><p>“To the extent that Elon Musk is involved in our democratic government, it goes against how I feel as a Canadian,” he said of Mr. Musk’s slash-and-burn approach. “We don’t have a distrust of the government. We have a belief in good government.”</p><p>And comedy is one way Mr. Myers can make that point, he believes.</p><p>“Fascism doesn’t like to be ridiculed; it likes to be feared,” he said. “Satire is an important tool in the toolbox to say that this is not normal — that the cuts he’s making are not normal.”</p><p>Mr. Myers said he had no ill will toward another prominent Canadian expatriate, the hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky, whose embrace of Mr. Trump’s MAGA movement has caused some Canadians to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/27/wayne-gretzky-canadian-pro-trump-rebrand" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">turn against him</a>. Mr. Gretzky remains “a great Canadian,” Mr. Myers said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He mentioned the game Red Rover, which he played as a boy in Toronto, as a vehicle for inviting Mr. Gretzky to join his side.</p><p>“Red Rover, Red Rover, we call Wayne over,” he said. “I hope he does. We would accept him with open arms.”</p><p>In his book, Mr. Myers writes that his native country has often struggled to define its purpose, its residents asking not “Who are we?” but rather “Why are we?”</p><p>It has an answer now, he said.</p><p>“As the great Canadian poet Joni Mitchell said, ‘You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone,’” he said. “The possibility of it all being gone has raised our consciousness of how great we are.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-13"></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>April 26, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated how many children Mike Myers has.
