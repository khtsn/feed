It has been on Amazon’s best-seller list for over a week, even before its release, and stood at No. 3 on Thursday. The book has also amplified debate about whether more blame should be placed on Democratic leaders, Mr. Biden’s staff and the press for not revealing more about the former president earlier.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/TAPPER-2-cvkh/TAPPER-2-cvkh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/TAPPER-2-cvkh/TAPPER-2-cvkh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/TAPPER-2-cvkh/TAPPER-2-cvkh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A stack of copies of the book “Original Sin.” " src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/TAPPER-2-cvkh/TAPPER-2-cvkh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/TAPPER-2-cvkh/TAPPER-2-cvkh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/TAPPER-2-cvkh/TAPPER-2-cvkh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/TAPPER-2-cvkh/TAPPER-2-cvkh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b63892ac-d0dc-5da1-b29c-4eb19b2e533d" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,” by Mr. Tapper and Alex Thompson.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It’s hard to think of a book which has shifted the political dial to this extent in recent years,” Politico Playbook wrote on Tuesday.</p><p>But the book has also invited scrutiny of the authors themselves — and Mr. Tapper in particular. Representatives for Mr. Tapper declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Intentionally or not, by being an author of a major book on the subject, Mr. Tapper has allowed himself to become a symbol of the establishment press that conservatives have long accused of hiding the former president’s frailty from the public.</p><p>Ms. Kelly, the former Fox News star, subjected Mr. Tapper to intense grilling on her popular podcast in an interview that went <a href="https://x.com/CurtisHouck/status/1924865029079195800" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">viral online</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“You covered the Biden presidency aggressively throughout the four years, and you didn’t cover mental acuity, hardly at all,” Ms. Kelly said at one point. “I mean, time and time again when issues came up, you seem to be running cover for the president.”</p><p>Mr. Tapper denied the charges. “Conservative media absolutely has every right to say, ‘We were hip to this, and the legacy media was not,’” he said later in the interview. “Now, I do not accept that I was part of a cover-up. I do not accept that I was just providing cover for Joe Biden.”</p><p>Mr. Stewart, the liberal comedian who hosts “The Daily Show” on Monday nights, dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFeUo-nOxQU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">much of his opening monologue</a> this week to the book. He showed eight different times that Mr. Tapper hawked his book on CNN’s airwaves. “Comes out Tuesday,” Mr. Tapper said in one clip. “You will not believe what we found out.”</p><p>“Breaking news!” Mr. Stewart exclaimed before pausing for comedic effect, then added: “In a week.”</p><p>“The Daily Show” then showed several clips of Mr. Tapper’s CNN colleagues also repeatedly bringing up the book, with some arguing that the revelation of Mr. Biden’s cancer diagnosis on Sunday may have made the book even more timely. Mr. Stewart vigorously disagreed with that assessment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The book scrutinizes former President Joseph R.

Is this a Girl Scouts situation? ‘Whoever sells the most Tapper books gets a Schwinn!’”</p><p>Even Hunter Biden, the former president’s son, got in the mix. He went <a href="https://www.breakermedia.com/p/hunter-biden-breaks-his-silence-on-tapper" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the record</a> this week with Breaker Media, a media newsletter, to say he had been “furious” with Mr. Tapper over past reporting. (Mr. Tapper has said Hunter Biden’s claims about his reporting are not true.)</p><p>At every turn, Mr. Tapper seems eager to turn the attention back to the reporting in the book. And its contents have prompted much self-examination within the Democratic Party.</p><p>“I can’t get into the details, it’s still embargoed, but it is enraging,” the “Pod Save America” co-host Tommy Vietor said <a href="https://x.com/alexthomp/status/1913377182141022553?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a month</a> before the book came out. The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times, among others, praised the book for what it revealed.</p><p>Mika Brzezinski, co-host of the beltway favorite “Morning Joe” and Mr. Tapper’s competitor at MSNBC, also complimented the book for its “beautiful” writing, as well as its “great reporting.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I really loved reading the book,” she said.</p><p>“Trust me, there has to be a ‘but’ coming here,” replied her co-host, Joe Scarborough, to a chorus of laughter in the studio.</p><p>Then Ms. Brzezinski turned to Mr. Tapper and Mr. Thompson, and brought up a subject — the book’s use of “cover up” — that has been criticized elsewhere.</p><p>“I want to understand why you’re using words like ‘cover up,’ which insinuates a crime or something,” she said skeptically.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Koblin covers the television industry for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
