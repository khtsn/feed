    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shane-goldmacher"><img alt="Shane Goldmacher" title="Shane Goldmacher" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/27/multimedia/author-shane-goldmacher/author-shane-goldmacher-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p></div></div></div><p>It’s hard for the party that holds the White House to run as the party of change. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/kamala-harris-democrats-dnc.html" title="">Kamala Harris and the Democrats are trying</a>.</p><p>Running on change is often smart politics. Voters are perennially unhappy with the country’s trajectory, and the pandemic made it worse. According to Gallup, it has been <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two decades</a> since a majority of Americans said they were satisfied with the direction of the nation. No wonder politicians cater to them with promises of new beginnings.</p><p>When Donald Trump was still facing President Biden — just a month ago — the former president could make a clearer case. Trump was out of power. He was the insurgent running against an incumbent. He promised to alter the country’s course.</p><p>Now Harris has jostled that dynamic after her party’s midsummer candidate switch. At its convention in Chicago this week, the Democratic Party has embraced the 59-year-old as the face of a new generation in a presidential contest that had previously featured two men seeking to set the record as the oldest person ever to serve. Inside the convention hall, chants of “We’re not going back” have rung out. And a fresh campaign slogan, “A New Way Forward,” is on banners and in speeches.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In today’s newsletter, I’ll look at that battle over who best represents change.</p><h2 id="link-41268ab2">What polling shows</h2><p>Embodying change has mattered for many years. Long before Barack Obama promised “change you can believe in,” Bill Clinton pitched “change versus more of the same.” Trump, of course, captured the change vote in 2016 when he promised a clean break from the Obama years.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kamala Harris on the first day of the Democratic National Convention.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>If anything, the desire for change has grown in the past decade. When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">a New York Times/Siena College poll</a> asked voters in May what they thought the country’s political and economic system required, the results were overwhelming: 69 percent said either major changes were needed or the system needed to be torn down entirely.</p><p>Only 24 percent of voters thought Biden would do either of those things. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/17/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">recent polls</a> in swing states suggest people view Harris differently. While far more voters still see Trump as more likely than Harris to make major changes — 80 percent to 46 percent — they are more divided on whether he would bring the kind of change that they want.</p><p>In fact, an identical share of voters (50 percent vs. 50 percent) said Harris would bring about the right kind of change compared with Trump.</p></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-41cb5db2">The messaging wars</h2><p>The fight over who most represents change is playing out on television, where campaigns spend much of their money. Future Forward, the leading Harris super PAC, created 200 potential ads for her, its leader, Chauncey McLean, said this week. The group tested all of those ads to determine which ones will be most effective.</p><p>So it is notable that several of the group’s ads already pitch Harris as a break with the past. “If you’ve had enough of this political era and you’re ready to turn the page,<em> </em>Kamala Harris is ready to lead us to the future,” concludes one recent spot. The <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/0ad6ff52-f510-404c-bcc6-5717b18d1a15/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ad on which the most money has been spent so far</a>, according to AdImpact, is another one from Future Forward. It ends with a tagline on the screen: “Let the future begin.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Raleigh, N.C.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“The Republicans were hoping that they were going to be able to paint her as more of the same,” explained McLean. But he said their surveys had shown that voters were open to Harris defining herself separately from Biden.</p><p>Chris LaCivita, one of Trump’s campaign managers, told me he didn’t think that Harris could seize the mantle of change from Trump. “They have no choice than to change the subject,” he said. “But changing the subject does not make you the agent of change.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Trump’s ads have yoked Harris to the least popular parts of the Biden-Harris administration. <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/4424b569-a826-4bba-ad04-d86c79b59e3a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One recent spot</a> features Harris saying the word “Bidenomics” three times in 30 seconds. <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/4796bbba-0623-4ff6-aa02-63b5e6ef0778" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Another</a>, from a Trump super PAC, talks about inflation and the “border invasion,” with a video of Biden and Harris hoisting their arms in the air together. “Kamala owns this failed record,” the narrator says.</p><p>The fight for change is just beginning. Harris allies say she has one obvious advantage that can’t be ignored: She <em>looks</em> like change. She’d be the first woman and the first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Trump, of course, has brought a constant level of upheaval since his arrival on the political scene in 2015.</p><p>The question, after nine years, is whether keeping Democrats in power can itself represent a break from that.</p><h2 id="link-6bc7d7ff">More on the convention</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Barack and Michelle Obama. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><ul><li><p>In back-to-back speeches, Michelle and Barack Obama reminded Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/obamas-convention.html" title="">of a past era of hope and change</a>, Peter Baker writes. “America, hope is making a comeback,” Michelle said.</p></li><li><p>Their speeches cast Harris’s background as an embodiment of the American story, and Trump as its opposite.</p></li><li><p>Michelle turned one of Trump’s statements against him, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/michelle-obama-dnc-speech.html?smid=url-share" title="">asking the crowd</a>, “Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those ‘Black jobs’?”</p></li><li><p>Barack urged Democrats not to get complacent. “For all the incredible energy we’ve been able to generate over the last few weeks — for all the rallies and the memes — this will still be a tight race in a closely divided country.”</p></li><li><p>Taunting Trump, Harris and Tim Walz drew a crowd of about 15,000 for a rally last night in the Milwaukee arena that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/harris-rally-milwaukee-dnc.html" title="">hosted the Republican convention</a> last month.</p></li><li><p>Delegates formally nominated Harris and Walz in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/lil-jon-dnc-harris.html" title="">high-energy, D.J.-led roll call</a> that included Lil Jon, Spike Lee and Eva Longoria.
