More than 150,000 people voted, according to the party’s leaders.</p><p>“America is not Canada. And Canada never, ever will be part of America in any way, shape or form,” Mr. Carney said in his acceptance speech on Sunday evening to an electric crowd of party faithful, directly addressing Mr. Trump’s constant threat that he wants to make Canada the 51st state. “We didn’t ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“So Americans should make no mistake,’’ Mr. Carney added. “In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.” </p><p>He is expected to be sworn in as prime minister quickly, early this week, officially ending the Trudeau era. His first and most pressing challenge will be to manage the threat from Mr. Trump to Canada’s economy and sovereignty.</p><p>But, because Mr. Carney does not hold a seat in Parliament, he is expected to call federal elections soon after being sworn in as prime minister. In those elections, he will face off with Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/multimedia/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/multimedia/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/multimedia/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A view on a street toward a building with a clock tower." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/multimedia/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/multimedia/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/multimedia/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/multimedia/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw/09canada-election-takeaways-carneyHFO-02-khfw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/c8e4abbc-1df0-5464-b55f-e7aedf0cbdb1" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Parliament Hill in Ottawa, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s tenure is ending.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cole Burston for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>It’s a crucial moment to be taking the wheel in Canada, a member of NATO and the Group of 7 industrialized nations and the world’s second-largest country by land mass.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump has put his thumb on Canadian politics, through his on-again-off-again pursuit of tariffs against Canadian goods, which threaten to cripple the economy, and his menacing comments about annexation.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau summarized the mood within his own party, and much of Canadian society, speaking at the Liberal Party convention to an adoring crowd in Ottawa just before his successor was announced.</p><p>“This is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given,” Mr. Trudeau said. “Even Canada is not a given.”</p><p>Mr. Carney said he supported the retaliatory tariffs Canada has adopted. “My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect,” he said.</p><p>Canadian voters have suggested to opinion researchers that who might best stand up to Mr. Trump has been a key question guiding the choice of Mr. Carney and future decisions in the federal election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Federal elections must be held by October in line with Canada’s rules. The Conservative Party, led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/world/canada/pierre-poilievre-conservative-leader-canada.html" title="">Mr. Poilievre</a>, had long maintained a 20-plus point lead over the Liberals in polls, but the gap has been closing since Mr. Trudeau announced his resignation and Mr. Trump started making moves against Canada.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/poilievre-and-carney-lead-dealing-trump-yet-doubts-persist" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest</a> <a href="https://leger360.com/fed-pol-feb-10/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polling</a> suggests that most respondents would choose Mr. Carney over Mr. Poilievre if he led the Liberal Party into the elections. Polling also shows that Canadians would prefer Mr. Carney to negotiate with Mr. Trump over Mr. Poilievre. Mr. Poilievre has suffered a serious setback in polls, as some voters see him as too close ideologically to Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Placards at the Liberals’ gathering in Ottawa on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cole Burston for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>And on Sunday night, Mr. Carney quickly pivoted to federal election campaign rhetoric to attack Mr. Poilievre, casting him as devoid of real-world experience and too admiring of Mr. Trump to challenge him.</p><p>“Donald Trump thinks he can weaken us with his plan to divide and conquer. Pierre Poilievre’s plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,” he said. “Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Carney’s experience in handling major crises as a technocrat could also be giving him an advantage over Mr. Poilievre in people’s perceptions. Mr. Poilievre, 45, has been a lifelong politician without much experience outside Canada’s parliamentary rough and tumble.</p><p>The Liberal Party establishment rallied around Mr. Carney’s campaign against Ms. Freeland, a former top lieutenant of Mr. Trudeau’s, whose resignation in December triggered Mr. Trudeau’s own decision to step down.</p><p>And it has been clear that the Conservative Party also sees Mr. Carney as the bigger threat: It has been running negative ads against him, focusing on his personal wealth and investing decisions.</p><p>A key question will be whether Mr. Carney can sufficiently differentiate himself from Mr. Trudeau, whom he advised and was friendly with. Canadians want change after a decade of Mr. Trudeau, and the Conservative Party has been highlighting the personal and ideological links between the two men.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Apart from Mr. Trump, Canada faces a slew of problems for which many voters blame Mr. Trudeau, foremost being an affordability crisis, with housing and cost of living crushing for many Canadians.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wiped tears away as he spoke at the Liberals’ gathering.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cole Burston for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But broader, more existential problems about how Canada is run are pressing, too. One is how to use Canada’s vast natural resources, including oil, gas and coal, as well as the vital fertilizer ingredient potash, rare minerals and uranium needed for nuclear energy.</p><p>Mr. Carney, in the years after his monetary policymaking career, emerged as a global evangelist for green investment, and he will need to decide how to make use of Canada’s tremendous natural endowments.</p><p>Immigration has been another key issue for Canadians. The country has historically been open both to economic migrants and to refugees, but, after the pandemic, Mr. Trudeau oversaw a rapid growth of temporary migration into Canada to help fill a labor shortage.</p><p>That has set off a backlash, with migrants accused of further straining a dysfunctional housing market and health-care system.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In his acceptance speech, Mr. Carney also sought to brandish his Liberal credentials and convince people that, despite having made a fortune in finance, he is still a progressive, attuned to the party’s DNA.</p><p>“I know that markets don’t have values, people do,” he said. “When markets are governed well, they deliver great jobs and strong growth better than anything. But markets are also indifferent to human suffering and are blind to our greatest needs,” he added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Matina Stevis-Gridneff is the Canada bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the country.<span> </span></p></div></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>7</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Canada’s Liberal Party Chooses a Central Banker to Replace Trudeau<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
