<p>This year&#39;s Masters Bangkok champions were unable to overcome a rebuilt SEN City, as they fell in a nail-biting 12-14 overtime on Sunset.</p>

<p>What started off as a back-and-forth between the two teams in the first half saw Sentinels take a two round lead at halftime. Despite losing both pistols, T1 were able to pull off thrifties following each one to stay in the game.</p>

<p>By the second half, the Korean squad managed to string five rounds together while simultaneously burning <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/757/kaplan">
		kaplan	</a>
</span>&#39;s second timeout, but <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/8419/reduxx">
		Reduxx	</a>
</span>&#39;s consistent performance and pressure on Chamber allowed Sentinels to stay in the game.</p>

<p>Despite a 12-11 lead courtesy of a <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span> flank, Sentinels were able to dominantly secure a 24th round and kept the momentum up heading into overtime. Crispy shots from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/30470/kyu">
		Kyu	</a>
</span> were not needed as <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/36245/n4rrate">
		N4RRATE	</a>
</span> and Reduxx pathed the way for their team to close out the last two rounds, sending T1 to the lower bracket.</p>



<p>Reigning world champions NRG continued their dominant run into the OFF//SEASON by bullying Cubert into the lower bracket.</p>

<p>It seemed as if nothing could stop Paris&#39; victors from advancing onwards at Home Ground, not even Sentinels&#39; academy team. <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11225/ethan">
		Ethan	</a>
</span> once again pioneered his team to victory, putting up a 1.51 rating on Harbor accompanied by an ACS of 284.</p>

<p><span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4828/nismo">
		NiSMO	</a>
</span> was the only player on Cubert to end the game with a positive K/D as <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/41798/nightz">
		nightz	</a>
</span> was late to the game on Neon with a measly 0.48 rating.</p>

<p>NRG started strong with a 9-3 lead on attack before allowing Cubert a single round in the second half to close out the game 13-4.</p>



<p>In a rematch of 2023&#39;s Home Ground grand finals in Tokyo, Japan, FNATIC barely broke a sweat against their opponents as an early lead in the Bo1 all but secured their advancement to the semi finals.</p>

<p>The departure of <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/458/chronicle">
		Chronicle	</a>
</span> didn&#39;t stop FNATIC from retaining their identity of EMEA powerhouse. With Split on the table, <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span> was able to let loose and take the reins alongside <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9554/kaajak">
		kaajak	</a>
</span> as the two Duelists proved to be a thorn in C9&#39;s side all map long.</p>

<p>New pickup <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/12928/veqaj">
		Veqaj	</a>
</span> held his own against the rebuilt boys in blue, posting up a modest but reliable 1.06 rating on Viper with a 225 ACS.</p>

<p><span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/729/zellsis">
		Zellsis	</a>
</span> was unable to lead his new team to a victory, finishing the map with a 0.99 rating, the highest out of all C9 players.</p>



<p>The first of many upsets of the main event continued with the Japanese squad dispatching of G2 shortly after the three-time regional champions switched their starting roster.</p>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, ZETA – utilizing three stand-ins for the event – took down G2 in convincing fashion. With <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/34776/absol">
		Absol	</a>
</span> at the helm opening up rounds on Yoru, ZETA displayed clear dominance throughout the first half of Haven, finishing up at a boastful 8-4 scoreline.</p>

<p>G2 essentially seemed locked out of the game as <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/15500/trent">
		trent	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/7873/leaf">
		leaf	</a>
</span> were unable to perform well on Fade or Viper. The team managed to show signs of life in the second half, but unfortunately for them ZETA had already amassed enough rounds to close out Haven 13-7.</p>
