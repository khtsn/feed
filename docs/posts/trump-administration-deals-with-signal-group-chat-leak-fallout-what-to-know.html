administration is dealing with the fallout of an extraordinary leak of internal national security deliberations, disclosed in an encrypted group chat that mistakenly included a journalist from The Atlantic.</p><p>In the group message among cabinet officials and senior White House staff, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth disclosed war plans two hours before U.S. troops launched attacks against the Houthi militia in Yemen. Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg</a>, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the group chat on Signal, a commercial messaging app.</p><p>Here’s the latest.</p><h2 id="link-13c6a48e">What has the White House said?</h2><p>President Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that the leak was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one.”</p><p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, posted on social media that “no ‘war plans’ were discussed” and “no classified material was sent to the thread.” But Mr. Goldberg wrote that he had not published some of the messages in the thread because he said they contained sensitive information.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Goldberg’s report also raised concerns about administration officials using Signal, a nonsecure messaging platform, and setting the messages to automatically delete. Ms. Leavitt pushed back against those concerns.</p><p>“The White House Counsel’s Office has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump’s top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible,” she wrote.</p><p>After the Atlantic report, Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement on Monday that the message thread “appears to be authentic.” Mr. Hughes said officials were “reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”</p><h2 id="link-205756be">The administration has tried to discredit Jeffrey Goldberg.</h2><p>When Mr. Trump was first asked Monday about the report, he said he was not aware of the leak, but he immediately attacked the magazine.</p><p>“I’m not a big fan of The Atlantic,” he said. “To me, it’s a magazine that’s going out of business.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>For years, Mr. Trump has complained about Mr. Goldberg and his publication because of an article the journalist <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published in 2020</a> that said that Mr. Trump had declined to visit a cemetery of fallen American soldiers in France because it was “filled with losers.”</p><p>Mr. Hegseth similarly criticized Mr. Goldberg on Monday, calling him a “deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist” after landing in Hawaii, his first stop on a weeklong trip to Asia.</p><p>“Nobody was texting war plans, and that’s all I have to say about that,” Mr. Hegseth said.</p><p>Mr. Goldberg said “that’s a lie” on CNN in response to Mr. Hegseth’s comments.</p><h2 id="link-270b2cf9">Will Mr. Waltz face consequences?</h2><p>Mr. Trump said Tuesday that Mr. Waltz would not face consequences after Mr. Goldberg wrote that the national security adviser had added him to the Signal chat.</p><p>“Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man,” Mr. Trump told NBC News. The president said one of Mr. Waltz’s staff members had added Mr. Goldberg.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But even before Monday’s leak, Mr. Waltz <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/us/politics/michael-waltz-trump.html" title="">faced skepticism from inside and outside of the administration.</a> Some of Mr. Trump’s most conservative allies viewed him as not loyal enough to the president while some of the Republicans he formerly served with in Congress considered him too loyal.</p><h2 id="link-2017a91c">How are both parties responding?</h2><p>Democrats are furious about the report, and they are demanding investigations into the disclosure of sensitive material. Some are also calling attention to the Trump administration’s efforts to downplay the incident, resurfacing clips of Mr. Waltz and other Trump allies criticizing Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state.</p><p>Ms. Clinton posted a link to the Atlantic article on social media on Monday with an emoji of two eyes and wrote, “You have got to be kidding me.”</p><p>Several Republicans on Capitol Hill expressed concerns about Mr. Goldberg’s inclusion in the chat and acknowledged that it was a mistake. Most, however, said they wanted a full briefing before drawing any conclusions.</p><p>Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said on CNN that his panel would send an inquiry to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and then determine whether a fuller investigation was warranted. But Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, dismissed the idea of additional investigations or discipline for the officials involved.</p><p>Still, some of Mr. Trump’s most loyal allies downplayed the incident. Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, said the story was a “smear” that is being “waged by the left.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tyler Pager is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager">More about Tyler Pager</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jeffrey-goldberg">Jeffrey Goldberg</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/atlantic-the-magazine">Atlantic, The (Magazine)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Musk Effect:</strong> Elon Musk is seemingly everywhere, dominating the news out of Washington and beyond.
