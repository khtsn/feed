He was 93.</p><p>His son, <a href="https://www.jeffcapri.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jeff Capri</a>, who is also a comedian, confirmed the death.</p><p>In the nearly 40 years leading up to “Catskills on Broadway,” Mr. Capri honed his standup routine at nightclubs, at resorts in the Catskills and Pocono Mountains, and as the opening act for the heartthrob singers Engelbert Humperdinck and Tom Jones.</p><p>“I opened for Sinatra. Twice,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/20/style/a-night-out-with-the-catskill-comics-one-liners-for-a-new-generation.html" title="">he told The New York Times in 1999</a>. “Never met him.” Mr. Sinatra did not like to fritter away his time with opening acts, he said.</p><p>Mr. Capri was a staple of the Catskills, the constellation of mountain resorts where comedians developed a brand of comedy, popular with Jewish families in the mid-20th century, punctuated by rapid-fire one-liners and self-deprecating jokes laced with Yiddishisms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was in 1991 when Freddie Roman, a fellow Borscht Belt comedian, tapped Mr. Capri to join him in the cast of “Catskills on Broadway,” along with Mal Z. Lawrence and Marilyn Michaels.</p><p>“I wanted an Italian, and Robert De Niro wasn’t available,” Mr. Roman said in a 90th-birthday roast for Mr. Capri in 2021. (The event included Mr. Capri’s final performance.)</p><p>By the time the Broadway show opened, most of the well-known Catskills resorts had long closed, and the revue was conceived as a revival, featuring veterans of the era. Mr. Roman, who died in 2022, was the M.C. and performed a 30-minute routine, as did the three others. The show ended with the comics telling more jokes and singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGveTSQbH30" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen</a>” (“To Me, You’re Beautiful”), which the Andrews Sisters recorded in 1937 and became a big hit.</p><p>Mr. Capri might have been the only non-Jew in the cast, but he had spent so much time in the Catskills that he had become, in effect, an honorary Jew to other comics. “I had a Jewish routine that I put in the middle of my act and it went over well,” Mr. Capri said in an interview for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/arts/freddie-roman-dead.html" title="">Mr. Roman’s obituary</a> in The Times.</p><p>Alison Kaplan, Mr. Capri’s life partner and agent, said, “Dick knew more Yiddish phrases than Freddie and Mal Z. combined.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In his review of “Catskills on Broadway,” Howard Kissel of the The Daily News speculated that Mr. Capri had been cast in the show “because he can tell jokes that would be in bad taste for Jews to tell — like a funny sequence on the Last Supper,” in which he traced his lineage to biblical times, based on (fictional) DNA research.<span>  </span>He added: “Mr. Capri says his ancestors were there, but not at the head table. They were at Table Four, where one of them won the centerpiece.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The program for “Catskills on Broadway,” which ran for 453 performances at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater and about 300 more on the road.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Playbill Inc.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Catskills” opened at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater in December 1991 and ran for 453 performances. Mr. Capri continued with the show when it went on the road for about 300 more performances.</p><p>When the show played the Jackie Gleason Theater in Miami Beach in 1993, The South Florida Sun Sentinel wrote: “Capri, like Roman, juggles one-liners along with careful setup/payoff comedy that has an unbroken flow.”</p><p>Mr. Capri was born Richard Emerick Crupi on Aug. 11, 1931, in Reading, Pa. His father, Francis, owned a grocery store. His mother, Leah (Lastrani) Crupi, ran the home and also worked in the store.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Dick was a class clown in high school, where his impressions made him a minor celebrity.</p><p>“Up until that time I was invisible — a cellophane person — and suddenly everyone knew me,” he told The Lebanon Daily News of Pennsylvania in 1980.</p><p>He left Reading for New York City after high school and soon began to play nightclubs around the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the Catskills, where mostly Jewish comedians performed for mostly Jewish audiences, Mr. Capri’s colleagues considered him an honorary Jew.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Capri family</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Dick is a clever lad and does a funny thing on Barry Fitzgerald imitating James Cagney,” Lenny Woronoff, a nightclub columnist for The Washington Daily News, wrote in 1954, when Mr. Capri performed at the Lotus, a club in Washington.</p><p>The nightclub work led to engagements in the Catskills and the Poconos in the early 1960s. He began opening for Mr. Humperdinck in the 1970s and Mr. Jones in the 1980s at hotels in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe, Atlantic City and around the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He also appeared on episodes of “The Ed Sullivan Show,” “The Merv Griffin Show” and “The Mike Douglas Show.”</p><p>Bill Scheft, a former comedian and staff writer for the “Late Show With David Letterman,” said in an interview: “Dick had an act that worked, and he never stopped writing. And he was great at roasts.”</p><p>Mr. Capri was a regular roaster at the Friars Club in Manhattan, where his targets included Donald J. Trump and the comedian and actor Drew Carey. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGZ1sXkg4ew" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The roast for Mr. Carey, in 1998,</a> was held a year after the publication of Mr. Carey’s book “Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined.”</p><p>“When I think of the finest books I’ve ever read,” Mr. Capri said, “I think of Tolstoy’s ‘War and Peace,&#39; Hemingway’s ‘For Whom the Bell Tolls’ and Drew Carey’s ‘Dirty Jokes and Beer.’ Ladies and gentleman, do I have taste?”</p><p>The Friars Club held a combination roast and bar mitzvah for Mr. Capri in 2004, presenting him with a yarmulke sewn with green, white and red fabric to look like an Italian flag. He was buried with the yarmulke, Ms. Kaplan said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>In addition to her and his son, Mr. Capri is survived by a brother, Frank. His marriages to Barbara Clippinger, a dancer, and April Rand ended in divorce.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Capri at the Friars Club in New York in 2014.

One night in the late 1970s, when he was performing with Mr. Humperdinck at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Mr. Capri learned that Cary Grant was in the audience. Afterward, Mr. Grant went backstage to meet Mr. Humperdinck, who was showering. While he waited, Mr. Grant spoke to an excited Mr. Capri.</p><p>“He looked at me and said: ‘You were wonderful. I just loved to laugh at you,” <a href="https://www.realdickcapri.com/comedy-videos-dick-capri.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Capri recalled</a> when he and Mr. Humperdinck were guests on the “Sally Jessy Raphael” talk show in the 1990s. Mr. Grant continued to praise Mr. Capri until Mr. Humperdinck emerged from his dressing room.</p><p>“Cary Grant sees Engelbert,” Mr. Capri said. “He says, ‘Engelbert, this was the best one-man show I’ve ever seen.’”</p><p>“What happened to ‘laughed and laughed’?” Mr. Capri said to Ms. Raphael and her audience. “Invisible!”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
