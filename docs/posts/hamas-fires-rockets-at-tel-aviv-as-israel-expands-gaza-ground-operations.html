The Israeli military said they were either intercepted or fell in open areas. But the barrage served as a show of resilience from the Palestinian armed group despite more than a year of war with Israel.</p><p>A two-month cease-fire collapsed this week with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-cease-fire-hamas.html" title="">an Israeli aerial bombardment of Gaza</a>, which the military said had targeted Hamas. Israel argued that the truce could not continue unless Hamas released more hostages, while Hamas accused Israel of violating the cease-fire agreement.</p><p>The United States, which had been seeking to broker an extension of the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, has thrown its weight behind the Israeli offensive. Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that President Trump “fully supports Israel” and “the actions that they’ve taken in recent days.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The renewed Israeli assault has killed more than 500 people in Gaza in three days, including scores of children, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The figures do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>After the Hamas rocket attack, the Israeli military warned Palestinians in Bani Suheila in southern Gaza to flee, saying militants were firing from the area.</p><p>Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesman, <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1902714593367019971" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> it “a final advance warning” before an Israeli attack.</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli military said its forces had begun conducting ground operations near Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza. That came a day after Israel announced that it had recaptured part of the Netzarim corridor in central Gaza, which divides the territory’s north and south. Israel had withdrawn from the corridor as part of the truce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Hamas said at least five of its top leaders in Gaza were among about 400 people killed by Israel on Tuesday, in a day of heavy bombardment that shattered the truce, according to Gaza officials. The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had killed at least two senior Hamas officials.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In Gaza, the escalating conflict prompted panic and fear among Palestinians who had hoped for a longer respite. Many Palestinians there say they see little hope for a resolution to the crisis soon.</p><p>Abdelkarim Harazin, 28, a doctor in Gaza City, said the cease-fire had brought a desperately needed break for Palestinians: Border crossings opened and food and other goods flowed in. Now, whatever food remains is sold at “sky-high prices” for many residents who have lost their homes or savings to the war, he said.</p><p>He accused Israel of breaking the cease-fire but also said that Hamas’s leaders should turn over the hostages and go into exile to spare Palestinians more Israeli attacks.</p><p>“Everyone is exhausted. How long will we have to keep living like this?” he said.</p><p>Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has vowed to step up pressure on Hamas until the group capitulates and releases the dozens of Israeli and foreign hostages still held in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Hamas officials say their demands for releasing the rest of the hostages remain unchanged, including an agreement to end the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas is also demanding the release of more Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>The 15-month war in Gaza killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in the territory, including thousands of children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Hamas set off the conflict with a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people and saw about 250 taken as hostages back to Gaza.</p><p>About 24 living Israeli and foreign hostages — as well as the remains of more than 30 others — are believed to still be in Gaza, according to Israel.</p><p>The cease-fire reached in January secured an initial six-week truce while mediators sought to bridge gaps between Israel and Hamas on the next stage of the truce. The six-week period elapsed in early March without an agreement on the second phase.</p><p>Almost immediately, Israel blocked humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, including food and medicine in an apparent effort to pressure Hamas in the negotiations to free more hostages. Later, the Israeli government cut off electricity it provided to a Gaza desalination plant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mediators like the United States were trying to reach a deal on the next steps in the truce, including a permanent end to the war and the release of the remaining living hostages.</p><p>But Israel has been unwilling to end the conflict permanently as long as Hamas still controls Gaza. Hamas is refusing to disband its armed battalions, send its leaders into exile or release many more hostages unless Israel commits to a permanent end to the war.</p><p>Hamas is believed to still control thousands of operatives despite losing many in the war.</p><p>Members of the Israeli parliament’s foreign affairs and defense committee — who receive closed-door intelligence briefings — said in a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-gaza-attack.html" title="">letter</a> that Hamas is believed to still have more than 25,000 fighters.</p><p>Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> and <!-- -->Myra Noveck<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
