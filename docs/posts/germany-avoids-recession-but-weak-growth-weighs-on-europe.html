name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Europe struggled to turn around its economic fortunes in autumn, as Germany, the region’s powerhouse, reported weak growth, offsetting stronger expansion in the continent’s southern countries, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-30102024-ap" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European statistical agency</a> reported on Wednesday.</p><p>Economic output in the 20 countries that use the euro grew 0.4 percent from July to September versus the previous quarter. Compared with a year earlier, the eurozone grew 0.9 percent.</p><p>The anemic pace is keeping Europe behind the United States, where the economy grew at an estimated 3 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, powered by consumer spending and investment.</p><p>“Europe’s recovery is falling short of its full potential,” Alfred Kammer, director for the region at the International Monetary Fund, warned <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/10/24/tr102424-transcript-of-eur-reo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last week at a meeting</a> in Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Dragging Europe down is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/business/europe-economy-competitiveness.html" title="">loss of competitiveness</a> that has continued to weigh on businesses — a problem that Mario Draghi, former head of the European Central Bank, said in a recent landmark report had put Europe’s “reason for being” at risk.</p><p>A key reason is that Russia’s war in Ukraine is still taking a toll, the I.M.F. said. Although European governments and businesses have worked to adapt to the loss of Russian gas, stubbornly high energy prices have continued to hammer industries, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/business/volkswagen-german-economy.html" title="">especially in Germany</a>, whose vaunted manufacturing sector has borne the brunt of the pain, the fund said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg, Germany.

In a sign of deepening woes, Volkswagen, Germany’s largest industrial employer, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/business/volkswagen-plant-closures-germany.html" title="">threatening major job cuts</a> and factory closures as it struggles to return its flagship brand to profitability.</p><p>European consumers have also been sitting on a huge pile of savings, reluctant to unleash spending that could help stimulate the economy as long as the costs of heating their homes and filling gas tanks remain high.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In France, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/business/france-moodys-negative-outlook.html" title="">a cost-of-living crisis</a> has crimped household spending and become a major political issue. Those worries were lifted temporarily in the summer when Paris hosted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/world/olympics-paris-attack-opening-ceremony" title="">Olympic Games</a>, with a surge in household consumption and government spending helping to lift growth by 0.4 percent from the previous quarter.</p><p>But the figure masked underlying weakness in the economy: Investment has slowed and consumers have pulled back on spending since the Games. France is facing further risks to growth in the form of a rapidly widening debt and deficit, which has spurred a politically fragile new government to seek 60 billion euros, about $65 billion, of tax increases and spending cuts next year.</p><p>France and Germany together are top drivers of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/business/europe-economy-inflation-growth.html" title="">eurozone economy</a>, and continued slowdowns there have outweighed faster turnarounds in southern European countries that were once the region’s laggards.</p><p>Spain is now one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/spain-china-investment.html" title="">fastest-growing countries in the bloc</a>, expanding at a 0.8 percent pace in the third quarter on the back of a boom in tourism and a rise in immigration that the government has welcomed to help fuel further economic growth. Portugal’s economy pulled ahead by 0.2 percent from the second quarter.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liz Alderman is the chief European business correspondent, writing about economic, social and policy developments around Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liz-alderman">More about Liz Alderman</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/eurozone">Eurozone</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/mario-draghi">Mario Draghi</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
