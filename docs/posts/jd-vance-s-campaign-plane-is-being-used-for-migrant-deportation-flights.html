The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/21/us/trump-immigration-policy.html" title="">Trump administration</a> has since expanded the range of people who can be targeted for removal, sped up the deportation process for others and, in some cases, tightened the rules for legal immigrants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In 2018, during President Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/us/trump-immigration-policies.html" title="">first term</a>, the plane was used for at least three deportation flights that took about <a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2019/04/23/ice-air/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">360 migrants</a> to El Salvador and Guatemala, according to the Center for Human Rights at the University of Washington. The center obtained the data through a public records request.</p><p>A fourth flight, chartered by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of what is known as its ICE Air program, was used to transfer about 144 migrants between detention centers in the United States.</p><p>The repurposing of Mr. Vance’s former campaign plane for migrant deportation flights was <a href="https://azmirror.com/2025/05/29/j-d-vances-campaign-plane-carried-anti-immigrant-rhetoric-now-it-carries-shackled-deportees/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported by The Arizona Mirror</a>. The publication tallied an additional 35 flights made by the plane in 2020 between ICE hubs in the United States and Central and South American countries.</p><p>It was not clear whether Mr. Vance, who represented Ohio in the Senate before being elected vice president, was aware of the plane’s history.</p><p>A spokesman for the vice president’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Department of Homeland Security, which ICE is part of, declined to comment on the specific plane, citing security concerns.</p><p>“ICE uses subcontractors to help carry out its mission to deport illegal aliens,” the department said in a statement. “These subcontractors are not exclusive to ICE.”</p><p>The plane, which is about 22 years old, is registered to Eastern 737 Asset Holdings L.L.C. in Kansas City, Mo., according to a Federal Aviation Administration registry. The company did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>From mid-April through May 24 of this year, the plane was chartered for 16 deportation flights to Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, according to Tom Cartwright, an immigrant rights advocate and a volunteer for the group Witness at the Border. The flight data was verified by The New York Times.</p><p>Soon after Mr. Trump chose Mr. Vance as his running mate last July, the plane became a mainstay on the trail, ferrying the future vice president and an entourage of handlers and journalists between Washington and battleground states.</p><p>Last August, the plane <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/jd-vance-plane-emergency-landing.html" title="">had to make an emergency landing</a> in Milwaukee shortly after takeoff because of a door malfunction. The flight returned to Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport, where the problem was quickly resolved before it continued to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Neil Vigdor covers breaking news for The Times, with a focus on politics.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Carol&#39;s Detention:</strong> For 20 years, Carol Hui has served waffles, raised her children and embraced the small town of Kennett, Mo. Her detention and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/missouri-immigrant-trump.html">pending deportation to Hong Kong has hit the community hard,</a> in a county that voted overwhelmingly for Trump.</p></li><li><p><strong>Russian Scientist Case:</strong> A federal judge said she would grant bail to Kseniia Petrova, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/science/russian-scientist-harvard-charges.html">an immigration case stemming from Petrova’s failure to declare scientific samples</a> she was carrying into the country.</p></li><li><p><strong>Checks on Migrant Children:</strong> From New York to Hawaii, federal agents have been showing up unannounced at schools, homes and migrant shelters to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/trump-ice-migrant-children-welfare-checks.html">interview minors in what the government calls “wellness checks.”</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Smuggling Ring Conviction:</strong> More than three years after a young Indian family froze to death trying to cross into the U.S. from Canada during a blizzard, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/human-smuggling-indian-family-canada-border.html">a federal judge sentenced the convicted architect</a> of the human smuggling network that they used to a decade in prison.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biden-Era Immigration Program</strong>: A federal judge temporarily <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/judge-blocks-shutdown-migrant-entry-programs.html">blocked the Trump administration from pulling legal protections</a> from hundreds of thousands of people who entered the U.S. through Biden-era programs.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Wrong Turn</strong>: An accidental trip over the Peace Bridge in Buffalo typically means a toll and a loss of time.
