Pro-war Russian commentators have called on Mr. Putin to do just that, while also demanding tougher peace conditions in Ukraine to avoid the kind of inconclusive cease-fire that ultimately led to Mr. al-Assad’s downfall.</p><p>Both scenarios would complicate the incoming Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">promise to swiftly end the fighting in Ukraine</a>.</p><p>As Mr. al-Assad’s regime crumbled, President-elect Donald J.

By last year, the Russian Army had abandoned its failed attempts to mount grand offensives that could topple the Ukrainian state. It has concentrated instead on Ukraine’s east, simultaneously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/europe/ukrainian-war-dead.html" title="">pressuring Kyiv’s forces</a> in multiple parts of the front and bombing Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure.</p><p>Military experts have interpreted this strategy as an attempt to exhaust Ukraine’s military and society, and force Kyiv to the negotiating table.</p><p>Mr. Putin has implied that any peace deal must allow Russia to keep at least the territory that it has already occupied, and guarantee Ukraine’s military neutrality, meaning no entry into NATO. Russia also wants to suppress <a href="http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/74285" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukraine’s</a> military capacity.</p><p>“We must not talk about a cease-fire for half an hour or half a year, so that they could resupply ammunition,” <a href="http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/75521" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Putin said at a forum in southern Russia last month</a>, referring to Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Ukrainian government has repeatedly rejected any peace conditions that would formalize the loss of its territory or bar the country from seeking NATO membership.</p><p>In the short term, Moscow’s setback in Syria could shrink the room for compromise further.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photo released by Russian state media of the Russian and Syrian presidents, Vladimir V.

He called for targeted killings of Ukrainian officials and more Russian airstrikes against Ukrainian government buildings and energy infrastructure.</p><p>Like Mr. Putin, the ultranationalist Russian commentators have offered few details about how a depleted Russian Army could achieve a Ukrainian capitulation that would satisfy their demands. But they are united in their calls for the army to step up its assaults.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Whether Mr. Putin listens to these or any other arguments is a different matter.</p><p>Vasily Kashin, a political scientist at Moscow’s state-run Higher School of Economics, has called the outpouring of nationalistic fervor following the Syria debacle “media noise.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A defaced portrait of ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad on the side of a highway in Damascus on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He said the Kremlin would continue prosecuting the war according to its plan, and was unlikely to be distracted by peripheral events that had little to no impact on the battlefield.</p><p>Mr. Putin has certainly long cultivated an image as a master strategist unperturbed by the ebb and flow of daily events. Still, the blow inflicted by Mr. al-Assad’s collapse to the Russian leader’s global reputation could yet compel him to make a show of strength in Ukraine, said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political scientist at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.</p><p>“He may be tempted to show that Russia is not defeated, and that it knows what it is doing,” she said. “And that may lead him to doubt what he is willing to concede in Ukraine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>To show strength, Mr. Putin could make new conditions for peace talks, or he could escalate airstrikes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/europe/russia-ballistic-missile-ukraine-war.html?searchResultPosition=5" title="">following through on his frequent threats</a>.
