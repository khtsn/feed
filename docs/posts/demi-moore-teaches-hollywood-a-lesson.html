    <h1>Demi Moore Teaches Hollywood a Lesson</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Demi Moore <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/demi-moore-sffilm-awards-19970596.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has said</a> that before she got the script for “The Substance,” she thought that maybe her days in the movies were done.</p><p>I was just about certain they’d passed.</p><p>Her commercial stride came about three decades ago, in her late 20s and early 30s, when she was a dewy object of immortal longing in “Ghost,” an exotic dancer in “Striptease,” a one-night stand worth $1 million in “Indecent Proposal.” Hollywood treated Moore as more specimen than thespian. And specimens don’t last.</p><p>But on Sunday night, at 62, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/movies/golden-globes-winners-2025.html" title="">she won a Golden Globe</a> for best actress in a movie (comedy or musical) for “The Substance,” presaging her outstanding female actor <a href="https://www.sagawards.org/media/news/releases/nominations-announced-31st-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nomination</a> from the Screen Actors Guild on Wednesday morning and giving her strong odds for a first-ever Oscar nomination next week. The moment had perfect poetry, because “The Substance” casts her as an aging star crudely sidelined for younger models. And because age, not youth, distinguished most of the other female actors taking home Globes.</p><p>Best actress in a movie drama went to Fernanda Torres, for “I’m Still Here.” She’s 59. Best supporting actress in a movie of any kind went to Zoe Saldaña, for “Emilia Pérez,” who, at 46, has ditched the blue hue of her sci-fi-hottie “Avatar” roles and ascended to a much higher zenith of regard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Globes honor work in television, too, and the best actress in a comedy series was Jean Smart, for “Hacks.” She’s 73. The winner for best actress in a limited series was Jodie Foster, for “True Detective: Night Country.” She’s 62.</p><p>I’m not prepared to declare a new day for older women in show business. But I do want to take the occasion of this awards season to celebrate a rare bevy of rich roles for veteran actresses and to articulate the wish that it’s less anomaly than turning point.</p><p>Rich roles for a diversity of performers, too. Torres and Saldaña are Latina. The women competing with Moore in her Globes category included Zendaya, who is Black, for “Challengers”; Cynthia Erivo, who is Black and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/scene/columns/cynthia-erivo-black-queer-los-angeles-lgbt-center-1236009478/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">identifies as queer</a>, for “Wicked”; and Karla Sofía Gascón, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/01/06/karla-sofia-gascon-emilia-perez-golden-globes-speech/77480457007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who is transgender</a>, for “Emilia Pérez.” Erivo and Gascón also joined Moore among the just-announced SAG nominees.</p><p>Whether the subject and setting are Hollywood or Washington, the entertainment industry or politics, we talk, as we must, about how far we still need to travel to reach a place of real inclusion, robust opportunity and full respect for all. But that doesn’t mean we haven’t made advances, and the Globes, for all their trademark silliness, were serious proof of that. Presenters, nominees, winners — they represented many kinds of women. Sure, their average weight was probably below the American norm and their average yearly bill for cosmetic interventions probably higher. Injectables aren’t on the way out.</p><p>But perhaps seasoning, experience and wisdom are in. The youngest of the six nominees in Torres’s category were Kate Winslet, for “Lee,” and Angelina Jolie, for “Maria,” both, at 49, in movies whose titles reflect their unswerving focus on uncommon women.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And perhaps we’re becoming just an iota less hasty to stereotype women and consign them to suffocating boxes. (I’m beginning 2025 on a note of willed optimism.) Pamela Anderson, who rose to fame in a bathing suit on the television series “Baywatch,” was among the Golden Globe nominees for best actress in a movie drama for “The Last Showgirl,” about a dancer whose currency has been cruelly devalued by age, and she joined Moore, Erivo and Gascón among the SAG nominees for outstanding female actor. Like Moore, Anderson had never previously received such critical acclaim. She’s 57 — and has lately been forgoing makeup in public appearances as a way of freeing herself from other people’s expectations.</p><p>I’d say that she and Moore are digging deeper than ever, but really they’d been denied the shovels. “The Substance” is a complicated one: joyless, tendentious, gratuitously bloody. But there’s no looking away from Moore’s raw, fierce, dazzling performance. It’s an unfettered scream of undiluted rage at a world that too often judges women superficially, treats them contemptuously and throws them away.</p><p>The awards-season response to it suggests that Hollywood sees the truth in that indictment and feels some measure of appropriate guilt. Does contrition augur amends? Here’s hoping that the aggregate talent of Moore and the other female actors on the awards circuit will persuade moviemakers of how rewarding that would be.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h2 id="link-52714da7">For the Love of Sentences</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fototeca Gilardi/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In The Washington Post, Candace Buckner <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/12/24/ace-flagg-cooper-flagg-twin-brother/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=wp_homepage" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described</a> the derision that Ace Flagg — the fraternal twin of the basketball sensation Cooper Flagg — faced when his high school basketball team played a recent road game. “The atmosphere is a cocoon of squeals and cheers, choreographed taunts and random insults, and it features the most savage combination in the free world: hormones and unlimited lung capacity,” she wrote. “And most of this symphony in the key of puberty is directed at Ace Flagg.” (Thanks to Paul Wester of Beltsville, Md., for nominating this.)</p><p>Also in The Post, Carolyn Hax <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2025/01/03/carolyn-hax-judging-purebred-dogs/#:~:text=Judging%20is%20carbs%20for%20the,openness%20to%20understanding%20others&#39;%20choices." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">counseled</a> a reader not to be so censorious of a person’s decision to purchase a purebred dog: “Judging is carbs for the ego — so tasty and hard to resist and havoc when overdone.” (Laurie Kasparian, Mission Viejo, Calif.)</p><p>And Ron Charles <a href="https://s2.washingtonpost.com/camp-rw/?trackId=5980c5dfae7e8a6816fa41a6&amp;s=6778019e64c0860cbc1ffff1&amp;utm_campaign=wp_book_club&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;linknum=5&amp;linktot=60" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previewed</a> “The Little Book of Bitcoin,” to be published later this month, by the hyperbolic, hyperactive, supremely self-confident pitchman Anthony Scaramucci: “This book couldn’t be any more <em>Eau de Mooch </em>if it were a jar of the man’s sweat.” Charles also observed: “But who can argue with the Mooch’s ebullience? In one passage, he touts the convenience of transporting $500 million in Bitcoin on a thumb drive, which is the best news I’ve heard since my yacht got a new helipad.” (Stephen S. Power, Maplewood, N.J., and Hannah Reich, Queens, among others)</p><p>In People magazine, Tim Gliatto <a href="https://people.com/angelina-jolie-maria-review-8758503" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remembered</a> Maria Callas: “She had both an electric stage presence and an unforgettable voice that, while not technically beautiful, projected a fierce, scalding intensity. You could sear a steak with that voice.” (Elizabeth Bradburn, San Francisco)</p><p>In The Philadelphia Inquirer, Margaret Eby <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/food/paradocx-vineyards-barn-red-paint-can-wine-20241227.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made the case</a> for cabernet in a can: “You can get fairly nice wine in a convenient single-serve packaging, allowing for picnicking and gesturing wildly without spilling.” (Elliot Brown, Manhattan)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In The Dispatch, Kevin D.

We’re a country with a Mack truck for an id and a Prius for a superego.” (Michael Smith, Georgetown, Ky.)</p><p>In The Times, Dan Barry and Alan Feuer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/us/politics/january-6-capitol-riot-trump.html" title="">marked</a> the anniversary of the storming of the Capitol: “The Jan. 6 tale that Mr. Trump tells is its own kind of replacement theory, one that covers over the marble-hard facts the way a blue carpet will cover those tainted Capitol steps on Inauguration Day.” (Ann Madonia Casey, Fairview, Texas)</p><p>Also in The Times, Michelle Cottle <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/opinion/donald-trump-elon-musk-taylor-swift-politics.html" title="">updated</a> Kari Lake’s résumé: “Mr. Trump has tapped her to be the new head of Voice of America.

And this book does something miraculous: It saves the baby of mysticism from the discarded bathwater of institutional religion.” (Sarah Leggat, Cohasset, Mass.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><em>To nominate favorite bits of recent writing from The Times or other publications to be mentioned in “For the Love of Sentences,” please email me </em><a href="mailto:bruni-newsletter@nytimes.com?subject=For%20the%20Love%20of%20Sentences" title=""><em>here</em></a><em> and include your name and place of residence.</em></p><hr/><h2 id="link-5fb603a0">What I’m Reading, Watching and Doing</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Danielle Deadwyler in “Carry-On.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Netflix/Everett Collection</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><ul><li><p>I could have filled the previous section of this newsletter with sentences from the Washington Post book critic Ron Charles’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/12/19/books-marriage/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent reflection</a> on his long marriage, his expansive home library and how each relates to and reflects the other, but the whole of his essay deserves a shout-out independent of its parts. It’s a touching recognition of where books take us and how books bind us.</p></li><li><p>I hope to tackle most of the books on my Times colleague and friend Sarah Lyall’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/books/review/best-thriller-novels-2024.html" title="">list of the best thriller novels of 2024</a> and have finished two so far. “The Sequel,” by Jean Hanff Korelitz, left me cold, failing to measure up to its forebear, “The Plot,” which I recommended in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/07/opinion/joe-biden-better-watch-his-back.html" title="">this edition of the newsletter</a> in 2022. But I was amply satisfied and pleasantly surprised by “What Happened to Nina?” by Dervla McTiernan. I say “surprised” because while its title and opening pages tee up a mystery, what follows is as much a compelling, succinct indictment of class privilege and social media. The ending is perfect.</p></li><li><p>As faithful newsletter readers know, I’m less highbrow than lowbrow in my movie and television tastes, which is to say I’m shamefully conversant in the late-career work of Liam Neeson and Gerard Butler. (Don’t judge!) Even so, the Neeson-esque, Butler-adjacent thriller “Carry-On” — which is what you’d get if you mixed “Non-Stop,” “Die Hard 2,” a quart of Red Bull and three heaping cups of treacle into a holiday-season panettone — strained even my remarkable ability to put my brain in Do Not Disturb mode. It’s about a spooky suitcase, an even spookier criminal and a spooked T.S.A. agent, and about halfway through it, I wondered if it was actually parody. But who should pop up in the middle of this mess and nearly redeem it? Danielle Deadwyler, as a Los Angeles detective 10 times keener than everyone around her (a low bar). Deadwyler was strangely passed over for an Oscar nomination for the 2022 movie “Till” and has a shot at one this year for “The Piano Lesson,” but whether or not that comes through, she has emerged as an actor worth watching in anything she does.</p></li><li><p>My Times colleague Maggie Haberman, David Folkenflik of NPR and Charlotte Alter of Time magazine will be joining me at Duke University at 1 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 25, for a panel discussion about the new Trump administration, the Republican majority in Congress and what it means for the country. The event, called the Zeidman Colloquium, is free and open to the public; <a href="https://dewitt.sanford.duke.edu/event/2025-zeidman-colloquium/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> are the details.</p></li></ul><hr/><h2 id="link-4deed9d8">On a Personal (By Which I Mean Regan) Note</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Frank Bruni</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>On the last day of 2024, Regan and I ran into a veterinarian who’d cared for her when she and I lived in New York. He cooed anew over her beauty and sweet disposition, then noticed her limp. He wasn’t surprised. Some three years ago, he remarked on an asymmetry in her gait that foretold trouble as she aged. She’s less than a month shy of 11 now.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“Knee tear?” he asked me.</p><p>Yup.</p><p>“Surgery?”</p><p>Six weeks earlier.</p><p>“That was inevitable,” he said. He added that she seemed to be making a good recovery. But he cautioned me: She’d probably never again be the deer-chasing, creek-crossing, hill-climbing whirligig of the past, and I’d be wisest and kindest not to encourage such intense exertion. It was time for her to slow down, at least somewhat. It was best.</p><p>In my 2022 book “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/books/review/the-beauty-of-dusk-frank-bruni.html" title="">The Beauty of Dusk</a>” — about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/opinion/eyesight-going-blind.html" title="">a rare type of stroke I suffered</a>, its effect on my eyesight and what I learned about coping and resilience — I recalled how a college psychology professor of mine liked to say that life was about dealing with loss. I questioned his specific wording, his exact formulation. I think life is about recognizing that loss needn’t be regarded that way and that there’s a complicated arithmetic at work. Loss is change. Loss is challenge, the meeting and mastering of which has its own dividends. With some losses, there are gains. And with many losses, something essential — maybe the most important thing of all — remains.</p><p>Lost to me and Regan are the challenging mountain hikes that we did on those special days when we were in the right place with the right amount of time. Lost to us are rambling, two-hour explorations of the trails near our Chapel Hill, N.C., home.</p><p>But our shorter, gentler strolls around the neighborhood in the morning, when the birds get mouthy, and in the early evening, when the sun quits, allow us to do precisely what those grander adventures did: share space and share pleasures in a world brimming with both. We move through it with less physical grace. But we move through it together, and that’s what counts.</p><hr/></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Frank Bruni is a professor of journalism and public policy at Duke University, the author of the book “The Age of Grievance” and a contributing Opinion writer.
