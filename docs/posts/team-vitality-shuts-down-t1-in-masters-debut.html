</span> in their opening <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok/swiss-stage" target="_blank">Masters: Bangkok</a> match. The victory puts Vitality one win away from making playoffs, while T1 needs to avoid a loss to continue in the tournament. </p>

<p>Neither team is a newcomer to the international stage, but both have struggled to find  success in the past, only winning two games each across a combined six events prior to Bangkok. This is Team Vitality&#39;s first-ever Masters event, however, having only attended <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo" target="_blank">LOCK//IN</a> via invite and qualified to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions 2024</a>. The teams&#39; lack of overlap in attendance also means this match was the first time the two organizations played against each other, though individual players on both rosters have faced off in the past. </p>

<p>In the map veto, Vitality took away <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/2059/team-vitality/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2025-01-01&amp;date_end=2025-02-19" target="_blank">their permaban</a>, Pearl, while T1 removed <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/14/t1/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2025-01-01&amp;date_end=2025-02-19" target="_blank">one of their two most common bans</a>, Abyss, knowing Vitality would likely ban Lotus in the second round. This let Vitality pick Fracture, looking to avoid T1&#39;s potential counter-strats on Haven. The South Korean team picked their favored map, Bind, as the second stage, and took away Haven, taking the series to more neutral ground with Split as the decider. </p>

<p>Vitality opened <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/448599/team-vitality-vs-t1-champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok-r1/?game=202498&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Fracture</a> with a pistol win, but T1 took over the first half, denying the offense from gaining an advantage. The Korean team was quick to adapt to Vitality&#39;s plans, exploiting their lack of anti-flank and getting key reads on the game plan. <span data-ref-id="2">

<p>The second half was a turning point for Vitality, with the team only losing three rounds, including the pistol and a single rifle round later in the half. Derke in particular was key to his team&#39;s success, going from 1-5 in opening engagements in the first half to 4-1 on defense, as well as a 1.91 rating on defense. In the end, Team Vitality took their map pick 13-10 after completely shutting T1 out of the second half. </p>

T1 found their footing in later rounds, but Vitality&#39;s strong start meant they only need two rounds to take the lead on attack. The 7-5 scoreline did not come easy for Vitality, however, as the final round saw them winning with a Stinger buy and salvaging a 2v3 thanks to a Viper&#39;s Pit from <span data-ref-id="4">
