Officials did not identify the driver.</p><p>Because they are highly social by nature and drawn to their hives, the bees were likely to settle down and stay close to the truck, said Gene E. Robinson, a professor of entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an expert on insect social behavior and genomics.</p><p>“That’s where their queen and the next generation of bees (the ‘brood’) are located,” Professor Robinson said in an email on Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At this time of year, each beehive typically contains about 40,000 to 60,000 bees, according to Professor Robinson, who said beekeepers should be able to get most of the bees back into their hives if they were not damaged.</p><p>“Migratory beekeeping is essential for the production of many important fruit, nut, and vegetable crops and migratory beekeepers are unsung heroes,” he said.</p><p>Friday’s honeybee escape was not the first time that wayward insects have created a problem for the people of Whatcom County.</p><p>It was there at the end of the last decade that the invasive species known as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/asian-giant-hornet-washington.html" title="">“murder hornet”</a> established a home until its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/us/murder-hornet-washington.html" title="">eradication</a> in 2024.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Neil Vigdor covers breaking news for The Times, with a focus on politics.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
