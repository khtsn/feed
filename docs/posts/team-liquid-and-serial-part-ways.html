		<p><strong>Its kinda disrespectful</strong> to say this to someone who have <strong>spent his whole time trying to go pro into tier 1</strong> and eventually he did for a short period of time. He was avoiding any kind of controversy and was propably a good teammate in terms of being friendly and passionate. <strong>He have most likely put more effort into something then you have ever done.</strong></p>

		<p>Serial was solid, but when you get the chance to sign trexx, it&#39;s hard to justify keeping him.</p>

	<div data-post-id="5142405">
		
		
		<p>The current meta revolves around 2 initiators Serial couldnt fit there. He was competing with Nats on the sentinel role. Liquid needed something different to help with the new meta and trexx was simply too good to ignore. Also i think that serial came to liquid casue they thought that 2 sentinel comps would be the future (they were wrong). </p>

			<p>Tier 2 and coming back stronger, ez. Still so young and very talented.</p>
<p>From what I&#39;ve heard is that Serial is insanely silent during comms and just plays his game. But yeah... I think that&#39;s what several people said about trexx as well + that he tilts af.</p>
<p>But who knows? It&#39;s not our duty to solve that.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very excited about TL and how good they eventually become.</p>		</div>

		<p>i don&#39;t like team liquid&#39;s management lol please do proper trial before signing anyone to see if a player fit the team or not. you guys did horrible job since the beginning.</p>
