		<p><strong>Its kinda disrespectful</strong> to say this to someone who have <strong>spent his whole time trying to go pro into tier 1</strong> and eventually he did for a short period of time. He was avoiding any kind of controversy and was propably a good teammate in terms of being friendly and passionate. <strong>He have most likely put more effort into something then you have ever done.</strong></p>

		<p>Serial was solid, but when you get the chance to sign trexx, it&#39;s hard to justify keeping him.</p>

			<p>Tier 2 and coming back stronger, ez. Still so young and very talented.</p>
<p>From what I&#39;ve heard is that Serial is insanely silent during comms and just plays his game. But yeah... I think that&#39;s what several people said about trexx as well + that he tilts af.</p>
<p>But who knows? It&#39;s not our duty to solve that.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very excited about TL and how good they eventually become.</p>		</div>
