Syrians posted celebratory memes when Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-syria-sanctions-us.html" title="">announced</a> that he would end American sanctions on their war-ravaged country “in order to give them a chance at greatness.”</p><p>And in Yemen — another country mired in war and subject to American sanctions — Abdullatif Mohammed implied agreement with Mr. Trump’s notion of sovereignty, even as he expressed frustration with U.S. intervention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A market in Sana, the capital of Yemen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yahya Arhab/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“When will countries recognize us and let us live like the rest of the world?” Mr. Mohammed, a 31-year-old restaurant manager in the capital, Sana, said when asked about the speech. American airstrikes pounded his city under both former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Trump, targeting the Iran-backed Houthi militia, until Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-houthis-bombing.html" title="">abruptly declared a cease-fire</a> this month.</p><p>“Who is Trump to grant pardons, lift sanctions on a country, or impose them?” Mr. Mohammed said. “But that’s how the world works.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s remarks came at the start of a four-day jaunt through three wealthy Gulf Arab states: Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. He was focused in large part on business deals, including more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-investment.html" title="">$1 trillion in investment</a> in the United States pledged by the three Gulf governments.</p><p>But his address in Riyadh made clear that he had broader diplomatic ambitions for his trip. He expressed a “fervent wish” that Saudi Arabia follow two neighbors, the Emirates and Bahrain, to recognize the state of Israel. (Saudi officials have said that will happen only after the establishment of a Palestinian state.) He said he had a keen desire to reach a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, adding that he “never believed in having permanent enemies.”</p><p>And on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-syria-president-al-shara-sanctions.html" title="">he met</a> the new leader of Syria, Ahmed al-Shara — a former jihadist who led a rebel alliance that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/middleeast/assad-regime-syria-final-days.html" title="">ousted the brutal strongman Bashar al-Assad</a>.

When Mr. Biden visited Saudi Arabia, he said that he told the crown prince he believed he was responsible for the 2018 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html" title="">killing</a> and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of the prince.</p><p>Mr. Trump instead heaped plaudits on the Arabian Peninsula and Prince Mohammed, calling him an “incredible man.”</p><p>“In recent years, far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it’s our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their sins,” Mr. Trump said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump and Prince Mohammed bin Salman touring Diriyah, the ancestral home of the Saudi royal family, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>His remarks left some Arab listeners worried about what the potential evaporation of American pressure over human rights violations could mean for their countries.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ibrahim Almadi is the son of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-us-frees-saad-almadi.html" title="">75-year-old American-Saudi dual national</a> who was arrested in the kingdom over critical social media posts; his father was released but is not allowed to leave Saudi Arabia. In an interview, Mr. Almadi said he had hoped Mr. Trump would speak to Saudi officials about his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/saudi-arabia-exit-ban-us-citizenship-792dbba3a851624a83f927d80e557d5e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">father’s case</a> during his visit — and that he had tried without success to reach out to officials across his administration. He sees it as the type of human rights violation that previous U.S. administrations would have pressed Saudi officials on.</p><p>“They are normalizing my dad’s case, which is not normal,” he said of the Trump administration.</p><p>A White House spokeswoman did not answer questions about whether the president or his aides had raised human rights issues with Saudi officials. Asked about the reaction to his address, the spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, said, “The president has received widespread praise for his speech.”</p><p>Abdullah Alaoudh, a member of a Saudi opposition party in exile and the son of a prominent cleric imprisoned in the kingdom, called the speech a public relations stunt for the benefit of Prince Mohammed.</p><p>He added that he found it ironic that Mr. Trump was praising a Middle East built “by the people of the region” when he was speaking to an audience dotted with foreign billionaires and “in front of an authoritarian leader who has brutally silenced all dissent.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In the ballroom in Riyadh, Mr. Trump received a standing ovation.</p><p>“The president’s speech was actually quite consequential,” Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan said at a news conference on Wednesday, describing it as an “approach of partnership, of mutual respect.”</p><p>Mr. Alamer, a senior resident fellow at the New Lines Institute, a Washington research group, said in an interview that the president’s words reflected themes “that are normally associated with leftist and anti-imperialist intellectuals.”</p><p>“While this is surprising in the sense that we, as Arabs, used to be the subject of American lecturing and interventionism, it is also not surprising when we consider that new right-wing populist movements — both in the Gulf and the U.S. — have borrowed some of this rhetoric from leftists and socialists and repurposed it to advance a conservative worldview,” said Mr. Alamer.</p><p>Negad el-Boraie, a prominent Egyptian human rights lawyer, said he was reluctant to read much into Mr. Trump’s speech, given that he was in Saudi Arabia primarily to talk about investments.</p><p>But for Mr. el-Boraie, Mr. Trump was merely being honest about what U.S. presidents had always really cared about — American interests — regardless of how much previous presidents draped their agendas in comments about human rights and democracy.</p><p>“The U.S. prioritizes its own interests,” he said. “Trump expresses his opinions frankly, and that’s clear in all his speeches.”</p><p>Shuaib Almosawa<!-- --> contributed reporting from Sana, Yemen; <!-- -->Rania Khaled<!-- --> from Cairo; <!-- -->Ismaeel Naar<!-- --> from Dubai; <!-- -->Hwaida Saad<!-- --> and <!-- -->Jacob Roubai<!-- --> from Beirut; and <!-- -->Muhammad Haj Kadour<!-- --> from Damascus.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Nereim is the lead reporter for The Times covering the countries of the Arabian Peninsula.
