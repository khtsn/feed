It was another attempt by rioters to flip the script about Jan. 6 and blame the Justice Department and the F.B.I. for engaging in what the complaint called “a corrupt and politically motivated” prosecution.</p><p>Mr. Trump himself, in the years since Jan. 6, has repeatedly sought to rewrite the history of the riot, claiming it was a “day of love” despite the fact that more than 140 police officers were injured by the mob. Since his return to the White House, he has also claimed that the Biden administration unfairly prosecuted him and many of his allies — even while setting up a special task force inside the Justice Department designed to pursue retributive investigations against his own adversaries.</p><p>Much of the lawsuit submitted by the five Proud Boys — Enrique Tarrio, Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola — sought to re-litigate legal questions that had not gone their way during a lengthy pretrial period and a multiweek trial in Federal District Court in Washington that ended in May 2023 with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/04/us/politics/jan-6-proud-boys-sedition.html" title="">guilty verdicts against all of them.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The men complained, for instance, about the ways in which they were arrested and then denied bail, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/us/proud-boys-fbi-informants.html" title="">accused the F.B.I. of using paid informants to spy on their defense team</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/01/us/politics/fbi-jan-6-investigation-proud-boys.html" title="">claimed that federal agents had altered what they claimed was exculpatory evidence</a>. All of this, the suit said, amounted to the government having deprived them of their constitutional rights.</p><p>Over the past several months, there have been a handful of other lawsuits filed by Jan. 6 defendants — or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/us/politics/jan-6-lawsuits.html" title="">discussed by lawyers representing them</a> — to wrest financial damages from the government over claims of mistreatment or abuse of power.</p><p>But the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flmd.442907/gov.uscourts.flmd.442907.1.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suit brought by the Proud Boys</a> was arguably the most prominent so far, if only because the men had faced the most serious charge — seditious conspiracy — levied against any of the rioters who took part in the Capitol attack.</p><p>The men also faced stiff punishment after their convictions. Mr. Tarrio, who once led the Proud Boys, was sentenced to 22 years — the highest penalty imposed on any of the rioters. Mr. Nordean and Mr. Biggs were sentenced to 18 and 17 years.</p><p>On Mr. Trump’s first day back in office, he issued a full pardon to Mr. Tarrio, who was not in Washington on Jan. 6 but was found guilty of helping plan the movements of scores of Proud Boys that day. The president did not grant pardons to the other men, but commuted their sentences, immediately freeing them from prison.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Even if the lawsuit by the men does not succeed at trial, it is in theory possible that they could get payments from the Trump administration.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/trump-justice-department-ed-martin-weaponization.html" title="">Ed Martin</a>, the lawyer chosen by Mr. Trump to run the Justice Department’s so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/justice-department-weaponization-group.html" title="">weaponization working group</a>, has said that the rioters deserve some form of compensation for what he has described as mistreatment by the government.</p><p>And last month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/politics/ashli-babbitt-jan-6-settlement-trump.html" title="">the Justice Department said it was discussing paying the relatives of Ashli Babbitt</a>, an Air Force veteran killed by the police on Jan. 6, about $5 million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit they brought against the government last year.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
