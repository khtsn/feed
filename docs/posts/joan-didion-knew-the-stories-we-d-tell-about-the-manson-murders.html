The story has everything: a wild-eyed mastermind who was also a failed rocker; a coterie of emaciated, beautiful women; the death of a gorgeous pregnant actress and her friends; strange links to the Beatles; a feeling that this murder was either random, or an indication that hell had broken loose on earth.</p><p>Plus, the public has always had the nagging sense that there was more to the story than anyone was letting on. It was just too Satanic-seeming. Too weird.</p><p>So no wonder the 1969 murders have been an ongoing source of fascination. In just the past few years, Quentin Tarantino’s film “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” Ryan Murphy’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/04/arts/television/american-horror-story-cult-review.html" title="">American Horror Story: Cult</a>” and Emma Cline’s novel “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/books/review/the-girls-by-emma-cline.html" title="">The Girls</a>” have become bona fide hits by reimagining the murders. Manson has turned up as a character in shows like “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/arts/television/review-mulder-meets-manson-in-nbcs-compelling-aquarius.html" title="">Aquarius</a>,” “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/arts/television/mindhunter-serial-killers.html" title="">Mindhunter</a>” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/movies/charlie-says-review.html" title="">Charlie Says</a>.” The journalist Tom O’Neill’s gobsmacking book “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/style/charles-manson-book.html" title="">Chaos: Charles Manson, the C.I.A. and the Secret History of the Sixties</a>,” from 2019, chronicled the author’s decades-long investigation into the case, with results that upend most of what we think we know. And now it’s <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/chaos-the-manson-murders-release-date-news" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Netflix documentary</a> from the director Errol Morris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A still from “Chaos: The Manson Murders,” a Netflix documentary by Errol Morris.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Netflix</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Somehow, this case keeps surprising us. But one person who regarded it without shock — as if it was the inevitable conclusion of a panicked era — was Joan Didion, who was living and working in Hollywood when the murders occurred. In her 1978 essay “The White Album,” regarded as a seminal account of the era, she writes about the ripples of terror the murders provoked. “These early reports were garbled and contradictory,” with differ­ent numbers of victims and explanations of what happened, Didion writes. “I remember all of the day’s misinformation very clearly, and I also remember this, and wish I did not: <em>I remember that no one was surprised</em>.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Reality was barely tangible in the summer of 1969, with its highs and lows, its muddled impressions and half-understood head­lines. Cause and effect seemed to be breaking apart. In some respects this was simply the inevitable result of a country becoming saturated in images because they had a screen at home. A movie theater was a place to go if you wanted to see a whole story, beginning to end. But a TV you could turn on and off, and you never knew what would be there when you turned it on again. You might see images from My Lai, the funeral of a slain politician, pop versions of cowboys on “Gunsmoke”<em> </em>or “Bonanza,&#34; smil­ing tap dancers on a variety show, some comedian or singer from your youth in a different setting than you remembered. It mirrored the neurons of a disturbed mind, firing at random.</p><p>“The White Album” is structured as a series of disconnected scenes. The reportorial voice mixes with the personal, punctuated by long passages from the trial transcript for the murderers of silent film star Ramon Novarro alongside diag­nosis notes from Didion’s own physicians. The Black Panthers show up, and so do the Doors, and so do Didion’s feelings of despair. They play like tracks on a record, related to one another by proximity if not by obvious connection.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joan Didion published “The White Album,” a book of essays, in 1979.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“In what would probably be the middle of my life I wanted still to believe in the narrative and in the narrative’s intelligibility,” Didion remembered. “But to know that one could change the sense with every cut was to begin to perceive the experience as rather more electrical than ethical.” The way you told the story determined its meaning, and if you plucked the right pieces from the headlines, you could assemble them into whatever story you wanted: the hippies’ world of freedom, the narrative of decline.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>OUTSIDE of its famous first line — “we tell ourselves stories in order to live” — “The White Album” is most often cited in retellings of the era’s most notorious crime story. The “murder of five” to which Didion alludes in the essay’s first paragraph is the grisly killing that rocked Hollywood and the world. On Aug. 8, 1969, the group was killed by followers of Manson, who convinced them to do it in part by claiming that the White Album was the Beatles’ apocalyptic message to Manson and his followers. Didion picked up on the detail, never mentioning it in the essay, and used it for her title.</p><p>One victim, the actress Sharon Tate, was married to Roman Polanski, and at the time of the murders, Tate was in their home, located at 10050 Cielo Drive, around seven or eight miles from Didion’s house. Polanski was in London. Tate was eight months pregnant with their baby. The grisly details of the murders have passed into legend — stabbing, screaming, no interest in cries for mercy. Didion would later remember the week as if it was from a horror film: “I recall a time when the dogs barked every night and the moon was always full,” she writes. The next day, the Manson family would murder Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, a middle-class couple who managed gro­cery stores, two people about as far away from Sharon Tate’s world as you could imagine. Nothing made sense.</p><p>What happened next was a laboratory study in how we tell our­selves stories to make sense of the madness. According to many retellings, half of Hollywood claimed that they were actually invited over to the Tate-Polanski house the night of the murders, but had chosen not to attend, and wow, what luck for them, if not for poor Sharon and the rest. Didion would discover later that on the night of the LaBianca murders, Manson and his acolytes were driving along Franklin Avenue, where Didion lived with her family, looking for a place to hit. It really could have been them.</p><p>More stories would emerge as the Manson family was brought to trial, more ways to string the events together into a script. Prosecu­tor Vincent Bugliosi, trying to build a lurid and prosecutable case, seized on a motive that was bound to entrance the nation. Manson, he said, was a lifelong Beatles fan, and also an entrenched racist who believed a race war was coming. He convinced his followers — mostly young women whose use of LSD and other drugs had left them very suggestible — that they would escape the coming war by moving out to the desert and finding the “Bottomless Pit,” in which they could hide until the war ended. Black men, Manson said, would inevitably win that war, since he said that they were physically stronger, but then the family would emerge and overpower them. The war would be called “Helter Skelter,” and Manson told the family that the Bea­tles had been singing about it on the White Album, and were trying to contact him for instructions about how to survive it. (Helter Skel­ter was in fact the name of the kind of ride you’d find in a small amusement fair in England.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The press covers the scene as Charles Manson, left, is brought into a jail in Los Angeles in 1969.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettmann/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>So, Bugliosi continued, the night of the murders, Manson had ordered four of his followers to go out and kill some people, but make it look like the Black Panthers — whom he feared, and who were vocally supported by famous white actresses like Jane Fonda and Jean Seberg — had done it. That, he said, would spark the race war.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It’s not clear whether Manson actually believed any of this. When Bugliosi later wrote about the trial, titling his book “Helter Skelter,” it became one of the best-selling true crime books of all time.</p><p>Years later, digging into the story, “Chaos” author Tom O’Neill would discover that there were even more possible explanations for what <em>really </em>was going on with Manson and his acolytes. “Chaos&#34;<em> </em>ends with more questions than it begins with. Was Bugliosi cherry-picking details? Was the L.A.P.D. somehow complicit in all of this, or just incompetent in some baffling ways? Wait — was the C.I.A. involved? Could it be that the government’s now well-documented attempts to research mind control tactics, or the F.B.I.’s well-documented attempts to bring down the Black Panthers, might be mixed up in here somewhere? When the facts seem so random, we try, as Didion put it, to impose a narrative line on disparate images. To freeze the shifting phantasmagoria before us.</p><p>Just about the only thing everyone could agree upon was that Manson represented, in some way that was hard to pinpoint in less than theological terms, pure evil. It was as if he encapsulated — or maybe was possessed by — the malevolent spirit that was roaming the country freely. As the Manson trial started in 1970, President Nixon said Manson seemed to “be rather a glamorous figure to the young people,” despite the fact that he “was guilty, directly or indirectly, of eight murders without reason.”</p><p>To the ordinary American reading about the trial at home, see­ing images of Manson on magazines and TV, an X carved into his forehead by his own hand, the situation seemed like it <em>had to mean something</em>. But of course, not everyone even agreed on that. Under­ground papers and activists and hippies didn’t really care if Manson had done it; he became a sort of icon of resisting the “rich pigs.”</p><p>New acolytes flocked to the courtroom, drawn to the wild-eyed man. As the jury sequestered at the Ambassador Hotel — the same place where Robert F. Kennedy had been assassinated two years earlier — the defendants became celebrities.</p><p>And the media gathered to make them stars.</p><hr/><p>Adapted from “We Tell Ourselves Stories: Joan Didion and the American Dream Machine.” Copyright (c) 2025 by Alissa Wilkinson.
