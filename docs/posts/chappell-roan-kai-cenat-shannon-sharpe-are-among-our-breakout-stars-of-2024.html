Her track “Good Luck, Babe!” — about a relationship between two women that collapses because one is, as Roan has put it, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/chappell-roan-good-luck-babe-interview-1234998731/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“denying fate”</a><span>  </span>— was one of the biggest hits of the summer.</p><p>But her ballooning fame hasn’t been without hiccups.

He has found another level of success off the field with his interview podcast “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ClubShayShay" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Club Shay Shay</a>.” It debuted in 2020, and has since built an audience of sports fans and those interested in Black Hollywood, with guests including Mike Tyson, John Legend, and Serena and Venus Williams.</p><p>But it was just a few days into January that his show broke the internet when Sharpe interviewed the comic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/arts/television/katt-williams-comedy-netflix-woke-foke.html" title="">Katt Williams</a> for nearly three hours of outrageous, rollicking and at times incendiary commentary on the entertainment industry and Williams’s life. The episode has been streamed about 85 million times on YouTube alone, and the show has remained among the most popular podcasts in the United States since.</p><p>Sharpe has also benefited from the once audio-only genre’s shift to video, with scores of fans now opting to watch their podcasts instead of just listen.</p><p>“There’s something about video and being able to see it for yourself,” Sharpe, 56, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/arts/podcasts-video-youtube-audio.html" title="">told The Times</a> in April. “You can get a sense of a person and their mannerisms.</p><p>Sharpe, who grew up poor in Glennville, Ga., has <a href="https://www.si.com/onsi/everyday-warrior-nation/everyday-warrior-podcast/shannon-sharpe-on-the-power-of-determination-discipline-and-dedication#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20don’t%20know%20how,up%20Sharpe’s%20emphasis%20on%20discipline." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">long</a> <a href="https://www.cantonrep.com/story/sports/pro/pro-football-hof/2011/08/07/shannon-sharpe-legend-s-three/42182700007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that his success has been guided by the “three Ds”: determination, discipline and dedication.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>“I don’t know how to give 50 percent or 75 percent,” he told <a href="https://www.si.com/onsi/everyday-warrior-nation/everyday-warrior-podcast/shannon-sharpe-on-the-power-of-determination-discipline-and-dedication" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sports Illustrated</a> in November. “When I commit, it’s 100 percent or nothing.”</p><hr/><p>Movies</p><h2 id="link-9d2703d">Mikey Madison</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mikey Madison’s performance in Sean Baker’s “Anora” recently earned her a best actress Golden Globe nomination.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caroline Tompkins for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Oscar buzz is buzzing big time for Mikey Madison, who delivered, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/movies/anora-review.html" title="">our film critic put it</a>, “a star-making turn” in “Anora,” Sean Baker’s film about the whirlwind romance and quickie marriage between a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/movies/anora-clip-mikey-madison.html" title="">tough yet disarming</a> sex worker, Ani (Madison), and the son of Russian oligarch (Mark Eydelshteyn).</p><p>The film won the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/movies/anora-palme-dor-sean-baker.html" title="">Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May</a>, the festival’s highest honor.
