Here are 10 artists who shook up their scenes and resonated with fans this year.</p><hr/><p>Pop Music</p><h2 id="link-587258a">Chappell Roan</h2><p>It’s almost incomprehensible to think that last year, Chappell Roan still had time to work as a camp <a href="https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/chappell-roan-on-the-rise" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">counselor</a>.</p><p>It’s not that she hadn’t been pursuing pop. Her debut album, “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,” was released in 2023. One of its now-hit singles “Pink Pony Club” was released back in 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But it was this year that all the pieces coalesced: Her <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">album hit No. 2</a> on the Billboard 200 album chart and <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/chappell-roan-number-one-artist-100-top-album-sales-charts-1235789526/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">No. 1 in album sales</a>; her extravagant drag-inspired persona, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/style/cole-escola-oh-mary-broadway-style.html" title="">1980s-influenced pop sound</a>, soaring vocals and edgy performances have become <a href="https://www.avclub.com/chappell-roan-gov-ball-2024-highlights-1851529729" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wildly viral</a>; she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/arts/music/chappell-roan-festivals-live-shows.html" title="">outgrew</a> her tour plans; and her dance-along anthem “Hot to Go!” was even featured in a Target ad and played at sporting events.</p><p>All the while, her lyrics tackle queer issues frankly. Her track “Good Luck, Babe!” — about a relationship between two women that collapses because one is, as Roan has put it, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/chappell-roan-good-luck-babe-interview-1234998731/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“denying fate”</a><span>  </span>— was one of the biggest hits of the summer.</p><p>But her ballooning fame hasn’t been without hiccups. Roan, 26 and from small-town Missouri, has been outspoken about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/arts/music/chappell-roan-live-fans.html" title="">toxic fan culture</a>, breaking the fourth wall to call into question the way that fans worship their heroes online and in real life.</p><p>“I never really expected it to grow this big,” she said in conversation with the “Saturday Night Live” star Bowen Yang for <a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/chappell-roan-and-bowen-yang-on-queers-fears-and-surviving-superstardom" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Interview Magazine</a> this summer. “It’s been really emotional because I’m not just singing pop music, it’s automatically political because I’m gay.”</p><p>Whether she’ll choose to forge ahead as she has or take a break, as <a href="https://theface.com/music/chappell-roan-pop-music-famous-interview-good-luck-babe" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she’s said she might</a>, is to be seen. But she will be a fixture at the 2025 Grammy Awards in February; she earned <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/arts/music/grammys-nominee-list-2025.html" title="">six nominations</a>, including best new artist and album of the year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16breakout-stars-2024-kvqf/16breakout-stars-2024-kvqf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16breakout-stars-2024-kvqf/16breakout-stars-2024-kvqf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16breakout-stars-2024-kvqf/16breakout-stars-2024-kvqf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A portrait of a man with brown hair and blue eyes.
