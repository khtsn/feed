These were first deaths in decades during the annual race, which is one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/sports/sailing/sydney-hobart-yacht-race-rough.html" title="">most prestigious in the world</a>.</p><p>The annual 628-nautical-mile race, which began Thursday in Sydney, attracts teams from around the globe. It is known for challenging conditions that in the past have sunk yachts as they made their way south to Hobart, the state capital of Tasmania. But it has been 26 years since it last claimed lives, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/25/sports/othersports/25sailing.html" title="">six sailors died</a> during the 1998 race in severe storms.</p><p>The Australian police said that the two men who died on Thursday night and early Friday were both struck on the head by booms, a horizontal beam that attaches the sail of a ship to the mast, and swings as the wind moves the sail from side to side.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A screen grab from a video shows the Flying Fish Arctos moored next to an ambulance at Jervis Bay in Australia on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">AUBC, CH9, CH7, CH9, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The first man, a crew member on the Flying Fish Arctos, was hit just before midnight by a boom that was “moving violently through the night with the challenging sea conditions,” Joe McNulty, a superintendent of the New South Wales state police, said at a news conference on Friday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The police identified the crew member as a 55-year-old Australian. The yacht was near Ulladulla, a coastal town south of Sydney, when he was struck.</p><p>Then, farther south near Batemans Bay around 2:30 a.m., a 65-year-old Australian man died in a similar way on another yacht, the Bowline, Mr. McNulty said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Bowline after the start of the race in Sydney on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Bramble/Rolex, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The police believe that both yachts were in the process of changing their sails, not actively sailing, at the time of the deaths, Mr. McNulty said. Both vessels have been taken out of the race and an investigation is underway, he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Another man, aboard the Porco Rosso, fell overboard during the night but was rescued, Mr. McNulty said.</p><p>Weather conditions were challenging overnight, with strong winds and a heavy squall, Mr. McNulty said, but “they weren’t dangerous conditions. They were safe for the race to proceed.”</p><p>The race, which traditionally begins on Boxing Day, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/sports/20iht-srwild.html" title="">first held in 1945</a> and has become one of the biggest events in the world of sailing.</p><p>“The Sydney to Hobart is an Australian tradition, and it is heartbreaking that two lives have been lost at what should be a time of joy,” Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister of Australia, <a href="https://x.com/AlboMP/status/1872386237182656617" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a>.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
