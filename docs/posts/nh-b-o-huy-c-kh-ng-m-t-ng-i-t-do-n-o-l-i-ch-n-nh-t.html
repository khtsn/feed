		<p>Riot has <a href="https://valorantesports.com/en-GB/news/game-changers-2025-slot-allocation-and-the-new-americas-lcq" target="_blank">announced</a> slot allocations for the 2025 Game Changers Championship, and with it the creation of the GC Americas Last Chance Qualifier. Rather than North America being guaranteed two slots, the second place teams from North America, Brazil, and Latin America will compete on LAN for the final slot at GCC.</p>

<p>Like 2024, this year&#39;s Game Changers Championship will feature 10 teams with three from EMEA, two from Pacific, and one from China. The key difference is that this year, Riot has grouped the Americas region together with four total slots. The winners of each regional GC circuit in North America, Brazil, and LATAM will qualify, while the last spot will be awarded to the winner of the Americas LCQ. This presents a new opportunity for the second place teams from Brazil and LATAM to earn the right to compete on the global stage.</p>

<p>The GC Americas LCQ will be a two-day event held in the Riot Games Studio in São Paulo, Brazil. The three participating teams will spend the first day playing a single round robin stage, and the best two teams will advance to a best-of-five match the next day to determine the winner. The date for this event has not yet been confirmed.</p>
