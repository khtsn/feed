Trump came prepared for the meeting with detailed questions for Biden, the White House press secretary said. The two met for about two hours.</p><p>Trump has named more than a dozen people to top jobs in his second-term administration, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/matt-gaetz-trump-attorney-general.html" title="">Matt Gaetz</a> as attorney general, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-tulsi-gabbard-director-national-intelligence.html" title="">Tulsi Gabbard</a> as director of national intelligence and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-defense-pete-hegseth.html" title="">Pete Hegseth as defense secretary</a>.

Now, in anticipation of the Trump administration’s push for an end to the war, the Ukrainians are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/europe/trump-ukraine-russia-peace.html" title="">focusing more on putting assurances in place to make a cease-fire hold</a>.</p><p>“The territorial question is extremely important, but it’s still the second question,” a senior Ukrainian official said. “The first question is security guarantees.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Kyiv would not formally renounce its claim over any territory, a top Ukrainian official said. But it might be willing to justify a deal in which Russia retains control over disputed land and Ukraine gains entry to NATO or secures access to a robust arsenal of weapons provided by the West.</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>Russia launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/europe/russia-missiles-ukraine-kyiv.html" title="">missile strikes today on Ukraine’s capital</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Cohen/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3e34ceba">A court rejected Netanyahu’s bid to delay his testimony</h2><p>Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-trial.html" title="">must take the stand next month</a> in his corruption trial, an Israeli court ruled. Netanyahu had sought a delay, arguing that he was too busy during wartime to prepare a defense.</p><p>Netanyahu was charged in 2019 with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. His trial began in 2020, and he has always denied any wrongdoing. The cases against him center on accusations that he arranged favors for tycoons in exchange for gifts and sympathetic media coverage for himself and his family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-182280a8">Inflation ticked up slightly</h2><p>Consumer prices <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/13/business/cpi-inflation-fed" title="">rose 2.6 percent in the year through October</a>, according to a government report released today.
