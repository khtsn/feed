    <h1>Adams Hosts Fox News at City Hall, as N.Y. Leaders Mute Trump Hostility</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The setting, not to mention the event itself, was unusual: Eric Adams, the Democratic mayor of New York City, had invited Fox News into City Hall on Wednesday for a sit-down interview.</p><p>And if anyone had a notion that he would be confrontational with the conservative network, Mr. Adams put it quickly to rest. He said Democrats had lost the presidential election because they had wasted time trying to demonize President-elect Donald J. Trump and that they had failed to address “the real needs of people.”</p><p>He characterized Mr. Trump’s chosen “border czar,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/nyregion/adams-homan-meeting-migrants.html" title="">Thomas D. Homan, as his partner</a>, said that the Biden administration’s border policy had created a “pipeline of criminality,” and offered that he would see if there was a way to get around current city laws to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into the Rikers Island jail complex.</p><p>Mr. Adams’s comments seemed so far to the right that the Fox News host who was interviewing him, Martha MacCallum, asked if he was considering rejoining the Republican Party.</p></div></div>
