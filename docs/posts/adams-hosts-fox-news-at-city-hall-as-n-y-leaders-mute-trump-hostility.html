He said Democrats had lost the presidential election because they had wasted time trying to demonize President-elect Donald J. Trump and that they had failed to address “the real needs of people.”</p><p>He characterized Mr. Trump’s chosen “border czar,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/nyregion/adams-homan-meeting-migrants.html" title="">Thomas D. Homan, as his partner</a>, said that the Biden administration’s border policy had created a “pipeline of criminality,” and offered that he would see if there was a way to get around current city laws to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into the Rikers Island jail complex.</p><p>Mr. Adams’s comments seemed so far to the right that the Fox News host who was interviewing him, Martha MacCallum, asked if he was considering rejoining the Republican Party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The mayor is hardly the only New York Democratic official who has ratcheted down the rhetorical warfare with the incoming Trump administration.</p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul has said her relationship with Mr. Trump “does not have to be adversarial” and has agreed with him on issues like border security. Attorney General Letitia James, a reliable foil of Mr. Trump who has won several cases against him in court, said she was prepared to work with “him or anybody regardless of party.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
