    <h1>Blinken to Visit Israel in Latest Push for Gaza Cease-Fire</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Blinken will have several other agenda items during his trip, including planning for the governance and security of Gaza after Israel’s military campaign in the territory ends, the State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said in the statement announcing the travel.</p><p>Mr. Biden previewed that part of Mr. Blinken’s trip on Thursday, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/10/17/remarks-by-president-biden-after-air-force-one-arrival-schonefeld-germany/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">telling reporters</a> that he had spoken with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel about it. “We’re going to work out what is the day after now — how do we secure Gaza and move on?” Mr. Biden said.</p><p>As Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/20/world/israel-hamas-yahya-sinwar-news" title="">continues to pound southern Lebanon</a> in a separate campaign against the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah, Mr. Blinken will also discuss “the need to reach a diplomatic resolution to the conflict,” Mr. Miller’s statement said.</p><p>The Biden administration has also spent more than two years <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/us/politics/biden-israel-saudi-arabia-negotiations.html" title="">pursuing a wider regional deal</a> in which Saudi Arabia and Israel would establish formal diplomatic relations for the first time if Israel committed to the creation of a Palestinian state and the U.S. entered into a security agreement with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>With Israel still fighting in Gaza, and now at war in Lebanon, the prospects for such a deal during Mr. Biden’s presidency appear slim at best. But Mr. Blinken insisted last month that it was still a realistic goal.</p></div></div>
