    <h1>G.M. Withdraws Profit Forecast as Trump Tariffs Take a Toll</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>G.M. also said on Tuesday that it made $2.8 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 7 percent from a year earlier. The company was hurt by a 14 percent drop in earnings before interest and taxes in North America, where it generates almost all of its profit. Its businesses that serve the rest of the world recorded small profits.</p><p>The company previously said it expected to make between $11.2 billion and $12.5 billion in net income for 2025, roughly double the $6 billion it made last year.</p><p>“The prior guidance cannot be relied upon,” Mr. Jacobson said.</p><p>In addition to the 25 percent tariffs on imported cars, the Trump administration has raised tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, driving up the costs of metals widely used in cars. Mr. Trump has also substantially raised tariffs on China and imposed hefty tariffs on many other countries that he later reduced to 10 percent for 90 days.</p><p>G.M. has had “productive discussions” with the Trump administration on tariffs, Mr. Jacobson said, but he declined to elaborate. “I don’t want to be viewed as trying to negotiate in public,” he said. “We look forward to getting more clarity around the tariff situation for the auto industry.”</p><p>The tariffs had a minimal impact on the company’s financial performance in the first quarter because they didn’t go into effect until April 3, Mr. Jacobson said. “The fundamentals of our business are strong,” he said.</p></div></div>
