In 1994, the group’s debut, “Definitely Maybe,” rocketed to the top of the British pop chart and became a zeitgeist-defining moment for a new wave of English rock.</p><p>But the band kept crashing down to earth, largely through the fisticuffs — verbal and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">physical</a> — of the Gallagher brothers. In 1995, a <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/364232-Oass-Wibbling-Rivalry" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14-minute unofficial CD</a> was released of Noel and Liam getting sidetracked during a journalist’s interview to bicker with each other, loudly and ruthlessly if not quite comprehensibly.</p><p>The band split up in 2009 — “I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/noel-gallagher-quits-oasis-with-great-relief-246228/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Noel said at the time</a> — and over the years the Gallaghers have continued to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/liam-gallagher-vs-noel-gallagher-oasis-brothers-beef-history-explained-206050/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lob public insults</a> at each other.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Now they seem to have reconciled sufficiently to announce a comeback tour in summer 2025, which is to include shows throughout Britain and Ireland, including at least four nights at Wembley Stadium in London. The band announced the <a href="https://oasisinet.com/home/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tour on its website</a>. In a statement, the band said plans were underway for dates on “other continents outside of Europe later next year.”</p><p>“The great wait is over,” the statement added: “Come see.” </p><p>The announcement was no surprise. Over the weekend, Oasis posted Tuesday’s date on its website and social media accounts, after days of gossip on social media and detailed reporting from anonymous “industry insiders” in the <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/music/article/oasis-reunion-and-wembley-gigs-next-year-is-that-definitely-maybe-c2spw6wm3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">British news media</a> about an imminent tour announcement. Liam Gallagher himself boosted those rumors. When one fan said he was “scared” about the news to come, Liam answered, “Your scared how do you think I feel.” Streams of the band’s catalog <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/oasis-streams-surge-globally-spotify-reunion-rumors-1236118426/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spiked in anticipation</a>.</p><p>Tickets for the shows go on sale Aug. 31.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In Britain, Oasis was a phenomenon, selling tens of millions of albums and racking up six Brit Awards, and the Gallagher brothers’ antics guaranteed constant coverage in the news media. But the band never scaled the same heights in the United States. Perhaps that was a result of its quintessential Englishness. More likely, it was self-inflicted: In 1994, when the American rock press was buzzing about Oasis, it put on a <a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/story-behind-worst-oasis-concert-of-all-time/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notoriously debauched performance</a> in Los Angeles and Noel abandoned the group for a few days.</p><p>Oasis has never won a Grammy Award. This year it was nominated for the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame for the first time but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/21/arts/music/rock-roll-hall-fame-inductees-cher-dave-matthews.html" title="">was not inducted</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Since Oasis broke up, Noel has released four albums with his group Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds. Liam has released two with his group Beady Eye, three solo albums and one with John Squire of the Stone Roses.</p><p>This week, Oasis is set to release a 30th-anniversary edition of its debut album, “Definitely Maybe,” including early tracks that the band had <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c134n75xm17o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">long considered lost</a>.</p><p>Alex Marshall<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-sisario">More about Ben Sisario</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/27/arts/music/oasis-reunion-tour.html">23</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/27/arts/music/oasis-reunion-tour.html">23</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Find the Right Soundtrack for You</h2><h3>Trying to expand your musical horizons?
