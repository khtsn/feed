The Ukrainian delegation said it would need a week to review Moscow’s proposal, delaying further discussion.</p><p>“We couldn’t react to the Russian proposals quickly,” Serhii Kyslytsia, Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister, told reporters after the talks, which lasted less than 90 minutes and took place at a historic hotel on the European side of the Bosporus.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The only concrete outcome of Monday’s talks was an agreement to exchange all gravely ill and wounded prisoners of war, as well as those under the age of 25. The total number of those prisoners is unclear. Both sides also announced a mutual agreement to exchange the bodies of 6,000 fallen soldiers each.</p><p>As with the previous meeting in Istanbul, substantive negotiations toward a peace agreement appeared to have been deferred, complicated by the two sides’ entrenched positions and the changing situation on the battlefield. Ukraine’s defense minister, Rustem Umerov, who headed his country’s delegation, said he hoped to reconvene for a new meeting before the end of June, but also made it clear that Ukraine believes progress toward a peace settlement requires a meeting of the two countries’ presidents.</p><p>“We think the further work of the delegations makes sense if it is aimed at preparing the leaders&#39; meeting,” he told reporters at the end of the talks.</p><p>The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected a meeting between Presidents Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p><p>Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian delegation, would not say if the Russians would return for another round of talks</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While Russia has rejected the idea of a truce while a long-term settlement is negotiated, Mr. Medinsky said Russia has now offered a partial cease-fire “at different parts of the frontline” for “two-three days” to help both sides recover the bodies of soldiers killed in fighting.</p><p>Moscow and Kyiv are talking under pressure from President Trump, who has alternatively cajoled and chided the leaders of both countries. But Russia and Ukraine have been holding firm, with neither expected to present conditions in the discussion that are acceptable to the other side.</p><p>As negotiations sputter, attacks on the battlefield have intensified. The Russian Army appears to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-offensive.html" title="">launched a new offensive</a>, advancing at the fastest pace since last fall and opening a new front in the northeastern Sumy region of Ukraine. It has also bombarded Ukrainian cities with some of the biggest drone and missile attacks of the war, including a barrage of 500 drones and decoys on Sunday.</p><p>Ukraine, for its part, has adapted and evolved in the face of a much larger military with deeper resources. Ukrainian drones, in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/world/europe/russia-ukraine-strikes.html" title="">ambitious, coordinated attack</a> — apparently launched from within Russia — struck air bases deep inside Russia this weekend.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Video verified by The Times showed that the assault damaged or destroyed some of the long-range bombers Russia has used to fire missiles at Ukraine<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/world/europe/russia-ukraine-strikes.html" title="">,</a> in what was described as “a black day for Russian long-range aviation” by a prominent, pro-Kremlin <a href="https://t.me/fighter_bomber/21277" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russian military blogger</a>. Moscow said that several aircraft were hit, but that the full extent of the damage has yet to be assessed.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The peace talks of recent weeks, the first since the early months of the war in 2022, have been clouded by political theatrics. Ukraine and Russia have attempted to set the tempo and terms of the talks without angering the White House, which has threatened to withdraw from the negotiations to end the war.</p><p>President Trump has accused both sides of intransigence, trying to pressure them into negotiations. Last week, following a Russian attack on Kyiv, Mr. Trump lashed out at President Vladimir V. Putin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/us/politics/trump-putin.html" title="">describing him</a> on social media as having “gone absolutely CRAZY.” Mr. Trump said that he was considering imposing additional sanctions on Moscow, but has not acted so far.</p><p>During the first round of talks in Istanbul in mid-May, top U.S. officials met with the Ukrainians and Russians separately, but left it to Turkey to mediate direct talks, making for a complicated diplomatic dance.</p><p>Afterward, the Ukrainians accused the Russians of issuing threats and provocations by saying they were ready to fight for many years and to invade more Ukrainian regions. The Russian delegation exuded confidence, saying that they were “satisfied with the results” of the talks, which they described as “organized at the initiative of Russia’s President.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In recent days, President Zelensky dampened expectations for the new round of discussions, confirming only on Sunday afternoon that a Ukrainian delegation would travel to Istanbul.</p><p>He said on Monday that Kyiv’s delegation was “ready to take the necessary steps for peace” with Russia. In remarks from Lithuania ahead of a NATO meeting, Mr. Zelensky said that those steps should begin with “a cease-fire and humanitarian actions, the release of prisoners and the return of abducted children.”</p><p>Ukraine said it submitted to Russia on Monday a list of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-children-russia-war.html" title="">Ukrainian children who were abducted</a> by Russia from occupied territory. The International Criminal Court has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/17/world/europe/icc-putin-ukraine-war.html" title="">issued arrest warrants</a> for Mr. Putin and his commissioner for children’s rights, based on the abductions.</p><p>. Mr. Medinsky, an aide to Mr. Putin who headed the Russian delegation, said Russia would study the list, while insisting that “not a single child has been kidnapped” but many Ukrainian children instead have been “rescued from a war zone.” The list includes 339 names, he said.</p><p>Tens of thousands of children have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/22/world/europe/ukraine-children-russia-adoptions.html" title="">taken from Ukraine</a> to Russia and Belarus since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, according to The Yale School of Public Health Humanitarian Research Lab, which has tracked the relocations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Released Ukrainian prisoners at a reception point in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine last month.

A senior Ukrainian official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, said its proposals included provisions for a cease-fire on land, at sea and in the air, with monitoring to be carried out by international partners.</p><p>Russia has signaled that it was not interested in a temporary cease-fire, but rather in solving the “root causes” of the war — Kremlin parlance for wide-ranging demands like a formal commitment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/nato-ukraine-sweden.html" title="">to not expand NATO eastward</a>, the recognition of its territorial gains, shrinking Ukraine’s military and other conditions that have been flatly rejected by Kyiv.</p><p>As with the first Istanbul meeting, the composition of the delegations — mostly government officials with little political leverage — suggested that Monday’s discussions remained limited in nature. The previous meeting yielded a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-prisoner-swap.html" title="">large prisoner exchange</a> but little else.</p><p>As Moscow’s troops are pushing again on the battlefield, Ukrainian officials have repeatedly expressed concerns that Russia was not interested in peace and was participating in the negotiations only to avoid alienating the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Keith Kellogg, Mr. Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, said last week that security advisers from the United States and various European countries would also attend the talks. But on Monday, Heorhii Tykhyi, a spokesman for Ukraine’s foreign minister, <a href="https://x.com/SpoxUkraineMFA/status/1929464428233121854/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a picture</a> on social media that showed part of the Ukrainian delegation meeting with what he said were representatives from European partners, Germany, Italy and the U.K.</p><p>American representatives were nowhere in sight.</p><p>Steven Erlanger<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.</p></div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
