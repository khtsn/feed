He was 91.</p><p>His daughters, Eléonore and Adeline, said that he died overnight between Sunday and Monday.</p><p>Mr. Guérard was already recognized as one of the most daring and innovative chefs in France, in 1974, when he took over <a href="https://lespresdeugenie.com/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Les Prés d’Eugénie</a>, one of the smaller, less developed properties in a chain owned by the family of his wife, Christine. Together, the couple turned the spa into a major tourist destination, despite its remote location in southwestern France, in large part because of what Mr. Guérard called “cuisine minceur,” a low-fat, no-starch, no-sugar, low-calorie application of nouvelle cuisine. (Guests could also go for the full-fat, lavish experience on the other half of the menu if they liked.)</p><p>His own efforts to lose weight at the spa, and his disgust with traditional diet dishes, inspired him to develop dishes that relied on vegetable purées combined with low-calorie fromage blanc for sauce, rather than butter and cream. Rather than sautéing in oil or butter, he steamed fish and meats in sealed containers with herbs to infuse and retain flavor.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Guérard in 2011. “The point of slimming cuisine is that it is delicious,” he once said. “You don’t feel like you’re making a sacrifice.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maurice Rougemont/Gamma-Rapho, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>He regarded traditional spa cuisine, which was imposed on him when he first visited Eugénie and needed to lose 15 pounds, as additional pain for patients already struggling with the rigors of weight-loss regimens. “The punishment was too severe to be borne,” he wrote in “Michel Guérard’s Cuisine Minceur” (1976), “evasive action had to be taken.”</p></div><div><div><p>To put pleasure back into the equation, he created dishes like mousseline of crayfish with watercress sauce, leg of milk-fed lamb cooked in wild hay, and a 60-calorie pear soufflé “as light and fragrant as hickory smoke,” in the words of the Washington Post food writer William Rice.</p><p>“The point of slimming cuisine is that it is delicious,” Mr. Guérard told the website <a href="https://www.european-food.com/interviews/michel-guerard-ive-never-created-any-dish-thinking-will-it-be-trendy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Food</a> in 2017. “You don’t feel like you’re making a sacrifice. Moreover, you eat what you need. You are not starved.” Without sacrificing flavor, he drastically pared down calorie counts. </p><p>He pulled off the neat trick of slimming down the veal stew known as blanquette de veau from the usual 1,000 calories to a slender 250 by eliminating butter, cream and egg yolks. Instead, he steamed the veal with carrots, cress, celery root and mushrooms and then whipped up a low-calorie béarnaise sauce using the cooking liquid and fromage blanc.</p><p>“My attitude towards food did not make sense to chefs at the time,” he <a href="https://time.com/4661405/michel-guerard-michelin-stars/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Time magazine</a> in 2017. “I was at worst an outcast and at best a crazy cook.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Guérard, left, with his fellow chef Paul Bocuse in 1975.

Paul Bocuse, after harboring doubts, was quoted as calling Mr. Guérard “the most imaginative of us all” in a 1975 <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1975/07/28/la-nature-des-choses" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">profile</a> of Mr. Guérard in The New Yorker. Daniel Boulud told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-les-pres-d-eugenie/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg.com</a> in 2016: “Out of all the chefs I ever worked with, Guérard had the greatest sensibility and was the most poetic. The way he engaged his cooks always led us toward a kind of creativity that was never conventional.”</p><p>Mr. Guérard’s cookbook, published in France as “La Grande Cuisine Minceur,” became a best seller there, and his growing reputation propelled him to the cover of the European edition of Time in 1976, under the headline “The New Gourmet Law: Hold the Butter.” A year later, the Michelin Guide awarded Les Prés d’Eugénie three stars, a rating it has maintained ever since.</p><p>Michel Etienne Robert-Guérard was born on March 27, 1933, in Vétheuil, about 40 miles northwest of Paris, and grew up after the age of 6 in Pavilly, outside Rouen, where his parents, Maurice and Georgine (Boulanger)<strong> </strong>Robert-Guérard ran a butcher shop. He attended the Lycée Pierre Corneille, a secondary school in Rouen, but left at 16 to become an apprentice pastry chef under a prestigious caterer, Kléber Alix, in Mantes-la-Jolie, 35 miles northwest of Paris.</p><p>After completing his military service in the Navy, which he spent cooking for an officers’ mess in Cherbourg, he found work as a pastry chef at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris and in 1958 passed the grueling series of tests required for the title Meilleur Ouvrier de France (finest craftsman in France). At the time, he was the youngest chef to have received that honor. Soon after, he left the Crillon to work at Le Lido, a splashy cabaret and restaurant frequented by international celebrities.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In 1965, Mr. Guérard bought a tiny rundown bistro, which he renamed the Pot-au-Feu, in Asnières-sur-Seine, just outside Paris. The neighborhood was dodgy. In the early days, he sold sandwiches to workers at a nearby rivet factory. The clientele included a fair share of gangsters.</p><p>Encouraged by his friend Jean Delaveyne, a wildly inventive chef who inspired a number of nouvelle cuisine chefs, he created what he called an “alchemist’s laboratory.” He scandalized critics by pouring a vinaigrette over foie gras in his signature <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY0Nl4-y5PI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">salade gourmande</a>, much copied and popularly known as “crazy salad.” Saltwater fish steamed under seaweed, later a feature at Eugénie-les-Bains, also originated at the Pot-au-Feu.</p><p>“I was never satisfied until I had an answer to everything,” he told The New Yorker in 1975. “I always asked myself, Why am I doing this and that? Once I knew, there seemed no point in more reading. I closed all the cookbooks. I crossed the border and went my own way.”</p><p>The Pot-au-Feu was awarded a Michelin star two years after opening and a second star in 1971. The Gault-Millau guide called it “the best suburban bistro in the world.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Guérard in 2013.

She died in 2017. In addition to his daughters, who run the family spa business, the Chaîne Thermale du Soleil, he is survived by three grandchildren.</p><p>Mr. Guérard undertook a number of side ventures over the course of his career. In the late 1960s, the singer and nightclub impresario Régine Zylberberg invited him to run the kitchen at her Russian-themed cabaret Le Réginskaïa; she later brought him to New York to direct the kitchen at Régine’s. In the late 1970s, he worked with the research and development department of Nestlé to develop frozen entrees, notably a fish version of the flaky almond pastry known as a pithivier and deluxe ice creams. He created a specialty food store, Le Comptoir Gourmand, opening branches in Paris and Lyon before setting up shop in Bloomingdale’s, in New York, in 1981.</p><p>Mr. Guérard was the author of “La Cuisine Gourmande” (1978). “Mémoire de la Cuisine Française” (2020), a book based on a series of interviews conducted by Benoît Peeters, was published in 2020. In 2013 he created a school, the <a href="https://www.institutmichelguerard.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Institut Michel Guérard</a>, to provide <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXKQV733sPI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">training</a> in the principles of healthy cooking.</p><p>He remained at the stove well into his 80s, constantly revisiting and revising his menus. “When I’m brushing my teeth, when I’m driving my car,” he told Bloomberg, “I’m always thinking of new dishes.”</p><p>Alex Traub<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>21</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Michel Guérard, 91,  Who Cut the Calories  In Haute Cuisine, Dies<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
