He told investigators that he had been planning the attack for a year, according to an F.B.I. affidavit.</p><p>The attack may <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/us/jewish-community-attacks-boulder-colorado.html" title="">intensify deep unease</a> in the Jewish community in the United States. In recent months, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/dc-shooting-jewish-museum-israel-embassy.html" title="">two Israeli embassy aides were murdered</a> in Washington, and a man <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/cody-balmer-motive-arson-gaza-palestinian-shapiro.html" title="">set fire to the residence of Gov. Josh Shapiro</a> of Pennsylvania, who is Jewish.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-43c14c97">Who was attacked?</h2><p>According to an F.B.I. affidavit, Mr. Soliman yelled “Free Palestine” and threw to two lit Molotov cocktails on marchers who were participating in a weekly event called <a href="https://run4lives.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Run for Their Lives</a> that is held in cities around the world. It is intended to call attention to the hostages taken by Hamas militants in the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel.</p><p>Eight people were burned, the affidavit states. The victims — four men and four women ranging in age from 52 to 88 — were hospitalized with injuries ranging from minor to serious. At least two of them were flown by helicopter to a burn unit in Denver.</p><p>After Mr. Soliman was arrested, investigators found a plastic container that held at least 14 unlit Molotov cocktails made from wine bottles and Ball jars as well as a weed sprayer filled with gasoline, the F.B.I. affidavit states.</p><p>Video verified by the news agency Storyful showed a man, shirtless and holding two bottles, shouting while patches of grass burned in front of the county courthouse and bystanders helped injured people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Lisa Effress, who was eating lunch nearby, said that she ran to the scene and saw smoke, people who were half-dressed and dazed, and discarded clothes that had been used to extinguish flames. “It was horrible,” she said.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-6"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="boulder-attack-map" data-id="100000010202002" data-source-id="100000010202002"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Boulder, Colo., Evacuation Area</h2><p data-testid="leadin" id="interactive-leadin">The Boulder Police Department asked people to stay out of this part of the city&#39;s downtown in response to the attack on Sunday.</p></header></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-4df57769">Who is the suspect?</h2><p>Mr. Soliman, 45, was taken into custody after witnesses pointed him out. He was <a href="https://bouldercolorado.gov/news/attack-pearl-street-8-victims-identified" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">booked on multiple felony charges</a> in the Boulder County Jail on Sunday.</p><p>In an interview with state and federal investigators, Mr. Soliman said he had been planning the attack for a year and that he wanted to “kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the FB.I. affidavit states.</p><p>Mr. Soliman told investigators that he wanted to stop the group from “taking over ‘our land,’ which he explained to be Palestine,” the affidavit states. He said he lives in Colorado Springs, Colo., and has a wife and five children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that Mr. Soliman was in the United States illegally, having entered in August 2022 on a tourist visa from Egypt and stayed past the visa’s expiration in February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022, said the spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin.</p><p>The initial charges against Mr. Soliman listed on the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office website included two first-degree murder charges, but it was not immediately clear why he was being charged with murder, given that the police said that no one was killed. He was being held on a $10 million bond.</p><p>There was no immediate indication that Mr. Soliman was linked to any particular group or network, according to Mark D. Michalek, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Denver field office.</p><h2 id="link-6058a55c">How have officials responded?</h2><p>President Trump said <a href="https://x.com/realdonaldtrump?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> that such attacks “WILL NOT BE TOLERATED” and he criticized former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for letting Mr. Soliman into the country, although he came legally on a tourist visa, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Trump has a long history of using violent crimes to build support for his restrictionist immigration policies.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a statement that the assailant had attacked in “cold blood” and called on U.S. authorities to prosecute the perpetrator to the fullest extent possible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Describing the attack as an act of antisemitism, Mr. Netanyahu said: “This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews.”</p><p>Mayor Aaron Brockett of Boulder said in an interview on Sunday night that he was outraged and saddened by the attack. “These were Jewish community members who were on a march for peace and for hostage return, and they were brutally attacked,” he said. “It’s disgusting and appalling.”</p><p>Alexandra E.
