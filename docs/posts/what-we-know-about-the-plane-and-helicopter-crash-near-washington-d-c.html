Operations to recover the fuselage from the river and additional bodies were expected to continue into Saturday, officials said.</p><p>American Eagle Flight 5342, operated by PSA Airlines for its parent carrier, American Airlines, had taken off from Wichita, Kan., carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. The collision occurred in clear skies as the plane approached Ronald Reagan National Airport around 9 p.m. on Wednesday.</p><p>The helicopter, a UH-60 Black Hawk with a three-person crew, had been on a military training flight, the Army said. The helicopter was supposed to be flying in a different location and at a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/army-helicopter-dc-plane-crash.html?smid=url-share" title="">lower altitude</a>, according to four people who were briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>On Friday, Reagan National Airport said that about 100 flights had been canceled that day as the airport operated at reduced capacity. The recovery operations have forced two of the airport’s three runways to close.</p><p>Among the victims were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/figure-skaters-dc-plane-crash.html?smid=url-share" title="">figure skaters</a> from the United States and Russia who had attended the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita.</p><p>Here is what to know about the crash.</p><h2 id="link-53b3c3b3">No survivors were found.</h2><p>Dark, cold and windy conditions made the search for bodies more difficult after the crash.</p><p>By midday Friday, 41 sets of remains had been recovered from the passenger plane and one from the helicopter, Chief John Donnelly of the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department in Washington said at a news conference. Twenty-eight victims had been identified, and 18 families had been notified, he said.</p><p>The jet, a Bombardier CRJ700, was nearly full when it crashed. To recover the remaining bodies, crews will need to retrieve the fuselage from the river, Chief Donnelly said. Todd Inman, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said at a news conference on Friday that salvage operations would continue on Saturday.</p><p>Army officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/army-helicopter-crew.html?" title="">identified two of the three aviators</a> onboard the helicopter: Staff Sergeant Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Ga., and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Md. A third aviator was not identified at the request of her family.</p><h2 id="link-55081f58">The collision caused an explosion.</h2><p>The collision was captured in a <a href="https://www.earthcam.com/usa/dc/?cam=dc_kennedycenter" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video from a live webcam</a> operated by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a few miles north of the crash site.</p><p>The collision resulted in an explosive fireball followed by a trail of smoke. Before the crash, the plane had been on approach to Runway 33 at Reagan National Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said.</p><p>The plane’s fuselage, inverted and broken in three sections, was found in waist-deep water, officials said. The debris was spread across an area of less than a mile, according to the Fire Department in Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-676cfa89">An F.A.A. report raised questions about staffing at the air traffic control tower.</h2><p>Staffing at the air traffic control tower was “not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,” said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/plane-crash-washington-dc/staffing-was-not-normal-at-airport-tower-according-to-a-preliminary-faa-report?smid=url-share" title="">a preliminary F.A.A. safety report</a>, which was reviewed by The New York Times.</p><p>A controller was performing jobs typically assigned to two controllers: handling helicopters in the airport’s vicinity and also instructing planes that were landing and departing from runways.</p><p>Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said at a news conference there had not been a “breakdown” in communication between the two aircraft and the control tower.</p><p>“This was not unusual with a military aircraft flying the river and aircraft landing at DCA,” he said, referring to the code for Reagan Airport. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and the F.A.A. would analyze the debris, he said.</p><p>The moments before the collision appeared to have been captured in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/air-traffic-audio-dc-plane-crash.html?smid=url-share" title="">audio recording</a>, according to LiveATC.net, which streams air-traffic control radio transmissions. In the recording, an air traffic controller is heard instructing the helicopter to pass behind the jet.</p><p>Shortly before the collision, the plane’s pilots were asked to pivot its landing route from one runway to another, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/jet-pilot-plane-crash-runway.html?smid=url-share" title="">according to a person briefed on the event</a> and conversations between an air traffic controller and the pilots overheard on audio recordings.</p><p>The helicopter was operating out of Davison Army Airfield in Fort Belvoir, Va., south of Washington.</p><p>It was taking part in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/plane-crash-washington-dc" title="">annual proficiency training flight</a> with a “fairly experienced crew” operating with night-vision goggles, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a <a href="https://x.com/DeptofDefense/status/1884968646092464600" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video statement.</a></p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board said it had recovered two so-called black boxes from the plane — a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder — that may offer insights into the final moments before the crash.</p><p>Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican of Kansas, said in a post on X that the F.A.A. had indefinitely shut down all low-altitude helicopter flights near Reagan National Airport. Mr. Moran, who is on the Senate subcommittee on aviation operations, safety and security, added that he expected the restrictions to be in effect until the investigations were complete.</p><p>The closures were confirmed by a second person who was briefed on them. An F.A.A. spokesman said the agency could not comment.</p><h2 id="link-13656b53">Figure skaters and hunters were among the plane’s passengers.</h2><p>Figure skaters, their family members and their coaches were among those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/plane-crash-victims-washington-dc.html?smid=url-share" title="">onboard the plane</a>, according to U.S. Figure Skating, the American governing body for the sport.</p><p>Russian nationals, including figure skaters, were also onboard. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/europe/russian-figure-skaters-dc-plane-crash-vadim-naumov-yevgeniya-shishkova.html?smid=url-share" title="">Among them</a> were the married skating champions Yevgeniya Shishkova, 52, and Vadim Naumov, 55, according to the Skating Club of Boston. They worked as coaches in the United States.</p><p>Two skaters from New England — Spencer Lane, 16, of Barrington, R.I., and Jinna Han, 13, of Mansfield, Mass. — were also killed. Their mothers, Christine Lane and Jin Han, also died.</p><p>A group of friends who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/plane-crash-washington-dc#friends-returning-from-a-hunting-trip-were-among-the-passengers" title="">had spent days</a> in Kansas on a hunting trip were also on the plane. Michael Stovall of Maryland was flying with at least six of his friends after the trip, said his cousin Shawna Slarb.</p><p>Kiah Duggins, who was set to become a law professor at Howard University next fall, also died in the crash, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFeQhzquwcD/?igsh=MXhkOG8xczJhOHJxMg%3D%3D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the university.</a></p><p>Officials had not <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/plane-crash-victims-washington-dc.html?smid=url-share" title="">released</a> a list of the victims.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Mark Walker<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jack Healy<!-- --> <!-- -->Julie Bosman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jenna Russell<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jesus Jiménez<span>  </span>and <!-- -->Mitch Smith<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
