In the email, she told Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bezos that the shift for the opinion section “threatens to break the trust of readers that columnists are writing what they believe, not what the owner has deemed acceptable.”</p><p>“Will’s decision to not to run the column that I wrote respectfully dissenting from Jeff’s edict — something that I have not experienced in almost two decades of column-writing — underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,” she wrote.</p><p>Ms. Marcus’s resignation from The Post came on the same day that Matt Murray, the newspaper’s executive editor, laid out his vision for the newsroom in an email to staff members. (The newsroom of The Post operates separately from its opinion department.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Murray, who joined the newspaper as its executive editor last year, said in his email that he was separating the production of the print newspaper from the rest of The Post and changing the way its newsroom was organized.</p><p>“The Post needs to evolve with reader habits, new opportunities, and technological developments, particularly the smart use of A.I. as it continues to develop and dramatically reshape users’ experiences of news,” Mr. Murray wrote.</p><p>The Post’s national desk, an important center of gravity at the newspaper, is being broken up into two departments, with one focusing on politics and government and one on reporting across the United States. Mr. Murray also said each department would have a senior editor focused on audience growth and visuals.</p><p>“Text will no longer be a default and length no more a measure of quality,” Mr. Murray wrote.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
