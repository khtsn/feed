    <h1>Biden and Harris Made a Joint Appearance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>President Biden and Kamala Harris appeared together in Maryland this afternoon for their first public event since Biden ended his bid for re-election. They were there to celebrate the results of a legislative accomplishment: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/us-to-announce-prices-for-first-drugs-picked-for-medicare-negotiations.html" title="">landmark price negotiations</a> that are expected to lower the cost of prescription drugs.</p><p>More than anything, however, the event felt like the passing of the Democratic torch. Biden, who is seeking to cement his legacy, trumpeted his decades-long push to lower drug prices. But there was no doubt that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/harris-biden-drug-prices-medicare.html" title="">Harris was the main attraction</a>.</p><p>The vice president coaxed the energetic crowd into chanting “thank you, Joe,” after articulating the real-world impact of Biden’s signature health care policies in a way that the president has struggled to. When Harris was done and Biden began to speak, the crowd began to filter out of the venue.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>We took <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/biden-2024-election-dropped-out.html" title="">an inside look at the real reasons Biden decided to end his campaign</a>.</p><p><strong>Here’s what else to know:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The candidates for vice president, Tim Walz and JD Vance, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/walz-vance-vp-debate-cbs.html?smid=url-share" title="">agreed to debate each other</a> on Oct. 1.</p></li><li><p>Donald Trump is seeking to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/nyregion/trump-delay-sentencing-election.html" title="">delay his criminal sentencing</a> in Manhattan until after the election.</p></li><li><p>Democrats are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/harris-walz-democrats-language.html" title="">leaning into the language of Republicans</a>, and themes like liberty, to argue that Republicans threaten fundamental freedoms.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Do you have questions about the election? </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/2024-election-questions.html?te=1&amp;nl=the-evening&amp;emc=edit_ne_20240802" title="">Send them to us, and we’ll find the answers</a>.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The body of a Russian soldier was found in the rubble of a Russian border post on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-6b92cc33">Ukraine said it had captured a Russian town</h2><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that Ukrainian troops <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/europe/russia-ukraine-airfields-kursk.html" title="">had taken full control of the Russian town of Sudzha</a>.
