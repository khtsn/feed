Nvidia dominates the market for chips used in building artificial intelligence systems and will now require a license sell A.I. chips to China. It raises the possibility that the company’s sales to China will evaporate in the coming months, bringing an end to a business that has contracted as the United States has curbed chip exports to its geopolitical rival.</p><p>In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, Nvidia said it will take a $5.5 billion hit because of piles of chips it will not be able to sell or orders it won’t be able to fill.</p><p>Nvidia’s stock was down about 6 percent in after-hours trading.</p><p>Stock market benchmarks in Japan and China fell about 1 percent on Wednesday. Share prices were down 2.5 percent in Hong Kong and nearly 2 percent in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/china-taiwan-tariffs-chips.html" title="">Taiwan</a>, a hub of global chip manufacturing. The maker of most of the world’s advanced chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which gets a lot of business from Nvidia, dropped 2.5 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the United States, S&amp;P 500 futures, which let investors bet on how the index might perform when trading begins in New York, were down 1 percent.</p><p>On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.2 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq also posted a slight loss. Positive quarterly results in the banking sector and signs that the United States was making progress on a trade deal with Britain helped stabilize stocks on Tuesday.</p><p>President Trump’s whipsawing tariff policies are still driving sentiment in global markets, especially in sectors facing the threat of more levies or potential reprieves.</p><p>A survey by Bank of America showed that global investors have cut their U.S. stock holdings by a record amount in the past two months, and that the potential for a recession spurred by Mr. Trump’s trade war poses a major risk to markets.</p><p>Tripp Mickle<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-ltd">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on U.S.-China Relations</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Pursuing Activists Abroad: </strong>The U.S. fired a new round of sanctions at China, targeting Chinese and Hong Kong officials over what it described as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/asia/china-hong-kong-sanctions.html">acts of transnational repression</a> for their crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and on U.S. soil.</p></li><li><p><strong>Export Restrictions</strong><strong>: </strong>The Trump administration added 80 primarily Chinese companies and organizations to a list of companies that are barred from buying American technology and other exports because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/business/economy/trump-chinese-tech-firms-chips-security.html">national security concerns</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Consulting Firm Employees Freed: </strong>China has released five employees of an American corporate investigations firm, the Mintz Group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/china-mintz-release-us.html">two years after they were detained</a> as part of a crackdown by Beijing on foreign business consultancies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Panama Canal Deal: </strong>Beijing’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/business/trump-panama-canal-china-hong-kong.html">threat to stop a tycoon’s sale</a> of his ports business has dealmakers wondering if they can still operate without political interference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Voice in Beijing:</strong> Senator Steve Daines of Montana, one of President Trump’s top allies in Congress, has cast himself as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/world/asia/trump-china-xi-daines.html">an intermediary between the Trump administration and Beijing</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>China Says It Offers Stability: </strong>China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, cast his country as a bulwark for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/asia/china-tariffs-us-trump.html">peace and stability in a world thrown into chaos by the Trump administration</a>, even as Beijing provokes its neighbors and fuels trade tensions.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
