Trump’s criminal case in Manhattan postponed his sentencing until after Election Day, a significant victory for the former president as he seeks to overturn his conviction and win back the White House.</p><p>In a ruling on Friday, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, rescheduled the sentencing for Nov. 26. He had previously planned to hand down Mr. Trump’s punishment on Sept. 18, just seven weeks before Election Day, when Mr. Trump will face off against Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency.</p><p>While the decision will avert a courtroom spectacle in the campaign’s final stretch, the delay itself could still affect the election, keeping voters in the dark about whether the Republican presidential nominee will eventually spend time behind bars.</p><p>It is unclear whether sentencing Mr. Trump in September would have helped or harmed him politically; his punishment could have been an embarrassing reminder of his criminal record, but could have also propelled his claims of political martyrdom.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Justice Merchan’s decision came at the request of Mr. Trump, who had asked to delay the sentencing until after the election, partly so he had more time to challenge his conviction. Prosecutors working for the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, who brought the case, had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/trump-sentencing-delay.html" title="">deferred to the judge</a>, paving the way for at least a brief postponement.</p><p>The judge’s decision to push the proceeding is likely to infuriate Mr. Bragg’s liberal supporters and fuel accusations that Mr. Trump is above the law, shielded from the consequences of conviction, unlike any other felon. To avoid that impression, left-leaning legal scholars — and Trump critics seeking catharsis — wanted Justice Merchan to hold the former president accountable promptly after he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/nyregion/trump-convicted-hush-money-trial.html" title="">convicted in May</a> of falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal.</p><p>Mr. Trump, the first former American president to become a felon, faces up to four years in prison. Justice Merchan, however, could impose a shorter sentence or only probation.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s request to postpone posed an unparalleled predicament for the judge, whose decision came despite earlier efforts to treat Mr. Trump as he would any other defendant.</p><p>Mr. Trump, of course, was no ordinary defendant: He hurled insults at the judge, sought to oust him from the case and leveled personal attacks on Justice Merchan’s daughter, a Democratic political consultant. On Justice Merchan’s part, he propelled the case forward for more than a year — even as Mr. Trump sought to thwart it at every turn — and imposed a gag order on the former president that barred him from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge’s own family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Justice Merchan, a veteran judge who once vowed to apply “the rules of law evenhandedly,” was an unlikely deliverer of relief for the former president. Yet his ruling on Friday marked just Mr. Trump’s latest success in dragging out his varied legal entanglements, a strategy that has paid off in all four criminal cases looming over the former president.</p><p>In the Manhattan case, the only one of the indictments that has reached a trial, Mr. Trump’s lawyers spent months building a web of legal challenges that influenced, and at times contradicted, one another. There were pleas for delays. Requests to throw out the case. And long-shot maneuvers to switch the case to federal court.</p><p>Justice Merchan had already delayed the sentencing once at Mr. Trump’s request, at the beginning of the convoluted process. Mr. Trump’s lawyers wanted to push back the sentencing, originally scheduled for July 11, so that Justice Merchan could consider their request to overturn the conviction based on a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-immunity.html" title="">granting him broad immunity</a> for official actions as president. Justice Merchan agreed to take up their request and to move the sentencing to Sept. 18.</p><p>But when Justice Merchan announced plans to rule on the immunity bid on Sept. 16, two days before the sentencing, Mr. Trump’s lawyers demanded yet another delay. The lawyers, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, had argued that the judge’s timetable was too compressed.</p><p>The delay will spare Mr. Trump a distraction — and humiliation — at a critical moment. Ms. Harris’s entry into the presidential race in July upended the campaign and erased the former president’s lead in the polls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a letter filed with the court, Mr. Trump’s lawyers implied that holding his sentencing just weeks before Election Day on Nov. 5 could improperly influence voters.</p><p>“By adjourning the sentencing until after that election — which is of paramount importance to the entire nation,” Mr. Trump’s lawyers said, “the court would reduce, even if not eliminate, issues regarding the integrity of any future proceedings.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Juan M.

Cohen, made shortly before the election. Mr. Trump eventually repaid Mr. Cohen, who became a star witness at the trial. And the former president, the jury found, carried out a scheme to use the false records to hide the nature of the reimbursement.</p><p>Soon after his conviction, Mr. Trump intensified his strategy of delay, which is something of a legal forte for the former president.</p><p>Mr. Trump had succeeded in postponing his Manhattan trial by three weeks, while managing to indefinitely delay trials in Washington and in Georgia, where he is accused of plotting to subvert democracy by refusing to accept his 2020 election defeat. (The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling stems from the Washington case.) Separately, a federal judge in Florida <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/us/politics/trump-document-case-dismissed.html" title="">dismissed the case</a> in which Mr. Trump was charged with mishandling classified documents.</p><p>Other stratagems failed. Mr. Trump recently sought to move his Manhattan case to federal court, his second attempt to do so. This time, he cited the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. But like his first attempt, it failed, with the judge again rejecting Mr. Trump’s argument that the case involved his official acts as president.</p><p>“Nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,” the federal judge, Alvin K. Hellerstein, wrote in his opinion, which Mr. Trump is appealing.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Protess is an investigative reporter at The Times, writing about public corruption.
