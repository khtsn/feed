offering veteran officeholders and up-and-comers alike the chance to speak to — and be seen by — an entire nation.</p><p>At the Democratic National Convention this week in Chicago, five of those rare slots will go to a group that most likely would be unfamiliar to previous convention planners: social media influencers.</p><p>Convention officials said each night would include at least one influencer. The speakers are Deja Foxx, Nabela Noor, Carlos Eduardo Espina, Olivia Julianna and John Russell, a group of millennial and Gen Z influencers who, collectively, have well over 24 million social media followers.</p><p>They will speak on the same podium as President Biden; the Democratic nominees, Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota; and party luminaries, including two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, among others.</p></div></div><div><p>“This feels very affirming,” said Ms. Foxx, 24, a reproductive rights activist from Arizona who worked on Ms. Harris’s first presidential campaign. She’ll speak about abortion rights on Monday night in a program that will also feature Mr. Biden. “I don’t take it lightly that I’m speaking on the same night as the president of the United States,” she said.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Amber Rose spoke on the first day of the Republican National Convention.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>These speakers represent a significant shift for the convention and underscore the Democratic Party’s efforts to speak to voters whose news diet exists outside traditional media. Last month, a conservative influencer, the actress and model Amber Rose, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/politics/donald-trump-hiphop.html" title="">spoke on the first night</a> of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.</p><p>The speaker roster at conventions tends to mix elected officials with entertainment figures and regular citizens who can speak to particular policy issues. The Republicans’ convention last month featured a number of people the party called “Everyday Americans,” who discussed topics including immigration, inflation and crime.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/15/more-americans-are-getting-news-on-tiktok-bucking-the-trend-seen-on-most-other-social-media-sites/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study by the Pew Research Center last year</a> found that almost half of Americans get some of their news from social media and that a third of adults under 30 get their news from TikTok. </p></div></div><div><div><p>To help chase those potential voters, the D.N.C. has, for the first time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/us/politics/joe-biden-donald-trump-2024-campaign-tiktok.html" title="">granted credentials</a> to more than 200 influencers, offering them the kind of wide-ranging access to events and people traditionally provided only to the press. It’s also giving them a special “creator platform” within the convention venue in Chicago, the United Center: a special V.I.P. box directly above the arena floor.</p><p>Providing influencers time onstage gives them the chance to repost clips of their speeches to their own social media accounts as well as the feeds of other influencers watching the show, all in pursuit of the modern media era’s most valuable prize of all: virality.</p><p><strong>“</strong>Content creators are a vehicle to reach new audiences, not just through their content, but through their unique ability to speak authentically to their own communities,” said Emily Soong, a spokeswoman for the convention.</p><p>Ms. Foxx said she was first approached by organizers a few weeks ago and has since worked with a campaign speechwriter to hone her presentation. “I was pretty nervous but now I’m feeling really ready,” she said. “I’ve been running through my speech every day.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nabela Noor has 11 million social media followers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The lineup on Tuesday night will include Ms. Noor, a Muslim American known for her makeup tutorials, cooking videos and frank talk about her challenging journey to motherhood. With more than 11 million followers spread across TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, she will speak on a night whose theme, “A Bold Vision for America’s Future,” is meant to draw contrasts between the Harris-Walz ticket and their Republican rivals, Donald J. Trump and Senator JD Vance of Ohio.</p></div><div><p>For Wednesday’s program, Mr. Espina, the son of Latin American immigrants who has amassed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/business/media/carlos-espina-tiktok.html" title="">huge following on TikTok</a> with his videos about news, politics, food and soccer, will talk about immigration. Although he normally posts in Spanish, he is expected to deliver his remarks in English.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Olivia Julianna has gained followers in part from her involvement in Gen-Z for Change.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vivien Killilea/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>That night will also include Ms. Julianna, <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/activist-olivia-julianna-21-future-for-democrats-abortion-rights" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who has called herself</a> “a plus-size queer Latina from rural Southeast Texas” and gained a following from her involvement in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/19/climate/young-climate-activists.html" title="">Gen-Z for Change</a>, a youth-oriented political activism group. Her top issues include climate change and, like Ms. Foxx, abortion access.</p><p>“Peer to peer organizing is one of the most powerful tools we have in our democracy,” said Ms. Julianna, whose speech topic will be “freedom.” For years I’ve spoken directly to my fellow young Americans through my social media pages, knocking doors for Democratic candidates, and rallying for fundamental freedoms across the country.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>During the convention’s final night, which organizers are describing, thematically, as a narrative about how the 2024 election is a fight “for our future,” Mr. Russell, a self-described “dirtbag journalist” will have a chance to speak.</p><p>Based in West Virginia, he worked on rural policy and engagement for Senator <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/03/elizabeth-warren-iowa-2020-1351098" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign</a> in 2020, ran unsuccessfully for Congress, and has built a following on his progressive coverage of the industrial Midwest and his strong support of labor unions. In his social media bios, he describes himself as “biased for the working class.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ken Bensinger covers right wing media and national political campaigns for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ken-bensinger">More about Ken Bensinger</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="NYT_BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" data-testid="region"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2024-election-footer-carousel" data-id="100000009577677" data-source-id="100000009577677"><div>
