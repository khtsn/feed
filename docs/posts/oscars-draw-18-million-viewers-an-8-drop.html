That is an 8 percent drop from the 19.5 million who watched last year.</p><p>The audience decline ends a three-year streak when Oscar ratings had been on the rise.</p><p>The decline follows a trend among other award shows, which have seen their ratings growth come to a halt this year. The Grammy Awards attracted 15.4 million viewers last month, a 9 percent decline <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/business/media/grammy-awards-ratings.html" title="">from the year before</a>. The Golden Globes in January also saw a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/business/media/golden-globes-ratings.html" title="">modest decline</a> from last year.</p><p>ABC said the Oscars had grown 3 percent among adults under the age of 50.</p><p>ABC broadcast the Oscars on Sunday, as it has for decades, but the show also streamed live on Hulu, which helped boost viewership.</p><p>The livestreaming experience, however, was far from perfect. There were <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/hulu-down-oscars-livestream-disney-1236307568/#recipient_hashed=4294811532854b5f7bb0629896c8a3aa9f5dbc26d4107e91bb4c75feeb2770a5&amp;recipient_salt=b90f9be8b878098266c78ed7d737d39ce0669ff65923c30070c5aa4cb1a6c7eb&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_campaign=Deadline_BreakingNews&amp;utm_content=590821_03-02-2025&amp;utm_term=2011488" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">glitches at the beginning</a> of the show, and some subscribers did not <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/hulu-oscars-stream-cuts-off-final-two-awards-1236308521/#recipient_hashed=4294811532854b5f7bb0629896c8a3aa9f5dbc26d4107e91bb4c75feeb2770a5&amp;recipient_salt=b90f9be8b878098266c78ed7d737d39ce0669ff65923c30070c5aa4cb1a6c7eb&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_campaign=Deadline_BreakingNews&amp;utm_content=590959_03-02-2025&amp;utm_term=2011488" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">see the finish</a>, when their feed was abruptly cut off shortly before the best actress and best picture awards were given out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Thank you for watching!” read the on-screen message. “This live event has now ended. You may exit playback and select something else to watch.”</p><p>Still, even with this year’s decline in audience, the Oscars will be among the highest-rated entertainment shows of the year. And, perhaps more significant, the Oscars will go another year as the most-watched live awards show, continuing to best the Grammys.</p><p>The show, which was hosted by Conan O’Brien, received mostly good reviews. Vanity Fair <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/conan-obriens-brilliantly-emceed-oscars-2025-was-the-best-ceremony-in-years" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said it</a> was “the best ceremony in years,” although Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/oscars-review-conan-o-brien-anora-timothee-chalament-1236324874/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a> that “the telecast felt too small for Hollywood’s biggest night.”</p><p>The ceremony was also long: It clocked in at nearly four hours.</p><p>Sunday’s Oscars came nowhere close to the box office firepower of last year’s telecast, which was fueled by “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie.” “Anora” took home best picture on Sunday night, one of its five Oscar wins. But with that win, “Anora” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/business/oscars-hollywood-culture-politics.html" title="">secured a record</a> for having the lowest domestic ticket sales in best picture history, outside of the pandemic.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
