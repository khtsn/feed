A British Airways plane that landed at Heathrow on Friday afternoon after a short flight from nearby Gatwick Airport was the first to touch down there since the fire began around 11:20 p.m. local time on Thursday.</p><p>Heathrow’s chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, described the outage and disruption as “unprecedented” and said officials would prioritize flights that had been stranded in Europe. On Saturday, “we expect to be back in full operation,” he told Sky News.</p><p>An average of more than 220,000 passengers a day traveled through the airport last year, on flights offered by dozens of airlines to more than 230 destinations around the globe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><h2 id="link-4def39ff">The problem began with a nearby fire.</h2></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Heathrow said the power outage was caused by a fire at an electrical substation supplying the airport.</p><p>The London Fire Brigade said it was called to the fire, in western London, around 11:20 p.m. on Thursday. About 150 people were evacuated from the area. The fire was under control by around 6:30 a.m., the fire brigade said.</p><p>Counterterrorism specialists are involved in the investigation, given the location of the substation and the impact on critical national infrastructure, London’s Metropolitan Police said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Britain’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband, told LBC Radio that so far “there’s no suggestion there is any foul play.”</p><h2 id="link-53c95102">When will Heathrow reopen?</h2><p>Repatriation flights and relocating aircraft were expected to be the first flights to land at the airport as operations resumed on Friday evening, an airport spokeswoman said. Passengers should not go to the airport without first checking with their airline.</p><h2 id="link-1e4d305e">The ripple effects are global.</h2><p>Heathrow’s closure was expected to affect at least 1,351 flights in and out of the airport, according to Flightradar24, a flight tracking website. As the closure was announced early Friday, 120 aircraft were in the air heading to Heathrow.</p><p>Some were diverted to other airports, including London Gatwick Airport, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, Flightradar24 said. Others turned back to the airports they had left.</p><p>As many as 290,000 people scheduled to fly to or from Heathrow could be affected by the closure, said Mike Arnot, a spokesman for the aviation analytics firm Cirium.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>British Airways said eight of its long-haul flights would depart from Heathrow on Friday evening, so some customers can make their way to the airport.</p><p>It could take several days for airlines to rebook passengers.</p><p>British Airways said it was giving customers who had booked travel to or from Heathrow over the weekend the option to rebook for free for a later date.</p><p>Of the eight flights scheduled to leave Kennedy International Airport in New York for Heathrow on Friday, five have already been canceled, according to departure boards at Kennedy. All eight arriving flights from Heathrow were canceled.</p><p>A spokesman for United Airlines said that most of the airline’s 17 scheduled flights to Heathrow Airport are expected to depart late Friday evening, arriving on Saturday morning.</p><h2 id="link-6d81be33">Britain’s laws protect many travelers facing disruptions.</h2><p>Airlines are required to look after travelers who are departing Britain on any airline or arriving there on a European Union or British airline. Travelers whose flights are canceled should be offered a choice of a refund or alternate travel arrangements at the earliest opportunity, according to Britain’s <a href="https://www.caa.co.uk/passengers-and-public/resolving-travel-problems/delays-and-cancellations/cancellations/#:~:text=Under%20UK%20law%2C%20airlines%20must,the%20cost%20of%20your%20calls)" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Passengers who choose to travel at another time must be provided with a reasonable amount of food or drink, accommodation if the new flight does not depart until the next day, and transportation to and from the accommodation.</p><p>Passengers whose flight has been canceled or diverted should check with their airline on its policies.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
