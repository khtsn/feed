The armed group Hamas, which is based in Gaza and allied with Hezbollah, said that one of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/05/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon/771666d8-35c5-50c9-9494-af3a45b30bc4?smid=url-share" title="">commanders had been killed</a> in the strike. Hours later, Israel said it had also killed a second high-ranking Hamas commander in Lebanon.</p><div><p>The Israeli military <a href="https://t.me/idfofficial/10829" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said it</a> had struck “weapons storage facilities, command centers and additional terrorist infrastructure” near the capital, Beirut. That appeared to refer to the Dahiya, an area where Hezbollah holds sway and where clouds of smoke were seen rising on Saturday.</p><p>A huge Israeli strike around the same area earlier in the week targeted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/world/middleeast/hashem-safieddine-hezbollah-leader.html" title="">Hashem Safieddine</a>, the presumed successor of Hassan Nasrallah, the recently assassinated leader of Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militia. It was not clear whether Mr. Safieddine had been killed.</p><p>As Israel kept up its campaign, Hezbollah on Saturday fired what Israel’s military said was an estimated 90 rockets into northern Israel, and sirens sounded across border towns, the Galilee region, and as far south as Haifa. Most of the rockets appeared to have been intercepted by air defense systems, and there were no reports of injuries.</p><p>Concern has been building over whether the broadening war would further draw in Iran, which supports both Hamas and Hezbollah and launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/world/middleeast/israel-retaliate-iran-missile-attack.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">a barrage of ballistic missiles</a> at Israel earlier in the week. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Friday that Iran could carry out additional attacks on Israel “if necessary.”</p><p>Here is what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Iranian diplomacy:</strong> Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, arrived in Syria early Saturday, according to Iranian state media. Mr. Araghchi appears to be on a diplomatic tour, and on Friday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/world/middleeast/iran-lebanon-gaza-ceasefire.html?smid=url-share" title="">visited Beirut</a> in an apparent effort to convey Iran’s readiness to support a joint cease-fire in Lebanon and in Gaza.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza evacuations:</strong> The Israeli military announced a new evacuation warning in the Gaza Strip for the first time in several weeks, advising residents of Nuseirat and Bureij in the central part of the enclave to flee. Israel has largely been focused on Lebanon since September, although in August it issued evacuation warnings in Gaza that covered roughly 250,000 people.</p></li><li><p><strong>American death:</strong> The State Department said it was “aware and alarmed” about reports of the death in Lebanon of <a href="#michigan-father-lebanon-airstrike" title="">Kamel Ahmad Jawad</a>, an American citizen. His family said in a statement this week that Mr. Jawad, who was from Dearborn, Mich., had been killed in an Israeli airstrike.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strikes in Lebanon: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/05/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon/bab3c17b-9129-560f-8c16-1da25dca7fb9?smid=url-share" title="">Israeli airstrikes again rocked the Dahiya late on Saturday night</a>. Many have already fled the cluster of densely packed neighborhoods south of Beirut, and search and rescue operations have been hampered in recent days by the continued bombardment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Weapons for Israel: </strong><a href="#macron-calls-for-halting-weapons-to-israel-for-gaza-conflict" title="">President Emmanuel Macron of France said on Saturday</a> that shipments of weapons to Israel that could be used in Gaza should be halted. “Lebanon cannot become another Gaza,” he added.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="25" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2I5OTc5MmM5LWVjMzItNTE0My05OWZiLTk5ZDNjMzY4NzE5OQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/05/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon#iranian-news-media-asks-where-is-top-quds-forces-commander-general-esmail-ghaani" data-source-id="100000009744467"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farnaz-fassihi"><img alt="Farnaz Fassihi" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-05T23:27:37.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 5, 2024, 7:27 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>As Iran awaited a potential counter strike from Israel on Saturday, senior officials and members of the Iranian news media were all asking a similar question: Where is Brig. Gen. Esmail Ghaani, the country’s top general and the commander in chief of its elite Quds Forces?</p><p>Officials in Iran have not yet given a clear answer, Iranian media reported.</p><div><p>“Public opinion is awaiting news that our general is alive and well,” said Tabnak, an Iranian news site. Another news site, Shahreh Khabar, published a long biography of the general’s decades of service as a veteran of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.</p><p>The Quds Force is the branch of the Guards that is tasked with external operations, including overseeing militant groups that Iran supports in the region, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, militia groups in Iraq and Syria as well as Hamas in Gaza. The network is regionally known as the “axis of resistance.”</p><p>The concerns about General Ghaani followed reports in some Israeli and Arab media on Saturday that he was either killed or injured in one of Israel’s recent attacks on Beirut. The Guards has yet to issue a statement confirming General Ghaani’s whereabouts.</p><p>General Ghaani, 67, was last seen publicly at the Tehran offices of Hezbollah, two days after Israel killed the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Lebanon, according to photos posted by Iranian media. The general was notably absent on Friday when Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, led a prayer service commemorating Mr. Nasrallah.</p><p>Three Iranian officials said General Ghaani had traveled to Beirut last week to meet with senior Hezbollah officials and to help the group recover from the wave of Israeli attacks in Lebanon. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and asked that their names not be published.</p><p>Iran launched nearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share" title="">200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday in retaliation</a> for the killing of Mr. Nasrallah and for the assassination in Tehran of Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh. Israel has vowed to retaliate.</p><p>Iranian military officials said on Saturday that all the country’s armed forces had been placed on the highest alert, anticipating Israeli strikes. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, in Damascus on Saturday, <a href="https://x.com/araghchi/status/1842598201309970813" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned in a post on X</a> that Iran’s response to any Israeli attack would be “stronger, and they can put our determination to that test.”</p><p>A member of the Guards stationed in Beirut who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive information said that the silence from senior Iranian officials about General Ghaani was creating panic among rank-and-file members. </p><p>General Ghaani is known for his stern and cold demeanor. He has been assiduous in following through on the projects started by his predecessor Gen. Qassem Suleimani, integrating Iranian-backed armed groups in different countries so that they operate cohesively and are self-sufficient in manufacturing weapons, such as missiles and drones, with the training and help of Iran.</p><p>The United States assassinated General Suleimani in 2020 in Iraq.</p><p>Iranian media has called on officials to confirm the general’s whereabouts. “If General Ghaani is alive and well, the best way to clarify and assure us that he is well is to publish a short video of him,” said Tabnak.</p><p>Alissa J.

France is not currently delivering any weapons to Israel, he said.</p><div><p>“I think we are not being heard,” he said of calls for a cease-fire, adding “and I consider it a mistake, also for Israel’s security.”</p><p>Later on Saturday, at a summit of French-speaking countries, Mr. Macron announced that 88 Francophone countries voted unanimously to call for a cease-fire in Lebanon as part of a commitment to de-escalate tensions in the region. The United States, Egypt, Qatar and other countries have spent months trying to cobble together a cease-fire in Gaza, but they haven’t been able to get Hamas and Israel to agree. </p><p>A U.S. and French-led effort to establish a temporary cease-fire in Lebanon stalled as well.</p><p>In a statement late Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel dismissed France’s call to stop selling Israel weapons for the war in Gaza.</p><p>“Shame on them,” he said, pointing to both France and other Western nations who have called for arms embargoes against Israel. He added, “Let me tell you this, Israel will win with or without their support.”</p><p>In response to Mr. Netanyahu’s statement, the French presidency issued a statement late Saturday reiterating France’s support for Israel.</p><p>“An immediate cease-fire is necessary in both Gaza and Lebanon to halt the escalation of violence, free the hostages, protect the population and find the political solutions necessary for the security of Israel and everyone else in the Middle East,” the statement read, adding, “France is Israel’s unwavering friend. Mr. Netanyahu’s words are excessive and unrelated to the friendship between France and Israel.”</p><p>Israel launched a ground operation earlier this week into Lebanon that targeted Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed group. Hezbollah began firing on northern Israel on Oct. 8 in solidarity with its ally Hamas in Gaza. After a year of tit-for-tat rocket fire exchanges, the fighting has expanded far beyond the Israeli-Lebanese border as Israel targets Hezbollah’s military infrastructure and many of its top commanders. Hezbollah fired an estimated 130 rockets into Israel on Saturday, the Israeli military said.</p><p>Israel has come under increasing international pressure to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza and Lebanon. The United States in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/07/us/politics/israel-biden-arms.html" title="">May suspended the export</a> of U.S.-made 2,000-pound bombs to Israel to prevent the U.S.-made weapons from being used in a long-threatened assault on the city of Rafah. Officials said they were not needed by the Israelis and their use could lead to wide civilian casualties.</p><p>Those concerns have continued as Israel has ramped up attacks on Lebanon, where hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced.</p><p>At the International Francophone Organization summit in Paris, Mr. Macron said that France will host an international conference later this month to provide humanitarian aid for Lebanon.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMjgwZTE3MWYtNjk4ZC01YjA3LTgyZGQtMDNiYWY2MDQzYTFh"><div id="280e171f-698d-5b07-82dd-03baf6043a1a" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/05/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon#280e171f-698d-5b07-82dd-03baf6043a1a"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward"><img alt="Euan Ward" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/08/reader-center/author-euan-ward/author-euan-ward-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/08/reader-center/author-euan-ward/author-euan-ward-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/08/reader-center/author-euan-ward/author-euan-ward-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-05T21:01:11.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 5, 2024, 5:01 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>One of the strikes just ignited a massive fireball, sending thick black smoke billowing through the air.

When the impact of an airstrike knocked him down while he was on the phone with his daughter, he got back up, found his phone and told her he needed to finish praying. Then, he got back to helping others, the family added.</p><div><p>That was his last day alive. Mr. Jawad, an American citizen, husband and father, and resident of Dearborn, was killed on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. during an Israeli airstrike, his family said.</p><p>“I would often ask him if he was scared, and he repeatedly told me that we should not be scared because he is doing what he loves the most: helping others live in the land he loved the most,” his daughter Nadine Jawad, a Rhodes scholar and Stanford medical school graduate, wrote in the statement.</p><p>When Mr. Jawad’s wife was reached on Friday, she said the family declined to comment further.</p><p>The airstrike was part of Israel’s intense bombardment and ground invasion in Lebanon, intended to target Hezbollah forces in that country and stop Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel. The military campaign has caused widespread destruction and displacement. At least 1,600 people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">have been killed</a> by the airstrikes, and over 1.2 million people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/04/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon?smid=url-share#here-are-the-latest-developments" title="">have been displaced</a> across the country, according to Lebanese authorities.</p><p>A State Department representative wrote in a statement on Friday evening that it had confirmed that Mr. Jawad was a U.S. citizen and that it was “aware and alarmed” of reports of his death.</p><p>“We extend our condolences to the family,” the statement said.</p><p>His friends and family described Mr. Jawad as a man deeply committed to his faith and to helping others, especially through his frequent trips to Lebanon, where he quietly paid off debts of people living there and supported those without the means to flee. He was also known for his devotion to his family — he is survived by his wife and four children — and his passion for soccer.</p><p>“He was this old-school, legendary father figure,” said Hussain Makke, 33, a preacher and teacher of Islamic sciences. Mr. Makke said he was living with his parents in London after his home in Lebanon was destroyed.</p><p>Mr. Makke stayed with Mr. Jawad’s sister in Dearborn several years ago. Mr. Makke’s father was also friends with Mr. Jawad and completed the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, with him.</p><p>Hamzah Raza, another friend of Mr. Jawad’s who is living in Maryland, described him in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=27340496238867487&amp;id=100000014390804&amp;mibextid=WC7FNe&amp;rdid=DuJvK0Nv9n3nYXKC" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> on social media as someone who loved people and loved helping people.</p><p>Mr. Raza, 27, a religious studies Ph.D. student, recalled in his post how, a week before Mr. Raza went to Lebanon, he told Mr. Jawad that he wanted to buy some books there.</p><p>Mr. Raza wrote that Mr. Jawad told him, “Just send the names of the books and I will get them for you. I want you to have as much time as you can seeing the country.”</p><p>As the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated, so, too, did Mr. Jawad’s efforts to help people in Lebanon, Mr. Makke said.</p><p>He added that during a recent series of Israeli airstrikes, Mr. Jawad saved his nephew, who was one of Mr. Makke’s students at a seminary in southern Lebanon. Mr. Jawad’s nephew did not have any family in the area, and Mr. Jawad drove to him and took the nephew to Beirut, perhaps saving his life, Mr. Makke said.</p><p>Mr. Makke said that a video taken from that experience shows Mr. Jawad laughing and smiling, even though the two were driving under airstrikes.</p><p>“He made it into an action movie,” he said. “He knew how to keep morale high, to not feel scared.”</p><p>But while Mr. Jawad also could have flown home, he chose to remain behind: “In his last days, he chose to stay near the main hospital in Nabatieh to help the elderly, disabled, injured and those who simply couldn’t financially afford to flee,” the statement from his family said.</p><p>His family noted in the statement that Mr. Jawad’s death was one of many across the Middle East.</p><p>“The fact that he was an American citizen should not make his story more important than others,” his daughter wrote.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.omprakash.org/global/lebanese-diaspora-relief-org-/crowdfund/emergency-assistance-for-lebanon--a-tribute-to-hajj-kamel-ahmad-jawad?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZoUG093_j2OAECxUfgGdwIBJSbtleFj0BPE_NCn-v4AVhusPztfJc6mD0_aem_fu3u87SjvvOPWUlf7w3ZEw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a fund-raiser</a> in Mr. Jawad’s memory, he sent a voice note to his children before his death.</p><p>“Peace be upon you,” he told them. “Everything is OK, but if something happens to me, your duty is to the poor.”</p><p>Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> and <!-- -->Sheelagh McNeill<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzA4M2YyMzAzLTY1ZGQtNWRiNS1iOTcwLWNmMTc1NTBmOGQxMQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/05/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon#us-strikes-yemen-houthis" data-source-id="100000009742280"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni"><img alt="Ephrat Livni" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ismaeel-naar"><img alt="Ismaeel Naar" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-04T20:52:05.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 4, 2024, 4:52 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke rises after strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Osamah Abdulrahman/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The United States Central Command said on Friday that it struck Houthi targets in Yemen, including “Houthi offensive military capabilities,” in an effort to secure international waterways.</p><p>The Iranian-backed Houthi militia in Yemen has been striking ships in the Red Sea in solidarity with Hamas, another Iranian-backed militia, since last year, disrupting commercial shipping.

It’s doing so not just in the south, where its ground invasion is seeking to halt Hezbollah’s rocket fire into northern Israel, but also with its systematic targeting of Hezbollah’s remaining leadership, whose movements Israeli intelligence apparently still track.</p><p>Many people in Lebanon and the broader Middle East had long feared that such a war was coming, even before the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. Hezbollah began firing on northern Israel soon after in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah last fought an inconclusive war with Israel in 2006, and, given Iran’s support for Hezbollah, concern had built over time that they would soon be at war again.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lebanese men on motorbikes ride along the destroyed streets in the Dahiya, south of Beirut, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>After nearly a year of tit-for-tat strikes, as both groups tested the tolerance of the other side, Israel dramatically escalated the confrontation.</p><p>Three weeks ago, Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/lebanon-explosions-radios.html" title="">detonated thousands of Hezbollah’s pagers and walkie-talkies</a>, killing scores of people and injuring thousands.

While the attacks drove Israelis from their homes, they did not put pressure on the military. Hezbollah’s leaders did not want to start a new war with Israel, U.S. officials assessed at the time.</p><p>Since the Israeli campaign against Hezbollah began last month, the group has not launched a major counterattack on Israel, much less opened an offensive front. Israeli and U.S. officials say Israel has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/politics/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-airstrikes.html" title="">destroyed half of the militia’s arsenal</a> and killed many of its leaders.</p><p>Israeli troops moved into southern Lebanon this week, after a nearly monthlong bombing and sabotage campaign that included a strike that killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">Hassan Nasrallah</a>, the leader of Hezbollah.</p><p>Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas, unleashed a missile barrage against Israel on Tuesday in response to the killing of Mr. Nasrallah. But most of the missiles were shot down or failed to do any real damage.</p><p>The failure of Hezbollah or Iran to meaningfully damage Israel, at least so far, is a telling sign of Mr. Sinwar’s miscalculation, American officials said.</p><p>Isolated and in hiding in Gaza, Mr. Sinwar’s communication with his organization has become strained. He stopped using electronic devices long ago and stays in touch with his organization through a network of human couriers, according to Israeli and American officials.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A poster of Mr. Sinwar at a Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon, in August.

Israeli forces are now in just a few positions in Gaza, including what they call the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-philadelphi-corridor-gaza.html" title="">Philadelphi Corridor</a> between the enclave and Egypt. While Israel has not launched a major raid into civilian areas of Gaza for weeks, it still conducts daily airstrikes targeting Hamas.</p><p>As a result, the toll on civilians in Gaza continues. In a 24-hour stretch on Wednesday and Thursday, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/03/world/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah/israeli-strikes-killed-99-over-24-hours-gaza-health-officials-say-one-of-the-highest-tolls-in-months?smid=url-share" title="">Israeli military killed 99 Palestinians in the enclave,</a> local health officials said, one of the highest death tolls in months.</p><p>Talks to broker a cease-fire in Gaza and release the Israeli hostages have broken down. Mr. Netanyahu has added demands and revived some that had previously been dropped, frustrating international negotiators. And Mr. Sinwar has become far more inflexible, U.S. officials say.</p><p>His actions and motivations have long been a focus of the American intelligence community. But after Oct. 7, the spy agencies intensified their work on the Hamas leader, forming a targeting cell to study and hunt him.</p><p>For months, intelligence agencies have assessed that Mr. Sinwar has a fatalistic attitude and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/world/middleeast/gaza-war-hamas-yahya-sinwar.html" title="">cares more about inflicting pain on Israelis than helping Palestinians</a>. U.S. officials will not discuss their recent intelligence collection on him, but the view that his attitude is hardening comes from officials studying his negotiating stances and classified reports.</p><p>Mr. Sinwar’s position stiffened this summer after Israel assassinated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-dead.html" title="">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, the political leader of Hamas based in Qatar and one of the chief negotiators. Mr. Haniyeh was a more conciliatory negotiator who was interested in making a deal, and U.S. officials say he was willing to push back against Mr. Sinwar’s more extreme demands. Israel’s decision to kill a top Hamas leader who was negotiating a cease-fire infuriated the group and Mr. Sinwar, according to U.S. officials.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ismail Haniyeh, center, a top Hamas leader, in Tehran in July.

U.S. and Israeli officials acknowledge there is no definitive proof of life. There have been no audio or video recordings from him for months.</p><p>On Sept. 13, Hezbollah released a letter that Mr. Sinwar sent in support of Mr. Nasrallah. Some Hamas officials, speaking elliptically, suggested that it was written outside Gaza by someone else, with Mr. Sinwar’s approval. It was not handwritten, unlike other communications that have been verified to come directly from him.</p><p>But American officials said they had no evidence he was dead, and in fact senior U.S. officials said they thought he was alive and making critical decisions for Hamas.</p><p>Mr. Sinwar remains in hiding but appears to recognize that Israeli forces are closing in on him. They came near his position in August, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of Israel saying that their forces had discovered signs that the Hamas leader had spent time in the warren of tunnels beneath Rafah, in southern Gaza.</p><p>“When we entered the tunnels under Rafah, where the hostages were murdered, we found signs of Sinwar’s past presence in Tel Sultan,” Mr. Gallant told reporters recently, referring to six hostages who were believed to have been killed in a neighborhood of Gaza, near Rafah.</p><p>While Mr. Sinwar’s strategy is not yet working, it could ultimately succeed.</p><p>Israeli forces are fighting Hezbollah on its home territory in southern Lebanon. While the Israeli government is promising a limited incursion in Lebanon, so far the military operations have been large-scale.</p><p>The fighting has already proved difficult: At least nine soldiers were killed in the first days of close-quarter combat. If the intense fighting continues, and Iran is drawn in, Mr. Sinwar could get his wish of a multifront war that eases pressure on Hamas. </p><p>Iran and Israel could continue to trade ballistic missile strikes. If one weapon causes immense damage, a larger conflict might erupt.</p><p>American officials are waiting to see whether the conflict between Iran and Israel escalates further. They do not believe that Iran wants a full-scale war with Israel or to directly intervene to help Hamas. But they also publicly support a planned Israeli strike against Iran in retaliation for the ballistic missile attack this week.</p><p>“Iran will hold a grudge for Nasrallah’s killing,” said Scott D. Berrier, a retired lieutenant general and the former head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency. “But their options are limited. I don’t see Iran going toe to toe with Israel anytime soon.”</p><p>A senior U.S. official said Iran’s actions over the past few months had sent a clear message to Mr. Sinwar: “The cavalry is not coming.”</p><p>Julian E.
