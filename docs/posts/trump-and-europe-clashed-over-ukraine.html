    <h1>Trump and Europe Clashed Over Ukraine</h1>

But on the topic of Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/politics/trump-macron-ukraine.html" title="">the divergence between the two leaders was evident</a>.</p><p>Trump refused to call Vladimir Putin a dictator, as he has described Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and falsely claimed that the U.S. had spent three times as much as Europe on the war. He demanded that Ukraine sign over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/europe/ukraine-us-mineral-wealth-deal.html" title="">hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue from natural resources</a> to the U.S., without mentioning Russian concessions. </p><p>Macron corrected Trump’s assertions about European aid, made clear that Russia — not Ukraine — was to blame for the war, and insisted that any truce “must not mean a surrender of Ukraine.”</p><p>The meeting came on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/europe/ukraine-war-anniversary-zelensky.html" title="">third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine</a>. Several European leaders acknowledged the day by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/europe/europe-ukraine-anniversary.html" title="">visiting Kyiv and pledging their support</a>. Meanwhile, Trump suggested that his negotiations with Putin could end the fighting “within weeks,” and said that he might visit Moscow if a peace deal were reached. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The U.S. also angered its European allies by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/middleeast/us-un-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">voting against a resolution</a> at the U.N. General Assembly that condemned Russian aggression and called for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The Americans were joined by Russia, Belarus and North Korea.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>There are many ways to measure the cost of three years of war. One is the death toll: It is estimated that more than 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers and 150,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. My colleague Kim Barker, however, looked at the war <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/europe/ukraine-prisoner-of-war.html" title="">though the story of Olha Kurtmallaieva</a>, a young cancer patient whose husband is in a Russian prison. </p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-68d98d5d">Musk’s threat to federal workers split Trump’s team</h2><p>This past weekend, federal workers were told that they had until midnight tonight to respond to an email from Elon Musk ordering them to justify their jobs or face termination. This afternoon, the government’s personnel department clarified that it was just a “voluntary” request. Yet, nearly simultaneously, Trump called Musk’s effort “ingenious” and said, “If you don’t answer, you’re sort of semi-fired or you’re fired.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/politics/elon-musk-email-federal-workers.html" title="">Confusion reigned</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next chancellor, in Berlin yesterday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hannibal Hanschke/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Roberta Flack in 1969. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jack Robinson/Hulton Archive, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-4afff2c3">The virtuoso Roberta Flack died at 88</h2><p>Roberta Flack, the magnetic singer and pianist whose intimate blend of soul, jazz and folk helped her rule the charts in the 1970s, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/arts/music/roberta-flack-dead.html" title="">died today at 88</a>.
