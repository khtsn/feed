Antarctica, by contrast, remained comparatively under the radar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But more than a century after explorers raced to plant flags in the frigid polar desert, countries are once again starting to openly vie for influence in the region.</p><p>The area is governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, which <a href="https://www.ats.aq/e/antarctictreaty.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mandates</a> that “Antarctica shall be used for peaceful purposes only.” The Cold-War era pact and subsequent agreements aimed to make Antarctica a military-free zone and manage competing territorial claims.</p><p>For decades, the system largely succeeded in establishing an international consensus for the region, according to a 2023 <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/great-power-competition-comes-south-pole" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based research institute.</p><p>Many nations have long-established or new facilities on Antarctica conducting scientific research, some of which could also be used to explore the region’s strategic and commercial potential. Competition to do so has quietly intensified in recent years, and looks likely to continue doing so, according to the report.</p><p>The Antarctic’s harsh environment and the treaty system have constrained access to its resources, but the region has a rich marine environment and potential reserves of oil, gas and minerals. The barren landscape is also a good spot for countries to place technology with military applications.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Russia has <a href="https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/western-intelligence-fears-new-russian-sat-nav-espionage-capabilities/#:~:text=Parallel%20to%20upgrading%20the%20GLONASS,to%20one%20Western%20intelligence%20source." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increased</a> efforts to build monitoring stations for GLONASS, its version of the Global Positioning System, which has <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/great-power-competition-comes-south-pole" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experts</a> say also have military use. At least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/29/world/countries-rush-for-upper-hand-antarctica.html" title="">three</a> Russian stations were already operating in Antarctica in 2015.</p><p>China in 2023 announced <a href="https://spacenews.com/china-to-build-satellite-ground-stations-in-antarctica/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plans</a> to build new satellite stations in Antarctica, another project with potential military applications.</p><p>The treaty bans mining in the region, protecting small reserves of iron ore, coal and chromium. Estimates vary greatly, but the region could also hold vast reserves of oil and natural gas. To the dismay of environmentalists, China and Russia are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/02/china-russia-team-up-krill-fishing-restrictions-antarctica" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pursuing</a> loosened restrictions on krill fishing.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/29/world/countries-rush-for-upper-hand-antarctica.html" title="">Facets</a> of the treaty that involve environmental protections will be up for review in 2048, but could be undermined before then.</p><p>Some signatories of the Antarctic treaty have also staked territorial claims — a number of which overlap — while others do not recognize the territorial claims of other countries. Chile is one of the few countries claiming territory, and it has installed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/world/americas/chile-antarctica-villa-las-estrellas.html" title="">a permanent settlement called Villa Las Estrellas</a>.</p><p>Chile sought to strengthen its territorial claims in May 2024, holding a meeting with defense officials in the Antarctic as a symbol of sovereignty amid <a href="https://apnews.com/article/chile-russia-antarctica-science-polar-argentina-oil-minerals-climate-change-7dcf5bfd3d38baada0eeebc199500ef0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tension</a> over Russia’s reported geological surveys in the Weddell Sea, an Antarctic region off South America’s southernmost tip.</p><p>Simon Romero<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
