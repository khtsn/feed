    <h1>Newsom to Meet With Trump as He Seeks Federal Aid for Fire Relief</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom of California headed to Washington on Tuesday to meet with President Trump and seek disaster aid for Los Angeles communities destroyed in last month’s firestorms, his latest attempt to mend ties with the White House as other Democrats have grown increasingly alarmed by the new administration.</p><p>Mr. Newsom and Mr. Trump, who have sparred publicly but also worked closely together during the president’s first term, were scheduled to meet at the White House on Wednesday, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.</p><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold disaster aid if California does not change how it manages its water, a perennially charged issue in an arid state where officials have to balance the needs of agriculture, ecosystems and thirsty cities. The president has also said that he wanted California to enact a voter identification law in order to obtain federal funding that would help Los Angeles recover from the wildfires.</p><p>Last month, wind-swept wildfires in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles and Altadena, Calif., killed 29 people and left thousands of homes in ashes. Mr. Trump almost immediately blamed Mr. Newsom and other Democratic leaders in California for the destruction and referred to the governor as “Newscum.” It is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars to rebuild the damaged communities.</p></div></div>
