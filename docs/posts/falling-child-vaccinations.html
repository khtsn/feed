Immunization rates against polio, whooping cough and chickenpox fell similarly.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>And there have been far more precipitous drops in some states, counties and school districts.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>States, not the federal government, set vaccine mandates. But the incoming Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/health/rfk-jr-vaccines-hhs.html" title="">could encourage anti-vaccine sentiment</a> and undermine state programs. The president-elect’s pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/caroline-kennedy-rfk-jr-vaccines.html" title="">has spread the false theory</a> that vaccines cause autism, among other misinformation.</p><p>Already, falling vaccination rates have followed a partisan pattern.</p><p>There are two ways vaccination rates can drop: More families can get an exemption, which gives them legal permission to skip vaccines; or more families can fail to vaccinate their children without permission.</p><p>In states that supported Donald Trump for president, the number of children receiving exemptions rose. The story with noncompliance is more complex. It rose in both blue and red states, although more in red states. (An unknown amount of noncompliance reflects families that did vaccinate their children but didn’t file the paperwork verifying they’d done so.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Surveys reveal <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/05/16/americans-largely-positive-views-of-childhood-vaccines-hold-steady/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new and deep partisan division</a> on this issue. In 2019, 67 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Gallup</a> that childhood immunizations were “extremely important,” compared with 52 percent of their Republican counterparts. Five years later, the enthusiasm among the Democratic grouping had fallen only slightly, to 63 percent. For Republicans and G.O.P. leaners, it had plunged to 26 percent.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Lawmakers in red states have tried to roll back school vaccine mandates, but most changes have been minor: Louisiana <a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1382696" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">required</a> schools to pair any mandate notifications with information about exemption laws; Idaho <a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:ID2024000H597&amp;ciq=ncsl&amp;client_md=c6485bdcee0600cd3bb876269bf7f69e&amp;mode=current_text" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">allowed</a> 18-year-old students to exempt themselves; and Montana <a href="https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/2021/billpdf/HB0334.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stopped collecting data</a> from schools on immunizations.</p><p>The decline in vaccination seems likely to have consequences. “Herd immunity,” in which unvaccinated children can’t easily spread measles because others are protected, requires about 92 percent inoculation. The further rates fall, the more likely an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/feb/05/-sp-watch-how-measles-outbreak-spreads-when-kids-get-vaccinated" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outbreak becomes</a>.
