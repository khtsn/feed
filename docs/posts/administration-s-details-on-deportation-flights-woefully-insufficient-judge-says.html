Boasberg, was the closest he has come to the possibility of holding the administration in contempt.</p><p>Judge Boasberg gave the Justice Department until Tuesday to explain itself and lay out clearly why he should find that administration officials had not violated his order stopping the deportation flights under the powerful wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act. Three flights of immigrants were sent to El Salvador on Saturday, two of them under the act’s authority.</p><p>Judge Boasberg’s angry order was the latest turn in his nearly weeklong effort to get the administration to tell him — under seal, if needed — what time the two planes departed the United States, what time they left American airspace and what time they landed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He originally instructed the Justice Department to provide him with that data by noon on Wednesday. He then extended that deadline by another day after department lawyers asked for more time as they considered whether to invoke a rare doctrine called the state secrets privilege in an effort to get out of turning over the information.</p><p>On Thursday, the government filed court papers to Judge Boasberg under seal, but hours later he revealed in his order that the papers “repeated the same general information about the flights” that department lawyers had already given him in previous court filings and hearings.</p><p>“The government again evaded its obligations,” he wrote, adding that the Justice Department’s filing was “woefully insufficient.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
