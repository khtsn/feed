    <h1>Administration’s Details on Deportation Flights ‘Woefully Insufficient,’ Judge Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The order by Judge Boasberg, the chief judge in Federal District Court in Washington, was the latest turn in his nearly weeklong effort to get the administration to tell him — under seal, if needed — what time the two planes departed the United States, what time they left American airspace and what time they landed.</p><p>He originally instructed the Justice Department to provide him with that data by noon on Wednesday. He then extended that deadline by another day after department lawyers asked for more time as they considered whether to invoke a rare doctrine called the state secrets privilege in an effort to get out of turning over the information.</p><p>On Thursday, the government filed court papers to Judge Boasberg under seal, but hours later he revealed in his order that the papers “repeated the same general information about the flights” that department lawyers had already given him in previous court filings and hearings.</p></div></div>
