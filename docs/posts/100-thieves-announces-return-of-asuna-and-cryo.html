</span> has <a href="https://x.com/100T_VAL/status/1986161728863019230" target="_blank">announced</a> the returns of <span data-ref-id="1">Peter		&#34;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/601/asuna">Asuna</a>&#34;

		Panganiban</span>.</p>

<p>Both players were allowed to explore their options as a part of the organization&#39;s full rebuild, which saw it release or move everybody to the inactive roster, including six players and three members of the coaching staff.</p>

<p>Asuna&#39;s would-be departure came at a crossroads both for the player and the organization. The end of the 2025 season marked Asuna&#39;s fifth year with 100T, one of the longest-running loyalties in all of professional Valorant. Since joining from <span data-ref-id="3">

</span> in late 2020, Asuna has been a key figure in 100T Valorant, mostly playing as the team&#39;s Duelist player in that time but also filling onto the Initiator role, namely on KAY/O, Gekko, and Skye. The 2026 season will mark his sixth season with 100 Thieves.</p>

<p>Of the departing players, Cryocells, or Cryo, was the second-longest tenured player. He joined in late 2022 ahead of the team&#39;s inaugural season of Valorant&#39;s partnership era. He joined after a standout year with <span data-ref-id="4">

</span>, which in 2022 grew into one of the world&#39;s strongest pre-partnership teams. On XSET, he played alongside players like <span data-ref-id="5">

</span>. Since joining 100 Thieves, Cryo has split duties as the team&#39;s Duelist with Asuna, while also filling in as the team&#39;s secondary Controller.</p>

<p>The mass release entering the 2025 offseason came as a result of 100 Thieves falling short of expectations. After lifting one regional title and reaching the international stage in 2024, 100 Thieves entered 2025 with very little change. Controller player <span data-ref-id="8">
