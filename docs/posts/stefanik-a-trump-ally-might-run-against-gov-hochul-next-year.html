But in late March, the president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/stefanik-trump-cabinet.html" title="">asked her to withdraw</a> because of concern about how her open seat might affect Republicans’ minuscule voting margin in the House.</p><p>The congresswoman’s allies said on Wednesday that in the weeks since, Republicans in Washington and New York had urged her to challenge Gov. Kathy Hochul, and she is taking steps to explore that possibility. They believe that Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, is vulnerable and that Ms. Stefanik could put the state in play.</p><p>The congresswoman, 40, stoked speculation about a potential candidacy in a speech Tuesday night as she accepted an award from New York Republicans. The speech, at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, focused heavily on state issues, with Ms. Stefanik discussing pension debt, New York City’s congestion pricing plan and quality of life in Buffalo and Rochester.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Afterward, Ms. Stefanik <a href="https://x.com/bern_hogan/status/1912550810392670602" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told NY1</a> that she was “honored” to be considered for the role, and less than 24 hours later, she blasted out a statement mocking Ms. Hochul’s latest poll numbers.</p><p>“We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fire Kathy Hochul once and for all,” Ms. Stefanik told NY1. “For so long, Democrats have had one-party rule in Albany, and it has caused a decaying of our state.”</p><p>The people familiar with her thinking, who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations, said Ms. Stefanik would also consider taking another role in Mr. Trump’s administration (the president has suggested he might find her another post) or maintaining her leadership position in the House. She has seriously considered running for governor before, in 2022, before deciding to pass.</p><p>A spokesman for Ms. Stefanik declined to comment on her plans on Wednesday.</p><p>A statewide race would be an uphill battle for Ms. Stefanik. New York has not elected a Republican governor since 2002, and Democrats expect to be able to capitalize on a midterm backlash against Mr. Trump.</p><p>First elected to Congress at age 30 as a Harvard-educated moderate, she has spent years <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/us/politics/elise-stefanik.html" title="">reinventing herself</a> in the mold of Mr. Trump — often adopting positions out of step with her home state. She repeated Mr. Trump’s conspiracy theories about a “rigged” 2020 election and opposes New York’s abortion laws, among other stances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Hochul did not comment on a possible Stefanik candidacy. But Democrats said on Wednesday they would relish facing the congresswoman.</p><p>“New Yorkers want nothing to do with the clown show of Trump loyalists who are only focused on enabling Trump’s agenda that is raising costs, gutting health care and attacking New Yorkers’ freedoms,” said Addison Dick, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party.</p><p>Republicans do have some reasons for optimism. They have slowly been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/democrats-house-ny.html" title="">making gains in the Empire State</a>. The party’s 2022 nominee, Lee Zeldin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/nyregion/hochul-governor-new-york.html" title="">came within six points</a> of beating Ms. Hochul.</p><p>Since then, Ms. Hochul has struggled to improve <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-state-of-new-york-april-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York voters’ dim</a> view of her and her accomplishments. Fellow Democrats, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/nyregion/antonio-delgado-governor.html" title="">Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado</a> and Representative Ritchie Torres, are mulling their own primary challenges to her.</p><p>Just 39 percent of registered voters approve of Ms. Hochul’s job performance, according to <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-state-of-new-york-april-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent poll</a> from Marist University. The same survey found that 57 percent of residents do not want her to run for re-election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Stefanik is not the only Republican considering running against Ms. Hochul. Representative Mike Lawler, a Hudson Valley congressman who represents a Democratic-leaning district, and Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, have also teased potential runs. Both men have recently won competitive races against Democrats in the kind of suburban areas that could swing a statewide race.</p><p>If she ran, though, Ms. Stefanik would most likely become the Republican front-runner. She has national name recognition, a close relationship with Mr. Trump and a track record of outperforming him in her sprawling North Country district. </p><p>“Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is GREAT!!!” the president <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114347490565859534" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted Wednesday morning on social media</a>, not long after she appeared on CNBC to discuss the Trump administration’s fight with Harvard.</p><p>She is also popular with Republicans in New York, where she has dedicated considerable resources to congressional swing races.</p><p>Gerard Kassar, the chairman of the state Conservative Party, called her “well qualified, well known, and a consummate New Yorker,” and said that he would welcome her entry into the race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Edward F. Cox, the Republican state chairman, declined to comment.</p><p>Neither Mr. Lawler nor Mr. Blakeman would say directly whether they would run against Ms. Stefanik, if she got into the race.</p><p>Mr. Lawler simply called her “a powerful leader” and said “the process will play out to ensure that Republicans have the strongest candidate possible.”</p><p>Mr. Blakeman, in a statement, said New Yorkers were “yearning for new leadership and are rejecting dangerous Democrat policies and leadership” but said he was focused on his own re-election as county executive this year.</p><p>If she was to run for governor, it would be a sharp turnabout for Ms. Stefanik, who only recently appeared to be cruising to Senate confirmation at United Nations ambassador. She went so far as to hold a goodbye tour for herself in her House district.</p><p>Fellow Republicans, though, became worried that her resignation from the House would not only tighten the party’s already narrow margin there but also jeopardize their hold on her right-leaning House seat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Stefanik agreed to Mr. Trump’s request that she withdraw. She has since taken a new role as chair of House Republican leadership, but fellow Republicans said it made sense that she would consider other options.</p><p>“She is being embraced by her constituents with open arms,” said Vince Casale, a Republican consultant who is based in upstate New York. “It would make total sense that she is thinking about what’s next. She had been ready to go.”</p><p>Robert Jimison<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Fandos is a Times reporter covering New York politics and government.</p></div><div><p>Benjamin Oreskes is a reporter covering New York State politics and government for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
