    <h1>Sarah Huckabee Sanders Jabs at Harris for Not Having Biological Children</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Introducing former President Donald J. Trump at a town-hall event in Michigan on Tuesday, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas extolled the virtue of humility in politics with an amusing story: She once teared up while watching her daughter get ready for a father-daughter dance, and her daughter said, “It’s OK, Mommy, one day you can be pretty too.”</p><p>“So my kids keep me humble,” Ms. Sanders said. Then, mispronouncing Vice President Kamala Harris’s name, she added, “Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble.”</p><p>The comment was widely interpreted as a reference to Ms. Harris not having biological children; she has two stepchildren. Coming from a surrogate for a campaign whose vice-presidential nominee, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, has been criticized for his past description of Democratic leadership as “childless cat ladies,” Ms. Sanders’s remark quickly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/us/politics/jd-vance-kamala-harris-childless.html" title="">prompted bipartisan backlash,</a> including from Bryan Lanza, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign.</p><p>Mr. Lanza said on CNN that the remark was “actually offensive” and that he was “disappointed in Sarah.”</p></div></div>
