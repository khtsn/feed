He and his friends jumped. Locals said it was the explosion of a land mine planted during the war, one of two such blasts heard and felt that day.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Syria’s conflict, which displaced more than half of the country’s prewar population of 22 million and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/syria-civil-war-death-toll.html" title="">killed more than 500,000 people</a>, according to most estimates, also brutalized historic sites scattered across a land central to many ancient Middle Eastern civilizations.</p><p>The historic souks, caravansaries and mosques of Aleppo are largely in ruins. Displaced families have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/world/middleeast/fleeing-a-modern-war-syrians-seek-refuge-in-ancient-ruins.html" title="">sought refuge</a> in long-abandoned towns and temples in the northwest. And in the ancient city of Apamea, dozens of treasure hunters with pickaxes and metal detectors have been digging near the site’s famed colonnade.</p><p>Even amid Syria’s archaeological richness, Palmyra stands out, containing “the monumental ruins of a great city that was one of the most important cultural centers of the ancient world,” according to UNESCO, which <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/23/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">designated it a World Heritage Site</a> in 1980.</p><p>The scale and beauty of the site still impress, although some of the showcase monuments are so badly damaged that it is hard to imagine what they had looked like. On the recent day, the place was also empty, save for the Syrian doctor and his friends; some other curious Syrians; one Italian tourist and his taxi driver; a group of desperate merchants hawking beads, trinkets and postcards; and the locals periodically driving their trucks or motorcycles through the ruins.</p><p>When the vehicles were gone, you could hear sparrows chirping between the pillars. You could also hear the buzz of a drone throughout the day, although it was unclear who was flying it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Do you know where the prison is?” asked a man driving through the area with a car full of gunmen.</p><p>The visitors’ center and museum were closed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Apamea, northwest of Palmyra, teams of treasure hunters have been digging near the site’s famed colonnade.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pits dug by treasure hunters looking for antiquities surround the ancient ruins of Apamea.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Palmyra was an oasis community integrated into the Roman Empire in the first century A.D. that grew into a key stop along the Silk Road and was ruled for a time by Queen Zenobia. Its blend of Greek, Roman and Persian architecture remained influential for centuries as it fell under Byzantine, Arab and French control.</p><p>After the civil war began in 2011, Palmyra’s strategic location rendered it a battleground between anti-government rebels, Syrian forces, the Russian military and Afghan militiamen backed by Iran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Those forces all left their marks on the city, but the Islamic State, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/world/middleeast/palmyra-syria-isis-amphitheater.html" title="">seized Palmyra in 2015</a>, carried out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/29/world/middleeast/isis-historic-sites-control.html" title="">a campaign of deliberate destruction</a>, driven by its extremist aversion to depictions of the human form and monuments to any faith other than its version of Islam.</p><p>They blew up sanctuaries, including the Temple of Baalshamin and the inner chamber of the Temple of Baal, a significant pre-Islamic religious site. Now, in the middle of the temple’s vast courtyard, only its rectangular portico remains, next to a mess of large stone blocks, some adorned with carved leaves and grapes.</p><p>The jihadists also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/world/middleeast/isis-palmyra-syria-antiquities-scholar-beheaded.html" title="">beheaded the city’s retired antiquities chief</a>, Khalid al-Asaad, and hung his body from a traffic light with his head between his feet.</p><p>A short drive from the main ruins, a tunnel descended to an underground burial complex that the extremists had used as a base. Sandbags protected its entrance, and graffiti on its walls recalled its former occupants.</p><p>“The Islamic State. Fire on the Christians,” read one inscription.</p><p>Another urged the fighters to keep the base tidy: “Brother mujahid, cooperate with your brothers to clean the place after eating.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The rooms held stone sarcophagi ornately carved with lounging figures in flowing robes, all now headless.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Defaced statues on ancient sarcophagi in an underground tomb in Palmyra.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Before ISIS arrived, the innermost room had been decorated <a href="https://archeologie.culture.gouv.fr/palmyre/en/mural-painting" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with frescoes</a> of animals, winged goddesses and the men buried in the vaults. Now, only the red, white and green honeycomb pattern on the ceiling remained. All of the other art had been hastily covered with white paint.</p><p>The jihadists also toppled the triple arch gateway known as the Monumental Arch, which stood at the start of the colonnade, and filmed young militants shooting dead 25 government soldiers on the stage of the amphitheater.</p><p>In 2016, Syrian government forces with Russian backing reclaimed the city, and in May of that year, Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/world/middleeast/syria-russia-palmyra-isis-classical-music.html" title="">flew in a symphony orchestra</a> and V.I.P. audience for a classical music concert that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said signaled “hope for Palmyra’s revival as the heritage of the whole humanity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>A few months later, the Islamic State retook the city and blew up the nearby tetrapylon, a much-photographed monument with four square platforms atop 16 pillars. The government re-retook the city in 2017.</p><p>Resting in the shade near the amphitheater, Mohammed Awad, 36, a hawker, said all of the fighting had made the city unlivable.</p><p>“We had Afghans, Iranians, Russians, Hezbollah, Chechens,” he said. “They all passed through Palmyra.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-24"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Military uniforms on the ground inside an ancient castle on the hilltop overlooking Palmyra.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A destroyed mosque in the town of Palmyra, near the ruins of the ancient city.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>He had been working at the site since he was a child, he said, and had learned enough English, Russian, Italian, Spanish, German, French and Japanese to have basic conversations — and to make sales.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>He longed for tourists to return.</p><p>“Every day we see foreigners, two or three or four,” he said. “But we hope that they will come back in buses, like they used to.”</p><p>There were also traces elsewhere of the other forces who had fought for Palmyra.</p><p>Entering the city’s castle required crossing a rickety footbridge built by the Russians. The detritus of their forces, or Syrian Army units they supported, filled its rooms: empty ammunition boxes, battered fatigues and boots, empty beer bottles and Russian-made rations.</p><p>Near the castle’s entrance was an empty wire rack with a sign that read “Syria Guides and Tourist Books” — a relic of better times.</p><p>On the edge of town stood the former Dedeman Palmyra Hotel, which had been taken over by Iran and its Fatemiyoun Brigade of Afghan militiamen who had been sent to help the Syrian Army.</p><p>They had lived in its rooms, turned a large meeting hall into a mosque and availed themselves of the swimming pool. Persian-language posters and slogans on the walls praised Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, and sought to inspire the troops.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“The Fatemiyoun fight for Islam,” read one.</p><p>“We will stand until the end,” read another.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrian shepherds near the empty swimming pool at the former Dedeman Palmyra Hotel.

The hotel’s buildings had been pounded by airstrikes and damaged white pickup trucks were scattered near the entrance like crumpled cans. The pool and fountain were dry, and a young shepherd led his flock through the grounds.</p><p>“We never came here before,” said the shepherd, Hamadi al-Qassim, 13. “They would have killed us.”</p><p>Amr Al-Azm, a professor of Middle Eastern history and anthropology at Shawnee State University in Ohio and a former antiquities official in Syria, said the country’s new authorities lacked the means to do much about the damage to Palmyra.</p><p>But that did not negate the site’s historical value, he said.</p><p>“In the grand scheme of things, this is part of human history, and whatever damage has occurred is part of the story of these places,” he said. “There was Temple of Baal once upon a time, and now it is gone. That is part of the story.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A destroyed tank at the entrance to the ancient city.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">
