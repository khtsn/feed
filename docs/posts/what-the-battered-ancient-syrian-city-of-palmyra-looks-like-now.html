Now, in the middle of the templeâs vast courtyard, only its rectangular portico remains, next to a mess of large stone blocks, some adorned with carved leaves and grapes.</p><p>The jihadists also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/world/middleeast/isis-palmyra-syria-antiquities-scholar-beheaded.html" title="">beheaded the cityâs retired antiquities chief</a>, Khalid al-Asaad, and hung his body from a traffic light with his head between his feet.</p><p>A short drive from the main ruins, a tunnel descended to an underground burial complex that the extremists had used as a base.
