This is the first time this inflation measure has slipped below 3 percent since 2021, and while price increases are still quicker than the 2 percent pace that was normal before the coronavirus pandemic, they are much slower than the 9.1 percent peak they reached two years ago.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The inflation report likely cements the case for a rate cut at the Fed’s Sept. 17-18 meeting, economists said. Fed officials have been holding borrowing costs at 5.3 percent, the highest level in more than two decades, to slow demand and bring price increases under control. They have been tiptoeing closer to a rate cut as inflation has eased, and made it clear following their July meeting that they wanted to see just a bit more progress before making their first move.</p><p>The new data “really ticks the box,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. He said the “big question” now is how big the Fed’s reduction will be.</p><p>For consumers, who are still getting used to higher price levels at the grocery store or the used car lot, cooler inflation means that the sudden cost jumps that became commonplace in 2022 and 2023 are increasingly a thing of the past.</p><p>And for Democrats and President Biden’s White House, that is a welcome development: It could help American voters to feel more optimistic about the economy.</p><p>“It’s great to see a ‘two’ handle on the yearly C.P.I.,” Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an email following the release. “It doesn’t mean our work is done, but it does mean we’re moving in the right direction, and with a bit of momentum.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Milder inflation may help Vice President Kamala Harris as she campaigns for president as the Democratic nominee. Former President Donald J. Trump, the Republican candidate, regularly blames Democrats for the run-up in prices since the pandemic — but that could become a less powerful talking point as increases slow and shoppers have time to acclimate.</p><p>The July cool-down was in line with expectations, and the market reaction was muted.</p><p>The Fed has held interest rates at their current level for the past year. Investors think that the big question for the Fed’s meeting in September is whether policymakers will cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point, a typically sized move, or by a half-point, which would be an unusually large reduction.</p><p>Investors began to bet that a bigger rate move was possible — even, they temporarily believed, likely — after an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/business/economy/july-jobs-report-what-to-know.html" title="">unexpectedly weak jobs report</a> was released this month. It showed that unemployment rose notably in July and that hiring had slowed. Joblessness has been creeping higher for months, which rarely happens outside of recessions.</p><p>Many Fed watchers thought that policymakers were likely to react by cutting rates more aggressively, because the Fed has two key jobs: keeping inflation in check and fostering a strong job market. With inflation coming under control, the thinking went, Fed officials would begin to focus more intently on protecting the labor market.</p><p>But developments in recent days have suggested that while the economy is moderating, it is not falling apart. Jobless claims eased last week. And recent company earnings reports suggest that consumers are still spending, if a bit more cautiously.</p></div></div><div><div><p>While the hotel operator Marriott reported “a hair more caution,” it said people were still traveling, for instance. And the clothier Ralph Lauren saw “good relative momentum” from more well-to-do customers.</p><p>And though Wednesday’s inflation figures suggested that price increases are easing, they are not grinding to a standstill. In fact, <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investors increasingly bet</a> on just a normal-sized rate cut after the data release.</p></div></div><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="inflation-categories-dq7hu" data-id="100000009628695" data-source-id="100000009628695"><div data-sourceid="100000009628695" id="embed-id-100000009628695">

</div></section></div><div><div><p>While many categories showed only mild price increases in July — including food, hotel room rates and personal care services — rent-related inflation indexes unexpectedly ticked up.</p><p>That’s notable, because Fed officials have spent months closely watching those shelter inflation measures, expecting them to begin to cool consistently. It served as a reminder of why the Fed has been cautious in declaring victory over inflation.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Still, there are reasons that the July jump in shelter costs could have been a one-off. They were concentrated in a just a few places, for instance.</p><p>“If you want to look at the totality of the data, the totality in my mind is pretty clear, and it is definitely toward more disinflation,” said Omair Sharif, founder of the research firm Inflation Insights. The Fed will receive a few more key data points before its next meeting — and its big decision about how much to cut interest rates.</p><p>Fed policymakers aim for 2 percent annual inflation based on the Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation measure, which comes out later than the Consumer Price Index.
