    <h1>A Dandy Night</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Early May means the world’s biggest celebrities are wearing outrageous clothes. It’s why we love covering the Met Gala, which raises money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s costume wing.</p><p>The gala officially opens the Costume Institute’s exhibition “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” examining 300 years of Black fashion and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/style/black-dandyism-history-met-exhibition.html" title="">history of Black dandyism</a>. Attended by the rich and famous and hosted, as always, by Anna Wintour, this year’s gala raised the most money ever in its history — $31 million.</p><p>Yet the party and the exhibition about Black style have a different feel than its planners may have intended. The political landscape looked very different when the Met announced the show in October, The Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/met-gala-2025-black-dandy-politics.html" title="">chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, explained</a>. Back then, Kamala Harris, the first Black woman ever to top a major-party ticket, was in the final weeks of her campaign for the White House. Now, the federal government has targeted all things involving diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as programming related to race — especially in cultural institutions.</p><p>The show has other political baggage, too. The Costume Institute has never had a Black curator, and the Met has its own history of racism. (This exhibition is the brain child of Andrew Bolton, the institute’s chief curator. It’s based on a 2009 academic text called “Slaves to Fashion” by Monica L. Miller, a Barnard professor who helped put the show together.) Despite many D.E.I. initiatives after 2020, the fashion world failed to make good on its promises; of the more than 15 recent appointments at the top of major brands, not a single one was Black.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But if there were concerns last night, you wouldn’t have known as Wintour’s co-chairs, Pharrell Williams, ASAP Rocky, Lewis Hamilton and Colman Domingo, greeted guests like Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Sha’Carri Richardson, Chappell Roan, Janelle Monáe, Kim Kardashian and Pharrell Williams.</p><p>Harris skipped the red carpet but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/kamala-harris-met-gala-2025.html" title="">posed for photos before the event</a> in her hotel room. She wore an asymmetric black silk gown with a choker neckline and one flowing white sleeve, designed by IB Kamara of Off-White.</p><p>Celebrities sometimes struggle to interpret the dress code. But last night was a true celebration of Black designers, stylists and celebrities. See some of the most daring and memorable looks below. And if you’re so inclined, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/05/style/met-gala-2025-red-carpet-looks.html" title="">take a scroll through our slide show</a>, which has every look you want to see. We added a new feature this year that allows readers to save their favorite looks and share them.

Earlier this year, Israel and Hamas agreed to a cease-fire. That deal held for months, during which Israel halted operations in Gaza and Hamas handed over some Israeli hostages. But the cease-fire ended in March. Now, it seems the war is truly returning.</p><p><strong>Why escalate now?</strong></p><p>Israel has pressured Hamas to return all of the remaining hostages, especially the 24 who officials believe are still alive. Officials also say that Hamas must disarm as part of any future deal. But Hamas has refused. Before it makes further concessions, it wants the war over and Israel out of Gaza.</p><p>Israel hopes escalation will get Hamas to capitulate and return all of the hostages — while giving its troops a chance to destroy the group’s remaining infrastructure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>What is Israel’s plan?</strong></p><p>The generals are calling up tens of thousands of reservists to expand operations in Gaza. They plan to occupy the region, forcibly relocate Palestinians in affected areas and oversee aid distribution.</p><p>Israel has blocked all aid, including food and medicine, from entering the territory for more than two months. (Some aid workers are accused of participating in the Oct. 7 attacks, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/28/world/middleeast/gaza-unrwa-hamas-israel.html" title="">The Times explained</a>, and a lawsuit claims that Hamas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/nyregion/us-reverses-position-gaza-unrwa-suit.html" title="">skimmed $1 billion in U.N. aid</a>. But the blockade has led to starvation and the spread of diseases, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/world/europe/israel-gaza-blockade-humanitarian-crisis.html" title="">The Times documented</a>.) With direct control, Israel says, it will allow distribution to resume.</p><p><strong>Will the plan work?</strong></p><p>Israeli leaders say that military pressure secured the release of hostages before. They hope to replicate that success. Critics argue that Israel has by now exhausted its ability to pressure Hamas with force. They worry more fighting will put the surviving hostages at risk. <em>— German Lopez</em></p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Israel’s prime minister said the country was “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/europe/israel-buildup-soldiers-hamas-gaza.html" title="">on the eve of a forceful entry</a> to Gaza.” </p><h3 id="link-21d9b780"><span><strong>OPINIONS</strong></span></h3><p>Americans should take Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/opinion/trump-third-term.html" title="">comments about a third term</a> seriously and push back, the <strong>Editorial Board</strong> writes.</p><p>To compensate for higher education’s flaws, high schools should offer both college prep and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/opinion/college-technical-vocational-education.html" title="">in-demand vocational career pathways</a>, <strong>Randi Weingarten</strong> writes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Atlantis Casino’s Sky Terrace.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Najera for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p><strong>Trending online yesterday:</strong> Jury selection started in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/arts/music/diddy-trial-sex-trafficking-jury-selection.html" title="">federal trial of Sean Combs</a>.
