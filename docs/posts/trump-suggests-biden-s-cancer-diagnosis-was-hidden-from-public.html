Biden Jr.’s cancer diagnosis was not made public a “long time ago,” seeming to suggest without evidence that the former president’s cancer was not newly discovered and had been covered up.</p><p>“There are things going on that the public wasn’t informed, and I think somebody is going to have to speak to his doctor,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.</p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Biden’s office said he had been diagnosed on Friday with an aggressive form of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/us/politics/biden-prostate-cancer.html" title="">prostate cancer</a> that had spread to his bones. Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/biden-prostate.html" title="">had spent May 9</a> at a Philadelphia hospital after a doctor discovered a small nodule on his prostate, his spokesman said last week. Mr. Biden, 82, had reported urinary symptoms before the nodule was found.</p><p>The cancer is Stage 4, with a Gleason score of 9, according to the former president’s office. A Gleason score is a measure of cancer aggressiveness, <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/diagnosis-staging/tests/biopsy-and-cytology-tests/understanding-your-pathology-report/prostate-pathology/prostate-cancer-pathology.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ranging from 6 to 10</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“To get to Stage 9, that’s a long time,” Mr. Trump said Monday, apparently mixing up the Gleason score with the cancer stage.</p><p>“You have to say, why did it take so long?” Mr. Trump said, adding, “It can take years to get to this level of danger. So it’s a — look, it’s a very, very sad situation, and I feel very badly about it, and I think people should try and find out what happened.”</p><p>Mr. Trump, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-biden-blame.html" title="">regularly blames</a> Mr. Biden for nearly every challenge facing his administration, appeared to be trying to tie the cancer diagnosis to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/biden-book-takeaways.html" title="">recent reporting</a> that Mr. Biden’s aides concealed his mental and physical decline during his presidency.</p><p>“Why wasn’t the cognitive ability — why wasn’t that discussed?” Mr. Trump said. “I think the doctors said he’s just fine, and it’s turned out that’s not so. It’s very dangerous.”</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Biden did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a breast oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania who advised the Biden White House on the coronavirus pandemic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”</a> that Mr. Biden likely “had this for many years — maybe even a decade — growing there and spreading.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“He had it while he was president” without knowing it, Dr. Emanuel told MSNBC. “He probably had it at the start of his presidency.”</p><p>Regular screenings for prostate cancer are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/prostate-cancer/screening/get-screened.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not recommended for men over 70</a> by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The C.D.C. cites potential harms from the screening in older men: false positives that can cause stress and needless additional tests, and discoveries of cancer that would have never produced symptoms but that can lead to treatments with harmful side effects.</p><p>Many patients with prostate cancer are asymptomatic and most do not know they have something wrong in their prostate until a doctor finds the cancer, said Dr. Marc B. Garnick, an expert on urological cancer at Harvard Medical School. And although initial diagnoses of severe prostate cancer are somewhat less common than they used to be, they are not uncommon, he added.</p><p>“It still happens on a regular basis,” Dr. Garnick said.</p><p>Dr. Judd W. Moul, a urologist and prostate specialist at Duke University, said that while “everyone’s talking about conspiracy and coverups,” from a medical standpoint, “the way that President Biden was diagnosed could be considered perfectly reasonable and not medically unusual.”</p><p>Erica L.
