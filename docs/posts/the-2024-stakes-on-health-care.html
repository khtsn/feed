But the stakes are still high.</p><p>The next president could influence how many people have health insurance, how much many pay for it, the prices of prescription drugs and more through regulatory power alone. In the event that either candidate is elected with legislative majorities, the differences could be even larger.</p><p>The Morning has been writing on how the election will matter for major areas of public policy. Today, I’ll break down the stakes for health care.</p><h2 id="link-34491f71">Insurance</h2><p>For people who use Obamacare, a lot of money is at stake.</p><p>During the pandemic, Democrats raised the subsidies that help 20 million Americans buy their own insurance. Poor Americans can get covered without paying a cent, and even people making north of $100,000 got help with premiums. But if Congress does nothing, the new subsidies will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/upshot/obamacare-election-trump-harris.html" title="">expire at the end of next year</a>. That would likely leave <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-06/60437-Arrington-Smith-Letter.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than three million</a> uninsured — and would make nearly everyone insured through Obamacare pay more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Donald Trump’s campaign says he opposes an extension, which might cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Kamala Harris wants the subsidies to be permanent, though she probably wouldn’t get her way if Republicans control Congress.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Grant Hindsley for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The candidates are also likely to approach key regulations of Obamacare differently. In his first term, Trump encouraged the sale of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/upshot/buying-short-term-health-insurance-what-to-know.html" title="">lightly regulated insurance plans</a> that cost less — and covered fewer medical problems. He also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/31/health/affordable-care-act-trump-spending.html" title="">pulled back on advertising</a> for people to enroll in Obamacare. The Biden administration reversed most of these changes, and Harris would likely keep such moves in place.</p><p>Trump could also weaken the requirement for insurers to cover all forms of contraception. In his first term, he let employers claim exemption on religious or moral grounds.</p><h2 id="link-7164c032">Drug prices</h2><p>A rare point of agreement between the two candidates is that the United States should pay less for prescription drugs. This is an area where the president could have a lot of influence, even if Congress doesn’t cooperate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The Biden administration signed legislation allowing Medicare to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/06/upshot/democrats-drug-prices.html" title="">negotiate the price of certain drugs with the companies that make them</a>. Ozempic and Wegovy, the blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs, could be negotiated next year. How aggressively will officials haggle over their price? It depends who’s running Medicare.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Centreville, Ala.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Charity Rachelle for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Harris is a fan of the new law and wants it to apply to more drugs. Trump has been quiet about the specific provision, but he has lamented for years that Americans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/us/politics/trump-drug-prices.html" title="">pay more for drugs</a> than the rest of the world. When he was president, he wasn’t able to get any major legislation passed, but he tried various rules — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/health/drug-prices-imports-canada.html" title="">blessing Canadian drug imports</a>, forcing drug companies to mention most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/drug-prices-tv-advertisements.html" title="">prices on television ads</a> — to achieve similar goals. </p><p>But Trump’s policies here are difficult to predict. On this topic, he is out of step with congressional Republicans and conservative health care scholars, who mostly oppose the drug negotiation law. How far he goes may depend on whom he appoints to the big government jobs.</p><h2 id="link-405179d2">Medicare and Medicaid</h2><p>On Medicare, the federal insurance program for Americans over 65, both Trump and Harris have vowed not to cut benefits.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But when it comes to Medicaid, which covers poor and disabled Americans, there are major differences between the candidates. Trump allowed state Medicaid programs to impose work requirements, limiting coverage to people who could prove they worked a certain number of hours a week. He could let Republican-led states try other experiments.</p><h2 id="link-4a00992c">With a congressional majority</h2><p>If allies of either candidate control both houses of Congress, the differences could be huge. Lawmakers could authorize Harris to negotiate for more drugs. She has also proposed to expand Medicare so it covers seniors’ hearing, vision and home-based care. Those changes would be costly but could be accomplished with a bare-majority vote in the Senate. Her other proposals — such as limiting insulin co-payments to $35 for all Americans or capping everyone’s out-of-pocket drug spending to $2,000 a year — would probably require either 60 Senate votes or the end of the filibuster.</p><p>If Republicans control Congress and the White House, they might cut Medicaid. Trump has not campaigned on reductions. But he has not pledged to protect the program, and he proposed major cuts in every one of his presidential budgets. None passed.</p><p>Trump has suggested he might be open to another Obamacare repeal attempt. But Republicans in Congress don’t seem interested.</p><p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Kamala Harris has offered policies that would lower out-of-pocket costs for many Americans and preserve or expand health insurance coverage. Donald Trump has been vaguer, and his agenda is a little harder to predict. But his allies have embraced policies that would probably increase insurance premiums for people who buy their own insurance — and raise the number of Americans who are uninsured. Both candidates would probably take steps to lower the price of prescription drugs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-54756621">Related coverage</h2><ul><li><p>An opaque industry — pharmacy benefit managers — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/business/prescription-drug-costs-pbm.html" title="">secretly inflates the price</a> of prescription drugs.</p></li><li><p>Medicaid, where changes may be looming, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/26/us/medicaid-election-voters-photos.html" title="">is a lifeline for many voters</a>.</p></li></ul><section data-id="100000009700675" data-testid="capsule-block"><h2 id="link-22e2b88a">The Stakes</h2><p><em>A Morning newsletter series on how Harris and Trump view some of the biggest issues facing the country.</em></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/briefing/the-stakes-on-presidential-power.html" title="">Presidential power</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/briefing/tax-election-harris-trump.html" title="">Taxes</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/briefing/immigration-trump-harris-policies.html" title="">Immigration</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/briefing/the-stakes-on-abortion.html" title="">Abortion</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/briefing/the-stakes-on-climate.html" title="">Climate</a></p></li></ul></section><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-33c86ff8">Republican Campaigns</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><ul><li><p>Trump held a rally at Madison Square Garden.
