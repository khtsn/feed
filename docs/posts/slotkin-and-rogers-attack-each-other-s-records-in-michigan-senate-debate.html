Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who is retiring, has held the seat since 2001, and the party must hold it to have a chance of winning its uphill battle to hang onto the majority. Recent polls have shown <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/us/politics/senate-polls-ohio-michigan-wisconsin.html" title="">Ms. Slotkin with a slight edge in the contest</a>.</p><p>The matchup is between two candidates with somewhat similar résumés. Both served in the House, representing neighboring Michigan districts, though not concurrently; Mr. Rogers was elected in 2001 and left four years before Ms. Slotkin arrived in 2019. Both also have national security backgrounds: Ms. Slotkin was a C.I.A. analyst before being elected to Congress, while Mr. Rogers was the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.</p><p>“The good news is we both have records,” Ms. Slotkin said early in the debate, adding that voters would “be able to see very clearly not just what we say we’re going to do, but what we’ve actually done.”</p><p>Both tried to weaponize those records.</p><p>Early on, as the moderator posed a series of questions related to Israel’s war in Gaza, they pivoted to argue about each other’s positions on the Iraq war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“In the run-up to the Iraq war, there was no greater supporter, there was no greater fist pumper than Mike Rogers in leading us into that war,” Ms. Slotkin said.</p><p>Mr. Rogers, who <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2002455" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voted in 2002 to authorize the invasion</a>, retorted by insinuating that Ms. Slotkin had been responsible for the bad intelligence that the spy community presented to lawmakers to make the case for the war — and accusing her of distorting his position.</p><p>“Listen, I get it, the C.I.A. has deception training; my opponent clearly went through that,” he said. “But you’re supposed to use that against your adversaries, not Michigan voters.”</p><p>Later, when the debate turned to domestic policy, Ms. Slotkin criticized Mr. Rogers for voting repeatedly to privatize or cut Social Security and Medicare.</p><p>“It’s all on the record,” she said. “Just check the facts.”</p><p>Mr. Rogers rejected that charge too, though he did support Republican budget plans that called for doing so over his years in the House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I’m not even sure she could pass the polygraph test in the C.I.A. anymore,” Mr. Rogers said. “When you look at what we have to do to protect it, fear and scare is not going to get it done — nor did I do the things that she suggested.”</p><p>The most protracted spat came when, during the discussion about manufacturing electric vehicles in Michigan, Mr. Rogers accused Ms. Slotkin of signing a nondisclosure agreement to help a company that has been accused of being affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party build a plant in Michigan.</p><p>Ms. Slotkin categorically denied ever having signed such an agreement. Last year, <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2023/02/06/michigan-economic-development-negotiations-code-names-nda/69858803007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Detroit News reported</a> that an aide to Ms. Slotkin did so in order to be able to view details of the project; a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michigan-democrat-signed-nda-involving-ccp-tied-company-documents-show-contradicting-her-past-claims" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News report</a> said Ms. Slotkin did as well.</p><p>“It’s a lie,” Ms. Slotkin said on Tuesday. It was Mr. Rogers, she said, who had helped the Chinese when he served as a consultant to AT&amp;T after his departure from Congress.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karoun Demirjian covers Congress with a focus on defense, foreign policy, intelligence, immigration, and trade and technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karoun-demirjian">More about Karoun Demirjian</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
