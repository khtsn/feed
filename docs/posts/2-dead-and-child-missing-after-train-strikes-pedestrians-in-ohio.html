Fremont is about 40 miles southeast of Toledo.</p><p>A 1-year-old child was rescued from the river and hospitalized, and emergency crews were searching the river early Monday for a missing 5-year-old, Mr. Sanchez said. He did not say what condition the 1-year-old was in, and it was unclear if either child had also been struck by the train.</p><p>The four people appeared to be part of a large family that had traveled to Fremont from Fort Wayne, Ind., to fish in the river, Mr. Sanchez said. The waterway is known as a place for white bass fishing in the spring.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We believe they were simply here in the area trying to enjoy the Sandusky River,” Mr. Sanchez said.</p><p>He added that the bridge was clearly marked as being for trains only.</p><p>It was not immediately clear which train line was involved.</p><p>David Tucker III, 20, was fishing by the Sandusky River when he heard the train approaching the bridge and sounding its horn, he said.</p><p>As the train neared, it continued to sound its horn intermittently, until the engineer blared it continuously, Mr. Tucker said.</p><p>Mr. Tucker then saw what he estimated were four or five people “drop straight into the water,” from the train trestle, he said. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He could see only their feet as they floated down the river. Mr. Tucker called 911 at 7:25 p.m., he said.</p><p>His father, David Tucker Jr., had just returned home from work and also said he had heard the train sound its horn.</p><p>“I looked out my back window, and I could see people in panic,” he said, adding he also heard the train “slam its brakes.” He immediately called his son because he knew his son was fishing at the river.</p><p>According to the Tuckers, the victims appeared to be crossing the train trestle to reach the other side. The trestle has a “no trespassing” sign, they said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Yan Zhuang is a Times reporter in Seoul who covers breaking news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
