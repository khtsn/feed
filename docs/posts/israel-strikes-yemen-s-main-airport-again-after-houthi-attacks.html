The latest strike destroyed the last remaining aircraft at the airport used by the Houthi government, according to Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, and the airport’s director.</p><p>“They destroyed it entirely,” the airport’s director, Khaled al-Shaief, said of the plane. He <a href="https://x.com/KAlshaief/status/1927633038374048199" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared on social media</a> a photograph of burning wreckage with fire trucks attempting to extinguish the blaze, saying the plane had been the last aircraft belonging to the national airline at the Sana airport.</p><p>The Sana airport is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/middleeast/israel-yemen-attack-sana-airport.html" title="">vital link for more than 20 million Yemenis</a> in Houthi-held areas, providing access to lifesaving medical treatment, medicine and aid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Houthis, who control most of northwestern Yemen, including Sana, have been launching rockets and drones at Israel and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/houthi-yemen-red-sea-attacks.html" title="">targeting ships in the Red Sea</a> since October 2023, in what they call a campaign of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Both the Houthis and Hamas in Gaza are part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/06/world/middleeast/iran-hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iraq.html" title="">Iran’s network of proxy militias</a> around the Middle East.</p><p>Sirens sounded across Israel several times this week warning of incoming Houthi missiles. The Israeli military said it had intercepted them all.</p><p>Earlier this month, a Houthi missile landed near a terminal of Israel’s main international airport, near Tel Aviv. That episode alarmed airlines, and some temporarily suspended operations in Israel.</p><p>In response, Israel struck the Sana airport on May 6 and, since then, neither side has shown signs of backing down.</p><p>“Whoever harms us, we will harm them,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said after the strike on the Sana airport on Wednesday. He put some of the blame for the Houthi actions on Tehran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The main force behind them is Iran, and it is responsible for the aggression emanating from Yemen,” Mr. Netanyahu said.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s remarks come as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/as-trump-seeks-iran-deal-israel-again-raises-possible-strikes-on-nuclear-sites.html" title="">Israel has been threatening a possible attack</a> on Iran’s nuclear program, which it views as an existential danger.
