</span>, dominating them 2-0 and dropping just 11 rounds. </p>

<p>The series was played out on KC&#39;s pick of Abyss and Xipto&#39;s pick of Corrode. KC won Abyss 13-4 and then won Corrode 13-7.</p>

<p>The series started on KC&#39;s pick of Abyss, the destination of Xipto&#39;s only map loss at the Pacific tournament. In that loss, Xipto struggled on defense but achieved most of its success on offense. Against KC on this day, the attack side was the half that Xipto struggled on.</p>

<p>After winning the pistol and anti-eco rounds with relative ease, displaying a patient, disciplined attack, Xipto appeared to set the tone early. From the would-be bonus round, the script was flipped. KC played more driven, steadying the balance between playing proactively and playing aggressively effectively, taking space in mid and forcing the Xipto players thin across the large map.</p>

<p>While Xipto opted for what seemed to be a meta-defining comp with Waylay, Yoru, and Veto, KC&#39;s comp seemed to prioritize comfort, with lethal Duelist <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/23049/alkyia">
		alkyia	</a>
</span> on Jett in a double-Controller, double-Initiator comp that leaned into the team&#39;s free-flowing approach on both sides of the map.</p>

<p>KC ended its defense side up 8-4 with 16 kills coming from alkyia. Moving onto attack, she remained the primary source of KC&#39;s frags. An &#34;alkyia go kill&#34; approach on attack found gaps in the Xipto armor, with one round seeing her take down four opposing players while the rest of her team was on the other side of the map in a fake that looked almost too easy.</p>


<p><em>A would-be thrifty for Xipto turns disastrous as the KC duo converts a 2v5.</em></p>

<p>KC cruised to a 13-4 win, with alkyia finishing a match-best 26/9, a rating of 2.00, and an ACS of 403. Xipto, as a team, managed just five kills, struggling to fight off the back foot against KC&#39;s pressure.</p>

<p>The focus then turned to Corrode, the map on which Xipto lifted the Pacific GC trophy on. Xipto came out with its tried and tested double-Sentinel comp, pairing Deadlock and Cypher with Yoru, Fade, and Omen. Meanwhile, KC opted for yet another double-Controller, double-Initiator comp, this time with Omen, Viper, Fade, and KAY/O. </p>

<p>After dealing with 17 rounds of an aggressive KC on Abyss, Xipto seemed well-prepared for the EMEA team&#39;s attempts at pushing the line of scrimmage early. After winning the first three rounds, Xipto gave up a thrifty, which snowballed into three straight for KC. The back-and-forth nature of the map continued onwards, with the teams going blow for blow to enter halftime knotted at 6-6.</p>


<p><em>Five ultimates invested into this round, but it&#39;s <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11183/glance">
		Glance	</a>
</span> with another huge clutch for KC.</em></p>

<p>While the story of Abyss was alkyia being supported in the fragging department by her teammates, Corrode saw a more well-rounded but equally as coordinated KC work past the double Sentinel defense of Xipto. </p>

<p>On defense, Xipto utilized its Sentinel utility within trap setups and to slow down site entries. However, this approach still required bodies to be committed to cover mid. With players like alkyia and Glance seemingly hitting every shot they came across, Xipto was forced to abandon mid on several occasions. That opened lanes for deep lurks into defender spawn for in-game leader <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/22792/jiex">
		Jiex	</a>
</span>, who, despite whiffing on a few prime opportunities, always gathered valuable info to direct her team to winning ways.</p>

<p>Theoretically, Xipto&#39;s double Sentinel comp should have seen more success on defense, but they struggled to hold the high-power KC at bay. The Pacific champions were wiped aside with relative ease, as KC dropped just one round in the second half en route to a 13-7 win.</p>

<p>At the end of two maps, alkyia&#39;s play on the Duelist role told the story. The Turkish sharpshooter, now seemingly planted on the Duelist role after some experimentation in regional play as a Controller, notched a match-leading 44 kills. Initiator player <span data-ref-id="5">
