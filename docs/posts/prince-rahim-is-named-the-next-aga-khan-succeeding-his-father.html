Prince Rahim, 53, was named as his successor after the unsealing of his will, according to the <a href="https://the.akdn/en/home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aga Khan Development Network</a>.</p><p>Prince Rahim, who is the Aga Khan V, will take the reins of a Shiite Muslim lineage that claims descent from the Prophet Muhammad. Ismaili Muslims, numbering 12 million to 15 million, live in more than 35 countries including Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan.</p><p>His family and the Ismaili institutions are stunningly wealthy: Estimates of the fortune have ranged from $1 billion to $13 billion, with diverse holdings ranging from airlines to racehorses to newspapers. The Aga Khan IV was one of the world’s wealthiest hereditary rulers, with some of the money coming from a kind of tithe levied on his followers.</p></div></div>
