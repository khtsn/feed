The franchises have met 11 times in the World Series, the most of any two teams.</p><p>It remains to be seen if Ohtani vs. Judge and Stone vs. Rodón can match Robinson vs. Berra and Koufax vs. Mantle.

The Yankees led, two games to one, but Brooklyn (now the Los Angeles Dodgers) was set to equalize, leading by 4-3 in the top of the ninth. With two outs, the Yankees’ Tommy Henrich swung and missed at a curveball. The game was over.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Or was it?
