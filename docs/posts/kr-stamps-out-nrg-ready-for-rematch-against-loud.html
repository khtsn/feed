</span> for a place in the top four in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2274/champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Americas Kickoff</a>.</p>

<p>NRG, after an unexpected loss to Cloud9 in their opener, found themselves in the lower bracket alongside KRÜ, who were knocked down by LOUD in their debut.</p>

<p>The series kicked off on KRÜ&#39;s pick of Abyss, with the Latin American squad running Jett, Viper, and KAY/O, while NRG opted for Yoru, Harbor, and Vyse. Despite mada setting up a 5v3 advantage on the pistol, KRÜ managed to convert the round and shut down NRG&#39;s force-buy. NRG pushed back in Round 4, eventually tying the game 3-3 off the back of a 3k from <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11225/ethan">
		Ethan	</a>
</span>.</p>

<p>KRÜ&#39;s strong retakes secured them two more rounds before NRG closed out the half in their favor, 7-5. However, NRG&#39;s struggles in pistols and force-buys continued, leading to a five-round losing streak. NRG&#39;s win in Round 18 was only a brief pause in KRÜ&#39;s momentum, as they closed out the map 13-8. Ethan&#39;s standout 21 kills wasn&#39;t enough to overcome KRÜ&#39;s attack, led by stellar showings from <span data-ref-id="4">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="5">

</span>.</p>


<p><em>NRG had a two-man advantage in three out of the four pistols they lost</em></p>

<p>NRG&#39;s Haven composition mirrored KRÜ&#39;s, with the exception of <span data-ref-id="6">

</span>&#39;s Jett. The map began similarly to Abyss, with NRG once again losing a 5v3 on the pistol and falling in the subsequent force-buy, putting them in an early 0-4 hole. They finally got on the board in Round 5, but KRÜ responded immediately, extending their lead to 8-2.</p>

<p>A crucial timeout from <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7/bonkar">
		bonkar	</a>
</span> in Round 11 helped NRG regain control, slowing their attack and securing the final rounds of the half to close the gap to 8-4. For the first time in the series, NRG won a pistol round despite a 3k from <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/24007/shyy">
		Shyy	</a>
</span>, carrying that momentum into an eight-round streak. mada dominated on defense with the Operator, anchoring sites with several multi-kills. KRÜ finally stopped the bleeding in Round 21, but it was too late as NRG closed out the map 13-10. mada and Ethan were unstoppable, finishing with 30 and 24 kills, respectively, while the rest of NRG combined for just 25.</p>


<p><em>mada was unstoppable in Haven, with four 3ks and an ace</em></p>

<p>The game ended on Bind, with NRG running KAY/O and Fade, while KRÜ opted for Skye and Vyse. Despite another pistol round 3k from Shyy, NRG delayed the defuse long enough to secure their second pistol win of the series. However, KRÜ quickly shut down any hopes of early momentum, winning both the eco and the follow-up force buy to establish an early lead. NRG finally found some life in Round 6 with Ethan winning a crucial 1v1, but <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3826/adverso">
		adverso	</a>
</span>&#39;s dominance on Viper continued to shut them out, securing early picks and denying site access. KRÜ ended the half with a commanding 8-4 lead.</p>

<p>With their tournament hopes on the line, NRG once again lost an advantaged pistol round, allowing KRÜ to extend their lead to 11-4. Though NRG attempted to replicate their defensive comeback from Haven, a 3k from Shyy in Round 19 sealed their fate, as KRÜ closed out the final map 13-7. Shyy and adverso dominated the final map, each ending with over 20 kills.</p>

<p>NRG exits the tournament far earlier than expected, while KRÜ earns a shot at redemption in a rematch against LOUD for a place in the top four.</p>
