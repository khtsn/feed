The Israeli military has acknowledged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-site-shooting.html" title="">firing</a> near people who had deviated from “designated access routes” and who did not respond to verbal warnings. Gaza health officials say dozens of Palestinians have been killed trying to get aid.</p><p>Shots were again fired about half a mile from one of the distribution sites early Sunday. Gaza’s health ministry said five people were killed and 123 were wounded in the incident. An Israeli military spokesman said the army had fired warning shots at people who were “advancing in a way that endangered the troops.” It added that some people had been injured, but did not specify how many.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many Gazans interviewed by The New York Times have said they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-center-shooting.html" title="">head to the sites</a> early, despite repeated warnings from the Israeli military that it regards the areas as active conflict zones when the centers are not open. Many are desperate for food — Gaza faces a severe hunger crisis — and seeking to get ahead of large crowds.</p><p>Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has razed huge urban areas and forced almost all the enclave’s two million residents to flee their homes at least once. Israel cut off deliveries of food, fuel and other essential goods to Gaza in March as a way to pressure Hamas, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/world/europe/israel-gaza-blockade-humanitarian-crisis.html" title="">blockade</a> that ended in mid-May after almost 80 days. Aid groups and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/gaza-famine-starvation-israel.html" title="">some Israeli military officers</a> have warned that the restrictions have pushed Gazans to the brink of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/world/middleeast/gaza-hunger-children-malnutrition.html" title="">starvation</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Children waiting for food at a distribution point in Nuseirat in the Gaza Strip last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Israel has accused Hamas of diverting aid from humanitarian groups under the previous distribution system, which was managed by the United Nations across hundreds of distribution sites. The United Nations has said there was no evidence that the militants systematically diverted aid.</p><p>Israel agreed to allow some aid into Gaza last month. Most has come through the foundation, which has four distribution sites that are operated by private American security contractors in coordination with the Israeli military. The United Nations and other aid groups have boycotted this system, and have accused Israel of using aid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-aid.html" title="">as a part of its military strategy</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Saturday, the foundation said it was “impossible to proceed” with aid distribution because Hamas had threatened its staff. A group spokesman later shared a written warning he said local staff members received, threatening them with “serious consequences” if they continued working for the program. The Times was not able to independently verify the claims.</p><p>In its response on Monday, Hamas said the foundation “continues to spread canned lies” and called it “nothing more than a propaganda front for the Israeli occupation army.”</p><p>Yet even beyond the dispute over security threats and attacks on civilians, the foundation’s unpredictable distribution system continues to confuse and frustrate Gazans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Security workers employed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation directing Palestinians gathered to receive aid at one of its sites on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>After announcing the opening of one center on Monday on its Facebook page, the foundation posted less than 20 minutes later that distributions were completed and it had closed. The comment section filled with angry reactions to the short notice and opening period.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A second post said that the foundation had closed another center “because of the chaos of surrounding crowds, which prevented the safe delivery of aid.”</p><p>The foundation then closed comments on its posts.</p><p>The aid group later said that it would open a center on Monday evening.</p><p>Since its launch, the foundation has also been rocked by internal turmoil. Its executive director <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/asia/gaza-aid-wood-independence-resigns.html" title="">resigned</a> hours before operations were set to begin. Last week, the U.S. advisory firm Boston Consulting Group said it had halted involvement with the aid organization.</p><p>The firm <a href="https://www.bcg.com/news/7june2025-clarifying-bcg-involvement-with-aid-in-gaza" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> on Saturday that a team of its employees from the United States had “provided pro bono support” to set up an aid organization in Gaza to work alongside other relief efforts but said they had “failed to disclose the full nature of the work.”</p><p>The company said it regretted the situation, and that the two managing directors and partners who led the efforts had “exited from the firm.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>International aid groups warn that Gazans remain at serious risk of malnutrition. The distribution sites remain hard to reach for many Gazans, particularly those in the north.</p><p>The U.N.
