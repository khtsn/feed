Holding the rope in one hand and his smartphone in the other, he took off from the platform as the camera began recording.</p><p>Video filmed by Mr. Bhatt and verified by The New York Times shows panic unfolding as militants can be heard opening fire on tourists, killing at least two dozen people. His smile and shouts of glee are a jarring juxtaposition to the terrorist attack happening below him.</p><p>As Mr. Bhatt, who was visiting with his family from Ahmedabad, in the western Indian state of Gujarat, starts his ride down the zip line, the camera pans across an open meadow. Crowds of people are gathered around what appear to be yellow and blue tents next to a tall structure, which serves as the entrance to the valley. Others are taking a stroll or picnicking on the grass, out in the open to enjoy the spring sunshine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/30/vid30-Kashmir-attack-92189-cover/vid30-Kashmir-attack-92189-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Rishi Bhatt</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Then a gunshot can be heard in the video. Two more shots ring out in quick succession as Mr. Bhatt passes over children jumping on a trampoline.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Below him, people are panicking and there is nowhere to take cover. Some tourists are standing next to Zorb Balls, clear inflatable balls people get inside of and roll. As the gunshots continue, some people look behind their shoulder toward the entrance. An adult swiftly picks up a child. One person crouches and starts to sprint in the same direction as many others: toward a dense forest of cedar trees.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/30/30vid-attack-47935-cover/30vid-attack-47935-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Rishi Bhatt</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The footage does not appear to show the gunmen. It is toward the end of Mr. Bhatt’s nearly 40-second ride down the zip line that he starts to look around, realizing something is wrong.</p><p>“For about 20 seconds I did not realize; I was deep in my fun in the zip line,” he told one local news channel in an interview. “Then I realized that firing was going on and people were dying below, and I saw five or six people had been shot.” After he got off the zip line, Mr. Bhatt said he found his family, and they fled, managing to escape the attack unharmed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A lot remains unclear about last week’s terror attack that took more than 26 lives and injured 17 people.
