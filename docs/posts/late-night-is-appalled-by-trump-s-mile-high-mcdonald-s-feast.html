Jr., who rails against processed food and has called fast food poison, by not only making him eat McDonald’s but forcing him to take a picture while doing it.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“You can tell it’s McDonald’s, because that is a grimace.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Look at R.F.K. Jr. He’s holding that McDonald’s the way you hold a bag of weed you found in your kid’s room.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“That is the most powerful assemblage of junk food since the Yalta Conference party sub.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“Look, I know Trump has been accused and found guilty of many crimes, but certainly none worse than ‘brings Filet-O-Fish on a plane.’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-23b7eb29">‘There’s No Monopoly on Stupid’</h2><p>On “Real Time,” Bill Maher chided Democrats for losing touch with the average American, saying the party had become “a ‘Portlandia’ sketch.”</p><blockquote><p>“Maybe take the clothespins off your noses and actually converse with the other half of the country. Stop screaming at people to get with the program and instead make a program worth getting with.” <em>— BILL MAHER</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“You love to speak truth to power, and we always should, but you have completely lost the ability to speak truth to <em>[expletive]</em>.” <em>— BILL MAHER</em></p><p>“You just lost a crazy contest to an actual crazy person.” <em>— BILL MAHER</em></p><p>“Even the one concession I’ve heard a few people on the losing side offer — that liberals should stop saying that Trump voters are stupid — comes with a kind of unspoken parentheses: ‘We know they are stupid, just don’t say it.’ Yeah, I got bad news for you: They don’t have a monopoly on stupid.” <em>— BILL MAHER</em></p></blockquote><p>Greg Gutfeld had similar thoughts about the Democrats on Monday.</p><blockquote><p>“Rather than making policies that benefited Americans, they slid mindlessly into the toxic bath of identity politics. This wasn’t thinking, it was the cessation of thought. Like when you’re in a coma or watching ‘Fox &amp; Friends.’” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><blockquote><p>“It’s a question echoing throughout the liberal-verse: Why don’t we have a Rogan? Where’s our Elon? Well, it’s simple — you had Rogan. You had Elon. You even had me in college. But who didn’t? Back then, all it took was a lukewarm Zima.” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-505f1137">The Punchiest Punchlines (Fight Night Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“Ahead of Friday’s fight between YouTuber Jake Paul and boxing legend Mike Tyson, Netflix streamed a few seconds of Tyson’s bare butt. Even worse, a full hour of Jake Paul’s face.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“Well, you know, if the boxing doesn’t work out, he could always get into sumo wrestling.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“According to Netflix, more than 60 million households streamed or attempted to stream what is being called the most watched instance of elder abuse since Joe Biden debated Donald Trump.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Mike Tyson has changed, probably for the better, but I feel like deep down, a lot of us were hoping if Tyson knocked this kid out, the universe would correct itself somehow. It didn’t.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>The panel on Saturday’s “Have I Got News For You” challenged Representative Tim Burchett’s support of Trump’s cabinet picks Matt Gaetz and R.F.K.
