Which is a fancy way of saying that there are so many amazing things coming out of ovens in so many places, made with rigor by former fine-dining pastry chefs and entrepreneurial hobbyists-turned-professionals alike. This is a great time for American bakeries, and here are some of the standard bearers we have loved from our travels over the last year. <em>BRIAN GALLAGHER</em></p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-1"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-2362c54c"><a href="https://bakersbenchla.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bakers Bench</a></h2><h3 id="link-3f602df5"><span>Los Angeles</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25bakeries-list22-qtcp/23bakeries-list22-qtcp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25bakeries-list22-qtcp/23bakeries-list22-qtcp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25bakeries-list22-qtcp/23bakeries-list22-qtcp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A woman in a blue and white tie-dyed T-shirt stands in front of a bakery display case." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25bakeries-list22-qtcp/23bakeries-list22-qtcp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25bakeries-list22-qtcp/23bakeries-list22-qtcp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25bakeries-list22-qtcp/23bakeries-list22-qtcp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 768w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25bakeries-list22-qtcp/23bakeries-list22-qtcp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1536w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/3b1bca56-c027-5579-bb82-ba8b950e9344" decoding="async" width="600" height="800"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rozette Halvorson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Jennifer Yee, above, didn’t invent vegan viennoiserie, but her work in the genre has raised expectations on what bakers can achieve with nondairy butter: everything! The croissants at Bakers Bench are excellent, and once you start going for those, it’s hard to stay away from the cookies, muffins and Danishes filled with fruit from the Santa Monica Farmers’ Market. For those who look forward to the fleeting pleasures of pithivier season, Ms. Yee’s annual take is always a spectacular vision and a thrill — whether you’re vegan or not. <em>TEJAL RAO</em></p><p>1021 Alpine Street, Building A, Los Angeles; no phone; <a href="http://bakersbenchla.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bakersbenchla.com</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-49c5ea34"><a href="https://banhbylauren.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bánh by Lauren</a></h2><h3 id="link-1ea6046c"><span>New York City</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Naomi Lewkowicz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>During the pandemic, the ex-Gramercy Tavern pastry chef Lauren Tran, above, perfected her roster of Vietnamese American and French pastries at Bánh by Lauren, the hugely popular pop-up she ran with her husband, Garland Wong. Now her glorious confections — including chewy, bright green pandan honeycomb cakes, crisp macarons and airy chiffon cakes in flavors like pandan-coconut, Vietnamese coffee and Thai tea — are available at a brick-and-mortar bakery in the heart of Manhattan’s Chinatown. On the savory side, don’t miss her Chinese sausage, Cheddar and chive scones, which make for a salty, brawny counterbalance to all the sweet creaminess of the desserts. <em>MELISSA CLARK</em></p><p>42 Market Street; no phone; <a href="https://banhbylauren.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banhbylauren.com</a></p><h2 id="link-17fc183a"><a href="https://www.cafemochiko.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cafe Mochiko</a></h2><h3 id="link-5eb5d895"><span>Cincinnati</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jon Medina</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The most memorable pastries at this Ohio sensation — prepare to stand in line — are eye-catching and often straddle the border of sweet and savory. Take the ube halaya croissant, which barely contains its creamy, purple “yam jam” filling, or the sweet corn bibingka, which you may assume is topped with shards of white chocolate before you realize it’s actually Cheddar. This is the work of Elaine Uykimpang Bentz, whose Asian American bakery is only part of Cafe Mochiko’s identity. At night it becomes a Japanese restaurant inspired by yōshoku cuisine, overseen by Ms. Bentz’s husband and co-chef and -owner, Erik Bentz. The Cincinnati chili ramen, a semiregular special, is locally famous for a reason. <em>BRETT ANDERSON</em></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>1524 Madison Road, Cincinnati; 513-559-1000; <a href="https://www.cafemochiko.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cafemochiko.com</a></p><h2 id="link-150b525b"><a href="https://www.caracasbakery.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Caracas Bakery</a></h2><h3 id="link-481a4bb3"><span>Doral, Fla.</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">James Jackman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>You could spend a lazy week traversing greater Miami to learn for yourself what locals already know: that South Florida is home to one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/dining/miami-bakeries.html" title="">country’s most dynamic bakery scenes</a>. Or you could just drop by Caracas Bakery. That is where the owner, Jesús Manuel Brazón, above — with the help of his father, Manuel (also a baker), and mother, Scarlet Rojas (a cachito whisperer) — built a local following, particularly among fellow Venezuelan Americans, while honing his Latin approach to viennoserie and French-style bread baking. It all comes together in flaky croissants and pastelitos, golfeados and kouign-amann palmeritas, and a handsome bâtard the menu calls “campesino.” A second location opened in the MiMo District of Miami in 2022; a Coral Gables spot opened earlier this month. The newer bakeries offer seating (unlike the original). <em>BRETT ANDERSON</em></p><p>7884 Northwest 52nd Street, Doral, Fla.; 786-967-6687; <a href="https://www.caracasbakery.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">caracasbakery.com</a></p><h2 id="link-1748e848"><a href="https://comadrepanaderia.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comadre Panadería</a></h2><h3 id="link-38f359c2"><span>Austin, Texas</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aaron P.

Her conchas are airy with a crackly shell, and bright with flavors like berries or matcha. The pínguína de maracuya, a chocolate-dipped cake filled with passionfruit cream, is one of several offerings that taste like better versions of a nostalgic treat. The showstopper is the pink cake: toasty with corn, tart with a prickly pear buttercream and delightful with sprinkles. Despite their saccharine appearances, not one of the desserts is overly cloying, and even the coffee drinks (Texas pecan horchata! Cranberry vanilla agua fresca!) strike the playful tone of the pastries. <em>PRIYA KRISHNA</em></p><p>1204 Cedar Avenue, Austin, Texas; no phone; <a href="https://comadrepanaderia.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">comadrepanaderia.com</a></p><h2 id="link-1392a0ac"><a href="https://www.countrybirdbakery.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Country Bird</a></h2><h3 id="link-6b2d330a"><span>Tulsa, Okla.</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Molly Thrasher</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Cat Cox came to baking from the art world, and an irreverent, creative sensibility shapes the menu at her bakery in Tulsa. French onion soup Danishes, ube-blue corn coffee cakes, and stuffing-inspired porridge loaves all pop up as specials on the sourdough-heavy pastry and bread menu. When Ms. Cox first started, she wanted to work with local grains but could not find a single local mill, even though Oklahoma forms part of the country’s wheat belt. So she found a farmer to sell to her and milled her own. The bakery is open Saturdays and occasionally weekdays, announced on social media and in a newsletter. Before opening, there’s usually a line down the block. <em>MEGHAN MCCARRON</em></p><p>1644 East Third Street Unit B, Tulsa, Okla.; no phone; <a href="https://www.countrybirdbakery.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">countrybirdbakery.com</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-53c1b9fd"><a href="https://dianesplacemn.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Diane’s Place</a></h2><h3 id="link-15023512"><span>Minneapolis</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Connor Siedow</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>This all-day restaurant is where Diane Moua realizes her dream of cooking Hmong American cuisine in her personal style.

People know to grab two of Emma’s sturdy, naturally leavened baguettes if there are any left by the time you make it through the line, though the real gems are denser offerings like the whole-grain rye loaf called vollkornbrot.

Their dream was realized in St. Joseph, a community of 7,000 about 70 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Ms. Lucas is a big-city pastry chef whose breads and pastries — there is maple icing on her cardamom rolls, and rosemary streusel atop the seasonal cranberry croissant — give locals good reason to wake up early; pizza brings them back on Monday nights.

Some of Mr. Kuch’s offerings are rooted in his Cambodian American identity — he makes cornbread with the coconutty, scallion-forward flavors of Cambodian street corn — while others are odes to Houston’s multicultural makeup.

Ms. Lee’s minimalist precision extends to the bakery itself, which feels like a museum, proudly showcasing the pastries on brightly lit tables like the artworks that they are. <em>PRIYA KRISHNA</em></p><p>44 East 21st Street; no phone; <a href="https://www.lyseenyc.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lyseenyc.com</a></p><h2 id="link-72527870"><a href="https://www.machineshopphilly.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Machine Shop</a></h2><h3 id="link-b58235b"><span>Philadelphia</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-43"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gab Bonghi</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>In a former auto body shop in a one-time technical high school, Emily Riddell is transforming freshly milled flour and sugar and seasonal produce into laminated pastries like jammy egg and pepper croissants, orange cardamom morning buns and quince Danish. When the pandemic abruptly halted their wholesale baking business, Ms. Riddell and her then-business partner, Katie Lynch, pivoted, starting pop-ups to sell treats directly to the public on the building’s first floor. By 2022, Riddell had converted the space into a full-fledged bakery selling viennoiserie, as well as delicate canelés, cookies made with three types of ginger, and beautiful lemon tarts capped with torched meringue. The shop’s car lift and air pump remain — alongside velvet banquettes and a huge custom pastry case popping with some of the city’s best baked goods. <em>REGAN STEPHENS</em></p><p>1901 South Ninth Street, Philadelphia; no phone; <a href="https://www.machineshopphilly.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">machineshopphilly.com</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-22"><div><h2 id="link-303e622a"><a href="https://thisistheplace.me/celebrationcakes" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Place</a></h2><h3 id="link-1a5b31f5"><span>Camden, Maine</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-47"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chelsea Kravitz </span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-23"><div><p>Laminated pastries are having a moment right now all over North America, with dexterous bakers flexing their buttery prowess across a spectrum of different pastries. At the Place, a tiny bakery in Camden, Maine, the ethereally flaky croissant dough (made with local flour and butter) appears in many forms and flavors — swirled into cinnamon buns, folded and sugared into kouign-amanns, layered into loaves. The offerings change weekly, in tune with the seasons and available produce. Which means you’ll have to wait until summer for the savory heirloom tomato Danishes and wild blueberry hand pies. Happily, pastries like the ham and cheese croissants and morning buns dusted with coriander and lemon will tide you over until then. <em>MELISSA CLARK</em></p><p>117 Elm Street, Camden, Maine; 207-200-8198; <a href="https://thisistheplace.me/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thisistheplace.me</a></p><h2 id="link-c908df5"><a href="https://www.poulettebakeshop.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Poulette Bakeshop</a></h2><h3 id="link-3f3d6bf6"><span>Parker, Colo.</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-49"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Poulette Bakeshop</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-24"><div><p>A suburban strip mall is an unlikely destination for world-class French pastry, but the lucky residents of Parker, Colo., have exactly that in Poulette Bakeshop.
