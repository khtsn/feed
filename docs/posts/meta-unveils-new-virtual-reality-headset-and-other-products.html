It does not stand to turn a profit any time soon. That is on top of the increasingly high costs of Meta’s expansion into artificial intelligence and data centers.</p><p>By building millions of smart glasses and VR headsets, Mr. Zuckerberg hopes to bring the many people who already use his apps into a different kind of social network. And by coupling those products with the Meta AI assistant, he hopes he can make them useful enough for people to want to come back to them regularly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><em>This story is developing.
