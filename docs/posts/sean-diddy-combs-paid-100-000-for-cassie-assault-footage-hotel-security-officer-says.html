He testified that he told her no and declined again when she showed up in the lobby later that day.</p><p>That evening, Mr. Garcia testified, he received another call from Ms. Khorram, who connected him with Mr. Combs. The music mogul sounded nervous, Mr. Garcia said, and explained that he had “a little too much” to drink the day of the assault. If the video got out, “it could ruin him.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Garcia, who said he was 24 years old at the time, testified that he rebuffed Mr. Combs again, but Ms. Khorram and the mogul called another time, and Mr. Combs said “he would take care of me,” suggesting a potential payment. Mr. Garcia later called his supervisor, who agreed to sell the footage for $50,000.</p><p>When Mr. Garcia told Mr. Combs that they would be willing to sell the footage, the officer said, “He was excited, said ‘Eddy, my angel, I knew you could help. I knew you could do it.’”</p><p>When the witness recounted the conversation, Mr. Combs, dressed in a brown sweater and white collared shirt, looked over to jurors to see their reactions, which were impassive.</p><p>Mr. Garcia’s supervisor later gave him a USB drive with the footage on it, and on March 7, Mr. Garcia brought it to an address in Los Angeles, where he said he met Mr. Combs, a bodyguard and Ms. Khorram.</p><p>Mr. Garcia handed Mr. Combs the drive and assured him that it was the only copy, he testified, but he also expressed concern that he could be implicated if there was a police report about the assault. Mr. Combs then called Ms. Ventura on FaceTime, passed Mr. Garcia the phone and told Ms. Ventura to “let him know that you want this to go away too,” the officer testified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“She said that she had a movie coming out and it wasn’t a good time for this to come out and she wanted it to go away,” Mr. Garcia said Ms. Ventura, known as the singer Cassie, had told him.</p><p>At that meeting, Mr. Garcia said, he signed a document — which was shown to jurors — affirming that he had handed over the only existing copy of the surveillance video. He testified that he did not read the document in full, and that he also signed a nondisclosure agreement.</p><p>Mr. Combs then left the room, Mr. Garcia said, and returned with a brown bag and a money counter, feeding stacks of $10,000 at a time into the machine. At the end, the machine displayed $100,000 — double what his supervisor had asked for. Mr. Garcia said he understood that the additional money was for him and one of his colleagues.</p><p>“He said not to make any big purchases,” Mr. Garcia said of Mr. Combs. “I understood it as it would draw attention.”</p><p>Mr. Garcia said $50,000 went to his supervisor and $20,000 to a colleague. He kept $30,000 for himself, using the cash to buy a used car.</p><p>It is unclear how footage of the assault ended up at CNN, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-assault-video.html" title="">broadcast clips</a> of it a year ago.</p><p>Mr. Combs is facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, which involves accusations that the mogul engaged an inner circle of bodyguards and high-ranking employees to help him commit a series of crimes over two decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At least two of those criminal allegations — bribery and obstruction of justice — relate to the aftermath of the assault at an InterContinental hotel in Los Angeles.</p><p>Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges. His lawyers have said that he and his employees were involved in legitimate business operations, not a criminal conspiracy, and that the sex at issue in the government’s case was entirely consensual.</p><p>On Tuesday, jurors again saw the footage of Mr. Combs, wearing a towel around his waist, striking and kicking Ms. Ventura in an elevator bank of the hotel. During her four days on the witness stand, Ms. Ventura testified that she had been trying to escape Mr. Combs after he had hit her in the face.</p><p>After the footage was first published by CNN, Mr. Combs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/19/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-assault-video-response.html" title="">apologized</a> on social media, saying “my behavior on that video is inexcusable.” His lawyers have acknowledged that he has a pattern of violence, but they have argued that he is not a racketeer or sex trafficker.</p><p>The testimony was the most detailed yet in addressing the role of Ms. Khorram, who was recently Mr. Combs’s chief of staff and was once described by him as his “right hand.”</p><p>Prosecutors have said that Mr. Combs first tried to pay off another member of the hotel security staff before approaching Mr. Garcia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At the start of the trial, that staffer, Israel Florez, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/12/arts/sean-combs-diddy-trial" title="">testified</a> that after he responded to a call about a woman in distress on the sixth floor of the hotel, Mr. Combs tried to bribe him with a “stack of money” in exchange for his silence; he said he declined. Officer Florez, who now works for the Los Angeles Police Department, testified that he had seen surveillance footage of the assault — and even recorded clips of it on his phone — but that when he returned to work after the incident, the footage had disappeared from the computer system.</p><p>Mr. Combs’s lawyers have not disputed that their client paid hotel security to make the assault footage “go away,” but they have argued that it was to prevent “bad publicity” for both Mr. Combs and Ms. Ventura, not to obstruct any law enforcement investigation into the beating.</p><p>“No law enforcement investigation existed, period,” said Teny Geragos, one of Mr. Combs’s lawyers, at the start of the trial.</p><p>Mr. Combs is accused of sex trafficking Ms. Ventura by coercing her into drug-fueled sex marathons with male prostitutes in hotel rooms, known as “freak-offs,” while he watched and sometimes recorded. Ms. Ventura testified that she had recently arrived at a settlement agreement with InterContinental worth about $10 million.</p><p>Derek Ferguson, who was the chief financial officer of Bad Boy Entertainment, Mr. Combs’s company, also testified on Tuesday, explaining the structure of the music mogul’s businesses, executives and various bank accounts.</p><p>As part of the racketeering conspiracy charge, the government has argued that Mr. Combs used resources from his companies to “feed his every desire,” including sexually exploiting women. While Mr. Ferguson was on the stand, the government highlighted bank records that showed transfers of business funds into an account associated with one of Mr. Combs’s personal properties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The defense has countered throughout the trial that Mr. Combs’s businesses were entirely lawful and separate from his “private, personal sex life.”</p><p>On cross-examination, lawyers for Mr. Combs sought to highlight the corporate oversight over his businesses, showing organizational charts from his companies and underscoring Mr. Ferguson’s education at Harvard Business School.</p><p>Responding to a series of questions from the defense seeking to undercut the racketeering charge, Mr. Ferguson testified that during his nearly 20 years as an executive at Mr. Combs’s companies, he never saw anyone help Mr. Combs commit crimes.</p><p>“Did you see anyone enhance Mr. Combs’s reputation or the reputation of any business through emotional, physical or sexual abuse?”</p><p>“I did not,” Mr. Ferguson replied.</p><p>Asked whether he thinks “highly” of Mr. Combs, Mr. Ferguson paused for several seconds.</p><p>“I don’t know how to respond to that,” he said.</p><p>Anusha Bayya<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ben Sisario<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
