disputed July presidential election left the country on Saturday, the authorities said, as a standoff deepened at the Argentine diplomatic residence in Caracas where six Venezuelan opposition leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/americas/venezuela-opposition-leaders-argentine-embassy.html" title="">have been sheltering</a> since March.</p><p>President Nicolás Maduro has faced widespread domestic and international condemnation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/world/americas/maduro-venezuela-election-results.html" title="">for proclaiming that he won</a> that election, as well as for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/world/americas/venezuelan-government-violence-human-rights.html" title="">a violent crackdown on demonstrators</a> protesting that declaration. The United States has said that the opposition candidate, Edmundo González, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/americas/venezuela-election-gonzalez-maduro.html" title="">won.</a></p><p>On Saturday, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_o8vGTOu1k/?igsh=Z29iODByMGhtb3A2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that Mr. González had left for Spain after voluntarily seeking refuge at the Spanish embassy in Caracas. Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, said that Mr. González was <a href="https://x.com/jmalbares/status/1832619042286223845?s=46&amp;t=KSrN1Uw6lFS9gLkbUN3M5Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">traveling on a Spanish Air Force plane</a> at his own request.</p><p>“The government of Spain is committed to the political rights and physical integrity of all Venezuelans,” <a href="https://x.com/jmalbares/status/1832619042286223845" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote on X</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. González was a retired diplomat with no political ambitions when he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/americas/venezuela-election-opposition.html" title="">plucked from obscurity</a> in March to be a stand-in for the popular opposition leader María Corina Machado. A few weeks earlier, the Venezuelan Supreme Court had disqualified Ms. Machado from the election, a common tactic to keep strong competitors off the ballot. Those who know Mr. González <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/world/americas/edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-elections.html" title="">said</a> the role was not one that he had aspired to, but that he had accepted it out of a sense of duty.</p><p>On Monday, a Venezuelan court, which was issued by a court that deals with “crimes associated with terrorism,” issued an arrest warrant for Mr. González. He was charged with conspiracy, usurping power, and sabotage, among other things.</p><p>In a separate standoff, security forces have surrounded the Argentine diplomatic residence in Caracas since Friday night. The six Venezuelans had taken refuge there in March, soon after the country’s attorney general announced warrants for their arrest.</p><p>Argentina’s Foreign Ministry <a href="https://www.cancilleria.gob.ar/es/actualidad/noticias/situacion-en-venezuela-rechazo-argentino-decision-unilateral-del-regimen-de" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> on Saturday that Venezuelan intelligence security forces were surrounding the residence.

The foreign ministry said that it had proof that its facilities were being used to plan “terrorist activities” and to plot assassinations against Mr. Maduro and his government.</p><p>A representative for Brazil’s foreign ministry told The New York Times that under international law, Venezuela had no right to do such a thing.</p><p>In a separate statement, Brazil’s foreign ministry said it had been surprised to learn that Mr. Maduro’s government “intends to revoke its consent for Brazil to protect Argentina’s interests in Venezuela.”</p><p>“Brazil will remain in charge of the custody and defense of Argentine interests until the Argentine government indicates another state acceptable to the Venezuelan government to exercise the aforementioned functions,” the statement said.</p><p>Some of the Venezuelans sheltering in the Argentine diplomatic residence <a href="https://x.com/Urruchurtu/status/1832441120825209002/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted images on X</a> on Saturday morning that appeared to show armed men in uniform nearby, some wearing balaclavas.
