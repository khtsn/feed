Many of them had hoped that Mr. Trump would be open to negotiating a deal to allow the acquisition to go ahead. Instead, the president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/trump-nippon-steel-us.html" title="">confirmed</a> last month that he opposed the proposed deal.</p><p>Many auto industry executives believe that the merger could have increased competition and supply in the American steel industry, ultimately lowering steel prices.</p><p>In the United States, U.S. Steel and Cleveland-Cliffs are the only major American producers of the high-finish steel favored by automakers. Cleveland-Cliffs has long sought to acquire its rival, but such a merger has raised concerns in the auto industry that it could create a monopoly, giving the combined company the power to raise prices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By contrast, industry groups expected the proposed Nippon Steel deal to preserve competition in the market. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing major U.S., Japanese, and European automakers, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1163302/000110465924041893/tm2410212d3_defa14a.htm#:~:text=That%20result%20could%20lead%20to,sent%20to%20the%20National%20Economic" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed</a> support for Nippon Steel’s acquisition, saying that a Cleveland-Cliffs-led deal would result in “anti-competitive pricing of materials.”</p><p>Even after former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/us/politics/us-steel-nippon-biden.html" title="">rejected</a> the deal in January, Nippon Steel continued efforts to revive it. Cleveland-Cliffs has recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/business/economy/us-steel-cleveland-cliffs-nippon.html" title="">indicated</a> that it remains interested in bidding for the financially troubled U.S. Steel. Last month, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/trump-nippon-steel-us.html" title="">reiterated</a> that U.S. Steel must remain American-owned, and said he would block Nippon Steel from taking a controlling stake in the company.</p><p>For automakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/business/automakers-trouble.html" title="">struggling</a> with challenges such as rising competition from Chinese rivals, costly technological transitions, and signs of a slowdown in U.S. consumer spending, the new steel tariffs are expected to further squeeze profits. The 25 percent levies, which went into effect on Wednesday, are expected to cause steel prices in the United States to rise about 16 percent compared to prices in 2024, according to the research firm Wolfe Research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>No Exemptions for Japan:</strong> Japanese officials visiting Washington <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/japan-trump-tariffs-auto-steel-trade.html">failed to win assurances</a> that the country would be exempt from sweeping tariffs set to hit imports of metals and cars into the United States.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump Has Said ‘No Exceptions’</strong><strong>:</strong> His administration has acknowledged that exceptions undercut the power of tariffs, but it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/economy/trump-tariffs-exceptions.html">seems hard for the president to resist making deals</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Eager for Tariffs:</strong> Many companies oppose President Trump’s tariffs, but some U.S industries like steel and aluminum makers say <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/economy/trump-tariff-supporters.html">they would welcome the help</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Possibility of a Recession:</strong> President Trump declined in an interview to rule out the possibility that his economic policies, including a dizzying approach to tariffs, would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/us/politics/trump-recession-lutnick.html">cause a recession</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
