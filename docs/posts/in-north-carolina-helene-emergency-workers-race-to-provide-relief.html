North Carolina officials said more than 200 people have been rescued, including 119 people rescued on Saturday by the National Guard. There were 45 search-and-rescue teams working, with help from 19 states and the federal government. Meanwhile, residents were scrambling to find basic necessities like gas, water, food and cell service to reach family and friends.</p><p>So far in North Carolina, 11 people have died in storm-related deaths, officials said, in what they called a historic disaster. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“And tragically, we know there will be more,” Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina said at a news briefing on Sunday afternoon. “This is an unprecedented tragedy that requires an unprecedented response.” </p><p>Helene made landfall on Florida’s Gulf Coast on Thursday night and marched inland, leaving a stretch of devastation throughout the Southeast. It has killed more than 60 people across the region. </p><p>Amid the chaos of the disaster and communications blackouts, there was some confusion about the death toll in North Carolina. While Mr. Cooper reported 11 deaths statewide, he could not confirm whether that number included 10 deaths reported earlier on Sunday by officials in Buncombe County, which includes the devastated city of Asheville.</p><p>Avril Pinder, the manager of Buncombe County, said that clear skies were helping search-and-rescue crews as they canvassed the area. “We are still trying to save every single person we can,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Pinder said that they have received about 1,000 reports of people unable to find family members, but she said that some were duplicates and that she was confident that number will drop sharply once communications systems and cellphone service are restored. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It is common in the immediate aftermath of natural disasters that numbers of missing people swell as survivors become cut off from family members. For example, after a wildfire decimated the town of Lahaina on Maui last year, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/23/us/maui-missing.html" title="">list of the missing</a> included more than 1,000 names, while the final death toll was 102.</p><p>“I know that there are a lot of people who are concerned about relatives and friends that they cannot get in touch with, and it’s one of the reasons we are pushing so hard to get communications back up, because we know that a lot of these people are just simply out of communication and are OK,” Mr. Cooper said.</p><p>Sheriff Quentin Miller of Buncombe County said he would not release the names of victims until family members can be notified, which has been difficult with communications down. “Our hearts are broken with this news,” he said. “We ask that folks give our community the space and time to grieve this incredible loss.”</p><p>With reports that people have been waiting in hourslong lines for gas, with tensions rising and arguments breaking out, Sheriff Miller said he would order more deputies to patrol business districts to prevent looting.</p><p>Mr. Cooper urged residents to stay off roads — hundreds were still closed in the state — and said the state was urgently trying to get supplies to affected areas, and would be setting up “mass-feeding sites.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In many communities, the water systems were shut down, due to power outages and infrastructure damage, and residents were urged to boil water or use bottled water, if they could find it. In Weaverville, near Asheville, for example, the water plant was damaged by eight feet of rainwater, said Patrick Fitzsimmons, the town’s mayor. Officials in Asheville say that restoring the full system could take weeks. </p><p>Mr. Fitzsimmons added there was no water available in the community — either from shops or in people’s homes — and that roads were blocked by downed trees and power lines. One of the only businesses opened on Sunday was a pharmacy, he said, where residents could use the drive-through window to pick up prescriptions. </p><p>Meanwhile, in Swannanoa, where helicopters were dropping supplies, there were “complete neighborhoods that are no longer there,” said Anthony Penland, the chief of Swannanoa’s fire department. He said that a section of the main highway was gone, and that a key bridge would need to be repaired, which has been hampering his search-and-rescue teams.</p><p>Mark Barrett<!-- --> contributed reporting. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tim Arango is a correspondent covering national news.
