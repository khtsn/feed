    <h1>Trend Overload</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Consider yourself lucky if you have never heard of the “coastal grandmother aesthetic.”</p><p>Or “blueberry milk nails,” or the “mob wife aesthetic” or a hundred other blink-and-you’ll-miss-them crazes that cycle online with the ferocity of a centrifuge. These microtrends, as they’re known, tend to be associated with Gen Z. But members of that generation say they are exhausted by the onslaught of faddish clothes and new phrases they encounter every time they pick up their phones.</p><p>I’ve spent the last few months asking young people about the fashion and social media trends that are actually registering in their offline lives. More than any one trend, the teenagers and twentysomethings I spoke with wanted to talk about just <em>how many</em> trends there were, and how overwhelming it all felt.</p><p>Every generation feels pressure to keep up with trends, especially in its youth. But many members of Gen Z seem to be under particular stress: The fire hose of social media offers endless opportunities to feel left out. Others say they just can’t afford — mentally or financially — to try to keep up.</p><p>For a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/style/gen-z-trend-cycle.html" title="">new story in The Times’s Style section</a>, I talked to young people about the frenzied trend ecosystem — and what some of them were doing to escape it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-6039efd3">Keeping up</h2><p>Short-form video platforms like TikTok are fertile territory for microtrends. They get a heavy assist from fast fashion companies like Temu and Shein that sell inexpensive but poorly made clothes and accessories, available in just a few clicks on the apps.</p><p>On the first day of sixth grade, Neena Atkins noticed that several girls at her middle school wore scrunchies on their wrists. She searched for scrunchies on TikTok, and in the days that followed she was served dozens more videos in which the hair ties were being worn as bracelets.</p><p>“I distinctly remember being like, ‘Wow, am I weird?’” Neena, now 16, said. “The repetition over and over, it really seeps in to your brain.”</p><p>Because TikTok’s algorithm is designed to show viewers more of the things they already like, viewers can feel like they are passing the same billboard hundreds of times rather than once or twice a day. That can be pretty convincing, especially in combination with the age-old teenage desire to fit in.</p><p>Neena bought a 30-pack of scrunchies on Amazon, but before long, the girls in her feed were obsessing over something else. The cycle began anew.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“There were these two months where cheetah print was everywhere,” Neena added, “and now when I go on TikTok, I see people saying, like, ‘Cheetah print is getting so old.’”</p><h2 id="link-63098369">Dropping out</h2><p>Many young people I spoke to said they felt stuck in a cycle of chasing, buying and discarding in order to keep up. Others, though, are trying to move beyond it. Some are swearing off fast fashion, or limiting their clothing to a similar uniform every day. A few have deleted social media.</p><p>Before buying something, Abner Gordan, 21, a student in Manhattan, tries to ask himself whether he wants something because it appeals to his sense of style, or because he is emulating what he has seen online.</p><p>He was heartened when he saw some TikTok users push “underconsumption core,” a style of video in which they showed off their underwhelming apartments and very regular clothing.</p><p>But he was discouraged when he saw that trend lose steam after just a few months. “In a weird way, being anti-trend is very trendy,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-3d79ad64">Government Overhaul</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk and Steve Bannon at the White House in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Eric Adams</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ashley Gilbertson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At a Hamas handover of the remains of a young hostage.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><ul><li><p>Israel promised that the military campaign in Gaza would help save hostages. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages.html" title="">At least 41 have died in captivity</a>, some killed by Hamas and others in Israeli airstrikes.</p></li><li><p>Chaos has swept coastal Syria as Assad loyalists battle government security forces. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/middleeast/syria-violence.html" title="">More than 1,000 people have been killed</a> since Thursday, a war monitor said.</p></li><li><p>A group of experts detailed what <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/europe/ukraine-peace-plan-russia-war.html" title="">enforcement of a cease-fire</a> between Russia and Ukraine could look like.</p></li><li><p>Canada’s Liberal Party elects a new leader today, who will become the country’s prime minister. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/canada/canada-liberal-party-leader-prime-minister-election.html" title="">Read what to know</a>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-44201c34">Other Big Stories</h2><ul><li><p>Wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/nyregion/brush-fire-long-island-brooklyn.html" title="">erupted on Long Island</a>, injuring at least one firefighter.</p></li><li><p>A legal services company has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-hotline-tony-buzbee-lawsuits.html" title="">created a hotline</a> to collect sexual assault accusations against the music mogul Sean Combs, formerly known as Diddy.

Since then, she’s delivered a trio of pocket-size nonfiction on feminism and grief. Now Adichie is back with “Dream Count,” a novel about the braided lives of four African women — a lawyer, a banker, a travel writer and a housekeeper. In an author’s note, she explains that one character was inspired by Nafissatou Diallo, the hotel employee who accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French politician and economist, of sexual assault. Adichie wanted to “‘write’ a wrong” with a “gesture of returned dignity,” she writes. Our critic described the book, which was just longlisted for the 2025 Women’s Prize for Fiction, as “dreamy indeed: an accumulation of scenes and sensations, cloudlike in their contour, floating this way and that against the backdrop of the pandemic.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/books/review/dream-count-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie.html" title="">Read the review</a>.</p><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>Before Harper Lee published “To Kill a Mockingbird,” she wrote short stories exploring some of the themes that would make her famous: fathers and daughters, race relations, small town gossip. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/books/harper-lee-land-of-sweet-forever.html" title="">Those stories will be published this fall</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-420eedc"><span><strong>THE INTERVIEW</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Montgomery for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-marchese"><img alt="David Marchese" title="David Marchese" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/01/reader-center/author-david-marchese/author-david-marchese-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></a></p></div></div></div><p><em>This week’s subject for The Interview is Lady Gaga, whose new album, “Mayhem,” is out now.</em></p><p><strong>Your partner, Michael Polansky, is an executive producer on the album. What impact did he have on the music?</strong></p><p>He oversaw the whole process of making the record, completing it, helping me to shape the sound of the record creatively. It was an amazing thing to do with your partner, because when I start to doubt myself, there is nobody that’s going to call me on it better than he is.</p><p><strong>I could imagine that relationships are tricky in your position because you might have questions about whether someone’s feelings are genuine. How did you realize that Michael was genuine?</strong></p><p>From the moment that I met Michael, he had the most warm disposition. Yes, he was impressive, but the thing I cared about the most was he wanted to know about my family. [Pause.] I’m sorry I’m crying.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>No, it’s OK.</strong></p><p>I guess what I’m trying to say is, I knew Michael was genuine because he wanted to be my friend. He wanted to take walks with me. He took me rock climbing. I also have a pain condition [fibromyalgia], but he had this belief that I could get better, and he inspired me to have more hope about it. So, yeah, I guess I know Michael is genuine because he’s my friend.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/magazine/lady-gaga-interview.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id="link-640bc3b8"><span><strong>THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photo illustration by Jamie Chung.
