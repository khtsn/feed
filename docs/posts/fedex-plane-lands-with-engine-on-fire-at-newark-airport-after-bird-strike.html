There were three people aboard the plane, the authority said.</p><p>In a statement, FedEx said the plane was flying from Newark to Indianapolis when the bird strike occurred. “Our crew declared an emergency and returned safely to Newark,” it said, adding that the plane was being evaluated. The company did not respond to a question about what cargo, if any, was on board.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration said the bird strike damaged one of the Boeing 767’s engines. The agency said the plane, FedEx Flight 3609, was disabled on a runway. The Port Authority Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting unit, the Port Authority Police and Port Authority Operations responded to the emergency landing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The episode happened at around 8 a.m., and operations resumed at the airport a short time later.</p><p>A fire can be seen on the underside of the plane in footage <a href="https://x.com/airmainengineer/status/1895832790979264850" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared on social media</a>.
