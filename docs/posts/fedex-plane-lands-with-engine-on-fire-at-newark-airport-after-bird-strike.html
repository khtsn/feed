    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A FedEx cargo plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Saturday morning at Newark Liberty International Airport with one of its engines on fire after it struck a bird while leaving the airport, officials said.</p><p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, said there were no reported injuries. There were three people aboard the plane, the authority said.</p><p>In a statement, FedEx said the plane was flying from Newark to Indianapolis when the bird strike occurred. “Our crew declared an emergency and returned safely to Newark,” it said, adding that the plane was being evaluated.
