Support for Mr. Nasrallah, a Shiite Muslim, peaked in Sunni Arab countries in mid-September, when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-chief-sinwar-thanks-hezbollah-letter-nasrallah-2024-09-13/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hamas — a Sunni group — released a letter of support for him from its leader, Yahya Sinwar.</a></p><p>According to the analysis, attitudes toward Mr. Nasrallah began returning to their usual levels across the Middle East after the letter but rose again after the Israeli strike that killed him, reflecting anger toward Israel and enthusiasm for Mr. Nasrallah’s support for Palestinians in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Sentiment about Mr. Nasrallah was more positive on news media sites in Lebanon after his death. But FilterLabs found that commentators on Lebanese social media also focused on the damage caused by the Israeli strike.</p><p>Mr. Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for 32 years, was a towering figure across the Middle East. On Saturday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/nasrallah-death-protests.html" title="">demonstrators in several countries</a> in the region mourned him and condemned Israel’s strikes. But some communities, including in Lebanon, welcomed his death.</p><p>The FilterLabs analysis noted worries among some in Lebanon that Hezbollah had courted a war with Israel, a conflict that has caused civilian casualties and threatens to bring further destruction to Lebanon, including its capital, Beirut.</p><p>Mr. Teubner said that in the days since Mr. Nasrallah’s death, many in Lebanon have hailed him as a martyr.</p><p>“But Lebanon is more negative overall on Nasrallah than the Arab world more generally because their focus has been on the devastation that has occurred and, in all likelihood, will increase with a ground invasion,” Mr. Teubner said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Monday, Israel began what it called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-ground-invasion.html" title="">a limited incursion</a> into southern Lebanon. U.S. officials said that their Israeli counterparts told them <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html" title="">they were not planning a full-scale invasion</a>, but the Biden administration remains worried that the Israeli military might get bogged down and remain in Lebanon longer than it planned.</p><p>Iran’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah" title="">strikes on Tuesday</a>, in retaliation for the killing of Mr. Nasrallah, could further shape attitudes in the days to come.</p><p>FilterLabs uses a computer model to analyze huge numbers of online posts, from social media sites, news media publications and other internet discussion forums. The model measures the sentiments expressed in postings to determine how public opinion on various subjects has shifted. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the group has tracked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/russia-putin-attitudes-social-media.html" title="">Russian attitudes on a variety of topics.</a></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julian E.
