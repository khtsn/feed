		<p>The final week of the group stages of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2499/vct-2025-china-stage-2" target="_blank">VCT China 2025 Stage 2</a> is complete, with every team having confirmed their spots for the Stage 2 playoffs. XLG and BLG ended their second consecutive stage with a 4-1 record, but were in different groups and earned the byes to start their playoffs, while Wolves and JDG were eliminated.</p>

<p>Here is how the final group stage week went for VCT China 2025:</p>



<p>For all the Wolves fans, this week started great but cratered as soon as they lost their match against Nova Esports, who earned their first and only win in Stage 2. That secured their elimination from Stage 2, but due to their Champions points from the third-place finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>, they still have a chance to qualify, yet it is entirely out of their hands.</p>

<p>However, what led Wolves fans to that speck of hope in week four was All Gamers, who had a statement sweep win over an improved FPX. That win moved them into second place in Group Omega, above DRG and FPX on round differential. Other news included a tough loss from Trace to the already eliminated TEC, as they fell into the lower bracket off of round differential, just as FPX did.</p>

<p>Both EDG and Nova ended the final week with a win and a loss, with <span data-ref-id="12">

</span> stood out in their win over FPX, playing both Controller and Duelist while ending the week with a tie for first in K:D at 1.76. Another amazing performance was <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4885/whzy">

</span> from BLG, who was crucial in their win over EDG to end the group stage games for the year. In that sole game, whzy had a 1.45 match rating and a league-leading 293 ACS and 1.09 KPR for the week.</p>

<p>Even then, there was another player who jumped off the page for their statistics, and that was <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/41739/slowly">

</span> from TYLOO. While the results from earlier in the week effectively confirmed their qualification to the Stage 2 playoffs, slowly showed no mercy in their match against JDG. He ended the week with a league-leading 1.51 match rating, third in ACS at 286.3, tied first with 1.76 K:D, second in KPR at 1.05, and third in ADR at 179.3.</p>

<p>Now that all the group stage matches are complete, here is a quick look at how the brackets are shaping up for the Stage 2 playoffs. XLG and BLG get their byes, avoiding the first round of the upper bracket, while Trace and FPX will start in the lower bracket.</p>

<p>That leaves <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527576/edward-gaming-vs-dragon-ranger-gaming-vct-2025-china-stage-2-ubqf" target="_blank">EDG facing DRG</a> to start the upper bracket, with <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527577/all-gamers-vs-tyloo-vct-2025-china-stage-2-ubqf" target="_blank">AG and TYLOO</a> facing off immediately afterward to determine who advances to the one seeds and who must go through the lower bracket.</p>
