    <h1>Working Out</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>I generally work three days in the office, two days from home. Recently, I was working on things that necessitated my being there in person, so I worked Monday through Friday, all five days in the office. The week felt long, unending. I kept thinking, ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äôs Friday,‚Äù but there was always another day. I had expected to feel spent at the end of the week, ready to return to the hybrid schedule, but instead I felt sort of delighted. Yes, the week was long, and wasn‚Äôt that great?</p><p>We‚Äôre always complaining that life goes by so quickly, that we don‚Äôt have enough time; look, it‚Äôs summer again, how can that be? I found myself amazed at the way time seemed to elongate during my week in the office. Yes, the days seemed to be moving more slowly, but isn‚Äôt that what we want? Isn‚Äôt that the point?</p><p>Hybrid work, for many of us, emerged from Covid lockdowns. It‚Äôs been several years that I‚Äôve been working this split schedule, and while it felt novel back in 2020, lately it‚Äôs felt humdrum. I‚Äôve become so accustomed to the tempo of the week ‚Äî Monday work from home, three days in the office, work from home Friday ‚Äî that changing it up made the days feel strange, like new countries to explore.</p><p>You might say, sure, I want my life to feel longer, but I want more leisure time, not an interminable workweek. I get it. Maybe part of my satisfaction with this schedule came from not having to squeeze all my office-specific work into three days. But it‚Äôs intriguing to think that reorganizing your week can reorient your relationship with time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Maybe the week felt longer because there was so much sameness to the daily routine. This is what people complain about! Monotony! We want to mix things up! But I think the real reason the office week felt longer, in a good way, is that it felt richer, more textured. On the two days a week I normally work from home, I see a very limited number of people. I have fewer social interactions. I‚Äôm less likely to go out after work. There‚Äôs less information to process, less excitement, and that makes the days, in a way, seem less significant. I spend less time thinking about the work-from-home days, so they make up less of my larger life narrative.</p><p>Five days in the office, by contrast, was five days of commuting with the fascinating (if occasionally maddening) characters on mass transit, seeing colleagues, coffee and lunch dates, happy hours. There was more content, more surprise, more to think about. Sure, there were days when I wished I could sleep a little later and not rush out the door to catch a train. But mostly the days felt like generous canvases to fill with the interesting activity of just living.</p><p>I realize I may sound like a corporate stooge, advocating that people buckle down and get back to the office. But I think you can achieve this kind of time elongation without giving up remote work. If you feel, as I did, that those home workdays were becoming sort of boring, suboptimal entries in the logbook of how you‚Äôre spending your time, you can try varying your schedule. Work from the library, or a cafe. Make a concerted effort to meet a friend for lunch, or to get dressed and go out after working in your pajamas all day. Mess with the format of your days. Make them feel larger.</p><p>I‚Äôm sure after enough time working five days a week in the office, I‚Äôd get used to the rhythm and start to feel as if time was going by too quickly again. When I told a colleague I‚Äôd been in every day of the week, he said it sounded ‚Äúabsolutely grueling.‚Äù And I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll do it every week. But I‚Äôm definitely going to continue to fiddle with my schedule, to keep things interesting, to keep trying to slow time down.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><p>Trump Administration</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Wendt on ‚ÄúCheers.‚Äù</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NBCUniversal, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h3 id="link-60445437"><span><strong>CULTURE CALENDAR</strong></span></h3><p><strong>üì∫ ‚ÄúAdults‚Äù (Wednesday):</strong> A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/arts/television/adults-fx-sitcom-gen-z.html" title="">‚ÄúFriends‚Äù for an extremely online generation</a>, this new FX series finds five recent college graduates crashing at a borrowed house in Queens.

Marinated in a vibrant green pur√©e of jalape√±os, garlic, cilantro stems and rice vinegar, the pork takes on a tangy, spicy character that‚Äôs amplified by a relish of jalape√±o and red onion spooned on top. Eric‚Äôs recipe is flexible; you can marinate the meat for as little as 30 minutes or leave it in the fridge overnight. And for those who don‚Äôt have a grill, the pork is just as good cooked under your broiler until the edges turn brown and crisp. Serve it with tortillas or flatbread, and a big crunchy vegetable salad. Then put it on repeat all summer long.</p><h3 id="link-20a8f964"><span><strong>REAL ESTATE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Olivia Page-Pollard with her foster dog Vinny.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>The Hunt: </strong>An immigration lawyer traded Brooklyn for Jackson Heights, Queens, with $300,000 to spend.

You can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/propane-gas-grill-leak-hack/" title="">check for gas leaks</a> by spritzing a soap-water mixture and looking for bubbles. Then, get the grates super hot, and scrape them down with a grill brush. Follow that with another wipe-down with a wet rag to get rid of any remaining soot or debris. Lastly, give the clean grates a good oiling with a paper towel and some vegetable oil.
