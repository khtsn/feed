    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>At an annual gathering of tech executives and billionaires in Sun Valley, Idaho, this past July, Gina Raimondo commandeered a table near a duck pond and tried to exert her influence as the U.S. secretary of commerce to help rescue an ailing national champion.</p><p>As media moguls and business luminaries cut deals nearby, Ms. Raimondo met with chief executives from Microsoft, Google and other firms and encouraged them to order their semiconductors from the United States, including from Intel. It was important to make more chips in America, she told them, and Intel, the American chip giant, was critical to that effort.</p><p>Ms. Raimondo, who is overseeing the Biden administration’s investments in the chip industry, has made similar requests in meetings and phone calls over the past year. She has urged executives at Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, Marvell Technology and other companies to consider ordering chips from Intel’s U.S. manufacturing plants, according to eight people familiar with those requests, most of whom asked for anonymity to discuss private conversations.</p><p>A majority of the firms have rejected her overtures because Intel’s chip-making techniques are not as sophisticated as those of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s leading chip maker and their primary supplier, these people said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The doubts expressed by top tech executives show how far Intel has fallen at a moment when Ms. Raimondo is trying to rebuild American chip manufacturing. Her unofficial role as a chip salesperson underscores how much is riding on the success of Intel, a 56-year-old firm that is at the center of President Biden’s efforts to rev up domestic semiconductor production.</p><p>While the Biden administration’s endeavor involves many companies, a crucial part of its ambition is pegged to Intel, which lobbied — and helped secure votes — for the 2022 CHIPS Act.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A large construction site built into a pit in the ground, with a red crane and a silver-and-white building with an American flag on it in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf/BIDEN-INTEL-04-vphf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/93dd98ff-e89b-5009-8009-6a2d279d098d" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Construction teams building an Intel plant in Chandler, Ariz., in November 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Intel, which is the only American-owned maker of advanced logic chips, is the single biggest recipient of federal money from the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at making the United States less reliant on Asia for the tiny electronics that power everything from cars to iPads. Intel is also the sole recipient of a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/us/politics/intel-chips-semiconductor-grant.html" title="">$3 billion government contract</a> to make advanced chips for the U.S. military.</p><p>Backed by promises of more than $20 billion in government support, Intel’s chief executive, Patrick Gelsinger, has committed to invest more than $100 billion to expand in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. But Intel’s business has recently worsened, causing concern on Capitol Hill and stoking the fears of some administration officials who have worried for years about the company’s ability to deliver on its promises.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Intel’s investments alone account for more than a quarter of the total chip investments that the Biden administration has publicized. Mr. Gelsinger said investments in the United States would proceed, but Intel announced 15,000 layoffs and delayed the opening of a large factory in Ohio, a project that Mr. Biden cited in his State of the Union addresses in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/us/politics/biden-sotu-transcript.html" title="">2022</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/us/politics/biden-state-of-the-union-transcript.html" title="">2023</a>.</p><p>The company’s experience hints at the perils the government faces in designing industrial policy and picking winners and losers in a fast-moving industry. The question now is whether the administration can help Intel turn around its performance or if it will sink billions of dollars into a company that may continue to struggle.</p><p>Intel built its empire making chips for personal computers, but it missed out on the industry’s last two major products: smartphones and artificial intelligence chips. Its sales and stock price have plummeted, and potential buyers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/business/dealbook/intels-chips-qualcomm-apollo.html" title="">have been circling</a> the company.</p><p>“The nightmare scenario is you have a huge bet that just fails,” said Peter E. Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who previously worked on the chips program at the White House. “It’s natural folks looking at this would be worried.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Biden administration has committed billions to reviving American chip manufacturing. Mr. Biden and Gina Raimondo, his commerce secretary, view the funding as critical to reducing America’s reliance on Asia for the tiny devices that power everything from cars to iPhones.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The Biden administration has hedged its bets by offering money to 20 other foreign and domestic chipmakers to invest in the United States. Officials say their plan to persuade <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/business/economy/chipmakers-promise-investment.html" title="">five of the world’s leading chipmakers</a>, including Intel, to build plants in the United States is still on track. In the two years since the CHIPS Act was passed, the U.S. semiconductor industry has created 115,000 jobs and had more investments in factory construction than it did in the previous 24 years combined, a White House official said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But those efforts have been slowed by a broader downturn in the chip industry. Samsung and Micron Technology have also posted disappointing results over the past year and delayed factories planned in Texas and New York.</p><p>Micron said it was preparing for construction and expecting strong financial results next year. Samsung said its facility would start production in 2026.</p><p>In an interview, Ms. Raimondo said her requests for companies to buy Intel chips were part of a push on behalf of all U.S. manufacturers.</p><p>“Of course, I’d be doing everything I can to make sure Intel is successful,” she said. “But really, my message to any of these companies, whether it’s Apple or AMD or Nvidia, Amazon, all of them, is we need your demand for U.S.-made chips.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We’re going to get it done, and that is not dependent on any one company,” she added.</p><p>AMD, Nvidia and Marvell declined to comment. Amazon confirmed those conversations, while Apple didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p><p>To prevent taxpayer money from being wasted, the administration created certain milestones for the companies it would subsidize. Companies must hit benchmarks — like building a plant, producing chips or signing up customers — before they can receive portions of their funds.</p><p>Like most companies, Intel has not yet received its first financial infusion under the program. And in recent months, it has been sparring with the government over the milestones it must hit before it gets funding, five people familiar with the talks said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Intel’s chief executive, Patrick Gelsinger, was a guest of President Biden at the 2022 State of the Union address.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Al Drago</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Gelsinger, who has spent the past three months restructuring the company and reassuring investors, said in an interview that he was frustrated with the process.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“There’s been renegotiations on both sides,” Mr. Gelsinger said. “My simple message is, ‘Let’s get it finished.’”</p><h2 id="link-2e839df1">America’s Champion</h2><p>Ms. Raimondo first met Mr. Gelsinger on a Zoom call in early 2021, where they joked about both being new to their positions. The two had just stepped into roles on opposite coasts of the country, where their interests would quickly become entangled.</p><p>Ms. Raimondo — the former governor of Rhode Island and a venture capitalist — had to immediately contend with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/business/economy/chips-semiconductors-shortage.html" title="">a global chip shortage</a>, which was shuttering American car factories and slowing the economy.</p><p>The Biden administration was also shaken by the country’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/29/technology/taiwan-chips.html" title="">dependence on Taiwan</a>, home to TSMC, for advanced chips. Chasing bigger profits, most American chip companies had relocated their manufacturing to Asia, where workers were skilled and cheap. But relying on Taiwan seemed increasingly risky as China sought to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/world/asia/china-taiwan-war-games.html" title="">bring the island under its control</a>.</p><p>In 2021, Ms. Raimondo’s deputies calculated that an interruption in Taiwan’s chip supply could be as harmful to the U.S. economy as the Great Depression had been, two government officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Gelsinger took over Intel with a plan to catch up to TSMC’s technology and build an expansive new factory business. He wanted the government to help bankroll that effort and joined Ms. Raimondo and other executives in pushing Congress for broader funding. Mr. Gelsinger met with more than 100 lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 to argue that American-owned chip factories were vital to the country’s future.</p><p>In March 2022, Mr. Gelsinger was Mr. Biden’s guest at the State of the Union address. In his speech, Mr. Biden described a $20 billion project that Intel had planned for Ohio as a “field of dreams” and said that the company would invest $100 billion across the United States.</p><p>“That would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history. And all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill,” Mr. Biden said to a standing ovation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nancy Pelosi, then the House speaker, flanked by a group of House Democrats, showcasing the CHIPS For America Act outside the U.S. Capitol in July 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden holding a note passed to him by an aide notifying him that Congress passed a bill to subsidize domestic chips manufacturing, at the White House in July 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Brenner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In late July, Congress voted to approve <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/business/economy/chip-industry-congress.html" title="">the CHIPS and Science Act</a>, one of the most ambitious attempts ever to reshape industry. It gave the Commerce Department $50 billion of funding and a $75 billion loan facility, and created a generous tax credit equal to a quarter of a company’s investments.</p><p>In their Washington office, Intel’s lobbyists watched the livestream of the House vote, sharing bottles of beer and congratulations.</p><h2 id="link-34cafac1">Fears of Phantom Plants</h2><p>As they designed the chips program, Ms. Raimondo and Biden officials weighed how to support Intel while safeguarding taxpayer money. They were already questioning whether Intel could follow through on its promises, several officials said.</p><p>David Yoffie, a longtime Intel board member, said he had told officials that Intel had a history of struggling to make chips for others. “Intel was going down a path that I wasn’t confident would succeed,” Mr. Yoffie said.</p><p>Caitlin Legacki, a former Commerce Department official, said there also was a fear that “Intel is going to take chips money, build an empty shell of a factory and then never actually open it, because they don’t have customers.” This is why the program was designed to withhold payments until companies hit certain milestones, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Intel’s plant in Arizona was a cautionary tale.
