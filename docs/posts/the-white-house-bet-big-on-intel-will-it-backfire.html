It was important to make more chips in America, she told them, and Intel, the American chip giant, was critical to that effort.</p><p>Ms. Raimondo, who is overseeing the Biden administration’s investments in the chip industry, has made similar requests in meetings and phone calls over the past year. She has urged executives at Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, Marvell Technology and other companies to consider ordering chips from Intel’s U.S. manufacturing plants, according to eight people familiar with those requests, most of whom asked for anonymity to discuss private conversations.</p><p>A majority of the firms have rejected her overtures because Intel’s chip-making techniques are not as sophisticated as those of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s leading chip maker and their primary supplier, these people said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The doubts expressed by top tech executives show how far Intel has fallen at a moment when Ms. Raimondo is trying to rebuild American chip manufacturing.

Intel is also the sole recipient of a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/us/politics/intel-chips-semiconductor-grant.html" title="">$3 billion government contract</a> to make advanced chips for the U.S. military.</p><p>Backed by promises of more than $20 billion in government support, Intel’s chief executive, Patrick Gelsinger, has committed to invest more than $100 billion to expand in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. But Intel’s business has recently worsened, causing concern on Capitol Hill and stoking the fears of some administration officials who have worried for years about the company’s ability to deliver on its promises.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Intel’s investments alone account for more than a quarter of the total chip investments that the Biden administration has publicized. Mr. Gelsinger said investments in the United States would proceed, but Intel announced 15,000 layoffs and delayed the opening of a large factory in Ohio, a project that Mr. Biden cited in his State of the Union addresses in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/us/politics/biden-sotu-transcript.html" title="">2022</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/us/politics/biden-state-of-the-union-transcript.html" title="">2023</a>.</p><p>The company’s experience hints at the perils the government faces in designing industrial policy and picking winners and losers in a fast-moving industry. The question now is whether the administration can help Intel turn around its performance or if it will sink billions of dollars into a company that may continue to struggle.</p><p>Intel built its empire making chips for personal computers, but it missed out on the industry’s last two major products: smartphones and artificial intelligence chips. Its sales and stock price have plummeted, and potential buyers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/business/dealbook/intels-chips-qualcomm-apollo.html" title="">have been circling</a> the company.</p><p>“The nightmare scenario is you have a huge bet that just fails,” said Peter E.

Samsung and Micron Technology have also posted disappointing results over the past year and delayed factories planned in Texas and New York.</p><p>Micron said it was preparing for construction and expecting strong financial results next year. Samsung said its facility would start production in 2026.</p><p>In an interview, Ms. Raimondo said her requests for companies to buy Intel chips were part of a push on behalf of all U.S. manufacturers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Of course, I’d be doing everything I can to make sure Intel is successful,” she said. “But really, my message to any of these companies, whether it’s Apple or AMD or Nvidia, Amazon, all of them, is we need your demand for U.S.-made chips.”</p><p>“We’re going to get it done, and that is not dependent on any one company,” she added.</p><p>AMD, Nvidia and Marvell declined to comment. Amazon confirmed those conversations, while Apple didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p><p>To prevent taxpayer money from being wasted, the administration created certain milestones for the companies it would subsidize. Companies must hit benchmarks — like building a plant, producing chips or signing up customers — before they can receive portions of their funds.</p><p>Like most companies, Intel has not yet received its first financial infusion under the program.

Chasing bigger profits, most American chip companies had relocated their manufacturing to Asia, where workers were skilled and cheap. But relying on Taiwan seemed increasingly risky as China sought to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/world/asia/china-taiwan-war-games.html" title="">bring the island under its control</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In 2021, Ms. Raimondo’s deputies calculated that an interruption in Taiwan’s chip supply could be as harmful to the U.S. economy as the Great Depression had been, two government officials said.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger took over Intel with a plan to catch up to TSMC’s technology and build an expansive new factory business. He wanted the government to help bankroll that effort and joined Ms. Raimondo and other executives in pushing Congress for broader funding. Mr. Gelsinger met with more than 100 lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 to argue that American-owned chip factories were vital to the country’s future.</p><p>In March 2022, Mr. Gelsinger was Mr. Biden’s guest at the State of the Union address.
