These are just the losses, of course — $130 billion worth. The total wagers placed by Americans every year, he estimates, passes $1 trillion. Taken together, the two figures suggest that in 2022 Americans bet the equivalent of nearly 4 percent of gross domestic product and lost more than 10 percent of that money on those bets.</p><p>In Silver’s telling, this is not merely a story about the addictive appeal of making low-stakes wagers on your phone, but about a much larger drift toward a more volatile culture of risk-taking, across domains from professional sports to dating apps to venture capital and even, through the pandemic emergency and after, public health. “The activities that everyone agrees are capital-G Gambling — like blackjack and slots and horse racing and lotteries and poker and sports betting — are really just the tip of the iceberg,” he writes. “They are fundamentally not that different from trading stock options or crypto tokens, or investing in new tech startups.”</p><p>The result is an emergent rivalry that often resembles a culture war and is sometimes waged in partisan terms. On one side are relatively risk-averse groups — academics, the media and most political actors in the liberal mainstream — that Silver describes as members of a community he calls “the Village.” On the other side are a loose alliance of risk-takers — poker players and also N.B.A. nuts, venture capitalists and crypto speculators — Silver calls “the River,” which he divides into subcommunities.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Upriver” comprises the high-minded intellectuals who call themselves rationalists and effective altruists and view the world through calculations of expected value. “Mid-river” is embodied by Wall Street and Silicon Valley, where investors hungry for astronomical returns countenance liquidations of the country’s taxi industry and degradations of its eldercare systems, for instance. “Downriver” is table gambling and sports books, and, below that, the legal and moral gray zone of what he calls “the Archipelago,” represented by crypto’s more volatile corners and other sundry scams.</p><p>Sports betting illustrates the downriver drift. The Supreme Court functionally legalized sports gambling only in May 2018, and because the country’s experiment with on-demand gambling is so young, it’s not entirely clear yet what its negative effects are. And as with our experiment with marijuana legalization, it’s sometimes hard to separate those effects from moral panic. But according to one <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/22/us-sports-gambling-far-from-progressive" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> early this year, 39 percent of American men aged 18 to 49 have an online sports betting account, and 38 percent of Americans with such accounts reported betting more than they should. Almost 20 percent said they’d recently lied about how much they were gambling — about the same percentage that reported losing money that was intended to meet a financial obligation. In New Jersey, in just five years, the number of calls to the state’s gambling addiction hotline has tripled.</p><p>Perhaps the most concerning red flag came in a preprint <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4903302" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> this month from a team of researchers from U.C.L.A. and the University of Southern California. In states that legalized and enabled online sports gambling, the researchers found, the likelihood of bankruptcy rose by 28 percent — not just among gamblers, whether casual or compulsive, but statewide. Relatedly, average credit scores went down — three times as much in places that enabled online gambling as in places that legalized only in-person betting — and debt collections went up. The effects were larger in low-income communities, which is not surprising: Families with smaller savings will most likely spend a much larger share of those savings gambling than those with more cash to spare, and do so with much less of a buffer to protect against losses.</p><p>None of these effects are necessarily huge in absolute terms — the total number of nonbusiness bankruptcies filed last year in the United States was <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2024/01/26/bankruptcy-filings-rise-168-percent#:~:text=According%20to%20statistics%20released%20by,cases%20in%20the%20previous%20year" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">around 430,000</a>, average credit scores in states with online access to sports books only dropped one percent, and debt collections rose by only an average of $30 per consumer. But given the size of states and the complexities of personal finance, the fact that the effects are visible at all at the population scale is remarkable.</p><p>Other effects may be even more alarming. Across whole counties, legalization of online sports betting reduces stock market investment by households by nearly 14 percent, academics from Northwestern, Brigham Young University and the University of Kansas <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4881086" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently found</a>. For every $1 spent on sports gambling, they write, an average household will, on net, invest $2 less — which suggests that America’s recent risk creep is not just a matter of drawing more adherents from the Village to the River, but also pulling them and their money from the fairly stable and secure risk-taking investments of the Mid-river into the much more volatile worlds downriver. As in any casino, there are winners. But the phrase “casino economy” is rarely meant as a compliment. And, on net, this appears to be a fairly clear-cut social loss.</p></div></div><div><div><p>And so taken together the research does raise a fundamental question: Why exactly are we doing this? Who was hurt by longstanding — if, yes, softly patronizing — prohibitions against gambling? What are the social benefits of doing so much more of it? And if legalizing online sports books and wallpapering the lives of Americans with enticing advertisements for them strike you as a bad idea — or at least not especially thought-through — well, what does that imply about the country’s apparent shift toward risk-forward libertarianism rather than risk-shy paternalism in recent years? Take down Chesterton’s fence and many more people are going to make the leap on a hope and a prayer. Sometimes on a lark.</p><h3 id="link-NaN"><span>*</span></h3><p>The River and the Village are among the more memorable and illuminating new social typologies I’ve come across in recent years, and in certain ways a better fit for aspects of our ongoing culture war than “right” and “left.” They also imply a particular, somewhat triumphalist history of those years, which took us from fights over universal health care and trigger warnings through the jagged disorder of the Trump years and the tumult of a pandemic, which confronted the country with an entirely novel risk landscape but also enabled a gambling and day-trading stimulus-check boom, and pushed the country out the other side considerably more libertarian on matters of public health. Even if, all along, both sides of the Covid culture war were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/opinion/covid-pandemic-2020-or-covid-pandemic-politics.html" title="">both more aligned and more ambivalent</a> than public wisdom now appreciates, the pandemic was a looking glass, through which a “Don’t Tread on Me” nation became still more fetishistic about individual autonomy and freedom from collective responsibilities. “The River is winning,” as Silver writes. “Silicon Valley and Wall Street are still accumulating more and more wealth. Las Vegas is taking in more and more money. In a world forged not by the toil of human hands but by the computations of machines, those of us who understand the algorithms hold the trump cards.”</p><p>Silver isn’t blind to the downsides of these trends, both within the world of gambling and beyond. He notes, for instance, that Americans live on average five fewer years than our G.D.P. alone would imply, suggesting that the difference may come down to the country’s larger appetite for risk-taking. He <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2024/08/08/nate-silver-wants-to-teach-you-how-to-be-a-better-gambler/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">describes</a> the low-end, down-market corners of the sports-book world as “definitely predatory.” He takes issue with some of the ruthless utilitarian logic of effective altruism, which discards common-sense ethical intuitions as so much sentimentality or superstition. And he spends several mesmerizing chapters in the company of Sam Bankman-Fried, the fraudulent crypto billionaire and avowed effective altruist who seems to straddle all the various tributaries of the River and looks today to many like a kind of representative stand-in for its problems.</p><p>Before his downfall, Bankman-Fried famously described the basic crypto business model as a Ponzi scheme — and did so casually, without seeming to understand what was problematic about building not just an offshore trading empire, but also a future-focused philanthropic project, on the back of financial fraud. But perhaps the most memorable and revelatory moment of his somewhat brief life as the next Warren Buffett and effective altruism’s version of Bill Gates came during a <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/sam-bankman-fried/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">podcast interview</a> with the libertarian economist and intellectual Tyler Cowen. Presented with a game of chance in which there was a 51 percent chance of doubling global value and a 49 percent chance of total destruction of the universe, Bankman-Fried told Cowen that he would choose to play the game and would take those odds. More than that: that he would make that choice not just once, crossing his fingers, but continuously and confidently, given the logic of positive expected value.</p><p>Silver faults Bankman-Fried for being reckless with risk. But squint at the world in a certain way, or look at it too much through the prism of social media, and it can begin to seem that even if the onetime boy king of crypto is now to most a cautionary tale, his basic manner of thinking is thriving and crowding out others. It is, after all, the language of many of the country’s most conspicuous “winners” — from Silicon Valley founders and venture capitalists to self-described rationalists and ruthless number-crunchers like Silver himself. Talk to those Americans most eager to debate, discuss and promote risk-taking, and what you get, Tim Wu <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/books/review/on-the-edge-nate-silver.html" title="">wrote</a> in his review of “On the Edge,” “is a glimpse of the economy of the future.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>But consider the country from other vantages and the overall trend toward expected-value thinking and “on-risk” behavior is not nearly as clear. Americans are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/american-workers-moving-states-.html#:~:text=The%20decline%20in%20moving%20rates,to%20move%20than%20younger%20people." title="">moving less</a> than they used to, which offers a partial explanation for why economic mobility <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/the-fading-american-dream/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has fallen</a> over the last generations. Behavioral response to the pandemic threat was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/opinion/covid-pandemic-2020-or-covid-pandemic-politics.html" title="">much more uniform</a> than we’ve told ourselves since, and pretty damn risk-averse. There has been a post-pandemic spike in new business startups, but the spike followed a slump that lasted <a href="https://x.com/justinwolfers/status/1824529318900338892?s=43&amp;t=Bn6Q8RbWQIKo2tkMMzQOFg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than a decade</a>. After decades in retreat, unions are finding their footing again, and despite what it may feel like, the country’s social safety net seems to be somewhat steadily <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/neoliberalism-and-its-enemies-part" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">growing</a>. Teenagers are <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/12/29/todays-teens-are-less-interested-in-sex-and-crime-study-finds/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drinking less</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/9/11887580/teen-behavior-2015" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">doing drugs less,</a> having sex less and having fewer children than they were a few decades ago, when kids who were said to be out of control produced something like a moral panic, though the great moderation of America’s youth has since produced its own version, with certain worrywarts anxious that children are now too coddled for their own good (and perhaps too much for their own mental health).</p><p>By some of these measures, some more risk-taking may well be to the good. Personally, I think it’d be better if children were left a little freer at somewhat younger ages to play and explore the worlds around them. Probably, higher rates of new business formation are a sign of the productive dynamism that has also helped make the country’s pandemic recovery much stronger than that of America’s peers (though more generous government spending surely helped, too).</p><p>But I don’t really think the GameStop bull run and the meme-stock craze that followed were an especially healthy or productive response to stimulus checks and idle time while working from home. And I certainly don’t think it’s worth pining for the days when so many teenagers were getting pregnant and giving birth, particularly when those declines have been so <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/08/02/why-is-the-teen-birth-rate-falling/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pronounced</a> among Black and Hispanic teens, whose rates of pregnancy have converged sharply toward those of white teenagers.</p><p>Is it possible to draw these threads together into a single narrative about the country’s appetite for risk? One simplistic synthesis, from the center-left and its sympathizers in the Village, would be that profit-seeking forces have fought to expose larger and larger slices of economic and social life to their own predations, with the country otherwise drifting mostly in other directions — perhaps, on the whole, toward preferences of more protection and stability. (In this context, it may be worth pointing out that large majorities of Americans <a href="https://x.com/caulfieldtim/status/1802723158346387800?s=12&amp;t=Bn6Q8RbWQIKo2tkMMzQOFg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still approve</a>, retrospectively, of key pandemic mitigation measures.)</p><p>Another perspective, from the capitalist center-right and from the willing gamblers of the River, might be that we are seeing the country’s natural entrepreneurs in a kind of revolt against a creeping “safetyism” that invariably limits their upside and downsizes their public status as well-deserving oligarchs — or at least “we built that” heroes of the petit bourgeoisie. (In this context, it may be worth pointing out that a lot of Americans now seem to regard the 2020 project of Covid mitigation as unnecessary fearmongering, though the pandemic ultimately resulted in nearly 1.5 million excess Americans deaths.)</p></div></div><div><div><p>To me, both of these analyses have some explanatory merit. But at the risk of being both simplistic and moralistic I would emphasize a somewhat more basic set of points — that not everything is a card game, that not every circumstance benefits from being played like one and that it is much easier to tolerate risk-taking in any endeavor when you are gambling with someone else’s cash or with the knowledge of some reliable backstop, financial or otherwise. In a revealing and somewhat out-of-character moment in “On the Edge,” a panicked Bankman-Fried says as much to Silver. “Life isn’t poker; life’s 3,000 poker games going on simultaneously,” he says. “And it’s not even explicit what they are … it’s just like everything in a wild messy milieu.”</p><p>Americans love Las Vegas. But everyone other than those Silver affectionately calls “degenerate gamblers” tap out after a few days sweating under fluorescent lights and eating at 24-hour buffets (or, if you’re feeling flush, a distant outpost of some globally famous restaurant from New York or Los Angeles or London). The addictive draw of a gambling floor is obvious to anyone who visits. But it’s equally obvious to almost all that no one should really want to live there.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
