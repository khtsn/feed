But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/world/asia/south-korea-presidential-election-candidates.html" title="">whoever wins</a> — the left-wing front-runner Lee Jae-myung or his conservative rival Kim Moon-soo — will lead a nation in crisis.</p><p>South Korea’s economic growth has sputtered to a snail’s pace. Its income gap is wider than ever. Its suicide rates are among the highest, and its birthrates the lowest, in the world. Yet, the country has never been more politically divided — between the left and right, between generations and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/asia/south-korean-women-election.html" title="">between young men and women</a>. Whoever becomes the president will not be accepted by a large swath of the polarized society.</p><p>South Korea also faces formidable challenges from abroad. North Korea is threatening to use its expanding nuclear arsenal against South Korea. Russia has signed a mutual defense treaty with the North and is helping <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/world/asia/north-korea-russia-weapons.html" title="">modernize its military</a>. But President Trump has asked why the United States should spend so much money to keep its troops in South Korea. He has also slapped steep tariffs on cars, steel and other products that are crucial for South Korea’s export-driven economy.</p><p>South Korea needs to repair strained diplomatic ties with China, its largest trade partner, to help spur exports and economic growth. But the United States, its only military ally, is asking it to join efforts to contain China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“A daunting and complex crisis is buffeting us,” said Mr. Lee, the Democratic Party candidate who is leading in the polls. “We must turn the crisis into opportunities.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party candidate, who is leading in polls, has said he would use his power to bring the country together and revive the economy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jun Michael Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Should he be elected, Mr. Lee will take office as one of the most powerful leaders since South Korea introduced popular elections in the late 1980s. He will be backed by his Democratic Party, which controls Parliament with a large majority. His party has vowed to push bills through Parliament that critics said would increase his influence over the judiciary.</p><p>The election is seen as a referendum on former President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived imposition of martial law, for which he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/asia/south-korea-removes-impeached-president.html" title="">expelled from office</a>. That gave Mr. Lee a head start and polls leading up to the election showed him leading Mr. Kim, the candidate of the right-wing People Power Party​, by around 10 percentage points.</p><p>His anticipated victory “is not thanks to any particular policy proposals, but rather a result of Yoon’s spectacular collapse,” said Prof. Leif-Eric Easley of Ewha Womans University in Seoul.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Lee has said he would use his power to bring the country together and revive the economy. But his supporters want him to pass special bills through Parliament to launch more extensive investigations into Mr. Yoon’s martial law and ​to ​probe allegations of corruption surrounding his family. ​</p><p>Mr. Kim has also promised national healing. But he has stoked the same right-wing fear and indignation that drove Mr. Yoon to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/10/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law-president-yoon.html" title="">send military troops</a> to the Democrat-controlled Parliament to try to impose martial law.​ He has warned that if elected, Mr. Lee would turn into “a monster” and abuse his immense power for political retribution​.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kim, the candidate of the right-wing People Power Party​, has also promised national healing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahn Young-Joon/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Political polarization will continue,” said Sung Deuk Hahm, dean of the Graduate School of Political Studies at Kyonggi University. “Lee Jae-myung must show a good economic performance to fend off challenges to the legitimacy of his presidency.”</p><p>Mr. Lee still faces his own legal jeopardy: he has been on trial on several criminal charges, including violating election laws. There is a legal debate over whether his trials should continue if he wins the election or should be suspended until after his five-year term. The nation’s Constitution doesn’t provide a clear answer. The Constitutional Court will likely have to weigh in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Until then, “uncertainty and confusion will persist,” said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership.</p><p>But if anything, Mr. Lee is a survivor.</p><h2 id="link-1682366d">From a slum to presidential favorite</h2><p>Growing up in a slum south of Seoul, he only finished elementary school before he went to work in sweatshops as a teenager. But he eventually became a human rights lawyer, mayor, governor and the head of South Korea’s largest political party and its presidential candidate twice.</p><p>He lost the 2022 election to Mr. Yoon. His legal troubles deepened, but his image as a victim of political persecution hardened among his supporters, when prosecutors under Mr. Yoon went after him, his family and his former aides with multiple criminal charges. His political fortune shifted after the unpopular Mr. Yoon declared martial law and angry South Koreans pushed back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Lee’s supporters at a rally in Seoul on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jun Michael Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Lee’s supporters have rallied behind his reputation as an administrator who gets things done — something the country sorely needs after three years of dysfunctional governance under Mr. Yoon. They have also expressed hopes that he would push through long-overdue reforms, such as overhauling the country’s prosecution service, which has been accused of meddling in politics.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But his detractors, including ​elderly voters and the right-wing political elites affiliated with the People Power Party, have called him a dangerous leftist who would undermine South Korea’s alliance with Washington for the sake of improving ties with North Korea and China.</p><p>Mr. Lee has recognized political polarization as one of the biggest challenges he would face as president. (He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/03/world/asia/south-korea-opposition-leader-stabbing.html" title="">narrowly escaped death</a> when he was stabbed in the neck by a politically motivated assailant last year.) But he must ​tread cautiously in addressing the problem.</p><p>Mr. Yoon and others involved in the imposition of martial law are standing trial on insurrection charges. While Mr. Lee has promised more investigations, many right-wing South Koreans say that Mr. Lee and his party were also responsible for Mr. Yoon’s martial law, because their obstructive tactics in Parliament forced Mr. Yoon to the extremes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Military vehicles and police near the National Assembly in Seoul following Mr. Yoon’s declaration of martial law in December.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

He talked less about traditional left-wing causes, like wealth redistribution and higher taxes for the rich, focusing more on economic growth.</p><p>Mr. Lee would also face a delicate ​balancing act in diplomacy.</p><p>He has tried to dispel the right-wing accusation that he ​was “pro-China” and “anti-U.S.” by ​emphasizing that the alliance with Washington as the bedrock of South Korean diplomacy. But he has also appealed to his left-wing base by promising to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/world/asia/south-korea-china-election.html" title="">improve ties with China and North Korea</a> without ​upsetting the alliance with ​Washington.</p><p>That strategy has detractors in Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A supporter of former President Yoon taking photos with a banner featuring the impeached leader during a rally in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

But “economic dependence on China,” he warned, “only deepens their malign influence and complicates our defense decision space during times of tension.”</p><p>Mr. Kim has promised to make South Korea a more reliable ally of the United States. But he has also championed an idea that will also disturb policymakers in Washington: South Korea, he said, should reintroduce American tactical nuclear weapons or prepare to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/world/asia/south-korea-nuclear-arsenal.html" title="">build its own nuclear weapons</a> to counter North Korea.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Choe Sang-Hun is the lead reporter for The Times in Seoul, covering South and North Korea.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
