At least one other explosive device was discovered and dismantled. The police are still investigating, but they said the devices resembled improvised bombs made in the West Bank.</p><p>The buses had emptied of passengers before the explosions, which caused no injuries. But the blasts jarred Israelis, recalling the deadly bus bombings of the mid-1990s and early 2000s, and the country was put on a terrorism alert.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately called for “a massive operation” in the West Bank, after weeks of what the Israeli military describes as a campaign to root out militant groups and prevent terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians. Israel has shifted its attention to the centers of militancy in the northern West Bank as its campaign against Hamas in Gaza has wound down.</p><p>Speaking at the military’s officers’ training school on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu said that troops would remain in the West Bank “as long as needed” and that sending tanks in for the first time in decades meant one thing: “We are fighting terrorism with all means and everywhere.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Forensics personnel inspecting a bus after an improvised bomb exploded on Thursday in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nir Elias/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Friday, both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Katz, the defense minister, made rare visits to an area known as the Tulkarem refugee camp, one of the crowded neighborhoods where refugees who fled or were expelled during the 1948 war that surrounded Israel’s creation and their descendants were housed.</p><p>The area, one of the focuses of Israel’s offensive, is nominally under the control of the Palestinian Authority, a body that exerts limited power in parts of the West Bank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Israeli military operation across several West Bank cities has displaced roughly 40,000 Palestinians from their homes, in what experts say is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/world/middleeast/west-bank-palestinian-displacement.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">the biggest displacement of civilians</a> in the territory since the Arab-Israeli war of 1967.</p><p>The military denies that there have been any forced evacuations in the West Bank. A military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, said recently that in some cases people had been ordered to leave specific buildings close to militant hide-outs, but that people were generally allowed to move around unimpeded.</p><p>Roughly 3,000 people have been able to return to al-Faraa camp, near Tubas. But Palestinians have said they fear a veiled Israeli attempt to permanently displace Palestinians from their homes and exert greater control over areas administered by the Palestinian Authority.</p><p>Mr. Katz said in a statement on Sunday that 40,000 Palestinians had left two refugee camp areas in Tulkarem and a third one in Jenin, and that they were now “empty of residents.” Mr. Katz added that UNWRA, the main United Nations agency providing assistance in the camps, was no longer functioning there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“I have instructed the military to prepare for a long stay over the coming year in the purged camps and not to allow residents to return and terrorism to grow back,” he added.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Tulkarem refugee camp, where refugees from the 1948 war and their descendants were originally housed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fadi Yassen/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on Sunday saying it considered Mr. Katz’s statements, along with the deployment of tanks and what it described as the intimidation of unarmed civilians, to be “a dangerous escalation.” It said Israel was trying to entrench a policy of forced displacement in the West Bank.</p><p>The ministry called for international intervention to curb what it described as Israel’s “unchecked aggression,” and “to compel Israel to halt its assault on our people and their fundamental right to remain on their land.”</p><p>The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, reported on Sunday that 27 people had been killed during the Israeli campaign in Jenin, which began more than a month ago, and that more than 100 homes had been demolished. Israel, it said, had destroyed streets and electricity and water lines on Sunday in Qabatiya, south of Jenin.</p><p>Asked how long the residents might be kept from their homes, a spokesman for Mr. Katz, Adir Dahan, said everything was “subject to the security situation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Israeli military declined to comment on that issue and directed questions to the defense ministry.</p><p>But the military said in a statement that it was expanding offensive activity to other towns in the Jenin area of the northern West Bank and that a tank division would operate in Jenin. The military said its forces had apprehended 26 terrorism suspects over the weekend and confiscated three guns and other weapons.</p><p>The Israeli military says it rips up roads to expose explosive devices planted beneath the surface.</p><p>Fatima AbdulKarim<!-- --> contributed reporting from Ramallah, in the West Bank, and <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> from Israel.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner">More about Isabel Kershner</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
