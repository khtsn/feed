But in October, it’s even more rare,” he added. “The last time we had 94 all the way in October was 2012.”</p><p>The heat was expected to peak mid-week, from Tuesday to Thursday, but high temperatures were expected to last through the weekend, said Mr. Flynn, who described the heat wave as the sort of “long duration” event that can raise the risk of illness, or even cause heat-related deaths.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/multimedia/02xp-heat-zwgv/02xp-heat-zwgv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/multimedia/02xp-heat-zwgv/02xp-heat-zwgv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/multimedia/02xp-heat-zwgv/02xp-heat-zwgv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A father and son walk in the water with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/multimedia/02xp-heat-zwgv/02xp-heat-zwgv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/multimedia/02xp-heat-zwgv/02xp-heat-zwgv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/multimedia/02xp-heat-zwgv/02xp-heat-zwgv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/multimedia/02xp-heat-zwgv/02xp-heat-zwgv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People cooling off at Crissy Field in San Francisco on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Scott Strazzante/San Francisco Chronicle, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Inland from San Francisco, temperatures have been even higher this week. The city of Santa Rosa hit 102 degrees on Tuesday, and San Rafael hit 105. In San Jose, it was 100 degrees. All three cities broke their previous records for Oct. 1, which were set during a heat wave in 1980, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>The cause of this week’s heat is offshore winds, which are blowing from inland out to coastal areas, said Mr. Flynn, the meteorologist. Typically, San Francisco stays cool even when nearby inland cities like Sacramento are broiling, because of the Pacific and the breeze blowing in off the ocean, which creates what’s known as the marine layer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><em>“</em>The only way for us to get these high temperatures on the coast is to have offshore wind — from inland out to sea,” said Mr. Flynn. “When we have that, that’s much dryer air. So this is a very dry heat,” he said.</p><p>Other parts of California have also seen temperatures way above the average for this time of year as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/30/western-record-heat-phoenix-california/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a heat wave baking the Southwest</a> has also led to alarmingly high temperatures in Southern and Central California.</p><p>According to officials, the dry heat is introducing another concern across the state, which is the heightened risk of fire in a season in which wildfires have already scorched a <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/california/wildfires-california-1-million-acres/3668165/?os=wtmb&amp;ref=app" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">total of a million acres</a>.</p><p>The National Weather Service measures the dryness of potential wildfire fuel, “and we’re basically as dry as it gets,” said Mr. Flynn.</p><p>Amid rising temperatures in Southern California, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/line-fire-san-bernadino-evacuations.html" title="">the Line fire</a>, which has burned for nearly a month in San Bernardino County, flared over the weekend, when officials ordered new evacuations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric warned it would shut off power to thousands in and around the Bay Area this week, citing the danger of fire amid high winds and low humidity, but canceled most outages it had planned for Tuesday.</p><p>Inland, the company did shut off power to some customers this week in Shasta, Tehama and Butte counties, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/thousands-in-butte-shasta-counties-could-be-affected-by-pg-e-power-shutoffs-starting-monday/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to local media</a>. In recent years, utility equipment in California <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/04/business/dixie-fire-california-pge.html" title="">has sparked fires</a> in dry conditions.</p><p>In addition to the greater risk of fire have come the usual concerns that heat waves raise, specifically in parts of California like the Bay Area, where fewer people have air conditioning. Some coastal cities are not prepared for 90-plus degree days, and officials urged people to check on their older and disabled neighbors.</p><p>Heat waves <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/upshot/record-breaking-hot-weather-at-night-deaths.html" title="">can be deadly</a> when it does not cool down at night, which has been the case in the recent stretch of heat in places such as in the Santa Cruz mountains, which remained in the mid 80s overnight, according to the National Weather Service. Deaths can climb 10 to 50 percent on days when the nights stay hot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/11/upshot/las-vegas-hot-nights.html" title="">studies show</a>, because it becomes more difficult for people to cool down after a hot day.</p><p>People who work outdoors or who are homeless are also at greater risk in a heat wave. San Francisco has a special protocol for checking on people living outdoors when temperatures are high: Outreach teams make more frequent wellness checks, hand out bottled water and assess people for symptoms of heat-related illnesses, according to Andrea Walker, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The city has also opened several temporary shelters and outreach teams are offering vouchers to people who need transport, she said.</p></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">What to Know During Extreme Heat</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Staying Safe:</strong> We asked emergency room doctors for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/well/live/excessive-heat-wave-weather-health.html">their advice on protecting yourself</a> from dehydration, heat stroke and other serious health problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keeping Cool Indoors:</strong> Too hot to go outside?
