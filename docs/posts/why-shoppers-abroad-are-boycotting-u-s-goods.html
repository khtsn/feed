There is no perfect substitute for Heinz tomato soup, a staple in his pantry. And he misses Pepsi Max.</p><p>But as long as President Trump pursues policies that Mr. Albertus, 57, believes put Europe’s economy and security at risk, he will boycott these and other U.S. products. He is one of a growing number of Europeans, Canadians and others who are forgoing American goods to show their anguish and dismay at Mr. Trump’s treatment of longtime allies.</p><p>“I felt a sense of powerlessness,” said Mr. Albertus, who is an administrator of a Danish <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/418746457927784" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> dedicated to boycotting American goods that has 90,000 members. “We all feel that we are doing something,” he added. “We are acting on our frustration.”</p><p>The strongest momentum behind such consumer action appears to be in countries that Mr. Trump has directly antagonized, like Denmark, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/europe/trump-greenland-denmark.html" title="">territory of Greenland</a> he has threatened to take, and Canada, which he has repeatedly said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/canada-trump-statehood-attacks.html" title="">should become America’s 51st state</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But as Mr. Trump embraces President <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/trump-russia-putin.html" title="">Vladimir V. Putin</a> of Russia and imposes tariffs on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/europe/trump-europe-tariffs-retaliation.html" title="">European</a> goods, groups dedicated to boycotting U.S. goods and swapping tips on local alternatives have popped up in several European countries.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/493116493836278/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Swedish Facebook group</a> with over 80,000 members, users ask for tips on buying non-American laptops, dog food and toothpaste. Members of a French group sing the praises of European <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1847392999339948/posts/1859115558167692/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laundry detergents</a> and smartphone apps, and debate whether Cognac or Scotch whisky is the better alternative to bourbon.</p><p>There are also detailed discussion threads about what exactly constitutes an “American” product — does Coca-Cola manufactured in Europe count, or ice cream from Ben &amp; Jerry’s, now owned by the British company Unilever? — that illustrate how boycotts in an era of globalized commerce are far from straightforward. But the groups are mostly a place for anxious Europeans and others to share stories and vent about their opposition to U.S. policies.</p><p>Majken Jensen, 49, a coordinator for a government agency in Copenhagen, acknowledged that many millions of people buy U.S. products worldwide, and boycotts by some consumers in a few countries may not make a huge difference, at first. Still, she has stopped buying Oreos and Heinz ketchup, and has swapped Estée Lauder night serum for a local brand, Beauté Pacifique.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I’m not even a drop in the ocean,” she said. “But that’s my little way to protest.”</p><p>Ms. Jensen emphasized that her decision to stop buying U.S. goods was in opposition to the Trump administration, not the American people. “We want our friends back,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A movement to boycott U.S. goods has gained momentum as President Trump pursues policies that many Europeans say put the continent’s security and economy at risk.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicolas Guyonnet/AFP--Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The backlash has led some stores to implement changes that make it easier for customers to identify local products. Canada’s largest grocery chain, Loblaw, is using <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-loblaw-introducing-symbol-to-indicate-products-affected-by-tariffs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a “T” symbol</a> to denote U.S.-made products that are more expensive because of retaliatory tariffs Canada recently put in place. In Denmark, the grocery store chains Netto, Bilka and Fotex <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anders-hagh-6290244_vi-g%C3%B8r-det-nemmere-at-handle-europ%C3%A6iske-m%C3%A6rker-activity-7300806905721962496-N5is?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGe_6EBzcvbG9d0-FaDvmv4HHbQe0-bygA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added stars to the price tags</a> of European goods after customers requested clearer labeling, their parent company said.</p><p>Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that social media and the interconnected global economy gave consumers more of a voice than ever before.</p><p>“America has done many questionable things over the years,” she said, “but I don’t think even the Vietnam War could have triggered a campaign like this, simply because social media was not available.”</p><p>Business leaders are aware of the potential costs. Beyond Meat, the plant-based food company with <a href="https://www.beyondmeat.com/en-GB/contact/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">headquarters</a> in California, warned in its latest financial report that it could lose customers internationally because of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/business/russell-2000-bear-market.html" title="">anti-American sentiment</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Michael Medline, the chief executive of Canada’s second-biggest supermarket company, Empire, said this month that the company’s sales of U.S. products were “rapidly dropping” because of a growing demand for non-American products. That decline will continue as the company sources more products from countries other than the United States, the company said, as Canada’s retaliatory tariffs make U.S. goods more expensive to import.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A McDonald’s in Copenhagen, Denmark.

He has also promoted far-right parties in Europe on X, the social media platform he owns. In Germany, Europe’s largest market for electric vehicles, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/business/tesla-germany-sales-elon-musk.html" title="">sales of Tesla cars fell</a> 76 percent in February compared with a year earlier, according to the German Association of the Automotive Industry.</p><p>Boycotts have hit the digital world, too, with consumers saying they have canceled subscriptions to Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video and other streaming services — even though substitutes with similar offerings were not easy to find. Mr. Albertus subscribed to Viaplay, a Swedish streaming service, where he recently started watching “Monk.” “It’s an American series, but life isn’t perfect,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mads Mouritzen, who began the Danish Facebook group, said he had deleted his accounts on Airbnb and Hotels.com, and had stopped using Google and Microsoft Office. (He justified his use of Facebook, based in California, as a platform for the group because it was the easiest way to reach the most people.)</p><p>“It’s very important to say we still like the Americans, we still like the country,” he said. “There’s a current situation that we don’t like, and there’s a current administration we don’t like.”</p><p>Mr. Mouritzen, a 57-year-old janitor, said he hoped relations between the United States and Europe would eventually get back to where they were. But if that takes time, Mr. Mouritzen is prepared: He has a stockpile of 12 bottles of American-made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/magazine/who-made-that-tabasco-sauce.html" title="">Tabasco</a> hot sauce, the one thing he can’t live without, purchased just before he started the boycott.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Europe Delays Tariffs:</strong> European Union officials are delaying their retaliation against President Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs until mid-April, aiming to refine the list of products that will be hit while also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/europe/us-tariffs-eu-whiskey.html">allowing more time to strike a deal</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>New Tariff ‘Number’</strong><strong>:</strong> The Trump administration plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-tariffs.html">confront countries around the world with a reciprocal tariff “number” on April 2</a>, a figure that will reflect what the White House considers the cost of foreign trade barriers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Boeing and the Aerospace Industry:</strong> Companies in the industry are big exporters but also very reliant on a global supply chain, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/business/boeing-trump-tariffs.html">making them vulnerable</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unsettled Farmers:</strong> When the U.S. trade representative asked for examples of unfair trade, agriculture interests had plenty, but also politely warned about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/business/trump-tariffs-farmers-agriculture.html">what a trade war could do to them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>What Oil Executives Want:</strong> Some executives in the industry, which spent more than $75 million to help elect Trump, are increasingly frustrated with his agenda. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/business/energy-environment/oil-executives-trump-tariffs.html">Here are some of the industry’s priorities</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
