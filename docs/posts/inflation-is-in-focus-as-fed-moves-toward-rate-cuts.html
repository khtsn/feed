But the stakes surrounding their next steps have suddenly become much higher.</p><p>The Consumer Price Index inflation measure probably remained relatively cool on an annual basis in July. Economists in a Bloomberg survey think that the index probably climbed 3 percent from a year earlier, in line with a 3 percent rise in June.</p><p>While that is faster than the 2 percent that was normal before the coronavirus pandemic, it is much slower than the 9.1 percent peak in 2022.</p><p>And after stripping out food and fuel prices, both of which can be volatile, the “core” index probably climbed 3.2 percent from a year earlier. That would be down from 3.3 percent the month before.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Signs that inflation is staying relatively low — or continuing to moderate — would likely keep officials at the Fed on track to cut interest rates at their Sept. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">17-18 meeting</a>. Investors think the big question is whether policymakers will lower borrowing costs by a quarter-point, a typical move, or a half-point, which would be an unusually large cut. <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Market pricing suggests</a> that traders think it could go either way at this point.</p><p>Just how much the Fed cuts rates next month could hinge partly on whether inflation continues to slow, but it is expected to depend heavily on what happens in the labor market. The unemployment rate ticked up and hiring slowed in the latest jobs report, which was concerning because weakness in the labor market can quickly bleed into the rest of the economy.</p><p>Because worsening job market data can be an early sign of a recession, that labor market report rattled investors, leading to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/business/stock-market-inflation.html" title="">wild swings in financial markets</a> last week.</p><p>Now, policymakers, economists and investors are likely to focus on employment data ahead of the Fed’s next meeting, especially a jobs report <a href="https://www.bls.gov/schedule/2024/09_sched.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scheduled for release</a> on Sept. 6.</p><p>But inflation data could also help inform the Fed’s next steps. While price increases have been cooling steadily in recent months, it would be more difficult for the Fed to make a large rate cut if progress were to stall, some economists think.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“If it’s a hot number, they have more of a quandary on their hands,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.</p><p>Fed officials aim for 2 percent annual inflation, but define that target using the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which comes out slightly later in the month than the Consumer Price Index. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure will be released <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Aug. 30</a>.</p><p>As policymakers watch incoming data releases to try to get a sense of what is happening with the economy — whether inflation is poised to keep cooling, and especially whether it can do so without a recession — recent company financial results offer a snapshot of the trends at play.</p><p>A complicated economic outlook and still-high interest rates are weighing on consumer demand, according to Home Depot.</p><p>“During the quarter, higher interest rates and greater macroeconomic uncertainty pressured consumer demand more broadly, resulting in weaker spend across home improvement projects,” Ted Decker, chief executive of the home improvement chain, said during an earnings call on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Other firms, including Marriott, have reported that customers are becoming slightly more wary and pulling back on big splurges like dinners out and vacations, even as they continue to spend on travel.</p><p>“While I think there is, at the margin, a hair more caution from the U.S. customer, we do see that there continues to be very strong demand on the leisure front,” Kathleen Oberg, the hotel operator’s chief financial officer, said on <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-marriott-international-narrows-fullyear-outlook-amid-growth-93CH-3547839" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent</a> earnings call.</p><p>But many companies report that higher-income customers, in particular, are powering ahead.</p><p>“Our full-price business is performing really, really well,” Justin Picicci, chief financial officer of Ralph Lauren, said on <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-ralph-lauren-reported-higherthananticipated-results-93CH-3560929" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent</a> earnings call. “Our core customer continues to be resilient and we’re seeing really good relative momentum in that business.”</p></div></div></section><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Online Hate to Real-World Violence: </strong>Social media posts assailing immigrants have fomented a climate of fear and hatred in Britain, Portugal and other countries. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/09/technology/migrants-racism-social-media-violence.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">The vitriol is now spilling onto the streets</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bari Weiss Knows What She’s Doing: </strong>The founder of The Free Press has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/bari-weiss-free-press.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">built a new media empire</a> by persuading audiences that she is a teller of dangerous truths.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reviving Downtown San Francisco: </strong>The city, which is among those most devastated in the United States after the pandemic, is trying to lure businesses back with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/san-francisco-storefronts-free-rent.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">free rent for up to six months</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>How to Not Get Scammed: </strong>Online schemes get more sophisticated all the time. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/business/online-scams-advice.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Here’s how to protect yourself and what to do if you get duped</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skirting A.I.
