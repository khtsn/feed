</span> has decided to step down from competing in VCT for the rest of 2025.</p>

<p>In her <a href="https://x.com/florscnt/status/1916916260295541146" target="_blank">statement</a>, florescent provided some insight into the change. She cited problems such as personal and family emergencies, as well as struggling to adapt to her relocation to EMEA. She had also previously vocalized some of her struggles in other <a href="https://x.com/florscnt/status/1915203302142206355" target="_blank">posts</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tHJNKJKGcA" target="_blank">interviews</a>.</p>

<p>Apeks corroborated many of these troubles in their own <a href="https://x.com/apeksgg/status/1916914654481179080" target="_blank">official statement</a>. Despite doing the best they could to accommodate and help florescent throughout the year, both parties ultimately decided it was best for her to step down for the time being.</p>

<p>Apeks&#39; <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/427110/apeks-changes-the-game-with-florescent" target="_blank">signing</a> of florescent back in December was a major milestone for VCT. As the first Game Changers player to ever step foot on the main VCT stage, her debut was raked with anticipation and expectation. While Apeks has yet to win a match in 2025, florescent has proven that she can compete with the best. She was the third-highest rated player in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/429394/team-liquid-vs-apeks-champions-tour-2025-emea-kickoff-lr1" target="_blank">Kickoff</a>, and had her share of incredible moments and performances throughout <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2380/champions-tour-2025-emea-stage-1/group-stage" target="_blank">Stage 1</a>.</p>


<p><em>florescent has definitely made her mark on EMEA.</em></p>

<p>florescent has suggested the possibility of returning to competition in the future, but for now will take the time to focus on her own well-being.</p>

All this in spite of her team not being able to win a single match.

			<p>I hope she gets fit soon, I liked seeing her play. I also had my doubts with dudes like AvovA being her team mates (literally spitting into the mic even when playing bad, telling every single opponent to &#34;sit down&#34; -&gt; Fnatic, Vitality etc.)</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t matteer which region, she needs a nice and positive team. When her family situation is not so cool, probably the best would be competing in NA if she wants to come back at some point.</p>
<p>Big talent, nice personality... for her first VCT season she did a nice job regarding all the struggles.</p>		</div>
