But the message alarmed agency staff that President Trump hoped to use the tax collector to protect his friends and allies from normal scrutiny, concerns that have only grown as the Trump administration clears out agency leadership and pushes it to carry out Mr. Trump’s directions.</p><p>Neither a Treasury spokesperson nor Mr. Eisner immediately responded to a request for comment. In an interview, Mr. Lindell said that Mr. Eisner’s message reflected a mix-up. Mr. Lindell said he had reached out to Treasury officials about why companies should have to amend previous tax years’ returns after receiving the employee retention tax credit, a pandemic-era benefit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s nonsensical government waste and I really want to try and get this rectified,” he said. Mr. Lindell said he had also faced an I.R.S. inquiry over when he could write off the cost of a Covid-19 drug he tried to sell during the pandemic.</p><p>“It’s pending their decision,” he said. “The I.R.S. is very slow in making the decision.”</p><p>Mr. Lindell met with Mr. Trump at the White House earlier this year. He has faced several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/06/us/politics/mike-lindell-mypillow-elections-lawsuit.html" title="">defamation lawsuits</a> stemming from his claims that the 2020 election was stolen, and federal agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/us/politics/mike-lindell-search-warrant-investigation.html" title="">seized</a> his phone in 2022.</p><p>Beyond shielding Mr. Trump’s friends, the Trump administration has pushed the I.R.S. to investigate his political targets, including by asking it to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status. The administration earlier this month also enlisted the I.R.S. to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement deport undocumented immigrants.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Duehren covers tax policy for The Times from Washington.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Iran Nuclear Talks</strong><strong>: </strong>As the administration grapples with how to stop Iran’s nuclear program, it has so far left a trail of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-negotations.html">mixed messages, conflicting signals and blustering threats</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Housing Aid:</strong> The White House is considering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/housing-aid-hud-federal-budget.html">deep cuts to federal housing programs</a>, including a sweeping overhaul of aid to low-income families, in a reconfiguration that could jeopardize millions of Americans’ access to rental assistance funds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Standoff Over Transgender Athletes:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-sues-maine-trans-athletes-womens-sports.html">sued Maine</a> over policies that allow some transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports, just days after also threatening to cut off funding to the state’s public schools and lunch programs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disinformation Office Shuttered:</strong> Secretary of State Marco Rubio shut down a State Department office that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-rubio-state-department-foreign-disinformation.html">tracks and counters global disinformation</a>, including campaigns by rival powers of the United States and terrorist groups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Deals With Law Firms:</strong> To avoid retribution, some of the nation’s biggest law firms agreed to deals with President Trump to provide free legal services for uncontroversial causes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/law-firms-deals-trump.html">Now he wants more from them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Changing Briefing Room: </strong>For decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/15/us/trump-white-house-briefing-room-new-media.html">the seating chart in the White House press briefing room has been controlled</a> by an independent organization.
