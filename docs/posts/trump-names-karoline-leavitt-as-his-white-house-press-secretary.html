    <h1>Trump Names Karoline Leavitt as His White House Press Secretary</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump announced on Friday that he had chosen Karoline Leavitt, who worked in his administration and served as his campaign’s press secretary, to be his White House press secretary.</p><p>Ms. Leavitt, 27, will take on one of the most visible jobs in Mr. Trump’s next administration, fielding questions from reporters in the White House briefing room on behalf of a president with an adversarial relationship to the mainstream media. She will be the youngest person ever to assume the role.</p><p>“Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again.”</p><p>Mr. Trump can be hyper-focused on coverage of himself, complaining both privately and publicly about newspaper headlines and television packages. He made a public show of castigating news outlets over unfavorable coverage and amped up his threats against the media in the final weeks of his campaign.</p></div></div>
