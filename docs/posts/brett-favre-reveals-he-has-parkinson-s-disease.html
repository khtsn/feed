Among the companies that benefited is a pharmaceutical company, Prevacus, that promoted its efforts to find a treatment for concussions.</p><p>“Sadly, I also lost an investment in a company that I believed was developing a breakthrough concussion drug I thought would help others,” he said. “And I’m sure you’ll understand, while it’s too late for me because I’ve recently been diagnosed with Parkinson’s, this is also a cause dear to my heart.”</p><p>The revelation was a startling admission from a high-profile football player whose more than two-decade career included a Super Bowl victory and induction into the Hall of Fame. While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/briefing/nfl-guardian-caps.html" title="">more attention</a> has been paid in recent years to concussions and brain injuries in professional football, especially those suffered by quarterbacks, it is notable for a living player to be diagnosed with a serious disease that could be linked to repeated head hits in football. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/cte-definition-nfl.html" title="">degenerative brain disease</a> that is most associated with pro football, can be diagnosed only after death.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In a 2023 study, researchers found that longer duration of play and higher levels of football were linked to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10422187/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increased chances</a> of being diagnosed with Parkinson’s.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Favre has estimated that he suffered <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/brett-favre-gives-frightening-answer-when-asked-how-many-concussions-he-suffered-during-his-nfl-career/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 1,000 concussions</a> during his career. He played football at the University of Southern Mississippi before spending 20 seasons in the National Football League. Most were as a quarterback with the Green Bay Packers, helping clinch a Super Bowl victory in 1997.</p><p>A once-popular player whose quiet charm and low Southern drawl landed him countless endorsements, Mr. Favre drained his public good will after allegations that he had played a role in misappropriating about $8 million in public funds intended for low-income families. Those public funds, part of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, provide cash assistance to households with children.</p><p>According to auditors, in 2017 and 2018, Mr. Favre received $1.1 million in speaking fees for speeches he never gave. They suggested he also helped funnel millions of dollars to pet projects: $5 million to build volleyball facilities at his alma mater, where his daughter played volleyball at the time, and an additional $2.1 million to Prevacus.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2024/07/24/jake-vanlandingham-guilty-plea-welfare-scandal/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jacob Vanlandingham</a>, the neuroscientist who led Prevacus, pleaded guilty to wire fraud in July, admitting to using funds diverted from the welfare program to pay off gambling and personal debts.</p><p>Mr. Favre was never charged with a crime, and his lawyer has said he paid back the $1.1 million in misspent speaking fees he received. But the state demanded that he pay back interest.</p><p>Mr. Favre refused, and the state sued him and 37 others to recoup funds it says they wrongfully acquired. The lawsuit made public texts from Mr. Favre that suggested he had a larger role than he claimed.</p><p>That lawsuit has since unleashed many others, including one Mr. Favre brought against the state auditor, Shad White, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4178045/2023/02/10/brett-favre-lawsuits-shannon-sharpe-pat-mcafee/" title="">accusing him of defamation</a>, and another the attorney general of Mississippi <a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/22/ms-ag-lynn-fitch-sues-auditor-shad-white-related-to-brett-favre-case/72704853007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brought against Mr. White</a> in an effort to block the recovery of funds from Mr. Favre.</p><p>Mr. Favre said on Tuesday that a gag order prevented him from speaking about continuing litigation, but he accused the state auditor of seeking to tarnish Mr. Favre’s reputation to advance his own political career.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The challenges my family and I have faced over the last three years because certain government officials in Mississippi failed to protect federal TANF funds from fraud and abuse and are unjustifiably trying to blame me — those challenges have hurt my good name,” Mr. Favre said, referring to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.</p><p>He has often said he was “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3681154/2022/10/11/brett-favre-mississippi-welfare-scandal/" title="">unjustly smeared</a>” in the news media. But text messages written by Mr. Favre and made public in a court filing suggested that he was trying to hide his involvement.</p><p>“If you were to pay me is there anyway the media can find out where it came from and how much?” he wrote to the center that paid him speaking fees.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Favre maintained his innocence.</p><p>“I had no way of knowing that there was anything wrong with how the state funded the project,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>10</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>During Testimony, Favre Says He’s Been Diagnosed With Parkinson’s Disease<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the World of Sports</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping professional, collegiate and amateur athletics.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Rivalries in College Football</strong><strong>: </strong>Upheaval within the Big Ten, Pac-12 and Southeastern Conferences has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/sports/football/college-football-conference-realignment-oregon.html">threatened some cherished rivalries</a>, while rekindling others.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘Woj’ Leaves ESPN: </strong>Adrian Wojnarowski, whose use of social media helped change the sports journalism landscape, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/sports/basketball/adrian-wojnarowski-retires-espn.html">retired from ESPN</a> to become general manager of the basketball team at St. Bonaventure University.</p></li><li><p><strong>Manchester City Hearing: </strong>The Premier League accused its champion of years of financial violations.
