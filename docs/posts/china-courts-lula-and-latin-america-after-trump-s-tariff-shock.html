Many Latin American governments also want to keep Beijing onside — chiefly as an economic partner, but for some also as a counterweight to U.S. power, experts said.</p><p>“What the people of Latin America and the Caribbean seek are independence and self-determination, not the so-called ‘new Monroe Doctrine,’” China’s assistant foreign minister, Miao Deyu, told reporters in Beijing on Sunday, <a href="https://en.people.cn/n3/2025/0512/c90000-20313497.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the People’s Daily</a>, nodding to President James Monroe’s <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1801-1829/monroe" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declaration of 1823</a>, warning European powers not to interfere in the Americas.</p><p>The U.S. secretary of state, Marco Rubio, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article303041969.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has said that</a> the Trump administration will be “putting our region, the Americas, first,” and Mr. Rubio’s first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/world/americas/rubio-central-america-visit.html" title="">overseas trip as secretary</a> was to Panama, Guatemala and other countries in the region. But Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs and threats to take over the Panama Canal have unsettled leaders in Latin America, especially in countries already wary of Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Even if Mr. Trump is not singled out by name in official statements from Mr. Xi’s meetings with Mr. Lula, and possibly other Latin American officials, the implication will be clear.</p><p>“Lula sees China as a partner in rebalancing global power, not just a trade partner but a geopolitical counterweight to U.S. hegemony,” said <a href="https://www.matiasspektor.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matias Spektor</a>, a professor of politics and international relations at Fundação Getulio Vargas, a Brazilian university. “Lula’s strategy is clear: diversify Brazil’s alliances, reduce dependency on Washington, and assert Brazil as a mover and shaker in an increasingly multipolar world.”</p><p>Still, behind closed doors, China’s talks with Mr. Lula and other Latin American and Caribbean leaders are unlikely to be just about mutual admiration. Mr. Lula is the most prominent of the leaders assembling in Beijing for <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/wsrc/202505/t20250511_11618772.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a meeting on Tuesday</a> between Chinese officials and ministers from the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, or CELAC, a group that does not include the United States or Canada.</p><p>Colombia’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/19/world/colombia-election-results" title="">president, Gustavo Petro, a leftist former rebel</a>, will also attend, Chinese <a href="https://x.com/CGTNOfficial/status/1921767066924703821" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">media reported</a>. But it was unclear who else was attending, and such meetings with China are usually attended by foreign ministers and other government officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Farm workers harvesting soybeans in Brazil’s Rio Grande do Sul State.

Chinese products including cars and appliances have filled markets in the region, and Chinese investments have funded bridges, dams and ports. Brazil and other big commodities exporters are, in part, hoping to repeat what happened in Mr. Trump’s first term, when China purchased more soybeans, iron ore and other products from Latin America in the face of U.S. tariffs.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last year, trade in goods between China and Latin America <a href="http://www.customs.gov.cn/customs/302249/zfxxgk/2799825/302274/302275/6312783/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reached nearly $519 billion</a>, about double the <a href="http://www.customs.gov.cn/customs/302249/zfxxgk/2799825/302274/302277/302276/310279/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">value of a decade ago</a>, according to Chinese customs statistics</p><p>Mr. Lula has, for all his friendliness to Beijing, <a href="https://dialogo-americas.com/articles/the-chinese-threat-to-brazils-steel-and-fiber-optic-industries/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increased tariffs</a> on iron, steel and fiber optic cable, products that mostly come from China. Countries across Latin America are “hugely concerned” that Chinese exporters shut out of the U.S. market will divert cheap goods there, swamping local manufacturers, said <a href="https://www.csis.org/people/ryan-c-berg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ryan Berg</a>, the director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p><p>“These are countries that have a history of protectionism already and are interested in protecting local jobs and local industries,” Mr. Berg said in an interview. “Even though many countries like Brazil have good relationships with China, they have nevertheless moved almost in parallel with the United States to protect certain industries out of fear that they could become dumping grounds for, say, Chinese steel and aluminum.”</p><p>Mexico, the second-biggest Latin American economy after Brazil, has so far taken a more cautious approach to courting China, reflecting its much larger trade ties with the United States, said <a href="https://www.rienner.com/title/Latin_America_China_and_Great_Power_Competition_New_Triangular_Relationships" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Enrique Dussel Peters</a>, a professor of economics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Indeed, Mexico’s diplomatic caution belies a trade relationship in which China is making huge inroads. Fueled largely by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/business/china-mexico-ev-electric-vehicles.html" title="">a surge in Chinese cars</a> on Mexico’s roads, Mexico now accounts for about 2.4 percent of China’s total exports.

Mr. Lula has also voiced hopes that China can help Brazil make gains in new technologies, including space and green energy.</p><p>When Mr. Xi traveled to Brazil for a G20 leaders’ summit in November, he added on <a href="https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202411/20/content_WS673cff07c6d0868f4e8ed359.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a state visit</a> there.

Mr. Biden’s only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/americas/biden-g20-summit.html" title="">visit to Brazil</a> as president — for the G20 summit — came only after he had lost the presidential election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The fact that we are much closer, but we have had high-level visits with less frequency than Xi is a barrier to regional prioritization and a bad sign from a strategic perspective.” Mr. Berg said. “I think a lot of that is going to change with Rubio,” he said, noting that Mr. Rubio is a fluent Spanish speaker familiar with the region.</p><p>Nearer term, China may focus on more orders of soybeans and other goods from Brazil. “There is anxiety about China crowding out Brazilian manufacturers, but the broader reality is clear,” said Professor Spektor, the Brazilian academic. “China’s demand underpins Brazil’s economic stability.”</p><p>Simon Romero<!-- --> in Mexico City contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>May 12, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this story misstated the length of the term of President Gustavo Petro of Colombia.
