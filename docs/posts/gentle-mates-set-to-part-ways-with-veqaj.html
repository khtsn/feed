		<p>arguably the most consistent on that roster, he is forsho tier1 material </p>

		<p>he&#39;s a good duelist through and through, dont know what m8 was thinking buying him just to stick him on recon and make him ass. All these teams have such shit scouting and management</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="5420902">
		
		
		<p>prob bc he was good on scans in scrims?? Lots of decent duelist players have found a lot of success, if not more success, switching roles. He only played like 1 split on a team that was mid, give him some grace</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="5422149">
		
		
		<p>idk bro, all the pros say recon is the HARDEST role to flex onto, thats why you&#39;ll rarely see even f0rsaken/chronicle on sova or fade. Its jst a kind of role you want a specialist on, ur much better off flexing to senti/smokes</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="5422170">
		
		
		<p>I agree with this but just wanted to say that Veqaj is not a tier 1 level duelist unless u are a midtable team or fighting for relegation, duelists like jas or exit are much better but he is a great player that would have a much better career on other roles just like keiko. Personally I have scouted Veqaj a lot and his recon agents are pretty good while his flash agents not so much, it seems to suit his style of play a lot but I agree that he would need time to become an specialist on it, he would be on my list for a tier1 team looking for an initiator with potential that they can work on or someone who needs a smokes player/second duelist</p>

			<p>Bro at the highest level if you take a pro and put him on any agent they should be able to play well. Yeah recon is harder than other roles sure, but any pro player should be able to play well on any role given they have some time to practice</p>
<p>its not like ow where each character plays fundamentally differently, every agent has a somewhat similar gameplay loop with the only difference being in how they interact with their and the enemy team</p>		</div>

	<div data-post-id="5425689">
		
		
		<p>nah, thats just not true bro, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t see so many teams struggle with role issues and improve drastically when theyre solved, prx, lev (king on neon..), sen, edg are all prime examples, at the highest level small mistakes cost the match, and roles are a major factor undeniably</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="5426753">
		
		
		<div>
			
			<p>prx role problems was bc they didn&#39;t put jinggg or something on non comfort agents, they put jinggg on omen and something on initi/yoru and then they won masters</p>
<p>lev the issue wasnt that kingg was on neon, it was that he was igl on neon while on a team that had a lot of internal issues</p>
<p>sen didnt really have role issues, its just that they played better when everyone was on their comfort roles</p>
<p>edg they switched smoggy to smokes and he became elite, idk if you are referencing another point in time tho</p>		</div>
