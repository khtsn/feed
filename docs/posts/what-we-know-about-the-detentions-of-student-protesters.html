If you lie to us, and get a visa and then enter the United States and with that visa participate in that sort of activity, we’re going to take away your visa. And once you’ve lost your visa, you’re no longer legally in the United States. And we have a right, like every country in the world has a right, to remove you from our country. Maybe more — might be more than 300 at this point. We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa.” Reporter: “You’re saying it could be more than 300 visas?” “I mean, at some point, I hope we run out because we’ve gotten rid of all of them.

But some legal experts say that the administration is trampling on free speech rights and using <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-trump-allegations.html" title="">lower-level laws</a> to crack down on activism.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday that the State Department under his direction had revoked the visas of more than 300 people and was continuing to revoke visas daily. He did not specify how many of those people had taken part in campus protests or acted to support Palestinians.</p><p>Mr. Rubio gave that number at a news conference, after noting that the department had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/ice-tufts-student-detained-rumeysa-ozturk.html" title="">revoked the visa</a> of a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University.

Most of them have publicly expressed pro-Palestinian views. Some have green cards, making them lawful permanent residents. Others have student visas, which allows foreign nationals to enter the United States for full-time study.</p><p>The extent of their involvement in pro-Palestinian advocacy varies. Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident who is believed to be the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/mahmoud-khalil-legal-resident-deportation.html" title="">first to be taken into custody</a>, helped lead high-profile protests at Columbia University against Israel’s war in Gaza. Mr. Khalil, who has Palestinian heritage, is married to an American citizen who is eight months pregnant.

She had drawn the attention of a right-wing group that claims to combat antisemitism on college campuses and publicizes its findings online after helping write an opinion piece in the student newspaper criticizing the university’s response to pro-Palestinian demands.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said investigators with that agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement “found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans. A visa is a privilege, not a right.” She did not offer evidence or details of that support.</p><p>A video of Ms. Ozturk’s detention, showing plainclothes agents from the Homeland Security Department detaining her as she was heading out to break her Ramadan fast with friends, has circulated widely online. “This video should shake everyone to their core,” her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, said in a statement on Wednesday. Ms. Ozturk is being held in Louisiana.</p><p>As it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/trump-immigration-visa-crackdown.html?smid=url-share" title="">scrutinizes</a> people living in the United States, investigators for ICE have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trump-crackdown-dissent.html" title="">searching videos, online posts and news clippings</a> of campus protests against the Israel-Hamas war.

A prominent pro-Palestinian voice on campus, Mr. Taal had previously filed a pre-emptive lawsuit to block possible action against him.</p></li><li><p>Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen who was studying and teaching at Georgetown University, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/georgetown-suri-detained.html" title="">was detained at his home</a>. He is married to a Palestinian American woman whose father is a former adviser to a deceased Hamas leader. A federal judge has temporarily blocked Mr. Suri’s deportation. He is “awaiting his court date” in Alexandria, La., according to his lawyer.</p></li><li><p>Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist and professor at Brown University’s medical school, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/us/brown-university-rasha-alawieh-professor-deported.html" title="">was deported</a> despite holding a valid visa.

Lawful permanent residents are also protected by the Constitution, including free speech and due process rights, which could set up a major legal challenge. Lawyers for those whose student visas have been revoked have similarly challenged the administration on constitutional grounds.</p><p>In some cases, the administration has also cited lower-level offenses to justify deportation efforts. The government has added <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-trump-allegations.html" title="">new accusations</a> against Mr. Khalil, saying that he withheld information about his membership in organizations, including a United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees, when applying for permanent residency. One of Mr. Khalil’s lawyers dismissed these new claims as “patently weak.”</p><h2 id="link-365f6e37">Will more students be targeted?</h2><p>Administration officials have signaled that these detentions and deportations reflect the beginning of a broader crackdown on pro-Palestinian protesters.
