But the contempt seems to be even louder behind closed doors.</p><p>Europeans reacted with a mix of exasperation and anger to the publication of parts of a discussion between top-ranking Trump administration officials, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/hegseth-classified-war-plans-group-chat.html" title="">carried out on the messaging app Signal</a>. The discussion, about a planned strike on Yemen, was replete with comments that painted Europeans as geopolitical parasites, and was revealed on Monday in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a>, whose editor was inadvertently included in the conversation.</p><p>“I just hate bailing out the Europeans again,” wrote Vice President JD Vance, asserting that the strikes would benefit Europe far more than the United States.</p><p>“I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,” Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, later replied. “It’s PATHETIC.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The exchange seemed to show real feelings and judgments — that the Europeans are mooching and that any American military action, no matter how clearly in American interests as well, should be somehow paid for by other beneficiaries.</p><p>A member of the chat identified as “SM,” and believed to be Stephen Miller, a top aide to President Trump, suggested that both Egypt and “Europe” should compensate the United States for the operation. “If Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return,” SM wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Trump administration’s stance toward Europe and Ukraine has prompted a series of international summits, including one in London this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Javad Parsa/NTB, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The apparent disregard by administration officials of security protocols by having such a discussion — which included operational details — on a consumer chat app, even an encrypted one, prompted concern that Russia and China could be listening in. </p><p>“Putin is now unemployed: No point in spying anymore,” Nathalie Loiseau, a member of the European Parliament, <a href="http://x.com/NathalieLoiseau/status/1904465322121240760" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>, saying the leaks now came from the Americans themselves. “No point in crushing Ukraine anymore, Trump will take care of it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The commentary in the exchange is the latest blow to one of the world’s most storied alliances, which took generations to build and strengthen but which the Trump administration has managed to weaken in mere weeks.</p><p>“It is clear that the trans-Atlantic relationship, as was, is over, and there is, at best, an indifferent disdain,” said Nathalie Tocci, director of Italy’s Institute of International Affairs, who formerly advised a top E.U. official. “And at worst, and closer to that, there is an active attempt to undermine Europe.”</p><p>The European Union is, in many ways, the antithesis of the principles that Mr. Trump and his colleagues are championing. The bloc is built around an embrace of international trade based on rules. It has been at the forefront of climate-related regulation and social media user protections.</p><p>Europe has been on alert ever since Mr. Vance delivered a speech at a security conference in Munich last month that <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/18/vance-speech-munich-full-text-read-transcript-europe/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">questioned European values</a> and its democracy and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/vance-far-right-germany-munich-afd.html" title="">shocked European leaders</a>. He followed that up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNPWmty6KDA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by warning</a> that Europe was at risk of “civilizational suicide.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vice President JD Vance’s speech at the Munich Security Conference last month shocked European leaders.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>If the relationship between the United States and Europe were merely transactional, it would be relatively easy for Europeans to just spend more on the military and give Mr. Trump some sort of victory, said François Heisbourg, a French analyst and former defense official.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But in Mr. Vance’s speech attacking European democracy in Munich, let alone in the newly public exchange, the distaste for Europe is about more than transactions.</p><p>“Vance was quite clear: We don’t share the same values,” Mr. Heisbourg said.</p><p>He and others, like Anna Sauerbrey, the foreign editor of Die Zeit, noted that the explicit demand for payment, rather than just political and military support, as in Iraq and Afghanistan, was new. And it ignored the fact that “the U.S. depends on global trade,” she said, and that “France, Britain and the Netherlands have deployed ships to the region” for the same purpose. The Americans, she said, “are constantly overlooking European efforts.”</p><p>China, for example, gets most of its oil imports through the Strait of Hormuz and does much of its export trade with Europe through the same sea route. But no one is asking China to pay, Ms. Tocci noted.</p><p>For months, Washington has been sending barbed statements and actions Europe’s way.</p><p>Mr. Trump has made it clear that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-greenland-why.html" title="">wants to acquire Greenland</a>, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, even as European leaders warn that they will defend territorial integrity. Usha Vance, Mr. Vance’s wife, and Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, are visiting the island this week, uninvited, its government says, and to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/us/politics/usha-vance-trump-us-greenland.html" title="">agitated response</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators outside the U.S. consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, this month, to protest the idea of the U.S. acquiring Greenland.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christian Klindt Soelbeck/Ritzau Scanpix, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump has also repeatedly warned that Europe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/world/europe/europe-trump-defense-budgets.html" title="">must pay much more</a> for its own defense, threatening not to come to the aid of nations that do not pay up sufficiently, and has pivoted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/europe/trump-russia-putin-ukraine.html" title="">sharply away</a> from Ukraine.
