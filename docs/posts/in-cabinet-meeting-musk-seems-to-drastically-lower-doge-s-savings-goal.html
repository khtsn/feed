    <h1>In Cabinet Meeting, Musk Seems to Drastically Lower DOGE’s Savings Goal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While stumping for Donald J. Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign, Elon Musk said he could cut $2 trillion from the federal budget. After Mr. Trump took office and placed Mr. Musk in charge of the budget-slashing so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Mr. Musk lowered that projection by half, to $1 trillion in the upcoming fiscal year.</p><p>In a cabinet meeting on Thursday, Mr. Musk appeared to set his group’s goal lower still.</p><p>“I’m excited to announce that we anticipate savings in ’26 from reduction of waste and fraud by $150 billion,” Mr. Musk told Mr. Trump, referring to the fiscal year, which runs from the beginning of October 2025 to the end of September 2026.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s group has slashed budgets and fired thousands of workers around Washington, but so far the <a href="https://doge.gov/savings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DOGE website</a> indicates that it remains far from reaching his goal of $1 trillion in savings next year. As of Thursday, the site claimed $150 billion in savings, with an itemized list of some of the purported cuts.</p><p>It was unclear if Mr. Musk meant to say that the $150 billion was merely what his team had found so far — meaning that $1 trillion in savings was still possible — or if that $150 billion was all it expected to find.</p></div></div>
