</span> have been knocked down to the lower bracket.</p>

<p>EDG, the defending <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions 2024</a> winner, currently holds the longest active streak of international LANs reached at eight, meaning their drop to the lower bracket puts that run at risk.</p>



<p>Despite attending Champions the last two years, BiliBili has yet to qualify for a Masters event. The wait may continue after Wolves Esports made quick work of them, defeating them 2-0. The result was a bit of a surprise, given BiliBili beat Wolves while giving up just nine rounds in the final two maps when the two teams met in the group stage.</p>

<p>On Split, both teams ran comps centered around Omen and Viper. BiliBili opted for a double Initiator pairing with Breach and Tejo, while Wolves had a more balanced comp, including Tejo, Raze, and Cypher. Wolves&#39; choice to run the Cypher seemingly paid off, as BiliBili struggled on their attacker side, picking up just five rounds.</p>

</span> makes BiliBili pay for waiting in the smoke.</em></p>

<p>After starting the map on a 4-0 run, the surviving two BLG players were forced to save in this round as part of a four-round run from Wolves. Wolves used their space-clearing utility, such as Tejo&#39;s Guided Salvos or Raze&#39;s Boom Bot and Paint Shells to guide a slow, disciplined half, giving up just three rounds in the half en route to a 13-8 victory.</p>

<p>On Haven, Wolves flexed their versatility while continuing to hold strong on their defender side. Four players picked up agent roles that they didn&#39;t play previously on Split, with perhaps the most crucial switch being <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/37489/lysoar">
		Lysoar	</a>
</span> on Cypher. He finished the map with a server-high 23 kills, and played a big part in Wolves dropping just three rounds on defense to close out a 13-8 win.</p>

<p>After an impressive group stage showing saw the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2149/champions-tour-2024-china-ascension/playoffs" target="_blank">China Ascension</a> winners come up just short of earning Group Omega&#39;s top seed, Xi Lai Gaming continued to shine by taking down the region&#39;s top dog in EDward Gaming 2-0.</p>

<p>EDG continued to struggle to adapt to Valorant&#39;s new double Duelist meta in the series. While star shooter <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> is far more known for his play on movement-based Duelists such as Neon and Jett, he played both maps in this series on Iso and Yoru. While Yoru has risen in popularity this year in VCT, KangKang has struggled to pick up the agent. His best performances during Masters Bangkok came on the aforementioned movement Duelists, though they often came at the cost of the outcome of the match.</p>

<p>The series opened on XLG&#39;s map pick of Lotus, which, despite a stellar performance from EDG&#39;s <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span>, saw the Ascension team look unstoppable. They won eight rounds on their defender side thanks to well-orchestrated retakes, including a 6-0 run to open.</p>


<p><em>XLG&#39;s C site retake took just seconds.</em></p>

<p>A well-rounded performance on attack, led by Duelist <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/22047/rarga">
		Rarga	</a>
</span>, helped XLG close out the map 13-9, shifting the focus to another three-site map in Haven.</p>

<p>Haven was far more closely contested than Lotus to start things out, as the teams entered halftime just two rounds apart. Ultimately, the difference was Rarga. The China Ascension MVP recorded his highest-ever single-map kill count in VCT play, finishing with a 1.92 rating and an absurd 35/16 scoreline. He and Sentinel player <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/37927/happywei">
		happywei	</a>
</span> combined for 12 first kills on the map, including seven on their defender side, to win 13-11 and knock EDG down to the lower bracket.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, EDG has decided to break up their core that lifted the Champions 2024 trophy and finished third at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> by benching <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/13768/s1mon">
		S1Mon	</a>
</span> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/461713/edg-signs-jieni7-to-expand-active-roster-to-six" target="_blank">adding</a> <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/51244/jieni7">
		Jieni7	</a>
</span>. The decision has garnered mixed results, as EDG has now gone 3-1 with a map difference of 6-4 in that span.</p>

<p>The win locks in a top-three finish for Xi Lai Gaming and, in turn, qualification for Masters Toronto. They will play Wolves Esports in the upper final to fight for a top-two finish.</p>

<p>The playoffs of VCT China Stage 1 will continue with the following matches:</p>
