Ho of Federal District Court in Manhattan, refused to let the government retain the option of reinstating the charges, as Mr. Trump’s Justice Department had sought.</p><p>The department had argued that the bribery and fraud charges should be dropped for three reasons: They were brought too close to the mayoral election; the U.S. attorney who brought the case had created “appearances of impropriety”; and, most importantly, the prosecution was hindering the mayor’s cooperation with Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown.</p><p>Judge Ho roundly rejected all three arguments.</p><p>“Everything here smacks of a bargain: Dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/02/nyregion/adams-charges-dismissed-ruling.html" title="">the judge wrote in his 78-page decision</a>. He suggested that the arguments about impropriety and timing were misleading and insincere.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Even so, his decision to let the Justice Department abruptly end the case, which had originally been set for trial this month, underscored the remarkable power that Mr. Trump’s administration has to terminate prosecutions, regardless of rationale.</p><p>Judge Ho wrote that the law had left him with little recourse in the face of the Trump Administration’s abandonment of the case. Still, he criticized the Department of Justice’s reasoning, calling it “unprecedented and breathtaking in its sweep.”</p><p>He noted that the department had failed to to offer any previous examples of charges being dismissed against an elected official in order to fulfill federal policy goals.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Adams, Alex Spiro, said in a statement that the case “should never have been brought in the first place.”</p><p>“Finally today that case is gone forever,” he said. “From Day 1, the mayor has maintained his innocence and now justice for Eric Adams and New Yorkers has prevailed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Spiro did not immediately respond to questions about the judge’s strongly worded opinion.</p><p>Judge Ho’s ruling marked the finale of an extraordinary and bitter clash between the federal prosecutors in Manhattan who indicted Mr. Adams and the Justice Department officials who worked to kill the case. That fight, in which both sides accused each other of ethical misconduct, left Mr. Adams deeply damaged as he faces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor-election.html" title="">a steep uphill climb for re-election this year</a>.</p><p>Judge Ho in his opinion discounted the Justice Department’s claims that the case had been brought for political reasons by the Manhattan federal prosecutors. “There is no evidence — zero — that they had any improper motives,” he wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/02/nyregion/adams-charges-dismissed-ruling.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/doc-89c8ac75-502e-4708-8d67-b-promo/doc-89c8ac75-502e-4708-8d67-b-promo-articleLarge.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/02/nyregion/adams-charges-dismissed-ruling.html"><h2>Read the ruling dismissing corruption charges against Eric Adams</h2></a><p>Read Judge Dale Ho’s decision dismissing the charges against Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, with prejudice.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/02/nyregion/adams-charges-dismissed-ruling.html"><strong>Read Document</strong></a></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The judge made it clear that his ruling did not address the merits of the case or whether a trial should have occurred. He said that Mr. Adams was, as ever, presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p><p>The Justice Department had moved to dismiss the charges against the mayor after the prosecutors who brought the indictment refused. One of the department’s highest-ranking officials, Emil Bove III, offered the justification that the case was compromising Mr. Adams’s cooperation with the Trump administration’s immigration policies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Judge Ho wrote that “the record does not show that this case has impaired Mayor Adams in his immigration enforcement efforts.” Instead, he said, after Justice Department officials sought dismissal of the case, the mayor took at least one new immigration action in line with the administration’s polices.</p><p>The judge said that granting the government’s request to dismiss the charges without prejudice, which would have allowed it to bring them again, “would create the unavoidable perception that the mayor’s freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents.”</p><p>Judge Ho’s ruling was in line with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/nyregion/adams-corruption-clement-dismiss.html" title="">a recommendation by a court-appointed legal expert, Paul D. Clement</a>, a conservative lawyer who had argued that the mayor’s case should be ended with prejudice, meaning it could not be revived.</p><p>“A dismissal without prejudice creates a palpable sense that the prosecution outlined in the indictment and approved by a grand jury could be renewed, a prospect that hangs like the proverbial sword of Damocles over the accused,” Mr. Clement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/clement-brief.html" title="">wrote in a March 7 court filing</a>.</p><p>Mr. Adams was indicted last year on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html" title="">five counts</a>, including bribery, fraud and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations. He had pleaded not guilty and consistently has denied wrongdoing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Once the indictment was returned in September, the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan pursued the prosecution aggressively. But after the change in presidential administrations, the Trump Justice Department reversed course, ordering prosecutors to seek the charges’ dismissal.</p><p>Danielle R. Sassoon, the interim U.S. attorney in Manhattan, refused to obey the order and resigned, and a spate of resignations in New York and Washington followed. Justice Department officials, including Mr. Bove, then the acting deputy attorney general, ended up filing the motion themselves.</p><p>Throughout the opinion, the judge made it clear that he was personally unconvinced by arguments of Trump administration officials. He repeatedly asserted that while he had little power to defy them, his view was less important than that of American voters.</p><p>“Because the decision to discontinue a prosecution belongs primarily to a political branch of government,” he wrote, “it is the public’s judgment, and not this court’s, that truly matters.”</p><p>In a February hearing in Judge Ho’s courtroom, Mr. Bove had argued that Justice Department officials had “virtually unreviewable” discretion to end cases.</p><p>The judge seized on that phrase in his opinion, calling it “disturbing in its breadth.”</p><p>Mr. Bove’s argument, Judge Ho wrote, suggested that public officials “may receive special dispensation if they are compliant with the incumbent administration’s policy priorities. That suggestion is fundamentally incompatible with the basic promise of equal justice under law.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>William K.
