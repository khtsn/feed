Cardinal Peter Erdo of Hungary asked for prayers for fellow cardinals at a church near the Colosseum. Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo of Congo joined priests from across the globe behind the altar of a church in western Rome.</p><p>The three cardinals — considered contenders, though not favorites, to become the next pope — were among those celebrating Mass across Rome on Sunday, making among their final public appearances before the conclave to elect a new pope begins on Wednesday.</p><p>Campaign rallies they were not. But in the homilies that the cardinals delivered, and in their interactions with the faithful, they offered hints at the messages they might be giving to other cardinals, and to what kind of pope they might want, or want to be.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>All cardinals are assigned what is known as a titular church in Rome; when they are in town, they can choose to celebrate Mass there. Some, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/world/europe/aveline-pope-conclave-contender.html" title="">Cardinal Aveline</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/luis-tagle-asian-pope.html" title="">Cardinal Luis Tagle</a> of the Philippines, a leading papal contender, had already done so last week. Cardinal Tagle drew hundreds of Filipino faithful to his titular church in the gritty Centocelle suburb on Thursday. A smattering of lesser-known cardinals also fanned out across the city on Sunday, giving eager Vatican watchers a chance to snap photos of Their Eminences all over town.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo of Congo delivering a homily on Sunday at his titular church, San Gabriele Arcangelo all’Acqua Traversa.

The half-dozen reporters milling around took off, contenting themselves with chatting with Francesco Ziaco, a 63-year-old banker who had come to see Cardinal Pizzaballa — and who happened to also look a lot like him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>(A reporter from RAI, the Italian broadcaster, asked Mr. Ziaco if he was the cardinal, going clandestine in civilian clothes. Though he was not, he acknowledged, “The first time I saw his picture, I thought, ‘This guy looks like me.’”)</p><p>The cardinals who did celebrate Mass were met with enthusiastic support.</p><p>A standing-room-only crowd filled the Basilica di Santa Francesca Romana, also known as Santa Maria Nova, waiting for Cardinal Erdo, the archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, to arrive. Several rows of chairs painted in gold near the front of the church were reserved for dignitaries, including the Hungarian ambassadors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/world/europe/hungary-habsburg-ambassador-vatican.html" title="">to the Holy See</a> and to Italy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Basilica di Santa Francesca Romana had a full crowd on Sunday for Cardinal Peter Erdo of Hungary.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yara Nardi/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In his homily, the cardinal, a favorite of conservative Catholics, urged the faithful to pray for a new pope “who will have to deepen the church’s mission in a dramatic phase of humanity’s history.”</p><p>“The church of today must confront first of all the question of its own ambition,” he said, calling for traditions to be protected and the church to focus on evangelization.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Cardinal Erdo, 72, did not mingle with parishioners. He waved off reporters who asked questions but did lower his car window on the way out to greet a toddler.</p><p>The tone of Cardinal Aveline’s Mass on Sunday felt lighter. He opened the service at Santa Maria ai Monti by thanking the Virgin of the Mount for having performed a “little miracle.” Later in the service, the parish priest, the Rev. Francesco Pesce, explained that the cardinal’s bag had been stolen at Mass at the church last week. Three days later, it was found.</p><p>Father Pesce joked that he would become pope and make Cardinal Aveline his secretary of state. There were laughs all around. The cardinal thanked parishioners for making him feel at home.</p><p>“Do not be afraid of the truth, it will set us free,” Cardinal Aveline, 66, the archbishop of Marseille, said during his homily. “Do not be afraid of those who are different from us, because each man and each woman is a brother and sister for whom Christ has risen.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cardinal Aveline at Santa Maria ai Monti on Sunday, where his homily invoked acceptance of others. “Do not be afraid of those who are different from us,” he said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amanda Perobelli/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Cardinal Aveline individually named the teenagers who had been confirmed, one of the sacraments in the Roman Catholic Church, a week earlier. He stopped by the front pews to shake hands with elementary school children whom he later joined in the sacristy for a chat. He spoke with parishioners and patted babies. He did not speak with reporters.</p><p>At the San Gabriele Arcangelo all’Acqua Traversa, Cardinal Ambongo, the archbishop of Kinshasa, made a point to stress the universality of the church in a homily delivered from an altar with priests from the Philippines, India, Madagascar and Italy.</p><p>Cardinal Ambongo, 65, a favorite of Francis, asked the faithful to pray for the cardinals entering in the conclave so that they would be illuminated with the Holy Spirit “to elect for the universal church a pope” who is ready to face the challenges of the modern world.</p><p>After the Mass, the cardinal met with reporters, staying on message with the sort of discipline that would make many political operatives jealous.</p><p>“I asked for prayers — not for prayers for a certain cardinal, for a cardinal from a certain part of the world,” he said. “We pray for a pastor that God wants for his universal church.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Cardinal Ambongo dodged questions about gay, lesbian and transgender Catholics, of whom he has been less than inclusive, saying, “It’s not the time to talk about these things.”</p><p>Then he said hello to parishioners, kissed a baby and went to lunch, hoping, he said, that the papal election would be a short one. “We hope that it will not take a long, long time,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patricia Mazzei is the lead reporter for The Times in Miami, covering Florida and Puerto Rico.</p></div><div><p>Jason Horowitz is the Rome bureau chief for The Times, covering Italy, the Vatican, Greece and other parts of Southern Europe.</p></div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a Times reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
