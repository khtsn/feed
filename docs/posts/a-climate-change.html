    <h1>A Climate Change</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lisa-friedman"><img alt="Lisa Friedman" title="Lisa Friedman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-lisa-friedman/author-lisa-friedman-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></a></p></div></div></div><p>Some of Donald Trump’s first steps on climate change when he enters the White House will send a message that the federal government no longer cares about the issue. He will pull out of the Paris Agreement. Allies say he’ll <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/climate/trump-transition-epa-interior-energy.html" title="">strip the phrases</a> “climate change,” “clean energy” and “environmental justice” from every agency website.</p><p>But the most significant policy moves will come later. They include repealing pollution limits on automobiles, power plants and factories. Agencies will give oil and gas companies easier access to federal lands for drilling. And Trump will work with a Republican-controlled Congress to repeal as much as possible of President Biden’s signature climate change law, the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>The result of all this: The United States will emit more greenhouse gases.</p><p>The Morning is running a series on the policies Trump and his congressional allies may implement next year. In today’s installment, I’ll walk through their climate agenda.</p><h2 id="link-3da84d60">Undoing regulations</h2><p>Trump’s victory will bring changes to almost every aspect of environmental policy. </p><p>Biden accepts the established science that the burning of fossil fuels is warming the planet. He tried to do a lot about it. To reduce demand for those fuels, he signed a law to pump billions of dollars into clean energy. He also forced power plant owners, automobile manufacturers and operators of oil and gas wells to keep carbon dioxide emissions down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Trump mocks all of that. “You know, they used to call it, remember, global warming. But then that didn’t work. Had many different names,” he said in a 2022 speech. “Now their great name is climate change.” </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He said during the race that he’d bring down electricity costs and boost the economy. To achieve that, he wants tax cuts, tariffs and unfettered access for oil companies to extract what he calls the “liquid gold” below. Lee Zeldin, his choice to run the Environmental Protection Agency, is a MAGA loyalist and former New York congressman. While Zeldin took <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/nyregion/zeldin-epa-trump.html" title="">some environmentally friendly positions</a> when he represented Long Island, he has embraced Trump’s approach, and it’s safe to assume he’ll reverse Biden’s regulatory moves.</p><p>Some rules will be especially easy to repeal. The agency only recently finalized a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/climate/methane-fee-epa-oil.html" title="">fee paid by energy companies</a> that spew excess methane gas. Lawmakers can overturn any rule finished within the last 60 days, and Republicans are eager to do so here.</p><p>Trump’s transition team also wants to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/climate/trump-transition-epa-interior-energy.html" title="">hollow out the E.P.A. itself</a>. It would like to move the agency’s headquarters outside Washington, push out civil servants who thwarted Trump’s policies during his first administration and put political appointees in roles traditionally reserved for nonpartisan experts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-7085052e">Drill, baby, drill</h2><p>Trump’s team also has big plans for the Interior Department, which oversees nearly 500 million acres of federal land, and for the Energy Department. Soon they will become almost entirely focused on aiding fossil fuel companies.</p><p>Trump tapped Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to be his interior secretary and to lead a new White House energy council. Burgum is close to fossil fuel companies. Trump picked Chris Wright, who runs a fracking company, to lead the Energy Department.</p><p>The truth about the Biden administration is that oil and gas drilling hit record levels under its watch. But Biden also tried to limit drilling, particularly in fragile wilderness like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Trump promises to end those protections, approve all pending drilling permits and relax regulations against pollution and harming wildlife.</p><h2 id="link-414d6251">Gutting a climate law</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Washington, D.C. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pete Kiehart for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Trump and the new Republican majority will face their biggest test when it comes to repealing the Inflation Reduction Act. The 2022 law offers $390 billion over 10 years to reduce emissions. It funds wind and solar power, electric vehicle battery factories and nuclear reactors.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Trump calls the law wasteful, and many Republicans are eager to dump its clean energy provisions to help pay for tax cuts that Trump has promised. He would ditch <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/trump-electric-vehicle-tax-credit.html" title="">a $7,500 tax credit</a> for people who purchase electric vehicles. Trump also dislikes offshore wind turbines, which he has falsely claimed are causing whales to wash ashore dead. He wants to end a tax break for building them.</p><p>But roughly 80 percent of the law’s clean-energy money spent in the first two years <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/climate/clean-energy-us-2024-election.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">has flowed to Republican congressional districts</a>, making a repeal politically challenging.</p><p>Even corporations aren’t sure about all of Trump’s plans. The country’s top automakers spent billions to transition to electric vehicles. Now they don’t want the incoming president to eliminate emissions rules. Utilities want to keep subsidies for wind and solar energy.</p><p>The test of how far Trump goes won’t rest on opposition from the left. It’ll be about how unified he keeps the right.</p><section data-id="100000009836988" data-testid="capsule-block"><h2 id="link-a2313a7">Trump’s Agenda</h2><p><em>A Morning newsletter series on the policies Donald Trump may pursue next year.</em></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/briefing/trumps-tariffs.html" title="">Tariffs</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/briefing/trump-tax-plans.html" title="">Taxes</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/briefing/a-republican-trifecta.html" title="">Republican priorities</a></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-52b1c218">More on the Trump Administration</h2><ul><li><p>Trump’s cabinet picks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/us/politics/trump-cabinet-america-first.html" title="">fall into three factions</a>: They’re focused on revenge, calming the markets or shrinking the government, David Sanger writes.</p></li><li><p>Investors have swung from elation to confusion after Trump’s victory.
