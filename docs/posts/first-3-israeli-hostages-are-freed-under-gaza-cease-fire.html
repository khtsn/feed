cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel. The hostages, all women, were released into Red Cross custody in Gaza on Sunday and were transferred to Israeli forces, who took them to meet their mothers, the Israeli military said.</p><p>About 100 hostages, living and dead, are thought still to be held captive in Gaza, most of them taken in the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Thirty-three of them will be released during an initial six-week phase of the cease-fire, including female soldiers and civilians, children, men over 50 and sick and wounded people, according to the agreement.</p><p>Here is what we know about the three hostages released on Sunday:</p><h2 id="link-49b61c44">Romi Gonen</h2><p>Ms. Gonen, was 23 when she was captured as she was trying to leave the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/taken-captive-romi-gonen-after-being-shot-in-car-by-terrorists/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nova music festival</a> in southern Israel when Hamas attacked. She was speaking at the time to her mother, Meirav Gonen, who she said had been shot and was bleeding.</p><p>Last February, Meirav Gonen released a recording of <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/07/news/hamas-terrorists-heard-arguing-over-who-got-to-kidnap-israeli-hostage-in-call-with-her-mom-family-says/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">her last phone call</a> with her daughter.

She said her daughter had been shot and that she feared for her life, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5le4w5454o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">telling the BBC</a> that she had welcomed the threats from President-elect Donald J.
