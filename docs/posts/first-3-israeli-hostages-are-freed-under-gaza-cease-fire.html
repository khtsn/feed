    <h1>First 3 Israeli Hostages Are Freed Under Gaza Cease-Fire</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the early weeks of the war, her mother <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-gaza-hamas.html" title="">expressed concern</a> that Israeli military operations in Gaza could endanger the hostages. </p><p>Romi Gonen’s older sister, Yarden, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/world/europe/israel-gaza-war-hostages-plaza.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> in February that she regularly went to a plaza in Tel Aviv where families of hostages have held vigils. </p><p>“None of us is doing anything remotely related to our previous lives,” she said. </p><h2 id="link-57562e31">Emily Damari</h2><p>Ms. Damari, 27 at the time she was captured, is the only hostage with British citizenship still being held. She was taken from her home in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/world/middleeast/israel-kibbutz-kfar-aza.html" title="">Kibbutz Kfar Azza</a> in southern Israel and was <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/taken-captive-uk-citizen-emily-damari-from-her-kfar-aza-apartment/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seen by a neighbor in her own car,</a> driven by a militant, heading toward Gaza.</p><p>Ms. Damari was raised in Israel but traveled to Britain often, according to her mother, British-born Mandy Damari, who was in Israel in December to speak with officials and the news media and to plead for a hostage and cease-fire deal. She said her daughter had been shot and that she feared for her life, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5le4w5454o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">telling the BBC</a> that she had welcomed the threats from President-elect Donald J. Trump that there would be “all hell to pay” if no deal was reached by his inauguration.</p><p>Last January, in January, a hostage who had been released from Gaza, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/26/world/israel-hamas-hostages-gaza-war" title="">Dafna Elyakim</a>, told Israeli news media that she and her younger sister had been taken into Hamas’s underground tunnels, where they met other female hostages including Ms. Damari.</p><p>On the eve of the first anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks, Mandy Damari spoke at <a href="https://www.thejc.com/community/she-likes-drinking-pints-and-watching-the-footy-emily-damari-is-the-last-remaining-british-captive-of-hamas-n3oe0r88" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an event in Hyde Park</a> in London, where she described her daughter as a soccer fan who enjoyed a drink and had “the classic British sense of humor, with a dash of Israeli chutzpah thrown in for good measure.”</p><h2 id="link-60f7500">Doron Steinbrecher</h2><p>Ms. Steinbrecher, who was 30 when she was captured from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Azza, is a veterinary nurse with Romanian and Israeli citizenship. According to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/presumed-captive-doron-steinbrecher-theyve-arrived-they-have-me/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Israeli news media</a>, she was in touch with her family on the kibbutz when the militants attacked, telling her parents that they had smashed her windows and shot into her room. </p><p>“They’ve arrived, they have me,” she said in a subsequent voice message sent to friends. </p><p>Last January, Hamas released a video clip of Ms. Steinbrecher and two other captives, Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev, in which they pleaded for their release. </p><p>Last March, on her 31st birthday, the <a href="https://www.jns.org/a-mother-pleads-for-her-kidnapped-daughters-life/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jewish News Syndicate</a> published an interview with her mother, Simona Steinbrecher, who said that she had looked pale and thin in the video. She said she was concerned that Ms. Steinbrecher was not getting the daily medication she needed, though she did not specify what that was.</p><p>“She’s a strong woman, but it’s terrible being there,” Simona Steinbrecher said. </p></div></div>
