Cross custody in Gaza on Sunday and were transferred to Israeli forces, who took them to meet their mothers, the Israeli military said.</p><p>About 100 hostages, living and dead, are thought still to be held in Gaza, most of them taken in the deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Thirty-three of them will be released during an initial six-week phase of the cease-fire, including female soldiers and civilians, children, men over 50 and sick and wounded people, according to the agreement.</p><p>“The vast majority” of the 33 hostages to be released in the six-week first phase of the cease-fire are alive, an Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, said Sunday in a discussion on social media.</p><p>Video released by the Israeli military <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_qELjvLED8&amp;ab_channel=IsraeliPM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">showed</a> the three hostages being reunited with their families at Sheba Hospital in Israel.</p><p>In one clip, one of the returned hostages, Romi Gonen, is surrounded in an embrace by members of her family as they tearfully comfort one another. Yarden Gonen, her sister, who had traveled around the world in the past year to lobby for Romi’s release, jumps up and down in the video as the family hugs. In another clip, another released hostage, Doron Steinbrecher, tearfully embraces loved ones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-1"><div><h3>Here’s what you need to know:</h3><ul><li><a href="#link-49b61c44">Romi Gonen</a></li><li><a href="#link-57562e31">Emily Damari</a></li><li><a href="#link-60f7500">Doron Steinbrecher</a></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-49b61c44">Romi Gonen</h2><p>Ms. Gonen was 23 when she was captured as she was trying to leave the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/taken-captive-romi-gonen-after-being-shot-in-car-by-terrorists/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nova music festival</a> in southern Israel when Hamas attacked.
