Some of the teams on the council that focus on specific regions or issues will be gutted, while others will be collapsed and folded into others. Still other teams will cease to exist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Andy Baker, Vice President JD Vance’s national security adviser, will serve as the deputy for the reconfigured council, alongside Robert Gabriel, whose current title is assistant to the president for policy.</p><p>The changes were <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/23/white-house-national-security-council-trump-rubio" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier by Axios</a>. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The council has a core staff of presidential appointees supported by dozens of specialists who are detailed — or essentially on loan — from other departments and agencies across the government. Presidents have used the council in different ways, but it has had a central role in foreign policy events since its creation in 1947.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s allies have long argued that the council had grown too large over time.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also held a deep distrust for and suspicion of the council since the earliest days of his first term, in 2017. People who have worked for him over time say he believes it was the source of significant undermining of his policy views.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s first impeachment involved testimony before Congress from Alexander S. Vindman, the council’s director of European affairs, who said the president pressed the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, for an investigation into Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family. At the time, Mr. Biden was one of Mr. Trump’s chief potential rivals in the 2020 election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In early April, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-meeting-laura-loomer.html" title="">fired several N.S.C. aides</a> after a meeting with the far-right activist Laura Loomer, who presented him with a list of people she suspected of disloyalty.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a White House correspondent for The Times, reporting on President Trump.</p></div><div><p>Erica L.
