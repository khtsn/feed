data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The federal government sued Southwest Airlines on Wednesday, accusing the airline of harming passengers who flew on two routes that were plagued by consistent delays in 2022.</p><p>In a lawsuit, the Transportation Department said it was seeking more than $2.1 million in civil penalties over the flights between airports in Chicago and Oakland, Calif., as well as Baltimore and Cleveland, that were chronically delayed over five months that year.</p><p>“Airlines have a legal obligation to ensure that their flight schedules provide travelers with realistic departure and arrival times,” the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, said in a statement. “Today’s action sends a message to all airlines that the department is prepared to go to court in order to enforce passenger protections.”</p><p>Carriers are barred from operating unrealistic flight schedules, which the Transportation Department considers an unfair, deceptive and anticompetitive practice. A “chronically delayed” flight is defined as one that operates at least 10 times a month and is late by at least 30 minutes more than half the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a statement, Southwest said it was “disappointed” that the department chose to sue over the flights that took place more than two years ago. The airline said it had operated 20 million flights since the Transportation Department enacted its policy against chronically delayed flights more than a decade ago, with no other violations.</p><p>“Any claim that these two flights represent an unrealistic schedule is simply not credible when compared with our performance over the past 15 years,” Southwest said.</p><p>Last year, Southwest canceled fewer than 1 percent of its flights, but more than 22 percent arrived at least 15 minutes later than scheduled, <a href="https://www.cirium.com/thoughtcloud/most-on-time-airlines-airports-2024-revealed-cirium/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Cirium, an aviation data provider</a>. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines all had fewer such delays.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In it, the government said that a Southwest flight from Chicago to Oakland arrived late 19 out of 25 trips in April 2022, with delays averaging more than an hour. The consistent delays continued through August of that year, averaging an hour or more. On another flight, between Baltimore and Cleveland, average delay times reached as high as 96 minutes per month during the same period. In a statement, the department said that Southwest, rather than poor weather or air traffic control, was responsible for more than 90 percent of the delays.</p><p>“Holding out these chronically delayed flights disregarded consumers’ need to have reliable information about the real arrival time of a flight and harmed thousands of passengers traveling on these Southwest flights by causing disruptions to travel plans or other plans,” the department said in the lawsuit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The government said Southwest had violated federal rules 58 times in August 2022 after four months of consistent delays. Each violation faces a civil penalty of up to $37,377, or more than $2.1 million in total, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>The Transportation Department on Wednesday also said that it had penalized Frontier Airlines for chronically delayed flights, fining the airline $650,000. Half that amount was paid to the Treasury and the rest is slated to be forgiven if the airline has no more chronically delayed flights over the next three years.</p><p>This month, the department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/travel/jetblue-fined-chronic-delays-east-coast.html" title="">ordered JetBlue Airways to pay a $2 million fine</a> for failing to address similarly delayed flights over a span of more than a year ending in November 2023, with half the money going to passengers affected by the delays.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Niraj Chokshi writes about aviation, rail and other transportation industries.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/niraj-chokshi">More about Niraj Chokshi</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/southwest-airlines-company">Southwest Airlines Company</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/transportation-department">Transportation Department</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Biden Administration</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Washington.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Last Days in Office: </strong>As his term nears its end, President Biden has issued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/biden-policy-decisions.html">series of policy decisions intended to cement his agenda</a> and, in some cases, make it harder for President-elect Donald Trump to put in place his own.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nicotine in Cigarettes: </strong>The White House unveiled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/health/fda-cigarettes-low-nicotine.html">proposal to cut the level of nicotine in cigarettes</a>, a last-minute push on a plan that could meaningfully cut cancer rates and extend the lives of millions of smokers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cuba: </strong>The president will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/politics/biden-cuba.html">remove Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terrorism</a>, U.S. officials said, as a part of a deal that is expected to free protesters jailed during a sweeping 2021 crackdown on dissent.</p></li><li><p><strong>A.I.
