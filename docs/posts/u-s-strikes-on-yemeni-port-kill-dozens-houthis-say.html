The Houthis have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/houthi-yemen-red-sea-attacks.html" title="">attacking ships in the nearby Red Sea</a>, and firing rockets and drones at Israel in a campaign that it says is in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>The American bombardment targeted the port of Ras Isa, a major fuel depot in the Houthi-controlled province of Hudaydah. At least 74 people were killed and more than 100 others wounded, <a href="https://x.com/alasbahi_dr/status/1913199623784607837" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said Anees al-Asbahi</a>, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. The toll could not be independently verified.</p><p>President Trump has expanded efforts by the Biden administration to degrade the Houthis, vowing that they will be “completely annihilated.” Since entering office, Mr. Trump has also tightened U.S. sanctions against the group and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/middleeast/trump-yemen-houthi-rebels-terrorists.html" title="">re-designated the militia</a> as a “foreign terrorist organization.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the increasingly forceful American strikes on the Houthis have yet to deter them from carrying out further attacks. Instead, the Houthis have said that they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/13/world/middleeast/american-strikes-yemen-war.html" title="">welcome a conflict</a> with the United States, their declared enemy.</p><p>Experts have also warned that attacking ports like Ras Isa could worsen the already dire conditions in Yemen. The United Nations has described the humanitarian crisis in the country as the world’s largest, with about 80 percent of the population in need of essential aid.</p><p>The Houthis began their attacks on Israel and on ships in the Red Sea after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">the war in Gaza</a> began in October 2023, ignited by the Hamas-led attack on Israel. Most of the Houthi projectiles have been intercepted by Israeli air defenses, though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html" title="">a drone attack in July</a> killed a man in Tel Aviv.</p><p>The militia briefly stopped firing rockets at Israel during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-gaza.html" title="">a two-month cease-fire</a> between Israel and Hamas this year. But after Israel ended the truce in mid-March with a renewed offensive in Gaza, the Houthis resumed firing ballistic missiles at Israeli territory.</p><p>Just a few hours after the American strikes, early on Friday morning, Houthi militants fired another ballistic missile at Israel. Air-raid sirens blared across the country’s heartland, instructing many Israelis to head to bomb shelters. There were no immediate reports of casualties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The American military said that it had targeted Ras Isa because shipments of fuel were still flowing into the port in defiance of American sanctions, allowing funds to flow into the Houthi coffers.</p><p>“U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue,” the American military’s Central Command said. “This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully.”</p><p>Hudaydah’s ports are also the main conduit by which fuel, food and aid enter impoverished northern Yemen, where more than 20 million people live.</p><p>In the past, the United Nations and humanitarian groups have condemned the targeting of the port as damaging vital civilian infrastructure.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and its allies similarly cited the need to degrade the Houthis when the militia tried to take over Hudaydah during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/world/middleeast/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html" title="">their nearly decade-long war</a> against the group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Back then, the United States and other countries pressed the Saudis to stop, fearing a humanitarian disaster. A United Nations-mediated agreement halted the fighting around the city in 2018.</p><p>Israeli fighter jets have also bombed Yemen multiple times since the Houthis began attacking Israel in late 2023, at times flying over 1,000 miles to strike ports and power stations in Houthi-controlled territory.</p><p>The Houthis have vowed to continue attacking until Israel ends its military offensive in Gaza.</p><p>Saeed Al-Batati<!-- --> contributed reporting from Al Mukalla, Yemen.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
