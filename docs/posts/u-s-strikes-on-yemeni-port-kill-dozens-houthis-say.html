The Houthis have been firing rockets and drones at Israel in a campaign it says is in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/houthi-yemen-red-sea-attacks.html" title="">attacking ships in the nearby Red Se</a>a.</p><p>The American bombardment targeted the port of Ras Isa, a major fuel depot in the Houthi-controlled province of Hudaydah. At least 74 people were killed and more than 150 others wounded, <a href="https://x.com/alasbahi_dr/status/1913199623784607837" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said Anees al-Asbahi</a>, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry, adding that a search was still underway for missing victims.</p><p>The toll could not be independently verified, but the figure could make the U.S. strike one of the deadliest since President Trump began <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/us-attack-houthis.html" title="">escalating</a> U.S. attacks on the Houthis in mid-March. More than 190 people have been killed since, Mr. al-Asbahi said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>U.S. officials have offered little information to the public on recent American operations against the Houthis. The Department of Defense declined to comment on the reported death toll in Thursday’s attack.</p><p>Since entering office, Mr. Trump has ramped up efforts started by the Biden administration to degrade the Houthis, vowing that they will be “completely annihilated.” Since entering office, Mr. Trump has also tightened U.S. sanctions against the group and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/middleeast/trump-yemen-houthi-rebels-terrorists.html" title="">re-designated the militia</a> as a “foreign terrorist organization.”</p><p>But the increasingly forceful American strikes on the Houthis have yet to deter them from carrying out further attacks. In closed briefings, Pentagon officials have acknowledged that the heavy bombardment has had limited success in destroying the Houthis’ vast, largely underground arsenal, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/us-strikes-yemen-houthis.html" title="">according to congressional aides and allies</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Houthis have said that they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/13/world/middleeast/american-strikes-yemen-war.html" title="">welcome a greater conflict</a> with the United States, their declared enemy.</p><p>Experts have also warned that attacking ports like Ras Isa could worsen the already dire conditions in Yemen. The United Nations has described the humanitarian crisis in the country as the world’s largest, with about 80 percent of the population in need of essential aid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The bombing’s deadly toll plunged Hudaydah into grief, said Manal Ahmad, 35, who lives in the city. She said she personally knew families who had lost loved ones, and social media was full of posts mourning those killed.</p><p>“We saw the images of the victims and the extent of the destruction,” Ms. Ahmad said in a phone interview. “What legitimate target are they talking about? Whatever the goal was — if there even was one — I don’t think it justifies the number of dead and wounded.”</p><p>The Houthis began their attacks on Israel after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">the war in Gaza</a> began in October 2023, ignited by the Hamas-led attack on Israel. Most of the Houthi projectiles have been intercepted by Israeli air defenses, though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html" title="">a drone attack in July</a> killed a man in Tel Aviv.</p><p>The Yemeni militants have also sought to enforce what they claim is a blockade on vessels with Israeli or American ties, menacing merchant ships passing through the Red Sea. In practice, the Houthis targeted ships with no clear connection to either country, upending global shipping and forcing boats to shirk the busy maritime corridor for a relatively little-used route around southern <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/houthi-red-sea-attacks-shipping-lanes-africa.html" title="">Africa</a> instead.</p><p>In January 2024, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution demanding that the Houthis immediately stop attacking commercial ships. The United States and Britain subsequently began bombarding Houthi targets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The militia briefly stopped firing rockets at Israel during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-gaza.html" title="">a two-month cease-fire</a> between Israel and Hamas this year. But after Israel ended the truce in mid-March with a renewed offensive in Gaza, the Houthis resumed firing ballistic missiles at Israeli territory.</p><p>Just a few hours after the American strikes, early on Friday morning, Houthi militants fired another missile at Israel. Air-raid sirens blared across the country’s heartland, instructing many Israelis to head to bomb shelters. There were no immediate reports of casualties.</p><p>The U.S. military’s Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, said that it had targeted Ras Isa because shipments of fuel were still flowing into the port in defiance of American sanctions, allowing funds to flow into the Houthi coffers. It did not provide its own assessment of how many people were killed in the bombardment.</p><p>“U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue,” the military said in a statement. “This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully.”</p><p>Hudaydah’s ports are also the main conduit by which fuel, food and aid enter impoverished northern Yemen, where more than 20 million people live.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the past, the United Nations and humanitarian groups have condemned the targeting of the port as damaging vital civilian infrastructure.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and its allies similarly cited the need to degrade the Houthis when the militia tried to take over Hudaydah during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/world/middleeast/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html" title="">their nearly decade-long war</a> against the group.</p><p>Back then, the United States and other countries pressed the Saudis to stop, fearing a humanitarian disaster. A United Nations-mediated agreement halted the fighting around the city in 2018.</p><p>Israeli fighter jets have also bombed Yemen multiple times since the Houthis began attacking Israel in late 2023, at times flying over 1,000 miles to strike ports and power stations in Houthi-controlled territory.</p><p>The Houthis have vowed to continue attacking until Israel ends its military offensive in Gaza.</p><p>Saeed Al-Batati<!-- --> contributed reporting from Al Mukalla, Yemen.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>April 18, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the route some ships are using to avoid Houthi attacks on the Red Sea. It is around the southern tip of Africa, not the Horn of Africa.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
