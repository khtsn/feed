Rivers contain carbon dioxide that is constantly escaping into the air, where it traps heat and warms the planet. But adding limestone converts some of that carbon dioxide into a stable molecule that instead stays underwater and washes into the sea, where it should remain trapped for thousands of years.</p><p>“The beauty of it is how simple the technology is,” said Eddie Halfyard, a freshwater ecologist and co-founder of <a href="https://www.carbonrun.io/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CarbonRun</a>, the start-up building the $400,000 limestone machine, with plans for many more. “We let the water do most of the work.”</p><p>With the dangers of climate change growing and greenhouse gas emissions soaring, scientists and entrepreneurs are increasingly exploring ways to deliberately intervene in climate systems to cool the Earth. Overwhelmingly, scientists say nations must sharply cut the pollution from burning fossil fuels that is driving up global temperatures. But many also believe that some of the excess carbon in the atmosphere must also be pulled out in order to preserve a livable planet.</p><p>“The potential for ocean-based carbon removal is huge, and it’s been really underexplored,” said Nan Ransohoff, who heads Frontier, a $1 billion fund backed by tech giants like Stripe and Alphabet that is <a href="https://frontierclimate.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investing heavily in strategies</a> to take greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A metal silo stretches toward the sky in the middle of a stand of tall trees." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-01-jhpc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>CarbonRun’s first limestone silo in Pictou County, Nova Scotia.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-2"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A similar liming machine built by salmon conservationists in 2016 sends a slurry of limestone and water into the Killag River near Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since the industrial age, oceans have naturally absorbed roughly one-third of the 1.7 trillion tons of carbon dioxide that humans have pumped into the atmosphere largely by burning coal, gas and oil.

Some environmental groups worry that even early experiments with these techniques could threaten fish and other aquatic life.</p><p>But with some companies eager to turn a profit from engineering the ocean, scientists say it’s imperative that experimentation takes place so the technology’s benefits and perils are fully understood.</p><p>“They all have their problems, they all have consequences,” Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, said of the different ideas to slow global warming by engineering the ocean. “But I think we just have to also weigh these,” he said, “against the consequences of doing nothing, which are to me catastrophic.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A limestone pile managed by Mosher Limestone, which supplies CarbonRun.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Luke Connell, CarbonRun’s chief executive, demonstrated how lime and water mix into the river.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-NaN">∴</h2><p><strong>Altering marine environments</strong> to cool the planet has been contentious from the moment scientists first suggested it four decades ago.</p><p>One early proposal was to sprinkle iron into the sea to fertilize enormous meadows of plankton that would breathe in carbon and take it with them to the ocean floor when they died. The backlash was fierce, especially after entrepreneurs began conducting unauthorized iron tests in the Pacific.</p><p>Today, CarbonRun’s founders are trying to avoid similar blowback by proving that adding limestone to rivers doesn’t just take carbon out of the air — it can also safely benefit local ecosystems.</p><p>It helps that the start-up is using a technique invented long ago to deal with a different environmental problem: acid rain. In the 1970s and ’80s, industrial pollution made rainfall more acidic, which poisoned lakes and streams around the world. Some of the hardest-hit countries, including Norway, Sweden and Canada, <a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/a05-009" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">began adding limestone</a> to their waterways to restore the pH balance and help fish populations recover. It worked.</p><p>A few years ago, two scientists in Nova Scotia, Shannon Sterling and Eddie Halfyard, realized that adding limestone <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370703079_Title_Addition_of_Alkalinity_to_Rivers_a_new_CO2_Removal_Strategy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also helped rivers sequester more carbon</a>. They joined Luke Connell, a Toronto-based entrepreneur, to form CarbonRun.</p><p>“It’s sort of like Ozempic,” Mr. Connell joked, referring to the diabetes drug that was later shown to have significant weight-loss effects. “This is a way to restore rivers that also happens to help our climate problem.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-11"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Greta Rybus for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/23/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-print-3/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-03-jhpc-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/23/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-print-3/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-03-jhpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Greta Rybus for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-02-jhpc/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-02-jhpc-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-02-jhpc/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-02-jhpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit="Greta Rybus for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/23/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-print-2/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-04-jhpc-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/23/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-print-2/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-04-jhpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-3-" data-credit="Greta Rybus for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/23/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-print-1/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-05-jhpc-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/23/multimedia/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-print-1/00cli-buyingtime-oceans-05-jhpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>Eddie Halfyard, CarbonRun&#39;s chief technology officer; a meter for measuring water levels; a local resident of the West River Pictou; Shannon Sterling, a co-founder of CarbonRun and a hydrologist at Dalhousie University.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The insight came as some major companies were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/climate/carbon-removal-technology.html" title="">willing to pay for carbon removal</a> as a way of offsetting their emissions.</p><p>It’s relatively straightforward for CarbonRun to show that adding limestone to rivers converts some carbon dioxide into a stable bicarbonate. Technicians sample river water above and below the limestone machines and can directly measure change, while accounting for a few other smaller complications.</p><p>The harder part is mining and moving the limestone cheaply: CarbonRun needs roughly two tons of rock for every ton of carbon it removes. If the company can solve that, there are hundreds of acidified rivers from Maine to Indonesia close to limestone deposits, potentially allowing for hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide to be captured each year.</p><p>For now, CarbonRun has been holding extensive public meetings with communities and First Nations in Nova Scotia, understanding that public opposition could be one of their biggest obstacles. The fact that river liming has already helped revive the province’s devastated fisheries is a selling point.</p><p>Donald Rutledge, 79, lives in Sheet Harbour and had watched the salmon, once so plentiful that they leaped out of the water, vanish in the 1980s. He was initially skeptical that adding limestone to rivers would help but became choked with emotion, he said, when the silvery fish returned.</p><p>“I can go fishing with my grandson.

They plan to do this several times a month to inform a complex computer model overseen by Katja Fennel, a Dalhousie oceanographer, who is trying to calculate how much extra carbon is being transferred to the ocean.</p><p>It’s still too early to know the results. “As a scientist, I’m always skeptical,” said Dr. Atamanchuk. “But based on everything we’ve seen so far, I’m optimistic.” </p><p>Even if the Dalhousie researchers prove the technique works in a protected harbor, others will have to test it elsewhere, in places with different circulation patterns, to have confidence in its efficacy.

Projects are subject to laws, agreements and regulations — if they exist — in ways that vary place to place.</p><p>Planetary, for instance, has permission to operate in Halifax Harbour because it is adding magnesium oxide through the outflow of a power plant; it needs to follow Canadian clean water laws and avoid raising the pH of the water above a certain level. International rules governing the open ocean are more complicated.</p><p>This regulatory patchwork might not be a big problem now, said David Santillo, a marine biologist at the University of Exeter and Greenpeace Research Laboratories. But as geoengineering grows, it could lead to disputes between countries. “It will always be very difficult to prove whether certain activity done in one area has caused an adverse effect that’s detected somewhere else,” Dr. Santillo said.</p><p>For Woods Hole’s experiment, Dr. Subhas and his team need a permit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

He said that would limit the ecological consequences, though not all experts agree.</p><p>“If this were to accidentally happen, and you drop 50 percent sodium hydroxide solution into the seawater, it would be considered a chemical spillage,” said James Kerry, a marine biologist with the wildlife protection group OceanCare.</p><p>Certain types of ocean geoengineering, if tried at scale, are also bound to affect deep-sea life, said Lisa Levin, a marine ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “We owe it to future generations to have at least one part of the planet we haven’t messed up,” she said.</p><p>By August, the E.P.A. still hadn’t given final approval, and the research boat the scientists planned to use became unavailable. They postponed the experiment until next summer, a delay Dr. Subhas called “frustrating.” He and his colleagues have met with fishermen and other community groups to try to assuage their concerns.</p><p>As he sees it, scientists are trying to study these climate solutions rigorously, which takes time. But for-profit companies are looking to move quickly. And they might not be as careful about getting the science right.</p><p>“That keeps me up at night,” Dr. Subhas said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Brad Plumer is a Times reporter who covers technology and policy efforts to address global warming.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/brad-plumer">More about Brad Plumer</a></span></p></div><div><p>Raymond Zhong reports on climate and environmental issues for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/raymond-zhong">More about Raymond Zhong</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Bold Plan Would Turn the World’s Oceans Into Carbon Busters<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Climate and the Environment</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Climate F.A.Q.:</strong> Do you have questions about climate change? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/climate/climate-change-faq.html">We’ve got answers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Methane Emissions: </strong>Satellite data shows the United States releasing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/climate/us-methane-greenhouse-gas.html">more and more of the potent greenhouse gas</a> into the atmosphere, despite pledges to cut back.</p></li><li><p><strong>Food’s Hidden Costs: </strong>Damage to the natural world isn’t factored into the price of food.
