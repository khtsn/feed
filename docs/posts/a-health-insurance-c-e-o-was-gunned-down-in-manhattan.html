The police described the killing as a targeted attack. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/04/nyregion/brian-thompson-uhc-ceo-shot" title="">Here’s what we know</a>.</p><p>The executive, Brian Thompson of UnitedHealthcare, was shot just after 6:45 a.m. near the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/nyregion/hilton-hotel-midtown-shooting.html" title="">New York Hilton Midtown</a>, where his company was holding its annual investor presentations. The surrounding blocks are a popular holiday destination for tourists and shoppers.</p><p>Surveillance video obtained by The New York Times shows a gunman in a dark hooded jacket walking up behind Thompson and firing at him at least three times. Police said the attacker had waited for Thompson, ignoring other passers-by, before shooting him in the back and leg. Thompson collapsed on the sidewalk against a wall before the gunman fled on an electric Citi Bike into Central Park.</p><p><strong>For more:</strong> Thompson, 50, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/health/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare.html" title="">managed a division that employs about 140,000 people</a>. He had recently received several threats, though that is not unusual for health insurance executives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators for and against transgender rights at the Supreme Court today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6a98b650">Justices appeared set to uphold a Tennessee law on trans care</h2><p>The Supreme Court’s conservative majority seemed inclined today to uphold a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/04/us/supreme-court-transgender-care" title="">Tennessee law banning transition care for transgender youth</a>. A decision in the case, which is expected by June, could set a precedent for transgender rights in America and affect <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/gender-transition-bans-states.html" title="">similar laws in more than 20 other states</a>.</p><p>At least five of the court’s conservative justices appeared likely to side with Tennessee. Some of the justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, argued that judgments about contested scientific evidence should be made by legislatures rather than judges.</p><p>The liberals on the court seemed more accommodating to the plaintiffs, who are backed by the Biden administration and argued that the Tennessee law violated the Constitution by denying equal protections for transgender people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pete Hegseth after meetings on Capitol Hill today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-5c3de901">Trump’s support for Hegseth is wobbling</h2><p>A small but pivotal group of Republicans has expressed concern about confirming Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s choice for defense secretary.
