This number doesn’t translate directly into what you’ll pay if you’re a borrower. If only credit card companies charged so little.</p><p>Still, this move should eventually bring interest rates down for many borrowers, even as it is likely to lower the rates that financial institutions pay out to savers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Here’s what to watch for in five key areas of your financial life, as rates fall now — and hopefully (for borrowers at least) even more in the coming months.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Once you establish your budget for a car, get preapproved for an auto loan through a credit union or bank.  </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Scott Olson/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-361a97e3">Auto Rates</h2><p><strong>What’s happening now: </strong>Auto rates and car prices have been <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/august-2024-atp-report/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trending lower</a> but they still remain elevated, making affordability a challenge. But dealerships are offering more incentives and discounts to attract buyers, and that’s expected to continue.</p><p>Car loans tend to track with the yield on the five-year Treasury note, which is influenced by the Fed’s key rate. But other factors determine how much borrowers actually pay, including: your credit history, the type of vehicle, the loan term and the down payment. Lenders also take into consideration the levels of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/08/your-money/car-loans-rates.html" title="">delinquent auto loans</a>.

Rates for used cars were higher: The average loan carried an 11.3 percent rate in August, marginally higher than 11.2 percent last August and 9 percent in August 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><strong>Where and how to shop: </strong>Once you establish your budget, get preapproved for a car loan through a credit union or bank (Capital One and Ally are two of the largest auto lenders) so you have a point of reference to compare financing available through the dealership, if you decide to go that route. Always negotiate on the price of the car (including all fees), not the monthly payments, which can obscure the loan terms and what you’ll be paying in total over the life of the loan.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Consumers looking for deals on credit cards should seek out smaller banks and credit unions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mario Tama/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-59ab0f67">Credit Cards</h2><p><strong>What’s happening now: </strong>The interest rates you pay on any balances that you carry should fall after the Fed has acted, though it may not be instant and it will vary by card issuer. As of May, the average interest rate when banks were assessing interest on balances was 22.76 percent, according to <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Reserve data</a>.</p><p>Much depends, however, on your credit score and the type of card. Rewards cards, for instance, often charge higher-than-average interest rates.</p><p><strong>Where and how to shop: </strong>Earlier this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-report-finds-large-banks-charge-higher-credit-card-interest-rates-than-small-banks-and-credit-unions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent up a flare</a> to let people know that the 25 biggest credit-card issuers had rates that were 8 to 10 percentage points higher than smaller banks or credit unions. For the average cardholder, that can add up to $400 to $500 more in interest each year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Consider seeking out a smaller bank or credit union that might offer you a better deal. Many credit unions require you to work or live someplace particular to qualify for membership, but some bigger credit unions may have <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/credit-unions-anyone-can-join-170123360.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">looser rules</a>.</p><p>Before you make a move, call your current card issuer and ask them to match the best interest rate you’ve found in the marketplace that you’ve already qualified for. And if you do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/your-money/credit-card-balance-transfer-can-reap-savings-if-done-cautiously.html" title="">transfer your balance</a>, keep a close eye on fees, whether your initial interest rate expires and if so, what it might jump to.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prospective home buyers would be wise to get several mortgage rate quotes from a selection of mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patrick T.

Housing prices remain high, in large part because there simply aren’t enough homes to meet demand.</p><p>Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages don’t move in tandem with the Fed’s benchmark, but instead generally track with the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including expectations about inflation, the Fed’s actions and how investors react.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/business/mortgage-rates.html" title="">6.2 percent</a> as of Thursday, down from 6.35 percent the previous week and 7.18 percent this time last year. Rates are also more than a percentage point lower than their most recent peak of 7.22 percent in early May.</p><p>Other home loans are more closely tethered to the central bank’s decisions. Home-equity lines of credit and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/your-money/adjustable-rate-mortgage.html" title="">adjustable-rate mortgages</a> — which carry variable interest rates — generally rise within two billing cycles after a change in the Fed’s rates.</p><p><strong>Where and how to shop</strong>: Prospective home buyers would be wise to get several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/realestate/What-Kind-of-Mortgage-Should-I-Get.html" title="">mortgage</a> rate quotes — on the same day, since rates fluctuate — from a selection of mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions.</p><p>That should include: the rate you’ll pay; any <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/business/home-closing-costs-rise.html" title="">discount points</a>, which are optional fees buyers can pay to “buy down” their interest rate; and other items like lender-related fees. Look to the “<a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-the-difference-between-a-mortgage-interest-rate-and-an-apr-en-135/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20mortgage%20APR,pay%20to%20get%20the%20loan." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual percentage rate</a>,” which usually includes these items, to get an apples-to-apples comparison of your total costs across different loans.

Those are all likely to inch lower, in line with the Fed’s move, but some providers may move faster than others. That usually depends on whether the bank wants to attract new customers by dangling yields that are more attractive than their competitors’ offerings.</p><p>But you can safely assume that online high-yield savings account will still offer more competitive rates than traditional commercial banks, whose yields have remained anemic throughout this period of higher interest rates (averaging 0.45 percent as of September, according to DepositAccounts.com, part of the online loan marketplace LendingTree).</p><p><strong>Where and how to shop: </strong>Rates are one consideration, but you’ll also want to look at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/business/online-lending-banking-money-risks.html" title="">providers’ history</a>, minimum deposit requirements and any fees (high-yield savings accounts don’t usually charge fees, but other products, like money market funds, do). DepositAccounts.com, which tracks rates across thousands of institutions, is a good place to start comparing providers.</p><p>If you’re considering certificates of deposit, now is probably the time to lock in a decent rate if you haven’t already. Online C.D.s with a one-year term <a href="https://www.depositaccounts.com/cd/1-year-cd-rates.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">averaged 4.97</a> percent in August, according to DepositAccounts.com.

Rates reset on July 1 each year and follow a formula based on the 10-year Treasury bond auction in May.</p><p>Private student loans are a bit of a wild card. Undergraduates often need a co-signer, rates can be fixed or variable and much depends on your credit score.</p><p><strong>Where and how to shop: </strong>Many banks and credit unions want nothing to do with student loans, so you’ll want to shop around extensively, including with lenders that specialize in private student loans.</p><p>You’ll often see online ads and websites offering interest rates from each lender that can range by 15 percentage points or so.
