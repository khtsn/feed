But Mr. Trump’s meeting of 15 minutes or so with Mr. Zelensky was surrounded with a symbolism and mystery of its own.</p><p>Photographs of the session released by Ukraine showed that the meeting took place in St. Peter’s Basilica, the two men perched on cushioned metal chairs, deep in conversation as they waited for the services to begin. It was a remarkable scene — an impromptu meeting between two men who have made no secret of their deep dislike and distrust for each other.</p><p>It was the first time they had seen each other since their contentious encounter in the Oval Office in late February, which ended in a televised argument over Mr. Trump’s turn away from Kyiv, and toward a new relationship with Russia. Mr. Zelensky was told to leave the White House, his lunch left uneaten and an economic partnership deal left unsigned.</p><p>A White House spokesman, Stephen Cheung, called Saturday’s encounter at the funeral a “very productive discussion,” but gave no details. In a later post on X, Mr. Zelensky described the brief talk as a “good meeting” where the pair discussed “a lot one on one,” including security guarantees to make sure Russia does not use a cease-fire as an opportunity to rearm and attack again.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s speedy departure came despite a suggestion from a Ukrainian spokesman that more talks would take place in Rome on Saturday. After Mr. Trump boarded Air Force One to leave, the spokesman then said a second meeting would not occur because of the “very tight schedules of the presidents.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The short meeting came at a critical moment in the push to end the war between Ukraine and Russia, with Mr. Trump trying to push Mr. Zelensky and President Vladimir V. Putin into direct talks.</p><p>“They are very close to a deal,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114400805703099287" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social</a> late Friday, after landing in Rome. “The two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off.’”</p><p>But as Mr. Zelensky arrived in Rome, Russia claimed that it had retaken a last village in Kursk, the Russian territory that Ukraine invaded last summer, partly to gain leverage in negotiations. Ukraine denied that its forces had fully withdrawn.</p><p>Earlier this week, the United States presented Ukraine with a plan for a cease-fire that would give Russia de facto control over all of the lands it has illegally seized since the invasion began three years ago. The proposal also includes a formal recognition by the United States that the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Moscow in 2014, is now Russian territory, a major reversal of American policy.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said this past week that Ukraine would never make that concession. But he traveled to Rome with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/europe/ukraine-peace-counterproposal.html" title="">counterproposal</a>, Ukrainian officials said, that would end the conflict on far less generous terms for Russia, and that would include billions of dollars in reparations for Ukraine, paid by Russia. The counteroffer makes no mention, though, of whether Ukraine would fully regain Crimea or other territory seized by Russia, and postpones discussion of territorial issues until after a cease-fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Neither proposal meets several of Mr. Putin’s demands, including that the size of Ukraine’s military be sharply limited.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A picture made available by the Ukrainian presidential press office shows President Trump meeting privately with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Saturday at St. Peter’s Basilica on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ukrainian Presidential Press Service</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump, flying back home, posted a lengthy message blaming Ukraine’s plight in part on his predecessors, Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr., the latter of whom had been sitting four rows behind him at the funeral. “This is Sleepy Joe Biden’s War, not mine,” he wrote.</p><p>He also criticized Russia’s leader. “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns over the last few days,” he wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.” Mr. Trump also threatened new sanctions against Russia in the post.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky’s description of the meeting made clear that he had learned a lesson from his Oval Office encounter: Always show gratitude, even if sharp disagreements remain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results,” he wrote. He ended with: “Thank you @POTUS.”</p><p>Among the points covered in the discussion, he wrote, were a “full and unconditional ceasefire,” and a “reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out.” The last was noteworthy: Mr. Trump’s proposal has only vague security guarantees for Ukraine. The Ukrainian proposal calls for a European peacekeeping force with the United States providing backup.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky also met with other leaders, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain. In a post on X, Mr. Macron, who included a photo of himself walking with the Ukrainian leader, said Mr. Zelensky was “ready for an unconditional ceasefire.” The offices of Ms. Meloni and Mr. Starmer emphasized Mr. Zelensky’s desire to “secure a just and lasting peace.”</p><p>After his inauguration, Mr. Trump had made clear that he wanted his first trip overseas in this term to be to the Middle East, starting with Saudi Arabia, the site of his initial visit during his first term in office.</p><p>Instead, his first trip ended up in Italy at the funeral, where he was surrounded by European leaders he has been denouncing as freeloaders unwilling to pay their share of the continent’s defense, and leaders of the European Union, which he said was “formed in order to screw the United States.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The service itself offered a reminder of how Pope Francis had strongly criticized the Trump administration’s policy on mass deportations of migrants.</p><p>During the homily, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re referred to the pontiff’s trip to <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/live/pope-francis-at-us-mexico-border/" title="">the border between Mexico and the United States</a>, one of his many “gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons.”</p><p>There was a certain irony in the meeting between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump at the funeral. The pope initially struggled to strike a balance between showing support for what he referred to as “martyred Ukraine” and his effort to avoid taking outright sides in the war. In 2023, he alluded to a secret “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/world/europe/pope-francis-hungary.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">mission</a>” to bring peace to Ukraine that failed to bear fruit. The pope, who called for “the boldness needed to open the door to negotiation” in his final Christmas address, would have surely welcomed any moves toward peace.</p><p>The foreign dignitaries who attended the funeral were seated in alphabetical order based on their country’s name in French. That put Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/world/europe/trump-pope-francis-funeral-blue-suit.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" title="">wearing a blue suit</a> in a crowd dressed mostly in black, and the first lady, Melania Trump, in between the leaders of Finland and Estonia and just down from Mr. Macron.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump was seated among foreign leaders for Pope Francis’ funeral on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In the absence of more substantive meetings, Mr. Trump’s every handshake and conversation was scrutinized for political significance at a moment of trans-Atlantic discord. He briefly greeted Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, who was sitting a few chairs down from him. In the past three months, Ms. von der Leyen was conspicuously absent from the leaders visiting the White House.</p><p>He chatted briefly with Mr. Macron, Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Starmer before the services began.</p><p>The office of Ms. Meloni, who has a friendly relationship with Mr. Trump, released photos showing him with his hand on her shoulder and another showing her walking beside Mr. and Mrs. Trump, apparently in conversation, inside St. Peter’s Basilica. Neither Ms. Meloni’s office nor the White House released any statements suggesting that substantial talks took place.</p><p>Maria Varenikova<!-- --> contributed reporting from Kyiv; <!-- -->Stephen Castle<!-- --> from London; <!-- -->Ségolène Le Stradic<!-- --> from Paris; and <!-- -->Emma Bubola<!-- --> and Josephine de La Bruyère from Rome.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David E.
