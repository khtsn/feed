		<p>The <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2535/vct-2025-pacific-ascension" target="_blank">VCT Pacific Ascension</a> group stage has concluded, which has trimmed down the field of ten teams to six, with the playoffs just around the corner.</p>

<p>The ten-team field was split into two groups of five, with the top three teams from each group advancing to the playoffs. The six-team bracket will be double-elimination, with the third seed from each group beginning their run in the lower bracket.</p>

<p>Here are the six teams advancing to the playoffs:</p>



<h2>1. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/12446/slt-seongnam" target="_blank">SLT Seongnam</a> (4-0)</h2>

<p>SLT Seongnam completed a perfect group stage showing, winning all four of their matches and dropping just two maps. SLT has managed to win close series, with their opening matchup against <span data-ref-id="0">

The Korean side has experimented with different looks, such as their more classic double Controller Haven comp, the Yoru-Waylay &#39;mosquito&#39; comp on Abyss, and a Skye-Tejo two Initiator comp on Bind. While SLT&#39;s record suggests dominance, their +14 round differential is just the second-highest in Group A.</p>

</span>, BOOM fell 2-0 to SLT. The loss meant that BOOM&#39;s hopes of finishing as the group&#39;s top seed were far gone, but also meant that they would not enter the playoffs in the lower bracket. Teammates <span data-ref-id="7">

<p><em>Five up, five down for whitecat.</em></p>

<h2>3. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/18117/motiv-esports" target="_blank">Motiv Esports</a> (2-2)</h2>

<p>In its first season as Motiv Esports, the Singaporean organization finished atop the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2559/challengers-2025-southeast-asia-split-3/playoffs" target="_blank">Southeast Asia</a>, finishing ahead of former Ascension teams like FULL SENSE and NAOS. While Motiv&#39;s only losses in the group stage came to SLT and BOOM, their wins have not been quite convincing. Against NKT, they won 2-0, finishing with a round differential of +4, and were taken to three maps by an E-KING side that finished the group stage winless.</p>



<h2>1. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/799/velocity-gaming" target="_blank">Velocity Gaming</a> (3-1)</h2>

<p>Velocity ended the season strong, dropping just two games in all three splits in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2527/challengers-2025-south-asia-split-3/playoffs" target="_blank">South Asia</a> to complete a clean sweep in the region.

</span>, they were victorious in a battle of undefeateds with a 2-0 win over NAOS. While a 2-1 loss to Nongshim meant the squad couldn&#39;t close out the group stage undefeated, claiming just one map was enough to secure Group B&#39;s top seed in the final match of the group stage.</p>


<p><em>Calm, cool, and collected from <span data-ref-id="11">

<h2>2. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/7031/naos" target="_blank">NAOS</a> (3-1)</h2>

<p>After finishing second in Southeast Asia Split 3, NAOS qualified for its third-straight Pacific Ascension event. NAOS has fully bought into comps with Yoru and Vyse, playing the Duelist on every map and the Sentinel on all but two maps. NAOS ended the group stage with Group B&#39;s highest round differential at +21. All four of NAOS&#39;s matches ended 2-0, with the one loss coming to Velocity.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/11060/nongshim-redforce" target="_blank">Nongshim RedForce</a> (3-1)</h2>

<p>Looking to re-Ascend, Nongshim RedForce entered Ascension with a change, moving <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/42772/xross">
		Xross	</a>
</span> to the starting roster in favor of <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4122/persia">

</span>. The move also meant <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/31828/francis">

</span> would be the team&#39;s permanent Yoru player, while <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/31827/dambi">
		Dambi	</a>
</span>, known for his high-octane Neon, would flex into the Controller role on some maps. After losing its opening match of the tournament in blowout fashion via a 2-0 loss to NAOS, Nongshim picked up the pieces and adapted. Nongshim failed to win a map that Dambi did not play Duelist, and in the later matches of the group stage, Nongshim fully took on double-Duelist comps. While a win against Velocity in the last match forced a three-way tie, Nongshim&#39;s slow start meant they were the group&#39;s third seed, meaning they will enter the playoffs one loss away from elimination.</p>



<p>Group A and Group B will mix in the playoffs, with the first seeds facing the opposing group&#39;s second seed in the upper semifinals. With Pacific having two Ascension slots up for grabs, teams in the upper bracket will need to win just two matches to reach VCT Pacific in 2026. </p>

<p>Third-seeded teams will face the losing teams of the upper semifinals in elimination matches, and would need to win three straight matches to reach VCT Pacific. The playoffs will kick off immediately on Wednesday, October 22 with the upper semifinals. The matches are:</p>
