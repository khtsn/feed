He relishes the exacting regimen of flying â checking fuel figures, analyzing weather patterns, tallying passengers and cargo. He is also energized by the risks he can take in music.</p><p>âIn flying, we have to identify all the threats and make sure we donât go anywhere near them,â he said. âIn music, itâs the opposite: We have to get as close as we can to catastrophe.â</p><p>Harding is a rarity in commercial flying: a pilot with a thriving artistic career. And in the high-pressure, all-consuming classical music field, where stars are often expected to show absolute devotion to their craft, he is an outlier, showing there can be life beyond the concert hall.</p><p>âI donât think itâs realistic to say just because you love something, you should do it 24 hours a day, every single day,â he said. âI just donât think thatâs human.â</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The renowned conductor Simon Rattle, who first met Harding when he was a sandy-haired 16-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/arts/music/27harding.html" title="">conducting prodigy</a>, said he had become âone of the great onesâ who could tackle almost any piece with any orchestra.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Francesco di Rosa, Santa Ceciliaâs principal oboist, and Alessandro Carbonare before the flight.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>âFlying has given him a center, a balance to his music,â Rattle said. âIt has made him a better musician and a much calmer person.â</p><p><strong>IN THE COCKPIT</strong> that December day, Harding was focused, a cup of coffee by his side. He was still getting to know the Santa Cecilia orchestra, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/arts/international/italian-orchestra-rediscovers-its-intensity.html" title="">Italyâs unofficial national symphony</a> since 1908, and he had proposed the flight to usher in his tenure, which began in October.</p><p>Now he had to perform for his musicians. He worried about the landing.</p><p>âIf I bang the plane down hard today,â he said, âtheyâre going to talk about it for the next 20 years.â</p><p>In the cabin, the musicians cheered their leader on. They joked about what to call him. <em>Maestro? Pilot? Captain? </em>They passed the two-hour journey with some music, singing a rendition of âVolare.â At one point, the clarinetist Alessandro Carbonare performed an excerpt from Pucciniâs âToscaâ from his seat in row 19.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>âIn flying, we have to identify all the threats and make sure we donât go anywhere near them,â Harding said. âIn music, itâs the opposite: We have to get as close as we can to catastrophe.â</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>When Carbonare told his mother that Harding was flying the orchestra to Paris, she did not believe him.</p><p>âNobody can imagine it,â he said, âa conductor who also flies.

That will be enough.â</p><p>As the plane descended, Harding invited Santa Ceciliaâs concert master and its assistant conductor into the cockpit to watch the landing. In the cabin, there was nervous laughter when the plane encountered turbulence.</p><p>As the Paris skyline came into view, a flight attendant chimed in over the intercom: âPrepare for maestro landing.â</p><p><strong>HARDING WAS BORN </strong>in Oxford, England, to a lecturer in engineering and a university administrator, who were amateur musicians. He began playing trumpet at 8, after hearing a Christmas performance of Handelâs âMessiah.â At home, he also dabbled in conducting, moving his arms along to recordings of Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. At 13, he enrolled at Chethamâs School of Music, a boarding school in Manchester.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Davide Tonetti, a percussionist, used his time onboard to study his score.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Carbonare played a bit of âTosca&#34; en route. âI just hope we arrive safely in Paris,â he said. âThat will be enough.â</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>When Harding was 17, a teacher sent Rattle, then the 37-year-old music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, a letter describing his preternatural skill at leading Schoenbergâs âPierrot Lunaireâ at school. Rattle invited Harding and his classmates to Birmingham to work on the piece.</p><p>âIt was kind of astonishing,â Rattle recalled. He took Harding under his wing, hiring him as an assistant and feeding him a steady diet of ham sandwiches.</p><p>Harding rose in classical music with staggering speed. At 17, he conducted bits of a rehearsal in Birmingham as Rattle looked on. At 19, he landed a dream gig as an assistant to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/arts/music/claudio-abbado-conductor.html" title="">Claudio Abbado</a>, then the chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, who had inspired him to be a conductor. At 21, he made his debut with that orchestra, and at 22, he signed his first recording contract.</p><p>âIt all seems utterly absurd now,â he said. âAt the time, I didnât understand how far away from my own competence it was.

Some musicians found him arrogant and aloof, and they were irked by his habit of speaking at length from the podium. (âI come and just talk, talk, talk,â Harding later said, âand thatâs just not how it works here.â)</p><p>When Harding was in his mid-30s, he hired a conducting coach, hoping to hone his communication style and technique. (Harding never studied at a conservatory.) Around the same time, he went through a divorce that he has said left him â<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/interviews/teen-prodigy-daniel-harding-unfocused-orchestra-could-smell/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unfocused and indecisive</a>.â</p><p>Harding kept up a busy performance schedule. But as he approached his 40th birthday, he mused on his interests outside classical music. He challenged himself to train as a pilot, thinking he had earned the luxury of âtaking a little time, just for me, to learn something.â</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He had been fascinated by flying since he was a child, when he played with a flight simulator on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum home computer. He flew on a small plane for the first time as a teenager at the invitation of an orchestra musician in Birmingham. During that flight, he said, he fell in love with the âsensations and beauty of flying.â</p><p>In 2014, for his birthday challenge, Harding enrolled in a flight school in southern France. In his down time between concerts and rehearsals, he studied topics like aerodynamics and aviation law. At one point, he installed a flight simulator in his basement. After a few years, he earned his private and commercial pilotâs licenses, as well as certification to fly the Airbus A320.</p><p>To get the Air France job, he undertook a series of exams, interviews and psychometric evaluations. He pointed to his experience in music to reassure the airline that he would work well with colleagues.</p><p>âBeing a conductor,â he said, âis the ultimate team activity.â</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Harding in Paris.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p><strong>HARDING NOW SPENDS ABOUT</strong> a week each month flying medium-haul flights for Air France in Europe and North Africa, scheduled around his performances.
