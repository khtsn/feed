A census of all 125,000 individual plants with a trunk size at least a centimeter in diameter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It is part of a new, multimillion-dollar effort in dozens of patches of forest across the world that’s aimed at figuring out, to an unprecedented degree of precision, the extent to which forests perform an epic service to humanity by capturing and locking away huge amounts of carbon dioxide, the main planet-warming greenhouse gas.</p><p>The Amazon is vast. Nearly 10 Texases would fit in it. Amid that emerald expanse, this infinitesimal patch, less than a tenth of a square mile, is a stand-in for the larger whole. As a representative sample of the northwestern part of the Amazon, it contains around 1,200 species of woody plants, from gigantic kapok trees to tightly coiled liana vines.

But most satellites can’t reliably penetrate the forest’s thick canopy.</p><p>“You can only get truly accurate carbon measurements by combining satellite data with ground-truthing,” said Laura Duncanson, a remote sensing expert at the University of Maryland. “Like, I’m talking tree-hugging.”</p><p>Tropical forest and other land absorbs one-third of all the world’s planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions. The Amazon, despite its immensity, is actually particularly fragile. This year, fires in the Brazilian Amazon hit a 14-year high. The whole region was bathed in smoke as the team did its work recently.</p><p>Scientists have been warning for years that the Amazon is nearing a tipping point where it shifts from capturing carbon dioxide to being a net emitter of it. As it shrinks, it becomes less able to pull water from the ocean and sustain its lushness (which, in a climate-system way of thinking, is also its ability to store carbon).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>These trends are driving a wide array of efforts to protect or expand forested land.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tropical forests, which absorb tremendous amounts of greenhouse gases, have been shrunk by deforestation.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>These can include carbon offsets, essentially credits representing investment in projects that avoid, reduce or store emissions, which individuals or companies can buy to compensate for their own greenhouse gases. Or reforestation bonds, a type of tradable security designed to give investors a higher financial return when the money is used to plant trees that can extract more carbon out of the atmosphere.</p><p>There is already a market for instruments like these worth almost $1 trillion. But for them to be priced to work properly, better data is needed on precisely how much carbon different forests hold.</p><p>“Bad data can equal junk credits,” said Khaled Diab at Carbon Market Watch, a nonprofit organization. “That problem is incredibly difficult to solve.”</p><p>Doubts about this data are one of the reasons that last year, the carbon offset market shrank for the first time in seven years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Those problems, while at the heart of the tree census in Amacayacu, barely dented the ardor of the team carrying it out.</p><p>Álvaro Duque, 59, a professor at Colombia’s National University who is leading the census, has a resounding, expressive voice. As he and his colleagues hiked from a remote research station even deeper into the forest toward the census plot, it was hard not to imagine that any nearby wildlife heard them from miles away and fled.</p><p>“The air in the forest understory is filled with compounds that make us feel relaxed,” he said excitedly. “Can’t you feel it?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andrés Upegui, one of the team members.

Eventually, though, the words pour forth. Everyone competed to tell stories of snake bites, helicopter rescues and 50-mile walks through the forest to play soccer.</p><p>“It makes you speak from the heart,” Dr. Duque said.</p><p>More prosaically, Dr. Duque is also animated by having received funding for this research project. The Bezos grant is the kind of money that researchers in Colombia, or Cameroon, or Cambodia, rarely expect to get.</p><p>“In this country, we’ve got four botanists for the entire Amazon,” said Andrés Barona, 45, who works for Instituto Sinchi, a government research body focused on the rainforest. Mr. Barona is a walking encyclopedia who can tell you the family, genus and species of nearly every plant he sees. Still, he said, “we have species we don’t know even know which family of tree they belong to here.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>The census sites chosen by STRI are particularly biodiverse. Locations with the most different kinds of trees are the most useful in training the remote-sensing algorithms used by satellites to scan vast stretches of the jungle.</p><p>The biodiversity of Amacayacu is breathtaking.</p><p>According to Dr. Duque, there are an average of about 250 tree species per acre. Tiny saplings, their baby leaves still bright red. Knee-height adolescents, their survival still uncertain. Then those reaching chest height, perhaps a centimeter in diameter, crossing the threshold for inclusion in the census.</p><p>Some will shoot a hundred feet into the canopy, providing new branches where squirrel monkeys and white-throated toucans can make their societies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-35"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Federico Rios for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/09/multimedia/00cli-amazon-03-ztgf/00cli-amazon-03-ztgf-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/09/multimedia/00cli-amazon-03-ztgf/00cli-amazon-03-ztgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Federico Rios for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/24/multimedia/00cli-amazon-02-ztgf/00cli-amazon-02-ztgf-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/24/multimedia/00cli-amazon-02-ztgf/00cli-amazon-02-ztgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit="Federico Rios for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/24/multimedia/00cli-amazon-01-ztgf/00cli-amazon-01-ztgf-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/24/multimedia/00cli-amazon-01-ztgf/00cli-amazon-01-ztgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-3-" data-credit="Federico Rios for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/05/multimedia/00cli-amazon-01-gjhc/00cli-amazon-01-gjhc-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/05/multimedia/00cli-amazon-01-gjhc/00cli-amazon-01-gjhc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left: A tarantula eating a grasshopper, giant river otters, a squirrel monkey and a poisonous frog.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>When not in the forest conducting the tree census, many of the team members sleep in a spartan research center, built on stilts in the woods.

And she has been Mr. Duque’s most reliable tree-measurer for nearly 20 years, a position of stability that helped her to transition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-39"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“By doing science I prove I have a role,” Lauris Sangama said.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-41"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mocagua, the nearest village to Amacayacu National Park.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-43"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Amazon River.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>“In our community being trans is seen as something horrible, something that shouldn’t exist,” she said. “But by doing science I prove I have a role.

And those species, typically enormous hardwood trees, may be the most susceptible to climate change (and illegal logging).</p><p>It would logically follow that the most effective steps to take would focus on protecting those trees. But it takes this kind of research to know that. “The dark age of tropical data scarcity might be ending,” said Dr. Duncanson, the remote sensing expert.</p><p>With the data collection well underway, Dr. Duque and Mr. Barona carried their bags toward the river where a boat would take them back into the air-conditioned world. The sky was acrid with smoke from fires both near and distant. It was devoid of storm clouds, billowing upward to the edge of the stratosphere, ready to rake the forest with rain. None had fallen in 16 days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-45"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Read by </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/max-bearak" itemprop="name">Max Bearak</a></p></div></div></div></div><p>Audio produced by <!-- -->Patricia Sulbarán<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Max Bearak is a Times reporter who writes about global energy and climate policies and new approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/max-bearak">More about Max Bearak</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Climate and the Environment</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Climate F.A.Q.:</strong> Do you have questions about climate change? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/climate/climate-change-faq.html">We’ve got answers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Superpower Beyond Clean Energy: </strong>Solar farms fight climate change and can help with another global crisis: the collapse of nature.
