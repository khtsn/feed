It is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/australia/us-trump-security-alliance.html" title="">heavily dependent</a> on the United States for its security, but derives much of its prosperity from <a href="https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/in-force/chafta/negotiations/Pages/background-paper-the-australia-china-trade-and-investment-relationship" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trade with China</a>, which is exerting its military ambitions closer and closer to Australia’s shores.</p><p>However, most pressing for voters is a persistent cost-of-living crisis and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/australia-election-housing.html" title="">worsening housing affordability</a> that has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/world/australia/economy-cost-of-living.html" title="">further dampened</a> the long-held optimism that Australia is a recession-proof country blessed with rich resources, high wages and stable, functioning government.</p><p>“Everything costs so much,” said Judy Pula, a registered nurse and mother of two who was voting in the Sydney suburb of Liverpool during a break in her shift. Ms. Pula, 29, said she had voted for Labor in the past but this time opted for the Australian Greens. “I feel like a new leader would be beneficial for us.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Still, the most recent opinion polls have showed Mr. Albanese’s party headed for a second term with a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, a turnaround from earlier in the year, when the opposition was in the lead. Australia has a Westminister-style parliamentary system.</p><p>Here’s what to know about the election:</p><h2 id="link-51c7be8f">It’s the economy, mate</h2><p>Mr. Dutton has gone to no fewer than 15 gas stations — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/30/australia-election-2025-live-housing-crisis-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-campaign-final-week-labor-coalition-cpi-inflation-ntwnfb?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6811b11f8f08f0938cf49225#block-6811b11f8f08f0938cf49225" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Guardian counted</a> — on the campaign trail, playing up his party’s proposal to cut a tax to reduce payments at the pump. Mr. Albanese has again and again <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-23/mediscare-medicare-health-policy-urgent-care-clinics/105201480" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flashed his card for Medicare</a>, Australia’s universal health care system, highlighting a promise to lower out-of-pocket costs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Peter Dutton, the leader of a conservative coalition seeking to oust the Labor government of Anthony Albanese, speaking to the media after voting in Brisbane on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dan Peled/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As much as the global turmoil originating from Washington has dominated news cycles here in recent months, voters say their top concerns are bread-and-butter (or bread, butter and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/12/world/australia/vegemite-centennial-history-melbourne.html" title="">Vegemite</a> here) issues stretching average households. But both major parties have pledged only small-scale measures to alleviate economic pressures, rather than bold, ambitious ideas for the country’s direction.</p><p>Bilal Anwar, a naturalized citizen who was voting in his first Australian election, said the increase in prices in recent years had been staggering.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Even a loaf of bread I buy, it used to cost a dollar-and-a-half or two, now it’s four, five dollars,” said Mr. Anwar, 39, referring to prices in Australian dollars. “This is not how much salaries have gone up.”</p><p>During a lightning round in their final debate, the two candidates were asked for the price of a dozen eggs, which sell for more than 8 Australian dollars, or nearly $6. Mr. Dutton was way off, putting the price at about half that. Mr. Albanese was closer but still low, with his answer of 7 Australian dollars.</p><p>The price of eggs <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/price-indexes-and-inflation/monthly-consumer-price-index-indicator/mar-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has jumped by 13.5 percent</a> in the year leading up to March 2025, after rising 6.8 percent the preceding year. Another staple, Vegemite, has <a href="https://www.finder.com.au/news/2023-vegemite-price-comparison-report" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also become more expensive</a>, though at a slower pace.</p><p>“It’s the hip pocket nerve. Under which government would you be better off?” said Shaun Ratcliff, a political scientist and pollster at Accent Research. Even though the economic dissatisfaction has dragged down Mr. Albanese’s approval ratings and should have helped the conservative opposition, “I don’t think they’ve convinced voters they would do much better,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3a004096">Culture wars</h2><p>A political low point for Mr. Albanese in his three-year term was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/world/asia/indigenous-voice-australia-referendum.html" title="">failure of a 2023 referendum</a> to enshrine the rights of representation for Aboriginal Australians in Parliament. It had been a major campaign pledge of his when he was elected the previous year. His Labor Party won control in 2022 after the center-right coalition had been in power for nine years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, center, and his son Nathan casting their ballots in the general election beside his partner Jodie Haydon at a polling station a Sydney suburb on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saeed Khan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Dutton, a former police officer from the state of Queensland, opposed the measure and continued to take a stance against other symbolic recognitions of Indigenous people. He has said he would not stand in front of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags and said giving acknowledgments of the first Australians at public events is “<a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/iran-port-explosion-injures-hundreds-20250427-p5luhc?post=p58kce" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overdone</a>.”</p><p>John Goodwin, a 72-year-old retiree wearing sandals and a T-shirt that read “Old Guys Rule,” said he didn’t think Mr. Dutton had run a good campaign but was still voting for his party because he didn’t want Labor in control.</p><p>He criticized both major parties: “I think the policies is just rhetoric, waffling on.” He added, “I can’t wait for it to be over.”</p><p>Early in the campaign, the opposition leader had adopted some buzzwords or policies that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/asia/australia-election-trump-china.html" title="">echoed President Trump</a> and a few of his pet causes, including denouncing “wokeness” and diversity initiatives. That strategy seemed aimed at riding the worldwide rightward, anti-incumbent currents that dominated last year. But as the first months of the Trump presidency have played out, the association began to cut against Mr. Dutton.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Right now, being seen to be Trumpian is, for the median voter, not a good thing,” said Ben Raue, an independent election analyst who runs the political tracking site Tally Room.</p><p>Grahame Don, 56, voted for the Liberal Party for decades but started backing Labor in the last election. Mr. Trump’s tone of talking about issues was bleeding into Australian politics, he said.</p><p>“This country has only gained from things like migration and international students that they have tried to make divisive,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-171b559c">Shift from major parties</h2><p>Australia, one of the few places in the world with compulsory voting, fines people who fail to turn up at the polls. That means politicians do not have the option of catering to narrow, extreme bases to turn out the vote, making its politics much more centrist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Early-morning swimmers place their votes  near Bondi Beach in Sydney.

That trend also makes the prospect of a minority government more likely, which would force whichever party wins the most seats to negotiate with smaller parties.</p><p>Garth Lotz, 35, a resident of Queensland, Mr. Dutton’s home state, said he voted for an independent candidate, hoping it would lead to less party politicking.</p><p>“Maybe there’ll be less of the sports team vibe that the whole thing gives off sometimes,” he said.</p><p>Chris Wallace, a political historian at the University of Canberra, said the shift was a clear signal from the Australian public of dissatisfaction with the slate of proposals and candidates offered up by the two main players.</p><p>“The major parties are not listening to voter views desperate for deeper solutions to the deep problems of today, especially younger voters,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">Victoria Kim</a> is the Australia correspondent for The New York Times, based in Sydney, covering Australia, New Zealand and the broader Pacific region.</p></div><div><p>Yan Zhuang is a Times reporter in Seoul who covers breaking news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
