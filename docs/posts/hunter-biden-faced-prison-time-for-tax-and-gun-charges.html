    <h1>Hunter Biden Faced Prison Time for Tax and Gun Charges</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Biden not only spared his son Hunter the humiliation of two felony convictions — he also saved him from what might have been a significant stretch of time in a federal prison.</p><p>Hunter Biden, 54, pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in Los Angeles in September for falsifying records and failing to file returns dating to a period when he was hooked on crack, alcohol and easy cash.</p><p>He faced up to 17 years in federal prison during a scheduled sentencing hearing in Los Angeles on Dec. 16, but would most likely have served no more than 36 months behind bars, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/hunter-biden-tax-gun-case.html" title="">according to sentencing experts</a>.</p><p>A jury in Wilmington, Del., in June found Mr. Biden, the president’s younger son, guilty of three felony counts for lying on a federal firearms application after an extraordinary seven-day trial. That trial made painfully public Mr. Biden’s crack addiction, reckless behavior and ruinous spending — narrated by three former romantic partners, including the widow of his brother, Beau Biden.</p></div></div>
