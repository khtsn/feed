If it can’t work out a way to buy it, it will take it.</p><p>“The Village of Dolton intends to purchase this home either through direct purchase or through their eminent domain powers,” wrote Burton S. Odelson, an attorney for the village of Dolton, Ill., in a letter sent to Paramount Realty USA, a real estate auction firm that had already begun collecting bids for the property. “The Village intends to work with the Chicago Archdiocese and other agencies to allow the home to be viewed and visited by the public as a historic site.”</p><p>It’s the latest development for the modest three-bedroom house after it was put up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/realestate/pope-leo-xiv-chicago-home-auction.html" title="">for auction last week</a> with Paramount. Acquiring the house via eminent domain would allow the village of Dolton to take the private property for public purposes, though the government would have to pay “fair compensation” to the owner, according to the letter. </p><p>The seller, Pawel Radzik, “is excited to have the potential opportunity to work with the church, the archdiocese and the village of Dolton to purchase the property,” said Steve Budzik, the real estate broker representing the property. Mr. Radzik, 36, bought the home in 2024 for $66,000 with a plan to renovate and flip it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Ultimately, what happens is up to the owner of the property,” said Misha Haghani, the CEO and founder of Paramount. “We’re just advisers here.”</p><p>The brick home, which had been listed for 199,900, suddenly became a historic site when Pope Leo XIV was introduced to the world earlier this month. The pontiff, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/us/pope-leo-childhood-chicago-catholics.html" title="">grew up as Robert Francis Prevost</a>, spent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/realestate/pope-leo-xiv-home-chicago-sale.html" title="">at least some of his childhood</a> in the house on 141st Place, about 30 minutes south of downtown Chicago. His father, Louis Prevost, sold the house in 1996 after almost 50 years, according to county records.</p><p>After receiving only a handful of offers in recent months, Mr. Budzik and Mr. Radzik were inundated with a sudden rush almost immediately following the conclusion of the conclave. They quickly pulled the house off the market as they worked out their next steps. Unable to settle on a price, they turned to Paramount, which started the auction and began <a href="https://www.prusa.com/auctions/pope-leo-xivs-childhood-home-chicago-dolton-il/c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collecting bids</a>. The auction is set to conclude June 18.</p><p>The village’s letter outlining its intent to acquire the home was sent to the auction house on Tuesday. Mr. Odelson, the village’s attorney, said in an interview that he has been in touch with the seller’s team and that negotiations are “open now.” He said he hopes to avoid eminent domain, which would entail an expensive and lengthy legal process.</p><p>Using eminent domain, Mr. Odelson said, “keeps the home in the news and not the light that the village or the church want. We don’t want it to be a controversy; we want it to be a sacred site.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matt Yan is a real estate reporter for The Times and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div><div><p>Debra Kamin reports on real estate, covering what it means to buy, sell and own a home in America today.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Pope Leo XIV</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A.I.
