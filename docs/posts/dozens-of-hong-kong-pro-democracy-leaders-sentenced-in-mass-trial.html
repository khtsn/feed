A judge read their sentences aloud, referring to them not by their names but by their numbers on a list. The hearing was over in half an hour.</p><p>It was the most forceful demonstration of the power of a national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in response to months of large protests against Chinese rule in 2019.</p><p>The court sentenced Benny Tai, 60, a legal scholar and opposition strategist, to 10 years in prison. Twenty opposition politicians and activists were given terms ranging from five to nearly eight years. Joshua Wong, 28, a prominent pro-democracy activist, was among 24 others whose sentences ranged from just over four to just under five years.</p><p>Gwyneth Ho, 32, a former journalist who was known for covering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-mob-attack-yuen-long.html#:~:text=A%20mob%20of%20men%20in,will%20only%20breed%20more%20violence." title="">a mob attack</a> on antigovernment demonstrators trapped in a subway station, was sentenced to seven years for running as a candidate. She had refused to plead guilty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Our true crime for Beijing is that we were not content with playing along in manipulated elections,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gwynethhokl/posts/pfbid02Vju6XTohdAFxXT4Gjb4JasuANxSm6bNeEEyACCBDYGqRJkKXW383mQcQfYpHwW6Kl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said a statement</a> posted on Ms. Ho’s Facebook account, apparently by her supporters, on Tuesday after the sentencing. “We dared to confront the regime with the question: will democracy ever be possible within such a structure? The answer was a complete crackdown on all fronts of society.”</p><p>The trial made clear that any form of dissent or criticism, however moderate, carried significant risk, analysts said. “If you are being critical of the authorities both in Hong Kong and in China, then it’s open season,” said Steve Tsang, a Hong Kong-born political scientist and director of the SOAS China Institute in London.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A prison van arrived at a Hong Kong courthouse before the sentencing on Tuesday.

That was because the law has made it harder for defendants to be released on bail, which in most nonviolent cases is routinely granted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Instead of a jury, the case was heard by three judges handpicked by the city’s Beijing-backed leader, as allowed by the law.</p><p>“The authorities wanted to show the public that they have the power to bring a big group of people to trial all at once,” said Patrick Poon, a visiting researcher at the University of Tokyo who studies freedom of expression in Hong Kong and China. “They want to show residents that anyone who tries to protest like this group of people will receive their same fate.”</p><p>Prosecutors accused the defendants of “conspiracy to commit subversion,” a national security offense, arguing that the objective of the election primary was to “undermine, destroy or overthrow the existing political system and structure of Hong Kong.”</p><p>The outcome of the primary made clear that the residents who voted favored candidates who were prominent supporters of the 2019 antigovernment demonstrations. The pro-democracy camp argued that the primary vote was little different from others held in democracies around the world. The hope was to maximize the camp’s chances of gaining more seats in a legislative chamber that already heavily favors the Beijing-backed establishment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Court staff raised a national flag outside of the court before the sentencing. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But they never had a chance to test the plan: The election was postponed, and most of the candidates were arrested.</p><p>Mr. Tai, the legal scholar who was sentenced to 10 years, had designed the electoral strategy, and prosecutors deemed him a mastermind. Mr. Tai had long been involved in efforts to persuade China to live up to a promise that has been central to Hong Kong since its 1997 return to Chinese control: that its residents would someday get to choose their own leaders. In 2014, he was one of the leaders of the Occupy Central movement that brought the city’s central business district to a halt in a peaceful call for freer elections.</p><p>Other defendants included Leung Kwok-hung, a 68-year-old activist known as Long Hair for his unkempt mane, who was sentenced to six years and nine months; Claudia Mo, 67, a veteran former lawmaker, sentenced to four years and two months; and Lam Cheuk-ting, 47, a former anti-corruption investigator, sentenced to six years and nine months.</p><p>Mr. Tai and 30 other defendants had pleaded guilty. The court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/asia/hong-kong-national-security.html" title="">convicted 14 of them in May and acquitted two others</a>.</p><p>Outside, hundreds of people waited in line to enter the gallery, braving a downpour and a heavy security presence around the courthouse, including an armored vehicle, police cars and barricades. Several dozen police officers were stationed on every street corner along the whole block.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>As she left the courthouse, Elsa Wu, the mother of Hendrick Lui, one of the defendants, unfurled a poster in protest of the sentencing. Several police officers led her away into a police van and tried to slide the door shut. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elsa Wu held a banner reading “The righteous shall live; the wicked shall perish.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“Tell me, why does he have to go to prison?” she called out, beating her fist. Mr. Lui was sentenced to more than four years in prison. “He is a political prisoner. He shouldn’t be in prison. He is a good person. Why does he have to be in prison?” she said.</p><p>Thomas Kellogg, the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law, said he thought the case would be seen by many in the international community as the “final nail in the coffin for the rule of law in Hong Kong.”</p><p>Despite the prospect of more prison time, some defendants were simply anxious for the trial that had left their lives in limbo to come to a conclusion, according to friends who had visited them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Emilia Wong, a gender rights activist,<strong> </strong>said in an interview ahead of the sentencing that her boyfriend, Ventus Lau, an organizer of the 2019 antigovernment protests, had been studying toward a degree in translation. She said she had been regularly visiting him in detention for the past three years, but it was clear the isolation was taking a toll on him.</p><p>“The scary thing about prison is not being locked up in one place. It is the loss of connection with people and society that is scary. To him, it was painful,” she said.</p><p>David Pierson<!-- --> and <!-- -->Berry Wang<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tiffany May is a reporter based in Hong Kong, covering the politics, business and culture of the city and the broader region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tiffany-may">More about Tiffany May</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
