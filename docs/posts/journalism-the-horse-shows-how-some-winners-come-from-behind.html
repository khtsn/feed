He broke out well enough, but trapped on the rail, boxed in tight, the favored horse faded in the pack just as the race began to burn.</p><p>The fastest surged forward. Journalism didn’t flinch. He waited, holding back, hunting space with coiled patience.</p><p>Then something shifted. There was no sudden explosion of speed, no frantic scramble. Just a patient, defiant unfolding. Trying to split horses near the quarter pole, Journalism took a hard bump from the right, faltering into another horse, then somehow squeezed through a seam in the chaos. When he finally found daylight, he had five lengths to make up and just seconds to do it.</p><p>Surging down the track, stretching his strides, he reeled in the leader and won by a half length.</p><p>It was a throwback, a reminder that patience isn’t weakness and that some victories are earned not by charging to the front but by knowing exactly when to move.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Journalism is now headed to the Belmont Stakes on Saturday at Saratoga, N.Y. The Belmont race is shorter than usual this year, just 1¼ miles, because it’s at the Saratoga track while the 1½-mile Belmont Park in Queens gets a face-lift. Even without a Triple Crown on the line this year, the Belmont holds its weight — a final trial where most names fade and one is etched into memory.</p><p>In an era wound tight with urgency, Journalism is the horse we forgot how to ride. He did not chase the breakneck pace. He moved with patience, let the chaos pass and proved capable of charging through gaps no wider than a saddle horn.</p><p>Maybe every era gets the horse it deserves. Some horses, like Secretariat, imprint themselves on a culture — a flash of what greatness looks like at full roar. That was in the early ’70s, when a name evoking institutional dignity could still carry heroic weight. In 2025, while institutions falter and fiction parades as fact, Journalism suggests another kind of greatness, another way for us to be: quieter, more patient, no less profound.</p><p>For too long, our society has been running at Silicon Valley tempo — move quicker, scale faster, break through or get left behind. It’s the rhythm we’ve absorbed: endless acceleration.</p><p>On LinkedIn, everyone’s just been promoted. On TikTok, everyone is younger than you with unnatural-looking lips, and they’re talking in some alien Gen Z patois. On Instagram, abs glisten, and someone’s just run a marathon or climbed Yosemite Falls — while you find a sock. The feed keeps racing. No time to rest. Always forward. Faster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some horses are trained to match the world that made them — break fast, seize the lead and hang on. Speed above all. But this bay colt with a short blaze, like the fire banked inside him, doesn’t run like the others. He settles. He watches. He waits.</p><p>It’s not flash. It’s feel. His owners say the animal is blessed with stamina <em>and </em>smarts. A horse who understands the rhythm of a race and how to hold his wind until it matters most. He runs like the old greats — Seabiscuit comes to mind — in the calculated way he finishes with meaning.</p><p>Maybe Journalism sees something we don’t. While we chase momentum, he runs with instinct. While we rush, he reads the track. He reminds us there’s still strength in patience and power in knowing not just how to move, but when.</p><p>We scroll, we sprint, we strain to keep up. We measure our days in steps, alerts and updates, rewarded for urgency and punished for pause. Even older generations — once the voice of reason — are tracking their heart rates, logging their miles and texting at red lights.</p><p>And at every stage, one wonders if it’s already too late. Some people peak early; we all remember the kids who seemed to have it all figured out at 17. But time has a way of revealing what matters. Some of us come from behind.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That’s the quiet truth in Journalism’s race. He didn’t win by being the fastest starter or the biggest colt. He won by running his own race, on his own terms. And when he moved, he moved with something stronger than speed: purpose.</p><p>Even if he never wins another trophy, Journalism has already become a kind of champion — for horse lovers, yes, but also for anyone who’s ever felt overlooked, underestimated or left behind. He runs as if he has nothing to prove and everything to show.</p><p>Our culture is obsessed with urgency, but winning doesn’t always mean being fastest to first. The deeper reward comes from staying in the race long enough to become who you were meant to be.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mark Robichaux is the author of “Cable Cowboy,” about the businessman John Malone, an owner of Journalism, and worked with Mr. Malone on his forthcoming memoir. He is also writing a book about a broken cow horse that became a champion.</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
