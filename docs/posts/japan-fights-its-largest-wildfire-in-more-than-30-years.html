It had grown by 400 hectares since Saturday.</p><p>Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency said it had learned of the fire on Wednesday afternoon, and that at least 84 homes had been damaged by Wednesday night. Japanese media reports said that police found a man’s body on the road Thursday morning while checking the area. The local authorities confirmed the man’s death, but didn’t give any other details. </p><p>The government issued evacuation orders to around 4,600 residents on Wednesday, according to the fire agency. Some<span>  </span>1,200 were in shelters as of Sunday morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Nearly 1,700 firefighters from 14 prefectures have been dispatched since Wednesday to fight the blaze, according to city officials. Video footage from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAc70_H9ifA&amp;t=9s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NHK</a>, Japan’s public broadcaster, showed firefighting aircraft circling above billowing smoke clouds rising over a forest, as orange flames raged between tree trunks.</p><p>It was not immediately clear how much progress fire crews had made in containing the fire, or whether the fire had caused additional damage to structures since Wednesday. The fire agency could not be reached for comment.</p><p>The cause of the fire was under investigation, the agency said.</p><p>The last forest fire of this scale in Japan burned more than 1,000 hectares on the northern island of Hokkaido in 1992, a fire agency spokesman said on Sunday, <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/03/01/japan/iwate-wildfire-battle/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Japan Times reported</a>.</p><p>Ofunato’s driest season is typically from January to March, according to the <a href="https://www.data.jma.go.jp/stats/etrn/view/monthly_s3_en.php?block_no=47512&amp;view=7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Japan Meteorological Agency</a>.
