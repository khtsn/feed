crimes committed against Americans and others at a notorious prison in Damascus during the Syrian civil war, according to an indictment unsealed on Monday.</p><p><a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/a2760e581051031c/7ac50a55-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The indictment</a> represents the first time the United States has criminally charged top Syrian officials with a litany of human rights abuses used to silence dissent and spread fear through the country. The whereabouts of the officials, Jamil Hassan and Abdul Salam Mahmoud, are not known, but the indictment clearly signals that the United States aims to hold to account those who were at the highest echelons of the Syrian government.</p><p>Mr. Hassan, who was the head of the Air Force Intelligence Directorate, and Mr. Mahmoud, a brigadier general in the Air Force’s intelligence unit, “sought to terrify, intimidate and repress any opposition, or perceived opposition, to the regime,” according to the indictment, which was filed under seal last month in federal court in Chicago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-1"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The indictment was made public the day after Syrian rebels <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/assad-syria.html" title="">overthrew the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria</a>. Mr. Hassan and Mr. Mahmoud would need to be flown to federal court in Chicago to stand trial, but the charges provide the legal mechanism for American law enforcement to take custody of the men, if they can be found.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. al-Assad, an authoritarian leader known for his brutal tactics during a 13-year civil war, has already fled to Russia, which, along with Iran, had helped keep him in power.</p><p>As top leaders under Mr. al-Assad, Mr. Hassan oversaw a crackdown on Syrian citizens in which a ruthless system of detention and torture flourished, and Mr. Mahmoud, as a brigadier general in the Air Force Intelligence unit, was in charge of the prison at the military air base in the Mezzeh neighborhood of Damascus as well as operations at the base.</p><p>Along with unnamed co-conspirators, Mr. Hassan and Mr. Mahmoud “committed the war crime of knowingly and intentionally conspiring to commit cruel and inhuman treatment,” according to the indictment. The men intended to inflict “serious physical abuse upon victims within their custody or control, namely U.S. citizens and other detainees” held at the Mezzeh prison, where investigators said both men had offices.</p><p>The indictment describes the torture that Syrian military officials doled out from 2012 to 2019. That included electrocution and pulling out the toenails of prisoners, as well as burning them with acid and regularly beating them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The men were instrumental in helping Mr. Assad silence dissent, using torture — and fear of it — to maintain his government for more than a decade. His rule came to an end days ago, when rebels seized the country’s largest city, Aleppo, and the capital, Damascus, and toppled Mr. Assad’s government. The rebels freed prisoners in the country, many of them thought to be innocent civilians.</p><p>Both Mr. Hassan and Mr. Mahmoud are well known to human rights advocates and the American government. In 2012, the United States <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/tg1547" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imposed sanctions</a> on Mr. al-Assad and his inner circle, including <a href="https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=12812" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Hassan</a>, for committing acts of violence against civilians.</p><p>In mid-November, three days before a grand jury returned the indictment against the men, the State Department said that it had <a href="https://www.state.gov/marking-one-year-since-icj-provisional-measures-against-syria-with-designation-of-syrian-official-due-to-involvement-in-gross-violations-of-human-rights/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restricted</a> Mr. Mahmoud’s ability to travel “due to his involvement in gross violations of human rights, namely torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”</p><p>A spokesman for the Chicago U.S. attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment about why prosecutors waited more than 20 days to unseal the indictment.</p><p>Prosecutors in Chicago have been investigating Mr. Hassan and others since 2018, when the Justice Department opened a case related to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/us/politics/justice-department-syria-war-crimes.html" title="">detention and killing of an American aid worker</a> named Layla Shweikani. F.B.I. agents traveled to Europe and the Middle East to interview witnesses, including the man who may have buried Ms. Shweikani.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The indictment does not name Ms. Shweikani, who was held imprisoned on the outskirts of Damascus for nearly a year at three detention facilities known for their use of torture: a facility at the Mezzeh airport, the Adra civilian prison and the Sednaya military prison.</p><p>Dina Kash, an F.B.I. witness who was detained at Mezzeh prison, said in an interview that investigators wanted names of fellow detainees and information about how they were treated. Syrian guards beat her, knocking out her teeth. She was forced to listen to the screams of other prisoners being tortured. Guards killed her husband.</p><p>“The investigators focused on the people that interrogated me and the Assad regime, intelligence operatives and officials that were involved in my family’s arrest, including Hassan,” Ms. Kash said.</p><p>Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, said now was the time for the United States to hold responsible those officials who had subjected American citizens and countless others to detention and torture. “Now it is our time to catch these criminals and bring them to the United States for trial,” said Mr. Moustafa, who added that he was traveling to Syria to help law enforcement agencies gather human remains and documents from the prisons.</p><p>The director of the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, in a statement, vowed to hold the men to account. “Hassan and Mahmoud allegedly oversaw the systematic use of cruel and inhumane treatment on perceived enemies of the Syrian regime, including American citizens,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The indictment does not mention Austin Tice, an American abducted in Syria in 2012. Syria never acknowledged holding Mr. Tice, but American officials are hopeful that he survived what would have amounted to a grueling stretch inside the prison system.</p><p>American officials are confident that Mr. Tice was held by the Syrians early in his abduction. Investigators learned that he had initially been taken to a prison in Damascus and was seen by a doctor, according to two people familiar with the matter. Mr. Tice managed to escape for about a week but was recaptured, the people said.</p><p>In May, U.S. officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/18/us/politics/texas-syria-hostage-death-kamalmaz.html" title="">informed the family of Majd Kamalmaz</a>, a therapist from Texas, that he died in Syria after disappearing there in 2017. Like the case of Mr. Tice, Syria never acknowledged holding Mr. Kamalmaz, and there was little information about his whereabouts.</p><p>Mr. Moustafa said he and his research team strongly suspected that Mr. Kamalmaz was imprisoned, at least for some of his time in Syria, at the Mezzeh air base.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katie Benner is a correspondent writing primarily about large institutions that shape American life.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-benner">More about Katie Benner</a></span></p></div><div><p>Adam Goldman writes about the F.B.I. and national security.
