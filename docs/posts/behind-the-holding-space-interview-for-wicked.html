Gilchrist, reporting for Out magazine, asked Ms. Erivo to respond to an observation that she had made: “I’ve seen this week people are taking the lyrics of ‘Defying Gravity’ and really holding space with that and feeling power in that,” Ms. Gilchrist said, referring to the musical’s anthem.</p><p>“That’s really powerful,” Ms. Erivo said. As Ms. Grande sympathetically held onto her pointer finger, she added, “That’s what I wanted.”</p><p>Whether it was the phrase “holding space,” the earnest and melodramatic reactions it elicited from Ms. Erivo and Ms. Grande, or the delicate finger-hold — or some combination of the three — the interview has spurred a range of reactions online. Some wondered if Ms. Gilchrist was serious. Others were simply baffled by the exchange.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Gilchrist, a vice president of editorial and special projects for the L.G.B.T.Q. media company Equal Pride, shared her point of view. This interview has been edited and condensed.</p><p><strong>Hi, Tracy. Can you give us a little bit more context about </strong><strong><em>that</em></strong><strong> interview?</strong></p><p>This was on the Universal lot earlier this month, on Nov. 7. It was very Hollywood — there was a whole yellow, brick road and Munchkinland set up outside.<strong> </strong>Typically, you have a window of time where you go in to do your interviews. For this one, I was slated for three interviews: Cynthia and Ariana, Marissa Bode and Ethan Slater, and Jeff Goldblum and Jonathan Bailey. I had four minutes to ask two people questions. You have to get in there and really have a moment. I like to try to get to something real.</p><p><strong>OK, so you have to really think quickly in this situation.</strong></p><p>I interviewed Cynthia for the <a href="https://www.out.com/out100/2024/artists/cynthia-erivo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Out 100 list</a> this year. She was the cover star. I had nearly an hour on Zoom with her, so we already had a little bit of a shorthand when I went in there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, who play Glinda and Elphaba in “Wicked,” during their interview with Ms. Gilchrist.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Out Magazine</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>Why did you ask Ms. Erivo about “holding space”?</strong></p><p>I had seen just that day, that Tony Morrison from GLAAD — who is a friend — had <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCFIbBkyB8s/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted the lyrics of “Defying Gravity.”</a> Mind you, this was 1.5 days after the election. We were all kind of reeling. What does this mean for marginalized people and specifically people in the queer community? I thought, “Well, this has been a week.” And so asked her, you know, I said that I’d seen people holding space with the lyrics of “Defying Gravity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>And a star was born!</strong></p><p>I was really teeing up my question, which was, “What does it mean to you to play this character who is so resonant with queer people, especially when we need it?” I hadn’t even asked the question yet. Her response was so dear to me. I was a little flustered.</p><p><strong>What is “holding space,” exactly?</strong></p><p>When I hold space for something, it means I take a beat. I pay attention. I come into myself rather than scrolling on my phone or being outward with something.<em> </em>You can hold space in many different ways, right? It can be something profound, or it can be something silly. I have been joking that I’ve been holding space for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/movies/review-carol-explores-the-sweet-science-of-magnetism.html" title="">the movie “Carol”</a> for eight years.</p><p><strong>Ms. Erivo seemed surprised, if pleased, to hear about this reaction. Were there other similar posts you saw from people relating to “Defying Gravity” in this particular way?</strong></p><p>I tried to clarify like, “No, it’s not a huge trend, but I have seen it.” That’s why I said I’m in queer media.<em> </em>I could have said “I have all queer friends,” but that’s what came out of my mouth.<em> </em>Again, I was still teeing up my question.</p><p><strong>Why is being in queer media an important distinction for you?</strong></p><p>I get to pick my own questions. I don’t have editors telling me what questions to ask. I get to ask questions that are pertinent and relevant to what’s happening in the queer community.</p><p><strong>During the interview, Ms. Grande reached over and ever so gently clutched one of Ms. Erivo’s fingers while you were talking. Did you notice in the moment?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>They first started grazing fingers while I was talking to Ariana. I don’t know if it ended up in the edited video, but in the raw footage you can see me clock it. In my head I’m thinking, “Please, God, I am just a human lesbian. This is too much!” The whole thing is ultimately high camp, right, because camp is sincere. I was sincere in my question. Cynthia was sincere in her response. And I think when Ariana grabbed her finger, she was just trying to sincerely let her know that she was there with her.</p><p><strong>Did you walk away from that interview</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>feeling as if it was pretty standard or as if you had gotten something really special?</strong></p><p>I thought it was a really lovely interview. And I thought that people who get it, would get it.</p><p><strong>How does it feel to be a meme?</strong></p><p>It’s been wild. I was in a meeting when it first started happening and someone texted me in the morning like “Hey, I’m loving this viral moment for you.” The video has about 500,000 views. That’s a lot for us, but I had no idea. I wanted to steer clear of the negativity because I don’t need it in my life, personally. I really tried to lean into the joy.</p><p><strong>What have been some of your favorite responses?</strong></p><p>Merriam-Webster had a “<a href="https://x.com/MerriamWebster/status/1859987387692032270" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">holding space” post</a>. The Empire State Building <a href="https://x.com/EmpireStateBldg/status/1860357591869624645" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">did one</a>, which was really fun. The cast of “Once Upon a Mattress,” Ana Gasteyer, Michael Urie and Sutton Foster, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anagasteyer/video/7440984885885455646?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7389335628745655838" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made a video</a>. The tippity-top was the Gay Men’s Chorus of New York <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCvSoNtOlWl/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">singing my interview</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Do you have any regrets about your question?</strong></p><p>Not really. What happened happened. I feel like I got a real response. I got something authentic.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
