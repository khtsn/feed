    <h1>U.S. Denied Entry to French Scientist Over Views on Trump Policies, France Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. authorities denied entry to the scientist and then deported him because his phone contained message exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed his “personal opinion” on the Trump administration’s science policies, Mr. Baptiste said.</p><p>It was not immediately clear what led the border authorities to stop the scientist, why they examined the contents of his phone or what they found objectionable about the conversations.</p><p>Customs officers are allowed to search the cellphone, computer, camera or any other electronic device of any travelers crossing the border, <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/cbp-search-authority/border-search-electronic-devices#:~:text=CBP%20conducts%20border%20searches%20of,government%20to%20conduct%20border%20searches." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a>, although the agency says that such instances are rare. In 2024, less than 0.01 percent of arriving international travelers had their electronic devices searched, according to the agency.</p><p>Mr. Baptiste’s office declined to provide further details about the case, and the National Center for Scientific Research did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the American Embassy in Paris declined to comment.</p><p>The Agence France-Presse news agency <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/sciences/le-gouvernement-deplore-le-refoulement-d-un-scientifique-francais-par-les-etats-unis-20250319" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier</a> on the scientist’s refused entry to the United States.</p></div></div>
