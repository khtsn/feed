</span> that included the first 13-0 of VCT 2026.</p>



<p>The first match of the day featured FNATIC versus NAVI in the teams&#39; seventh meeting in the partnerships era, with FNATIC dominating the head-to-head 5-1. </p>

<p>NAVI took the first map to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594757/natus-vincere-vs-fnatic-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-mr3/?game=244357&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>, where they were 2-0 in this event with <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/18677/ruxic">
		Ruxic	</a>
</span> on Chamber. This time, though, they struggled to break through FNATIC&#39;s defenses, especially when it came to <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/12928/veqaj">
		Veqaj	</a>
</span>&#39;s Viper utility and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/9554/kaajak">
		kaajak	</a>
</span>&#39;s Operator; the pair racked up 15 and 14 kills in the first half respectively, leading FNATIC to 9-3 at halftime.</p>

<p>It seemed that the map would go to FNATIC after they won the pistol round to go up 11-3, but NAVI dug their heels in, winning seven rounds in a row and forcing both of FNATIC&#39;s timeouts as they worked their way back to 11-10. In FNATIC classic fashion, the round that broke the drought for FNATIC was an Astra wall fake with less than 20 seconds on the clock, which got them up to 12 and allowed them to wrap the map up 13-10.</p>

<p>After an unsuccessful showing with <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span> on Sage in their Breeze debut against BBL Esports, FNATIC switched up their composition to one with Alfajer on Viper and Veqaj on Jett. NAVI, who were playing the map for the first time at this event, also opted into double-Duelist with Neon and Yoru. </p>

<p>NAVI went on to have a dominant 13-6 showing, with <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4544/filu">
		Filu	</a>
</span> having one of his best map performances to date as Neon. The Duelist put up a whopping 20 kills to four deaths in the first half, seven of which were Operator kills. <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/29867/hiro">
		hiro	</a>
</span> was also highly impactful as Sova, collecting four 3Ks over the course of the map.</p>


<p><em>Filu was on fire on Breeze.</em></p>

<p>Everything came down to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594757/natus-vincere-vs-fnatic-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-mr3/?game=244359&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>. FNATIC took control first with a 7-0 start off the back of the Duelists <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/9554/kaajak">
		kaajak	</a>
</span> and Alfajer spearheading their attack and Veqaj continuing to frag out on Viper with 15 kills in the 9-3 half.</p>

<p>NAVI again began to grind things back to par. hiro was in unbelievable form on Tejo, finding another four 3Ks on Tejo and spurring his team on to match point at 12-10. Unyielding, FNATIC forced extra innings, as crashies and Veqaj won out a 2v2 retake with 0.90 seconds on the defuse.</p>

<p>Overtime was an all-out brawl, with NAVI being the side with more opportunities to close it up. In the end, however, <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4/crashies">
		crashies	</a>
</span> was the hero of the day, hitting an unreal flick in a 1v1 against the raid boss hiro to win FNATIC the map 17-15. </p>


<p><em>crashies snaps to hiro&#39;s head instantly in the most important duel of the match.</em></p>

<p>A NAVI loss meant heartbreak for hiro, who ended Bind with a server-high 33/15/10 KDA on Bind and a 68/37/25 KDA with a +31 kill differential overall. On the side of FNATIC, Alfajer particularly excelled in the first blood department with a 17-4 FK/FD record across the series. </p>

<p>After a strong 2-0 start in the upper bracket, NAVI fall to the lower bracket with one life remaining and hopes of Santiago qualification growing further away. Their next match will be on Friday, February 6 against the winner of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594763/team-heretics-vs-karmine-corp-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-lr2" target="_blank">Team Heretics versus Karmine Corp</a>.</p>



<p>After a losing 2-0 BBL in the upper bracket, the promised superteam of Vitality looked to regain their momentum with a win over the established GIANTX squad. </p>

<p>Things kicked off on GIANTX&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594758/team-vitality-vs-giantx-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-mr3/?game=244360&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a>, although no one would have guessed it to be their pick based on the result as Vitality crushed their opponents in the first 13-0 of the VCT season. Their attacking plans flawlessly exploited all of GIANTX&#39;s weaknesses, from the Duelist pair <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/5022/derke">
		Derke	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/9780/jamppi">

</span> overwhelming <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/34684/westside">

</span>&#39;s Chamber on B site to <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/458/chronicle">
		Chronicle	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/5554/profek">
		PROFEK	</a>
</span> finding value through Mid lurks in every other round as GIANTX attempted to set up for retakes.</p>


<p><em>Who needs an Interceptor when you have a rifle?</em></p>

<p>PROFEK set a new regional KDA record of 18.0 with a 13/1/5 KDA, but Chronicle was the real star of the show, topping the server by miles with a 20/5/1 KDA, 262 ADR, and a 2.17 rating. </p>

<p>The next map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594758/team-vitality-vs-giantx-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-mr3/?game=244361&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Breeze</a>. GIANTX showed their resilience with a 4-0 start to break their opponent&#39;s streak, but Vitality regained control with six rounds in a row to go up 7-5 at the half. The rest of the map was a dead heat, at one point tied 11-11, but a 3K from <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/9780/jamppi">
		Jamppi	</a>
</span> to lock down A gave Vitality the push they needed to close Breeze 13-11.</p>


<p><em>Jamppi mows down three while dodging a Hunter&#39;s Fury.</em></p>

<p>FNATIC and Vitality earn a long break as they prepare for a match against one another on February 13, with Derke and Chronicle to face their former teammates for a spot in the middle final. GIANTX, on the brink of elimination, will next play the winner of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594764/team-liquid-vs-ulf-esports-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-lr2" target="_blank">Team Liquid versus ULF Esports</a>.</p>
