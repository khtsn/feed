A marker in the entertainer’s American hometown, he thought, might be a good way to honor him.</p><p>Mr. McKechnie sent proposals for a marker to the Florida Historical Marker Program and the Miami Beach City Council, which were approved. The new historical marker consists of a plaque that calls Mr. Arnaz “an American original” and tells some of his story as part of a wave of Cuban émigrés who fled the Cuban Revolution of 1933 that <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1933/08/13/223730712.html?pageNumber=23" title="">deposed President Gerardo Machado</a>.</p><p>The marker’s unveiling coincided with the last day of Hispanic Heritage Month, and with the date of the 1951 premiere of “I Love Lucy,” the show that would make Lucy and Desi household names.</p><p>Their story has also been the subject of documentaries and movies, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/movies/being-the-ricardos-review.html" title="">the 2021 film “Being the Ricardos,”</a> starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem, which centered on one very bad week on the sitcom and how they navigated relationship troubles. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/movies/lucy-and-desi-review.html" title="">The 2022 documentary “Lucy and Desi”</a> explored their career and romance, a collaboration that would make waves in Hollywood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Desi Arnaz started playing the conga to the rhythm of “One, Two, Three, Kick!” at a performance at the Park Avenue nightclub, near the site where the marker was placed in 1939.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/03/obituaries/desi-arnaz-tv-pioneer-is-dead-at-69.html" title="">Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha</a> was born in Santiago de Cuba on March 2, 1917, to a wealthy family.
