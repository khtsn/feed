We have come a long way from the <a href="https://www.pafa.org/museum/collection/item/george-washington-lansdowne-portrait" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lansdowne portrait of George Washington</a>, in which the Virginian general stands at his desk with stiff republican reserve.</p><p>The new official image, shot by the government photographer Daniel Torok, presents the incumbent in tight close-up and obscure quarters. Its lighting is immoderate, its tone forbidding, but compared to the last one its subject’s mood has actually brightened.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the new presidential portrait, Mr. Trump is dead center, occupying a good three-quarters of the frame.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via White House</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>For that previous portrait, released at the time of the presidential transition in January 2025, Mr. Torok used egregious spotlighting from below that gave Mr. Trump the mien of a horror movie villain. The ex-president become president-elect glowered and squinted, in marked imitation of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/us/politics/trump-mugshot-booking-photo.html" title="">his mug shot</a> taken at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The new portrait, by contrast, displays a classically Trumpian tonal incongruity; for all the darkness, note the humor. The lighting is more head-on. Mr. Trump’s shoulders are relaxed, his affect has softened. His neutral expression is moderated by a slight warmth in the eyes — a classic pose that a younger generation, following the supermodel Tyra Banks, knows to call “smizing.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The tone of the latest presidential portrait may appear forbidding, but compared to the previous one, seen here, the subject’s mood has actually brightened.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Library of Congress; P&amp;P</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>What gives the portrait its discomfort is less the pose than the composition; the lens is much closer to the subject than in previous official presidential portraits, and the cropping is extreme. In the official photograph taken for Mr. Trump’s first term he appeared slightly off center, smiling, with ample headroom, filling a little less than half of the picture’s horizontal real estate. The photographic portraits of Joseph R. Biden Jr., Barack Obama and George W. Bush were similarly composed.</p><p>Now Mr. Trump is dead center, occupying a good three-quarters of the frame, and the lens is positioned just a tick too low and close for comfort. It recalls one of those dreadful-existential moments when you open the camera app on your phone and the front-facing lens is activated; there you are, too big, too haggard. For the new portrait, Mr. Trump seems to have consented to leave visible the bags under his eyes that the lit-from-below transition portrait eliminated, whether through makeup or Photoshop.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The official photograph taken during Mr. Trump’s first term was composed much like the photographic portraits of Joseph R.

Bush.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shealah Craighead/Library of Congress; P&amp;P</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The setting is bare, as shadowy and theatrical as the “Apprentice” boardroom, without the White House portico or gilded moldings that peeked from the backgrounds of earlier official photographs. What symbols you have will be found only on the president’s person. The American flag, traditionally behind the president, can be seen on the pin on his jacket’s left lapel. The traditional red tie (in the first term he wore blue) has been done up with a fat Windsor knot, and the silk shines like a cubic zirconium.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>When he came to power in January 2017, Mr. Trump felt like an outlier, and looked like one too. A lustrous ostentation, inherited from ’80s New York tabloids and 2000s reality television, marked him as visually removed not only from the old Washington political elite, but also from the Middle American iconography, the nuclear family and the picket fence, that then still shaped American conservatism.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the portrait from Mr. Trump’s first presidential transition, the White House portico peeked from the background.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Library of Congress; P&amp;P</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Year by year, though, the president’s taste has become the public’s. The portrait’s twilit gloss rhymes with the set designs of the last few Republican national conventions, with gold and black substituting for red, white and blue, and continues an aesthetic of obsidian flash extending all the way back to Trump Tower, the dark, domineering skyscraper that has loomed over Fifth Avenue since 1983 like an oversized vial of Drakkar Noir.</p><p>By 2025, the Trumpian aesthetic has now propagated well past politics, into the tech world and the sports industry, into restaurants and nightlife, into influencers hawking cryptocurrency and vertical videos of fitness supplements. Visually, stylistically, Mr. Trump has not changed — but we have, and I have always believed that political opponents who mocked or dismissed the president’s aesthetic appeal did so at their peril. In defying traditional elites’ tastes, in showing indifference to the visual expectations of others, there lies a curious image of strength.</p><p>What is most interesting in the new portrait is the obscurity of the edges, the Gloria Swanson soft focus. Mr. Trump has thrust his head slightly forward, and the sharp lighting on his face contrasts with heavily blurred cheeks and shoulders. The flag pin is hazy, with no visible stars, and the pale blue shirt and tie appear more computer rendered than lens derived.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Regardless of the actual techniques used to produce it, the photograph displays numerous hallmarks of A.I. imagery: symmetrical composition, imprecise detail, blurring at the edges, and shallow depth of field. If the aesthetic hallmarks of the first Trump term came from television, this second administration has drawn its imagery more from Silicon Valley — even the official White House communication channels have presented the president in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/us/politics/trump-pope-photo.html" title="">pope’s white cassock and miter</a>, and recast sobbing, handcuffed migrants <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1905332049021415862?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as anime characters</a>.</p><p>Between Washington and San Francisco has arisen a techno-cultural regime of image making, of which Mr. Trump is both witting and unwitting master technician. The portrait, in that way, is less a return to the old 1980s gloss than a reflection of 2020s superproduction: an artifact from a brave new world where images can always be regenerated and even the presidency has no history.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jason Farago, a critic at large for The Times, writes about art and culture in the U.S. and abroad.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
