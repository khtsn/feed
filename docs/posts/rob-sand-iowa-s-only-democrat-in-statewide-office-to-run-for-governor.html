Since President Trump became the leader of the party, Iowa Republicans have amassed large legislative majorities and won all six seats in the state’s congressional delegation.</p><p>The incumbent governor, Kim Reynolds, a Republican, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/us/politics/kim-reynolds-iowa-governor.html" title="">said last month</a> that she would not seek re-election to a third full term, setting up an open Republican primary that could attract several prominent conservatives.</p><p>Iowa is expected to be one of several Midwest states with closely contested governor’s races next year. Republicans are hoping to capture governorships now held by Democrats in Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Sand has been a highly visible state auditor, examining state agencies and at times clashing with Ms. Reynolds. He has also worked to build a personal political brand that is distinct from his party. In his announcement video, posted to social media on Monday, he described his background as an auditor and prosecutor without once mentioning that he is a Democrat.</p><p>“I’m doing it because we need more public service and less politics,” Mr. Sand said in the video about his run for governor. “A lot of politicians yap about making a place redder or bluer. I want Iowa to be better and truer.”</p><p>Iowa was once a swing state. Former President Barack Obama carried the state twice, and the Democrats had a majority in the State Senate until the 2016 election.</p><p>Under Ms. Reynolds, however, the state government has moved in a sharply conservative direction. Lawmakers have passed restrictions in recent years on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/14/us/iowa-abortion-ban-law.html" title="">abortion</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/reynolds-iowa-transgender-ban-bathroom-e1651a8785586274f66819dad28b471e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transgender people</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/books/booksupdate/iowa-book-ban-books.html" title="">school library books</a>, and have <a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/state-government-news/2023-06-01/reynolds-signs-law-to-limit-iowa-state-auditors-powers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">limited the power</a> of Mr. Sand’s office as auditor. So far, voters have rewarded the Republicans. Mr. Trump carried the state in each of the last three presidential elections, including by a 13-point margin in 2024.</p><p>Over that time, Mr. Sand has become a political outlier. Two other Democrats in statewide office, the treasurer and attorney general, lost their seats by narrow margins in the 2022 election. Mr. Sand won re-election that year by about 3,000 votes <a href="https://electionresults.iowa.gov/IA/115641/web.307039/#/detail/1700" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">out of about 1.2 million cast</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mitch Smith is a Chicago-based national correspondent for The Times, covering the Midwest and Great Plains.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>North Carolina Supreme Court Race:</strong> The Republican challenger has embarked on an extraordinary effort to reverse his election loss that critics say is testing the boundaries of post-election litigation. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/north-carolina-supreme-court-race-explainer.html">Here’s what to know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Starbase, Texas:</strong> It has been a rough patch for Elon Musk, but he is about to realize a dream for SpaceX, its employees and for himself: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/elon-musk-town-starbase-texas.html">His own town on the southern tip of Texas</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rigging of the Texas Lottery:</strong> Texas lottery executives blessed a scheme that ensured one player would win a $95 million jackpot in 2023.
