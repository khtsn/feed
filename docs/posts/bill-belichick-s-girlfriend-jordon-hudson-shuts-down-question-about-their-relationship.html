How does his team need to adjust?</p><p>“Identifying a problem,” he went on, “figuring a solution and then executing that plan to make it work.”</p><p>Jordon Hudson, Mr. Belichick’s 24-year-old girlfriend, tried to do exactly that at one point in the interview, when Mr. Dokoupil asked Mr. Belichick, 73, how they had met.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We’re not talking about this,” Ms. Hudson interjected off camera from the producer’s table.</p><p>“No?” Mr. Dokoupil asked her.</p><p>“No,” Ms. Hudson said.</p><p>Representatives for Mr. Belichick and his school, the University of North Carolina, did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the interview, but his relationship with Ms. Hudson — and, of course, their nearly 49-year age difference — has been a source of intrigue since the couple went public last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As gruff as he is successful, Mr. Belichick re-emerged from a brief sabbatical in December when he signed a contract worth about $10 million a year to become the head coach at North Carolina. It was seismic news that shook the world of college football — North Carolina has traditionally been a basketball powerhouse — and thrust Mr. Belichick <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/style/bill-belichick-north-carolina.html" title="">back into the spotlight</a>.</p><p>He had previously led the New England Patriots of the N.F.L. to six championships in 24 seasons as the team’s head coach. But his tenure with the team came to an end after the 2023 season — the second straight in which New England had finished with a losing record. At the time, Robert Kraft, the team’s owner, described it as a mutual decision for them to part ways. Mr. Kraft, though, later <a href="https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2024/10/15/robert-kraft-explains-why-he-had-to-fire-bill-belichick/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a radio interview</a> that he “didn’t enjoy having to fire him.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In his appearance on “CBS Sunday Morning,” Mr. Belichick insisted that he had not been fired. But when Mr. Dokoupil pointed out that Mr. Belichick had not included a single reference to Mr. Kraft in his book, Mr. Belichick offered a blank stare and curtly noted that Mr. Dokoupil’s observation was “correct.”</p><p>One person who <em>is</em> cited in the book is Ms. Hudson, whom Mr. Belichick describes in the acknowledgments section as his “idea mill and creative muse.”</p><p>Ms. Hudson <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jordon/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has more than 87,000 followers</a> on Instagram, where she describes herself as the daughter of a Maine fisherman, an avid birder and a former college cheerleader. She is also a pageant queen: She is set to represent her hometown, Hancock, Maine, as she competes for the title of <a href="https://missmaineusa.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Miss Maine USA 2025</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Hudson and Mr. Belichick <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DF8kcOdv9GK/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">met in 2021</a>, reportedly when they were <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/06/18/bill-belichick-autographed-jordon-hudsons-school-work-during-1st-meetup/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seated next to each other</a> on a flight. They were first spotted together in 2023, and their rumored romance later became official after Mr. Belichick’s split from his longtime girlfriend, Linda Holliday.</p><p>As the Patriots’ coach, Mr. Belichick had been averse to social media, going so far as to broadcast his ignorance (real or feigned) by referring several times to “Instaface.” But he has been <a href="https://www.instagram.com/billbelichick/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">active on Instagram</a> since he began dating Ms. Hudson, and she has featured him prominently in a number of her own posts — including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBzn8o5PbkA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Halloween-themed one</a> in which she is posing as a mermaid and Mr. Belichick is reeling her in as a fisherman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Never been too worried about what everybody else thinks,” Mr. Belichick said in the “CBS Sunday Morning” interview. “Just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what’s right.”</p><p>At the same time, it seems clear that Ms. Hudson has played a role in trying to shape the public perception of their relationship. In emails <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6279486/2025/04/15/bill-belichick-jordon-hudson-unc-football/" title="">recently obtained by The Athletic</a>, Ms. Hudson came to Mr. Belichick’s defense after he expressed concern to North Carolina officials about being called a “predator” online.</p><p>“Is there anyone monitoring the U.N.C. Football page for slanderous commentary and subsequently deleting / blocking users that are harassing BB in the comments?” she asked in an email in February.</p><p>During the CBS interview, in which she was described by Mr. Dokoupil as a “constant presence,” she took care of monitoring things herself.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Scott Cacciola writes features and profiles of people in the worlds of sports and entertainment for the Styles section of The Times.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/bill-belichick">Bill Belichick</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/university-of-north-carolina">University of North Carolina</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Style Coverage</h2><h3>Fashion, trends, love and more.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>An Armed and Legged Fish: </strong>How Steve, a French cartoon with a catchy theme song, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/style/le-poisson-steve-tiktok.html">became a TikTok star.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>A Basketball Star Is Born</strong>:<strong> </strong>Paige Bueckers became a college sensation for her skill and her style.
