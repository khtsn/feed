    <h1>Justice Dept. Investigates Minnesota Prosecutor Office Over Race Policy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division said on Saturday that she was investigating a new policy in Minnesota’s largest county to determine whether it illegally considers race as a factor in plea deals.</p><p>Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, announced the investigation on social media Saturday night. A letter to the county attorney’s office in Hennepin County, which include Minneapolis, will seek to determine if it engages “in the illegal consideration of race in its prosecutorial decision-making.”</p><p>The inquiry stems from a policy memo the office issued days earlier, in which prosecutors were told to be aware of racial or age considerations in plea negotiations and sentencing.</p><p>“While racial identity and age are not appropriate grounds for departures, proposed resolutions should consider the person charged as a whole person, including their racial identity and age,” the memo said. “While these factors should not be controlling, they should be part of the overall analysis. Racial disparities harm our community, lead to distrust, and have a negative impact on community safety. Prosecutors should be identifying and addressing racial disparities at decision points, as appropriate.”</p></div></div>
