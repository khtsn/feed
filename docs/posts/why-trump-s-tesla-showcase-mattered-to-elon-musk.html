But the nation’s biggest electric vehicle producer was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Seems odd that Tesla wasn’t invited,” Musk tweeted before the event.</p><p>The Biden White House explained the snub by noting that the automakers that had been invited were the nation’s three largest employers of the United Automobile Workers, a powerful union, and it suggested that the administration would find other ways to partner with Tesla. (Union animus toward electric vehicles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/business/electric-vehicles-uaw-gm-ford-stellantis.html" title="">later became a problem for Biden</a>.) But today, the moment is seen as a turning point in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/business/dealbook/biden-musk-apple.html" title="">feud</a> between Musk and Biden that some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-kara-swisher.html" title="">Democrats say they have come to regret deeply</a>.</p><p>“They left Elon out,” said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who is working to get his party to embrace electric vehicles, “and now he hates ’em.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was hard not to think about that episode yesterday when Musk and Trump lined up Teslas, including Cybertrucks, on the White House driveway and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-buy-tesla-elon-musk.html" title="">proceeded to rattle off their benefits</a> like denizens of a suburban showroom.</p><p>“I love the product,” Trump said.</p><p>“Try it,” Musk said. “You’ll like it!”</p><p>Musk now has the White House attention and promotion that he wanted several years ago — and with it, a pile of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/elon-musk-companies-conflicts.html" title="">potential benefits</a> for some of his companies — but it’s come at a price. He donated some $300 million largely through his own super PAC to help Trump get elected. My colleagues Theodore Schleifer and Maggie Haberman reported yesterday that he’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-donation.html" title="">signaled a willingness to put another $100 million</a> into groups controlled by Trump’s political operation.</p><p>His alliance with Trump has also eaten into his customer base. Before the election, Murphy said, Democrats were four times more likely than Republicans to buy an electric vehicle. Now, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/tesla-stock-market-elon-musk.html" title="">sales of Teslas are slumping</a>, and some Democrats are turning theirs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/tesla-boycott-elon-musk.html" title="">back in to dealers</a>.</p><p>Musk may be hoping to find a new market on the other end of the political spectrum. Trump, who has spent years denigrating electric vehicles, insisted he was buying one, with a check. Sean Hannity, the Trump ally, said he, too, would buy a Tesla Model S Plaid as a show of solidarity with Musk.</p><p>“This thing rips,” he said on his show, “and you can go 400 miles without a charge.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><hr/><p>AGENCY REPORT</p><h2 id="link-28e9082e">47 percent</h2><p>That’s the size of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-education-department-firings.html" title="">staff cuts</a> at the Education Department, an agency that Trump has said he wants to eliminate. The department announced on Tuesday that it was firing some 1,300 employees. Another 572 employees took separation packages offered in recent weeks, and 63 probationary workers were terminated last month. The department started the year with more than 4,100 workers.</p><p>The cuts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/education-department-cuts.html" title="">struck a blow</a> to efforts that measure achievement in U.S. schools. At least 800 Education Department research employees and outside partners have lost their jobs.</p><h3 id="link-1506c9ab"><span><strong>More on government agencies</strong></span></h3><ul><li><p>The Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/climate/epa-climate-grants-canceled.html?smid=url-share" title="">canceled $20 billion in climate grants</a>.</p></li><li><p>A federal agency dedicated to mental health and addiction faces huge cuts, my colleague <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/health/federal-cuts-substance-abuse-mental-health.html" title="">Jan Hoffman writes</a>.</p></li><li><p>Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/musk-doge-social-security-entitlement-spending.html" title="">suggested this week</a> that his team would scrutinize Social Security and entitlement spending.</p></li></ul><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Tesla Supercharger in Santa Monica, Calif., last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>MEANWHILE on X</p><h2 id="link-1bd28">$TSLA</h2><p><em>Musk is using his X account as a megaphone.

My colleague Shawn McCreesh, a White House reporter, </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/elon-musk-suit-trump-white-house.html" title=""><em>took that to be a sign of a demotion</em></a><em>. I asked Shawn to tell us a little more.</em></p><p><strong>Why does it matter so much that Musk decided to wear a suit last week?</strong></p><p>I think there is a costume element to Musk’s marauding through the capital — that “Tech Support” T-shirt he constantly wears, and the little joke he tells when he wears it, is very much part of the whole shtick.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>This sudden change of wardrobe coincided with a few other things happening around him last week that sure looked like the beginning of a power clampdown. That this most classic and essential of Washington symbols — the gray suit and tie — should also be the symbol of his subjugation was fascinating.</p><p><strong>Musk was back to the old blazer-and-T-shirt look at the Tesla event yesterday. What does that mean?</strong></p><p>It’s his look, which I guess Trump will continue to tolerate. That he does says a lot about Musk’s power and influence in Trump’s court, because Trump absolutely loves suits. He has written about his love of them in several of his books over the years. It is his costume. It is what people wear when they dress up as him for Halloween.</p><p>Rulers throughout history have had strict rules about how their courts are allowed to dress. King Louis IV, for example, had a rule that only a select group of noblemen could wear a certain blue silk jacket like his. Louis also loved diamonds, brocaded coats, elaborate wigs and shoes with red heels that symbolized the blood of his enemies whom he vowed to crush under his feet.</p><p>Some people in Washington who dress slovenly on purpose — like John Fetterman and, to a degree, Bernie Sanders — do so to signal that they are one of the people. Musk strikes me as the opposite. His informality seems to be about reminding everyone that he is in a league of his own.</p><p><strong>Tell us, Shawn — when do you wear a suit?</strong></p><p>Well, after writing about this topic, I felt it’d be rather hypocritical not to wear one. So I’ve got a suit on today.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/elon-musk-suit-trump-white-house.html" title=""><em>Read more here</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-17"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jess Bidgood is a managing correspondent for The Times and writes the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/on-politics">On Politics</a> newsletter, a guide to the 2024 election and beyond.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jess-bidgood">More about Jess Bidgood</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/sean-hannity">Sean Hannity</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Elon Musk’s Government Role</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>War on the I.R.S.: </strong>Italian employees who serve American forces at the Aviano Air Base in Italy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/musk-email-italy-airbase.html">where workers’ rights are held sacrosanct</a>, got a familiar demand to list their achievements from Elon Musk, carrying with it the threat of termination if they did not respond.</p></li><li><p><strong>Musk’s Donations:</strong> Musk has signaled that he wants to put $100 million into groups controlled by the Trump political operation, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
