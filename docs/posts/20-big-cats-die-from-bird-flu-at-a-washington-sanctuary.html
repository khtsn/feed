Within days, other species began to show signs of illness.</p><p>On Nov. 23, the first cat, a cougar, died, and several others began to become increasingly ill in the following days. An African serval was the last cat to die, on Dec. 13. Some of the cats shared a common wall between their habitats, but did not directly interact.</p><p>Only 17 cats remain in the sanctuary, Mr. Mathews said.</p><p>Mr. Mathews said that the sanctuary was working with officials to determine the virus’s origin, though it has been difficult to pinpoint how it entered the grounds. Wild bird droppings might have entered the cat habitats, or the meat used to feed the animals could have contained the virus, he said.</p><p>The sanctuary removed 8,000 pounds of food that had been stored in a freezer to prevent any further infections, and it started a sanitation process, which could take months to complete.</p><p>“We have to go through and disinfect each habitat,” Mr. Mathews said. “Any straw or organic matter needs to come out and be bagged and then burned, and then we have to disinfect again. Then we have to let it set for a couple weeks.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Workers at the sanctuary have been wearing protective clothing and N95 masks, and they are sanitizing their shoes to prevent any virus particles that could remain from spreading.</p><p>Cats are particularly vulnerable to avian influenza. A new version of the bird flu virus, H5N1, emerged in 2020 and has been rapidly spreading around the world, infecting birds and other mammals.</p><p>The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife <a href="https://wdfw.medium.com/avian-influenza-cases-increase-in-washington-a5cb8600ab0d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> earlier this month that it had confirmed avian influenza infections in “numerous” wild birds this fall, and had recently confirmed that two cougars in another area, Clallam County, had the H5N1 virus.</p><p>Last year, two outbreaks of bird flu <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/health/bird-flu-cats-dogs-h5n1.html" title="">spread in cat shelters in Seoul</a>, where investigators later determined the source to be raw duck meat fed to the cats.</p><p>In California, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/us/bird-flu-california-covid-cows.html" title="">bird flu has infected</a> most of the state’s dairy cattle herds this year, with cows in 645 dairies testing positive for H5N1. There have been at least 61 human cases reported in the United States so far, with most of the individuals experiencing mild symptoms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.wildfelids.org/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wild Felid Advocacy Center</a> in Washington takes in big cats who have not been properly cared for, or whose owners could no longer care for them.</p><p>In addition to the half-Bengal tiger, named Tabbi, and four cougars, Hooligan, Holly, Harley and Hannah Wyoming, the dead included an African caracal, named Crackle; two Canada lynx cats, Chuckie and P’uch’ub; a Geoffroy’s cat, Mouse; a Bengal cat, Pebbles; a Eurasian lynx, Thumper; and four bobcats and five African servals, according to the sanctuary’s statement.</p><p>“It looks like the virus has taken its course,” Mr. Mathews said. “We’re just trying to make the one that’s incapacitated now just a little stronger.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emmett Lindner writes about breaking and trending news.
