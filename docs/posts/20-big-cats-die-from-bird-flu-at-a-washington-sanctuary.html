Within days, other species began to show signs of illness.</p><p>On Nov. 23, the first cat, a cougar, died, and several others began to become increasingly ill in the following days. An African serval was the last cat to die, on Dec. 13. Some of the cats shared a common wall between their habitats, but did not directly interact.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
