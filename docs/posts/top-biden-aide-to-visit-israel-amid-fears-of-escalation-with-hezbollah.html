    <h1>Top Biden Aide to Visit Israel Amid Fears of Escalation With Hezbollah</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Hochstein is expected to meet with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and defense minister, Yoav Gallant, on Monday. He has already made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/us/politics/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-iran.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">at least five trips</a> to Israel and Lebanon since Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/us/politics/amos-hochstein-lebanon-israel-biden.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">tasked him with trying to prevent</a> the clashes from expanding into a war that could be even more devastating than the conflict in Gaza.</p><p>Statements by Israeli officials in recent days suggest that time may be of the essence.</p><p>Mr. Gallant said on Monday that he had informed U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III in an overnight phone call that time was “running out” for a diplomatic solution.</p><p>“Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas,” Mr. Gallant said in a statement. “The trajectory is clear.”</p><p>And Mr. Netanyahu told a meeting of government officials on Sunday that the situation in Israel’s north “will not continue.”</p><p>The strikes have driven more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-civilians.html" title="">than 150,000 people</a> in Israel and Lebanon from their homes in the border region. Those who have fled their homes in Lebanon have received little assistance from the government, which is in the middle of a prolonged financial crisis. In Israel, the government has paid to feed and house evacuees in hundreds of hotels across the country.</p></div></div>
