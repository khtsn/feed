He has already made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/us/politics/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-iran.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">at least five trips</a> to Israel and Lebanon since Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/us/politics/amos-hochstein-lebanon-israel-biden.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">tasked him with trying to prevent</a> the clashes from expanding into a war that could be even more devastating than the conflict in Gaza.</p><p>Statements by Israeli officials in recent days suggest that the window for negotiating a political settlement to the spiraling conflict in the north might be closing.</p><p>Mr. Gallant said on Monday that he had informed U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III in an overnight phone call that time was “running out” for a diplomatic solution.</p><p>“Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas,” Mr. Gallant said in a statement. “The trajectory is clear.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And Mr. Netanyahu told a meeting of government officials on Sunday that the situation in Israel’s north “will not continue.”</p><p>The strikes have driven more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-civilians.html" title="">than 150,000 people</a> in Israel and Lebanon from their homes in the border region. Those who have fled their homes in Lebanon have received little assistance from the government, which is in the middle of a prolonged financial crisis. In Israel, the government has paid to feed and house evacuees in hundreds of hotels across the country.</p><p>In his remarks on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu said “we will do whatever is necessary to return our residents securely to their homes.”</p><p>Israel over the weekend rained artillery fire and airstrikes on southern Lebanon in response to Hezbollah rockets that had triggered air-raid sirens and sparked brush fires in northern Israel. </p><p>Fears of a broader conflagration have risen since an Israeli airstrike in late July killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/middleeast/fuad-shukr-hezbollah-israel-strike.html" title="">a senior Hezbollah commander</a> in the Beirut suburbs. Iran threatened to strike Israel over the killing of a Hamas leader on its soil shortly after that.<span>  </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Israeli officials have taken pains to emphasize their readiness. On Monday, Israel’s defense ministry said it had equipped 97 “rapid response units” in towns along the northern border with “combat and rescue gear, medical supplies, uniforms and protective equipment.”</p><p>Here’s what else is happening in the Middle East:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Polio in Gaza: </strong>Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the main U.N. agency that aids Palestinians in Gaza, <a href="https://x.com/unlazzarini/status/1835624063680594264?s=46&amp;t=ccWRJzS530FIzJwwxUAeMg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Monday</a> that the first round of a polio vaccination campaign in the Gaza Strip had been successfully completed, with hundreds of thousands of children vaccinated. The next stage of the campaign aims to administer a second vaccine dose to each child by the end of September, he added.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hostage deaths:</strong> The Israeli military said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-killed-strike.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">an internal investigation</a> found that three hostages in Gaza were probably killed as a result of an airstrike targeting a senior Hamas commander in November. The investigation’s findings came as advocates for the hostages and their families demand that Mr. Netanyahu do more to secure a deal with Hamas for the release of the hostages still in Gaza, even if that allows Hamas to survive the war with Israel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Netanyahu’s rival goes to Washington:</strong> Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel’s parliamentary opposition, was in Washington on Monday. His office said he was scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser. Mr. Lapid, a vocal critic and rival of Mr. Netanyahu, made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/world/middleeast/yair-lapid-blinken-washington.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">a similar diplomatic trip</a> to the U.S. capital in April.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter who covers the culture and politics of the New York City region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
