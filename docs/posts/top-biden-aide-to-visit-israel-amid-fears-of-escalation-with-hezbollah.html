amid deepening concern that months of cross-border violence between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia, could escalate into a larger regional war.</p><p>Hezbollah and Israel’s military have been trading near-daily fire since last October, when the start of the war in Gaza prompted the Iran-backed militia to launch rocket attacks on northern Israel in solidarity with Hamas. </p><p>The cross-border clashes have intensified in recent months, and Israel’s reduced combat operations in Gaza have freed up more of its forces for a possible offensive in the north against Hezbollah.</p><p>The visit by the adviser, Amos Hochstein, is part of efforts by the Biden administration to prevent “an escalation and a widening of this conflict,” John Kirby, a White House spokesman, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/09/13/on-the-record-press-gaggle-by-white-house-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-28/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told reporters last week.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Amos’s travels are very much a continuation of the diplomacy that he’s been conducting now for many months to try to prevent a second front from opening up in the north there,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Hochstein is expected to meet with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and defense minister, Yoav Gallant, on Monday. He has already made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/us/politics/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-iran.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">at least five trips</a> to Israel and Lebanon since Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/us/politics/amos-hochstein-lebanon-israel-biden.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">tasked him with trying to prevent</a> the clashes from expanding into a war that could be even more devastating than the conflict in Gaza.</p><p>Statements by Israeli officials in recent days suggest that the window for negotiating a political settlement to the spiraling conflict in the north might be closing.</p><p>Mr. Gallant said on Monday that he had informed U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III in an overnight phone call that time was “running out” for a diplomatic solution.</p><p>“Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas,” Mr. Gallant said in a statement. “The trajectory is clear.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And Mr. Netanyahu told a meeting of government officials on Sunday that the situation in Israel’s north “will not continue.”</p><p>The strikes have driven more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-civilians.html" title="">than 150,000 people</a> in Israel and Lebanon from their homes in the border region. Those who have fled their homes in Lebanon have received little assistance from the government, which is in the middle of a prolonged financial crisis. In Israel, the government has paid to feed and house evacuees in hundreds of hotels across the country.</p><p>In his remarks on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu said “we will do whatever is necessary to return our residents securely to their homes.”</p><p>Mr. Hochstein’s mediation efforts have involved repeated rounds of shuttle diplomacy between Beirut and Jerusalem. Because the United States designates Hezbollah a terrorist group, Mr. Hochstein has communicated with it through Lebanese government officials who act as interlocutors. </p><p>France — which maintains direct lines of communication with Hezbollah — has been pursuing its own diplomatic solution at the same time. In recent months, Mr. Hochstein has sought to better <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-blinken.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb" title="">coordinate</a> efforts with French officials, who have also been vocal about the risk of military escalation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Monday, France’s ambassador to Israel, Frédéric Journès, also warned of a wider conflict.</p><p>“If a full-scale war starts in Lebanon, it could turn this whole thing into a regional conflict, and then you have a regional conflict in Ukraine and a second regional conflict in the Middle East,” he said at the Haaretz National Security Conference in Israel. </p><p>“Nobody wants this war,” he added. “Iran doesn’t want it, Hezbollah doesn’t want it and Israel doesn’t want it, and yet it is very possible that it happens.”</p><p>Despite the warnings, the tit-for-tat violence continued on Monday. Israel’s military said that it had struck Hezbollah “infrastructure” in southern Lebanon on Monday after “a number of projectiles” crossed from the country into Israeli territory.</p><p>That followed Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes on southern Lebanon over the weekend in response to Hezbollah rockets that had triggered air-raid sirens and sparked brush fires in northern Israel. </p><p>Fears of a broader conflagration have risen since an Israeli airstrike in late July killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/middleeast/fuad-shukr-hezbollah-israel-strike.html" title="">a senior Hezbollah commander</a> in the Beirut suburbs. Iran threatened to strike Israel over the killing of a Hamas leader on its soil shortly after that.<span>  </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Israeli officials have taken pains to emphasize their readiness. On Monday, Israel’s defense ministry said it had equipped 97 “rapid response units” in towns along the northern border with Lebanon with “combat and rescue gear, medical supplies, uniforms and protective equipment.”</p><p>Here’s what else is happening in the Middle East:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Polio in Gaza: </strong>Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the main U.N. agency that aids Palestinians in Gaza, <a href="https://x.com/unlazzarini/status/1835624063680594264?s=46&amp;t=ccWRJzS530FIzJwwxUAeMg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Monday</a> that the first round of a polio vaccination campaign in the Gaza Strip had been successfully completed, with hundreds of thousands of children vaccinated. The next stage of the campaign aims to administer a second vaccine dose to each child by the end of September, he added.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hostage deaths:</strong> The Israeli military said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-killed-strike.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">an internal investigation</a> found that three hostages in Gaza were probably killed as a result of an airstrike targeting a senior Hamas commander in November. The investigation’s findings came as advocates for the hostages and their families demand that Mr. Netanyahu do more to secure a deal with Hamas for the release of the hostages still in Gaza, even if that allows Hamas to survive the war with Israel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Netanyahu’s rival goes to Washington:</strong> Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel’s parliamentary opposition, was in Washington on Monday. His office said he was scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser. Mr. Lapid, a vocal critic and rival of Mr. Netanyahu, made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/world/middleeast/yair-lapid-blinken-washington.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">a similar diplomatic trip</a> to the U.S. capital in April.</p></li></ul><p>Euan Ward<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter who covers the culture and politics of the New York City region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">Israel-Hamas War News</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/lloyd-austin">Lloyd Austin</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/yoav-gallant">Yoav Gallant</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Hostage Deaths:</strong><strong> </strong>Israel’s military announced that, based on an internal investigation, three hostages were probably killed as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-killed-strike.html">result of an Israeli airstrike</a> targeting a senior Hamas commander in November.</p></li><li><p><strong>​​Fight Over Philadelphi Corridor:</strong><strong> </strong>The border between Egypt and Gaza has become a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/middleeast/philadelphi-corridor-israel-gaza-egypt.html">major point of contention in cease-fire negotiations</a> — not just between Israel and Hamas, but also between Israel and Egypt.</p></li><li><p><strong>How UNRWA Became a Flashpoint:</strong><strong> </strong>The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees has survived 75 years of Israeli-Palestinian strife. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/magazine/unrwa-gaza-war.html">Can it survive the latest conflict</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Israel Raids Secret Weapons Site: </strong>Israel carried out a commando raid in Syria that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/israel-raid-syria-weapons.html">obliterated a Hezbollah missile production facility</a> near the Lebanese border, according to American and other Western officials.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gazans Say Polio Drive Is Futile:</strong><strong> </strong>Palestinians living with the daily fear of Israeli strikes see a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-vaccination-futility.html">level of absurdity in the international drive</a> to vaccinate their children.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
