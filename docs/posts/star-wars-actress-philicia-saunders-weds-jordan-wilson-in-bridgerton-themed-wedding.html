Four Nintendo video game characters are inked on his left shin, and a quote from a “Batman” comic covers his right rib cage.</p><p>But until a Friday afternoon in March 2022, Philicia Shamira Jean Saunders didn’t know this side of her co-worker at Bad Robot, the Los Angeles film and television production house of which the “Lost” co-creator J.J. Abrams is a founder.</p><p>That afternoon, she took Mr. Wilson to lunch as a thank you for remotely fixing her iPad ahead of an acting audition. It was two years into the pandemic, and because Mr. Wilson had just recently moved to Los Angeles to join Bad Robot’s technology support team, the two had only interacted through virtual office meetings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Wilson showed up to lunch wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with an anime character that Ms. Saunders, an anime fan herself, recognized right away. Over noodles at Kotoya Ramen in West Los Angeles, Ms. Saunders — a human resources professional and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3578394/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an actor with two “Star Wars” films to her name</a> — was surprised and delighted to discover how many other passions she shared with the former Apple Genius Bar technician.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Wilson is a voice actor who describes himself as a“walking nerd billboard.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kristen Booth Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Saunders is an actor with two “Star Wars” films to her name.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kristen Booth Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>They discovered a mutual love of anime, video games, cosplay and acting. He’s a voice actor who has been featured in commercials for Starbucks, Xfinity and the cognac maker Hennessy. She, in addition to playing the Resistance base fighter Tabala Zo in “The Force Awakens” and “The Rise of Skywalker,” has appeared in TV series including “9-1-1” on ABC and “How I Met Your Father,” on Hulu/FX. She has also performed onstage, currently appearing in “I, Daniel Blake” at the Fountain Theater in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/vows" title=""><em>Binge more Vows columns here</em></a></strong><strong><em> and </em></strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/fashion/weddings" title=""><em>read all our wedding, relationship and divorce coverage here</em></a></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>“Finding a nerd was something I’ve always wanted in a partner,” Ms. Saunders said. “I was like, ‘This can’t be the person I’ve been looking for.’” She had a firm rule against office romances.</p><p>Mr. Wilson was equally captivated by the conversation’s effortless flow, and by his co-worker — she’s not only an actor, but a member of <a href="https://breathesoloproductions.com/black-swans-synchro" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Black Swans Synchro</a>, a squad of synchronized swimmers, all women of color, who will be the subject of an upcoming documentary, now in the early stages of development. He had glimpsed Ms. Saunders once in passing at the office, but sitting across from her at the noodle place, he found himself disarmed.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Wow, she is even more beautiful in person. This is not good,” said Mr. Wilson, who was similarly wary of dating a co-worker.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The duo quickly settled into an easy camaraderie, finding any excuse to connect at the office. He would bring her coffee. She would ask him an occasional tech question she already knew the answer to.</p><p>“I asked him to help me anyway, just so he could come by my desk,” she said. “He’s charismatic, he’s funny, I love his smile. When he’s happy and energetic, it’s very contagious.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Despite having a policy of not dating co-workers, they quickly bonded over their common interests in anime, video games, cosplay, and acting. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kristen Booth Photography </span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The cautious pas de deux continued for months, until Mr. Wilson took to heart the words etched on his torso about conquering limits (the full quote: “All men have limits. They learn what they are and learn not to exceed them. I ignore mine”). He asked Ms. Saunders on an official date, suggesting sushi, a favorite of hers, despite his own distaste for it. “I really wanted to impress her and show her that I like her enough to get outside my comfort zone,” he said.</p><p>That first date in May 2022 lasted six hours, and more followed. By the time their relationship grew serious, Ms. Saunders had moved on from Bad Robot, and is now a senior recruiter at the Plente Executive Search Group. Mr. Wilson followed suit, joining Scopely, a mobile-first video game developer where he works in executive technical support.</p><p>Ms. Saunders, 36, grew up in the Ladera Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, the daughter of a U.S.-born mother and a father who immigrated from Jamaica in his teens. She earned a bachelor’s degree in East Asian studies from Princeton and an M.F.A. in acting from the University of California, Los Angeles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Mr. Wilson, 35, studied studio art at William Paterson University, and was raised in Englewood, N.J., by a single mother and maternal grandmother, with whom he shared an especially profound bond.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“From that first ramen date, I was like, ‘This is the safest I’ve felt in a long time. I want to feel this way every day,’” Mr. Wilson said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kristen Booth Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Losing her was definitely the hardest thing in my life, and it’s affected me a lot,” he said of MaMa, as he called her, who died of cancer in 1998.</p><p>Ms. Saunders, he said, “feels like an embodiment of my grandmother’s love. From that first ramen date, I was like, ‘This is the safest I’ve felt in a long time. I want to feel this way every day.’”</p><p>Fantasy worlds permeate the couple’s life. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kooolmodee/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Wilson’s drawings</a>, mostly depicting anime scenes, line the walls of the apartment they moved into in September 2024 in the Westchester neighborhood of Los Angeles, that they share with their black cat, Baggie. They revel in trips to Disneyland and Universal Studios and take turns acting out a favorite scene from “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” in their most dramatic British accents. Together, they dress up in meticulously planned costumes for anime conventions and Renaissance Faires.</p><p>“It’s about not letting go of your inner child and just enjoying the things that make you happy,” Mr. Wilson said of the geeky pursuits that bind them. For him, they also have served as a guidepost.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>One line delivered by Kamina, a character in the Japanese anime series “Gurren Lagann,” resonates deeply with him: “Believe in the you that believes in you.”</p><p>A little over a year after Mr. Wilson and Ms. Saunders started dating, he recalled those words as he prepared to propose at an Airbnb he had rented overlooking the hills of Tarzana, Calif. When she arrived — for a romantic private dinner, she’d been told — Mr. Wilson took her hand and led her up a set of stairs to a patio with two long rows of electric candles that curved into the shape of a heart. He had set up an iPad so their family members could watch over Zoom.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-15"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Couture Cakery created the couple’s cake, which had four tiers: two tiers of marble cake with caramel buttercream filling and two tiers of chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kristen Booth Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The bride, a fan of Netflix’s “Bridgerton” series, infused elements of the show into their wedding.

But her admiration for the series goes beyond its grand 19th-century costumes.</p><p>“I would always watch movies like ‘Shakespeare in Love’ and I’d be like, ‘Oh my god, I would love to wear a nice corset and a beautiful big skirt, but someone that looks like me won’t be anywhere in that time period unless she’s a servant,” she said. “‘Bridgerton’ came out and it turned that stereotype on its head. You could see yourself in those spaces.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Saunders wore a Bridgerton-inspired Vivienne Atelier Bridal gown with an eight-foot train.

Their mutual friend Anwar Ali, ordained by Rose Ministries for the occasion, officiated.</p><p>“Beyond the shared interests and inside jokes, there’s a pure, simple joy in just being together,” Mr. Ali said during the ceremony. “They turn ordinary moments into something special.”</p><p>“You drive me to be better every single day,” Mr. Wilson told Ms. Saunders during his vows. “You push me to be more gentle every day. You encourage me to reach higher than I thought I could reach every day.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“You have helped me discover the best version of myself,” Ms. Saunders said to her “cool nerd,” as she calls him. “A journey that I have been on my entire life.”</p><p>Ms. Saunders wore a Vivienne Atelier Bridal dress with a ball gown silhouette befitting a “Bridgerton” ball and a sparkly train that extended almost eight feet behind her. Mr. Wilson wore a burgundy tuxedo, and later changed into a Regency-style coat for their first dance, which began with him kissing his bride’s gloved right hand and her curtsying. The pair then glided into period choreography <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY9Za9R3FaU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">straight out of “Bridgerton” prequel “Queen Charlotte,”</a> and straight out of time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Guests toasted the couple during the reception.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kristen Booth Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><hr/><h3 id="link-52899010"><span><strong>On This Day</strong></span></h3><p><strong>When</strong> Nov. 10, 2024</p><p><strong>Where</strong> Ebell Club Long Beach in Long Beach, Calif.</p><p><strong>Grandpa’s Special Role </strong>Ms. Saunders’s 97-year-old maternal grandfather<strong> </strong>James Wilson Ferguson Sr. served as ring bearer. Not a fan of flying, he traveled by train from Columbus, Ohio, to attend the Southern California wedding. “I am his first granddaughter getting married,” Ms. Saunders said, “so it’s a big deal.”</p><p><strong>Music to Marry By </strong>Mr. Wilson walked down the aisle, accompanied by his mother, Donna Wilson, and older sister Diadra<strong> </strong>Wilson, as the Harpeggio Quartet played the song “Dearly Beloved” from Kingdom Hearts, one of the couple’s favorite video games. Ms. Saunders followed, making her entrance to “Love” from the Disney animated film “Robin Hood.” Her parents, Philip and Jean Saunders, greeted their daughter at the end of the aisle as she approached the groom.</p><p><strong>Here Come the Suds</strong> Each wedding guest received a square of fragrant soap handmade by the bride’s older sister and maid of honor, Tamar Saunders. A note with the gift humorously observed that in the modern era, “frequent bathing has become all the rage, quite a departure from Regency times when a wash was more a matter of whimsy than routine.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>ST</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>13</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>‘Star Wars’ Actress Weds, but in a ‘Bridgerton’ Setting<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
