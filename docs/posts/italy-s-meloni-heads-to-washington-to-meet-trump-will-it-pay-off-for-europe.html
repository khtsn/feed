Those credentials have helped stoke speculation that Ms. Meloni could visit the White House with an Italy-first approach, looking to strike deals for her country and threatening to undermine European unity.</p><p>But many diplomats and officials push back on such concerns, in part because Ms. Meloni has made a name for herself in recent months as a collaborative player on the European stage. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>To Ms. Meloni’s fans, this is a moment ripe with opportunity. To others, it is an important test of whether she can use her affinity with Mr. Trump to help Italy, and Europe.</p><p>“Italy will find out how much it can claim a special relationship with the United States,” said Giovanni Orsina, the head of the political science department at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome.</p><p>The visit unquestionably comes a time of high stakes: The 27-nation European Union relies on the United States as its most important trading partner, and Mr. Trump’s trade war threatens to upend that. </p><p>Mr. Trump’s threats of imposing punishing tariffs, beyond those already in place, could dent demand for everything from Chianti to chemicals — and the European economy hangs in the balance, as leaders try to persuade Mr. Trump to relent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump announcing tariffs at the White House earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“She will play a facilitator,” between the European Commission and the United States, Italy’s minister for enterprises, Adolfo Urso, said in an interview. He added that Ms. Meloni could count not only on a long-established bilateral relationship between Italy and the United States, but also on “a personal relationship that was consolidated between Meloni and Trump.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Top-level European Union officials have struggled to meet with their American counterparts. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has not been able to speak with President Trump since he retook office, despite trying.</p><p>National leaders have had better luck, at least in winning an audience. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Britain’s leader Keir Starmer and Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin have all met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office.</p><p>Many see Ms. Meloni’s trip as a continuation of those efforts.</p><p>“Any outreach to the U.S. is welcome,” Arianna Podesta, the European Commission’s deputy chief spokeswoman, told reporters on Monday about Ms. Meloni’s trip, adding later that the trip was also “closely coordinated.”</p><p>Ms. Podesta said on Wednesday that Ms. Von der Leyen and Ms. Meloni spoke by phone on Tuesday evening, and called having contact with the Americans “extremely positive.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Still, Ms. Meloni’s visit has caused unease in some quarters. French Industry Minister Marc Ferracci told a French broadcaster that there was a risk that the visit <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/giorgia-meloni-donald-trump-visit-triggers-anxiety-in-france/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could break</a> the continent’s unity. In Brussels and in Italy, opponents have said that Ms. Meloni’s visit to Washington will reveal how loyal she is to Europe, at a time when Mr. Trump and his allies continue to portray Europe’s leadership as feckless.</p><p>“This is the moment of truth for our prime minister,” Italy’s former development minister and opposition politician Carlo Calenda said in a statement. “We will see whether she is a leader that keeps the European front united, or if she will give in to the flattery of the US president.”</p><p>For weeks, Mr. Trump’s actions — threatening widespread tariffs and tilting toward Russia — have increasingly strained Ms. Meloni<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/world/europe/italy-meloni-trump-europe-tensions.html" title="">’s delicate balancing act</a>.</p><p>A nationalist conservative, she has called Elon Musk a friend and received praise from Mr. Trump, who has called her a “wonderful woman.” And she has often sought to have it both ways, nurturing bilateral ties with Mr. Trump while preserving Italy’s role within a united E.U.</p><p>But every new step by Mr. Trump has highlighted her attempts not to strongly take a side. Although she has been a strong supporter of Ukraine, she did not, like other European leaders, rebuke Mr. Trump after his dressing down of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. She also spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland in February, and called for the E.U. not to escalate or retaliate on tariffs, and she has continued that mantra even after Mr. Trump threw the world into a tailspin with wide-ranging tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>European and NATO leaders at a summit in Britain last month.

When European nations voted to impose counter tariffs in response to Mr. Trump’s steel and aluminum levies, for instance, only Hungary opposed the move. Italy joined the 25 other member states in supporting retaliation. (Europe has since walked back those retaliative tariffs, at least temporarily, in response to Mr. Trump’s decision to hit “pause” on some tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations.)</p><p>Ms. Meloni also has said that Mr. Trump’s tariffs were “wrong,” and, in the run-up to her trip, she did not signal any intention to obtain special carve outs for Italy.</p><p>“Europe’s industrial supply chains are now intertwined,” Mr. Urso, her minister for enterprises, said. “We certainly do not want to divide Europe.”</p><p>European officials are currently trying to push their American counterparts to negotiate. Officials are offering economic carrots, including the possibility of cutting tariffs on cars and other industrial goods and ramping up European purchases of natural gas, while also threatening to retaliate if no deal can be reached.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Even those who are skeptical of Ms. Meloni have pointed out that she has good reason to toe the European line in Washington on Thursday: Italy may be a large economy, but the E.U. as a whole is more powerful in winning concessions when it is united.</p><p>“It is an important moment for Italy,” Mr. Orsina, the analyst, said. “And it may be an important one for Europe, too.”</p><p>As for Ms. Meloni, she seems to be under no illusions about the import of her meeting with Mr. Trump.</p><p>“I am feeling no pressure for my next two days,” Ms. Meloni joked on Tuesday afternoon as she spoke at an awards ceremony in Rome. “We will do our best,” she said, adding: “I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.</p></div><div><p>Jeanna Smialek is the Brussels bureau chief for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Santa’s Neighbors Are Annoyed: </strong>A tourist season in Rovaniemi, Finland that stretches from October to March has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/asia/santa-finland-rovaniemi.html">anything but jolly for some residents</a> of the “Official Hometown of Santa Claus.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Orange Skies in Iraq: </strong>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/middleeast/iraq-sandstorm.html">severe sandstorm swept across Iraq</a>, turning the sky a strange orange, reducing visibility and sending several thousand people to emergency rooms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Van Gogh’s Last Painting: </strong>The artist painted his final work, “Tree Roots,” in Auvers-sur-Oise, France.
