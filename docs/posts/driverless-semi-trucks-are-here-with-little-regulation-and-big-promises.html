They won’t ride the brakes or make unnecessary lane changes, wasting fuel. And they won’t need to abide by the 11-hour daily driving maximum imposed on long-haul truckers for safety reasons.</p><p>“If you’re a farm that has fresh produce, the reach of your farm just expanded dramatically,” said Chris Urmson, the chief executive of Aurora, who was riding in the back seat during the first run.</p><p>Aurora’s new truck, which has already logged more than 1,000 driverless miles shuttling goods along Interstate 45 in Texas, is equipped with nearly 360-degree sensors that can detect objects 1,000 feet away.</p><p>But some truckers, academics and labor groups are uneasy. They see an unregulated and risky sphere emerging, and worry that American roads could be facing a new menace.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Byron Bloch, an auto safety expert in Maryland, said that federal oversight of the new robotrucks was “totally inadequate” and that the technology was being rushed into use with “alarming” speed.</p><p>“My initial thought is: It’s scary,” said Angela Griffin, a veteran truck driver from outside Hagerstown, Md.</p><p>She said misting rain had caused A.I.-powered scanners on her semi truck to malfunction, and she worried that unpredictable traffic patterns in congested areas or challenging weather conditions could lead to catastrophic errors by unmanned trucks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A test track in Pittsburgh, where Aurora is based.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gene J.

There was a semi on her right. Workers were in between the trucks, and there was no left shoulder. She slammed on the brakes and yelled. Her truck pulled up just in time.</p><p>“I thought for sure I was going to kill those people,” she said. “I don’t see how a driverless truck would have been able to read and recognize the threat that was imminent.”</p><p>And Ms. Griffin wondered if the lack of a driver might slow the response time if an autonomous truck runs over a pedestrian, or freezes in the road and gets rear-ended. (Mr. Urmson, the Aurora chief, declined to say how many people in a remote assistance center would be assigned to each robotruck.)</p><p>Semi trucks, the skeptics note, bring dangers different from those posed by the self-driving cars that have started to take over the streets of San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin and Las Vegas. The trucks are far heavier, and need at least a football field’s length to come to a complete stop at highway speeds. Some carry flammable or hazardous materials.</p><p>The rollout of robocars has itself been bumpy. In Arizona in 2018, a driverless car ran over a pedestrian walking a bicycle, killing her. In San Francisco and Austin, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/technology/driverless-taxis-cars-cities.html#:~:text=on%20city%20services.-,In%20San%20Francisco%20and%20Austin%2C%20Texas%2C%20where%20passengers%20can%20hail,firefighters%20and%20other%20city%20employees." title="">vehicles have slowed emergency response</a> times and caused accidents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>With larger vehicles, the critics say, the dangers multiply. The risks seemed to crystallize on an Arizona highway in 2022, when an autonomous truck with a driver aboard veered across Route 10 and careened into a concrete barrier. (Nobody was hurt.)</p><p>“It’s potentially disastrous from a safety perspective,” said John Samuelsen, head of the Transport Workers Union of America, who is also worried about trucking jobs being automated out of existence. </p><p>Mr. Samuelsen appears to have public opinion on his side. A <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2025/02/aaa-fear-in-self-driving-vehicles-persists/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey conducted</a> by AAA this year found that 61 percent of motorists in the United States feared self-driving vehicles and that 26 percent were unsure about them.</p><p>Mr. Urmson, the Aurora chief, vowed that his trucks would be safe. “We have something like 2.7 million tests that we run the system through,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The shipping industry has struggled to recruit truck drivers in recent years for grueling long-haul shifts.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gene J.

Gary Buchs of Colfax, Ill., who has been driving big rigs since the 1980s, said he expected driverless trucks would be safer and more predictable. He doubted they would eradicate trucking jobs.</p><p>“I think the growth of jobs will outpace the addition of autonomous trucks,” Mr. Buchs said, predicting that for any lost long-haul trucking jobs, there would be new, higher-quality careers for shorter deliveries. “Younger people want the jobs changed.”</p><p>Just about everybody agrees on one thing. The robotrucks are coming, fast. “Like a freaking Corvette — doing zero to 60,” Mr. Samuelsen said.</p><p>The consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company has <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive%20and%20assembly/our%20insights/will%20autonomy%20usher%20in%20the%20future%20of%20truck%20freight%20transportation/will-autonomy-usher-in-the-future-of-truck-freight-transportation.pdf?should#:~:text=Beyond%202035%2C%20total%20cost%20of,traditional%20trucks%20for%20longer%20distances.&amp;text=Furthermore%2C%20according%20to%20the%20projection,on%20the%20road%20in%202035." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">projected</a> that 13 percent of the heavy-duty trucks on U.S. roads will drive themselves within a decade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For now, Aurora, whose investors include Uber, has operated just two trucks without a driver — only in good weather and during the day. And last week, <a href="https://aurora.tech/newsroom/updating-our-driverless-operations" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aurora said it was</a> temporarily returning an observer to the driver’s seat at the request of the truck’s manufacturer. But Aurora says it plans to expand its driverless runs to at least 20 trucks by year’s end, and to push into more challenging conditions.</p><p>The company is fine-tuning the technology for bad weather, and said its robotruck would drive conservatively in the rain and use blasts of high-pressure air to clean the lenses of its sensors. Runs in the snow appear more distant. (Mr. Urmson previously ran Google’s self-driving car project, now known as Waymo, which has had successes in San Francisco and other cities.)</p><p>At least three other companies are also developing driverless trucks. One of the companies, Kodiak Robotics, has started to use driverless trucks on dirt roads in Texas.</p><p>Experts spoke highly of Aurora, describing the company as a leader in safety. But they also expressed concern about a lack of regulation.</p><p>“What Aurora’s doing is being much more careful than most,” said Philip Koopman, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in autonomous vehicles. “But there’s still no requirement for independent checks and balances.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The Transportation Department, which regulates commercial trucking through its Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, said in a statement that “comprehensive federal regulations specific to automated trucks are still under development.” But the department added that it was working with the trucking industry and state governments to “modernize safety oversight.”</p><p>Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, said in a statement that he welcomed the arrival of Aurora’s trucks and that his state “offers businesses the freedom to succeed.”</p><p>Although there is no federal regulatory framework in place, a number of states have considered legislation to regulate self-driving trucks. </p><p>Under normal circumstances, experts said, robotrucks may prove much better at driving than humans. “For our ordinary set of traffic crashes, automated trucking will be safer,” predicted Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who focuses on driverless vehicles, citing existing research on vehicle automation.</p><p>But experts caution that it is impossible to predict how the trucks will react to circumstances their designers did not anticipate: a storm of tumbleweeds, perhaps, or a broad cyberattack that affects their systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“This technology is really good at things it’s practiced, and really bad at things it has never seen before,” Professor Koopman said, adding, “From a safety point of view, nobody knows how it’s going to turn out.”</p></div></section></article></div>
