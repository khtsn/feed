But with a fire, if a fire hits your house, all of your stuff is gone.” She packed her car with items that were irreplaceable and drove to her parents’ house in the next town over.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Another fire in Horry County that burned about 800 acres was 80 percent contained as of Sunday afternoon, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ForestryCommish/posts/pfbid027PR13Nb2Cif1C7Lb13XKJnSB6kYrBbVtvu8g8FLX7sZj1uLtv3DGME2EegRseGMyl?rdid=sHS5EQfI1S8X0vv6#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Forestry Commission said</a> on social media.</p><p>The state fire marshal said that there were more than than 175 wildfires in the state burning a total of 4,200 acres, <a href="https://governor.sc.gov/news/2025-03/governor-henry-mcmaster-declares-state-emergency-due-wildfires" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the governor’s office</a>.
