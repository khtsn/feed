Conditions were “slightly better” on Sunday, the agency said, and it cautioned residents against doing anything that could spark a fire.</p><p>Gusty winds, dry air and afternoon high temperatures in the low 70s helped fuel the rapid spread of the fires. Another factor: South Carolina had unusually low rainfall in February, and the vegetation is dry.</p><p>For instance, Myrtle Beach, has recorded 2.30 inches of rain since Jan. 1, compared with 6.30 inches of rain that is considered normal for this time of year. North Carolina was a bit wetter last month, though it also received below-average rainfall.</p><p>Claire Fahy<!-- --> and <!-- -->Amanda Holpuch<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
