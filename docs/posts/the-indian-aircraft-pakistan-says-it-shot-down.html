Pakistan, for its part, claims it shot down five planes and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/pakistan-defense-minister-india.html" title="">at least one</a> drone: three Rafale fighter jets, one MIG-29 fighter aircraft, one Su-30 fighter jet and one Heron drone.</p><p>The New York Times was unable to independently verify these claims.</p><p>John E. Pike, director of <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GlobalSecurity.org</a>, a nonprofit research group based in Alexandria, Va., said those five aircraft and the drone could have been downed by surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. “Pakistan has both,” he said.</p><p>Here is what to know about the aircraft Pakistan’s military says it shot down.</p><h2 id="link-586bf55">Rafale</h2><p>The Rafale is a <a href="https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/defense/rafale/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">twin-engine</a> fighter jet that can take off from an aircraft carrier or a base onshore, according to its French manufacturer, Dassault Aviation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In April, the Indian government <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2124851" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed</a> a deal with France to purchase an additional 26 of the aircraft for the Indian Navy, to be delivered by 2030. According to Dassault Aviation, India had <a href="https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/defense/rafale/rafale-deployment-history/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously</a> ordered 36 Rafales.</p><p>Photos from the village of Wuyan in India-administered Kashmir, showed debris identified as an external fuel tank for a plane. Trevor Ball, an associate researcher at Armament Research Services, said that the tank was likely from a French-made Mirage or Rafale fighter jet, but he could not confirm whether the fuel tank came from an aircraft that had been hit by enemy fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3143e5">MIG-29</h2><p>The Soviet-designed MIG-29 is a twin-engine fighter aircraft developed to counter U.S. fighters like the F-16. The Soviet Air Force began using MIG-29s in the 1980s, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many former Soviet republics continued to use the plane. It has also been a popular export; over 30 nations have used or operated it, <a href="https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/Search/WEG/MIG-29" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the U.S. Army Training Command.</p><p>The plane was originally intended for dogfighting enemy aircraft, though some MIG-29s have been outfitted for attacking ground targets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The MIG-29 is often a competitor with the F-16 in international arms sales Mr. Pike said, adding that it was a “competition which it frequently loses.”</p><h2 id="link-1bd92">Su-30</h2><p>The <a href="https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/WEG/Asset/Su-30_(Flanker-C)_Russian_Multirole_Fighter_Aircraft" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Su-30</a> is a twin-engine fighter jet developed in the Soviet Union in the 1990s by Russia’s Sukhoi Aviation. It can be used for air-to-air combat, or missions striking targets on the ground, according to a U.S. Army analysis.</p><p>It’s significantly bigger than the MIG-29, at nearly 72-feet long and with a wingspan of over 48 feet. (The MIG-29 is nearly 57-feet long and has a wingspan of around 37 feet.)</p><h2 id="link-72853b4c">Heron Drone</h2><p>Heron drones encompass a family of Israeli-made unmanned aerial vehicles. U.S. government assessments list India as having <a href="https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/Search/All/Heron" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least one</a> variant.</p><p>Shawn Paik<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>May 7, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people killed in the terrorist attack in Kashmir.
