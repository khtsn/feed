Those actions were part of a “buy-or-bury strategy,” the F.T.C. said.</p><p>Ultimately, the purchases coalesced Meta’s power, depriving consumers of other social networking options and edging out competition, the government said.</p><p>“For more than 100 years, American public policy has insisted firms must compete if they want to succeed,&#34; said Daniel Matheson, the F.T.C.’s lead litigator in the case, in his opening remarks. “The reason we are here is that Meta broke the deal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,” he added.</p><p>Meta’s lawyers denied the allegations in opening arguments, countering that the company faces plenty of competition from TikTok and other social media platforms. The F.T.C. approved the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, and it would set a dangerous precedent for the business world to try to unwind the mergers, the lawyers added.</p><p>“This case is a grab bag of F.T.C. theories at war with fact and at war with the law,” said Mark Hansen, the company’s litigator and a partner at the law firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel &amp; Frederick. “The facts are going to prove that the F.T.C.’s theories are all wrong.”</p><p>The trial — Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms — poses the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/technology/zuckerberg-testifies-meta-trial-ftc.html" title="">most consequential threat</a> to the business empire of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/technology/mark-zuckerberg-meta-free-speech.html" title="">Mark Zuckerberg,</a> the company’s co-founder. If the government succeeds, the F.T.C. would most likely ask Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, potentially shifting the way that Silicon Valley does business and altering a long pattern of big tech companies snapping up younger rivals.</p><p>Still, legal experts cautioned that it might be challenging for the F.T.C. to win. That’s because the government must prove something unknowable: that Meta, formerly known as Facebook, wouldn’t have achieved the same success without the acquisitions. It is also extremely rare to try to unwind mergers approved years ago, legal experts said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“One of the most difficult things for antitrust laws to deal with is when industry leaders purchase small potential competitors,” said Gene Kimmelman, a former senior official in the Obama administration’s Department of Justice. Meta, he added, “bought many things that either didn’t pan out or were integrated. How are Instagram and WhatsApp different?”</p><p>The F.T.C.’s case against Meta is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/antitrust-google-amazon-apple-meta.html" title="">third major tech antitrust lawsuit</a> to go to trial in the past two years. Last year, the D.O.J. won its antitrust case against Google for monopolizing internet search. A federal judge is set to hear arguments over remedies, including a potential breakup, next week. The D.O.J. also completed a separate trial against Google for monopolizing ad technology, which is still being decided by a federal judge.</p><p>The Justice Department has also sued Apple, and the F.T.C. has sued Amazon, accusing the companies of antitrust violations. Those trials are expected to begin next year.</p><p>The case against Meta could affect its 3.5 billion users, who on average log onto Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp multiple times a day for news, shopping and texting. Instagram and WhatsApp have attracted more users in recent years as Facebook, Meta’s flagship app, has stopped growing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>F.T.C. Chairman Andrew Ferguson was in the courtroom to listen to the government’s opening statement. Meta’s chief legal officer, Jennifer Newstead, and Joel Kaplan, its chief global affairs officer, also attended. Alex Schultz, Meta’s chief marketing officer, sat at the litigator’s table and will serve as the company’s executive at the trial.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, outside court Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael A.

He is already in the national spotlight for rejecting the Trump administration’s effort to use a powerful wartime statute to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants it deemed to be members of a violent street gang.</p><p>Judge Boasberg has said he had never been a user of Meta’s apps, but was familiar with Facebook Live, which has been featured in criminal trials. He took notes as Mr. Matheson explained the government’s definitions of social networking and methodology to determine Meta was a monopoly. He was equally focused on Meta’s rebuttal of those definitions.</p><p>The F.T.C. argued that Mr. Zuckerberg said in 2006 that Facebook was used to connect “actual friends.” The F.T.C. has argued that Meta has had a monopoly in social networking since 2011 and that SnapChat was among the only comparable platforms to Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Meta rejected the F.T.C.’s definition of social networking, saying it faces competition from TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube and other platforms. Mr. Hansen said it competed with messaging apps for sharing content between friends and family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He said more than half of all engagement on Facebook and Instagram is of videos, which put Meta squarely in competition with TikTok, the fast-growing short-video app. When TikTok was momentarily shut down in January, Meta saw a surge of usage to Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, which shows the company has plenty of competition.</p><p>“Meta has no monopoly,” Mr. Hansen said.</p><p>During what is projected to be an eight-week trial, the government and Meta are expected to tell competing versions of the company’s 20-year growth story.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andrew Ferguson, right, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission exits the E.

The company overpaid when it purchased Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, the F.T.C. argued.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In 2014, as WhatsApp grew, Meta offered to buy the company for $19 billion — also far above its market value, the government said.</p><p>The F.T.C. plans to highlight a paper trial of emails between Meta executives, alongside other evidence, to argue that the company bought the start-ups because they were threats.</p><p>In his opening remarks, Mr. Matheson mentioned documents, including what he described as a “smoking gun” February 2012 email by Mr. Zuckerberg, in which the chief executive discussed the rise of Instagram and the importance of “neutralizing a potential competitor.” In another email in November 2012 to the former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote, “Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion.”</p><p>The F.T.C. lawyer said Meta bought WhatsApp to keep it from being acquired by competitors like Google, which were trying to use a messaging service to launch a competing social network. Meta’s acquisition of WhatsApp was intended to build a “moat” around the company’s monopoly in social networking, Mr. Matheson said.</p><p>The government is set to call witnesses from Meta, as well as competitors, venture capitalists, economists and media industry executives. Mr. Zuckerberg was expected to be called as the first witness as soon as Monday. The F.T.C. said Ms. Sandberg, and Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram, would testify this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-15"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cecilia Kang reports on technology and regulatory policy for The Times from Washington.
