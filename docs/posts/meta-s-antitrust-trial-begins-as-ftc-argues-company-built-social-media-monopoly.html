Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse in Washington</p></div></div></div></div><p><time datetime="2025-04-14T16:05:34-04:00"><span>April 14, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>4:05 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the chief of executive of Meta, took the witness stand on Monday to defend his social media empire in a landmark antitrust trial that could dismantle a company that has transformed how the world connects online.</p><p>In a packed courthouse in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, lawyers for the federal government pushed Mr. Zuckerberg to define the social networking market as one that just connects friends and family, so that they could set up how Meta dominates that area. The government has contended that Meta <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/technology/meta-ftc-trial-whatsapp-instagram.html" title="">illegally cemented a monopoly</a> by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp when they were tiny start-ups, combining them into the same company, which was known as Facebook then.</p><p>In response, Mr. Zuckerberg described the social media market as much larger than how the government was defining it. Connecting friends and family is “one of the core things” the company does, he said, but Meta is also involved in “the general idea of entertainment and learning about the world and discovering what’s going on.”</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, wearing a dark suit and light-blue tie, was the first witness in the trial, Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms. Earlier in the day, the F.T.C. opened its first antitrust trial under the Trump administration by arguing that Meta’s acquisitions were part of a “buy-or-bury strategy.” Ultimately, the purchases coalesced Meta’s power, depriving consumers of other social-networking options and edging out competition, the government said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Meta’s lawyers denied the allegations in opening statements, countering that the company faces plenty of competition from TikTok and other social media platforms. The F.T.C. approved the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, and trying to unwind the mergers would set a dangerous precedent, the lawyers added.</p><p>The trial poses the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/technology/zuckerberg-testifies-meta-trial-ftc.html" title="">most consequential threat</a> to the business empire of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/technology/mark-zuckerberg-meta-free-speech.html" title="">Mr. Zuckerberg,</a> the company’s co-founder. If the government succeeds, the F.T.C. is likely to ask Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, potentially shifting the way that Silicon Valley does business and altering a long pattern in which big tech companies have snapped up younger rivals.</p><p>Still, legal experts cautioned that it might be challenging for the F.T.C. to win. That’s because the government must prove something unknowable: that Meta wouldn’t have achieved the same success without the acquisitions. It is also extremely rare to try to unwind mergers approved years ago, legal experts said.</p><p>“One of the most difficult things for antitrust laws to deal with is when industry leaders purchase small potential competitors,” said Gene Kimmelman, a senior official in the Obama administration’s Department of Justice. Meta “bought many things that either didn’t pan out or were integrated,” he added. “How are Instagram and WhatsApp different?”</p><p>The F.T.C.’s case against Meta is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/antitrust-google-amazon-apple-meta.html" title="">third major tech antitrust lawsuit</a> to go to trial in the past two years. Last year, the Justice Department won its antitrust case against Google for monopolizing internet search. A federal judge is set to hear arguments over remedies, including a potential breakup, next week. The department also completed a separate trial against Google for monopolizing ad technology, which a federal judge is still deciding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Justice Department has also sued Apple, and the F.T.C. has sued Amazon, accusing the companies of antitrust violations.</p><p>The case against Meta could affect its 3.5 billion users, who on average log on to Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp multiple times a day for news, shopping and texting. Instagram and WhatsApp have attracted more users in recent years as Facebook, Meta’s flagship app, has stopped growing.</p><p>“For more than 100 years, American public policy has insisted firms must compete if they want to succeed,” said Daniel Matheson, the F.T.C.’s lead litigator in the case, in his opening remarks. “The reason we are here is that Meta broke the deal.”</p><p>“They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The F.T.C.’s chairman, Andrew Ferguson, was in the courtroom to listen to the government’s opening statement. Meta’s chief legal officer, Jennifer Newstead, and Joel Kaplan, its chief global affairs officer, also attended. Alex Schultz, Meta’s chief marketing officer, sat at the litigators’ table and will serve as the company’s executive at the trial.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, outside court Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael A.

He is already in the national spotlight for rejecting the Trump administration’s effort to use a powerful wartime statute to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants it deemed to be members of a violent street gang.</p><p>Judge Boasberg has said he was never a user of Meta’s apps, but is familiar with Facebook Live, which has been featured in criminal trials. He took notes as Mr. Matheson explained the government’s definitions of social networking and methodology to determine Meta was a monopoly. He was equally focused on Meta’s rebuttal of those definitions.</p><p>The F.T.C. argued that Mr. Zuckerberg said in 2006 that Facebook was used to connect “actual friends.” The agency has argued that Meta has had a monopoly in social networking since 2011 and that SnapChat was among the only comparable platforms to Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Meta rejected the F.T.C.’s definition of social networking, saying it faces competition from TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube and other platforms. Mark Hansen, Meta’s lead litigator and a partner at the law firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel &amp; Frederick, said it competed with messaging apps for sharing content among friends and family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Hansen said more than half of all engagement on Facebook and Instagram involved videos, which put Meta squarely in competition with TikTok, the fast-growing short-video app. When TikTok was momentarily shut down in January, Meta saw a surge of use on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, which shows the company has plenty of competition, he said.</p><p>“This case is a grab bag of F.T.C. theories at war with fact and at war with the law,” Mr. Hansen said. “The facts are going to prove that the F.T.C.’s theories are all wrong.”</p><p>“Meta has no monopoly,” he said.</p><p>During what is projected to be an eight-week trial, the government and Meta are expected to tell competing versions of the company’s 20-year growth story.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andrew Ferguson, right, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, leaving the federal courthouse in Washington on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Brenner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The F.T.C.’s argument hinges on Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which forbids a company to maintain a monopoly through anticompetitive practices.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The F.T.C. accused Meta of struggling to build a mobile app and fearing that Instagram would rapidly outpace it in popularity. The company overpaid when it purchased Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, the F.T.C. argued.</p><p>In 2014, as WhatsApp grew, Meta offered to buy the company for $19 billion — also far above its market value, the government said.</p><p>The F.T.C. is highlighting a paper trial of emails between Meta executives, alongside other evidence, to argue that the company was a monopoly and bought the start-ups because they were threats. The government presented Mr. Zuckerberg with a binder of internal documents between him and others in the company.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg spoke slowly, appearing to grow more comfortable as he explained the mechanics of online social networks and how his company’s products had changed over the years. And he said a minority of content was shared among friends on Facebook and Instagram, with it “decreasing as a percentage of what is happening across the service.”</p><p>In his opening remarks, Mr. Matheson mentioned documents, including what he described as a “smoking gun” February 2012 email in which Mr. Zuckerberg discussed the rise of Instagram and the importance of “neutralizing a potential competitor.” In another email, in November 2012 to Meta’s chief operating officer at the time, Sheryl Sandberg, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote, “Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>In addition to Mr. Zuckerberg, the F.T.C. said, Ms. Sandberg and Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram, will testify this week.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-17"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cecilia Kang reports on technology and regulatory policy for The Times from Washington.
