According to the latest statistics from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, in 2022 the state agency lost $285 million to fare evasion in the subway system and $315 million on buses even as roughly twice the number of passengers ride the trains.</p><p>It is the latest enforcement effort by an agency facing a dire financial future, in part because of widespread fare evasion. The M.T.A. has predicted <a href="https://new.mta.info/document/147291" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deficits of almost $1 billion</a> by 2028, mostly because of lower-than-expected fare revenue.</p><p>The authority for years has sent groups of unarmed, uniformed employees to patrol buses and give tickets to riders who do not pay as part of its Evasion and Graffiti Lawlessness Eradication program, known as EAGLE. Last year, the M.T.A. <a href="https://new.mta.info/press-release/mta-eagle-teams-begin-bus-stop-hub-approach-part-of-enhanced-fare-enforcement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded the routes</a> the groups covered and focused on locations with high rates of fare evasion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At the same time, the Police Department created a unit specifically dedicated to bus fare evasion. As part of that effort, the department deploys officers alongside the M.T.A.’s teams to more effectively curb fare beating and to keep the transit workers safe from retaliation.</p><p>It’s unclear how successful the latest round of enforcement will be. Past attempts to rein the problem in have failed to yield results on the subway, where <a href="https://metrics.mta.info/?subway/fareevasion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14 percent of riders failed to pay</a> to ride during the first three months of the year. During the same time period last year, the rate was 11 percent.</p><p>Enforcement is even more difficult on the buses, where there are no turnstiles or gates to block access. Transit experts say it is much easier to skip the fare, and some riders also feel justified because heavy traffic and a lack of bus lanes means that bus service can be slow and unreliable. On buses, <a href="https://metrics.mta.info/?bus/fareevasion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the fare evasion rate</a> was 39 percent at the beginning of 2023 and 48 percent at the start of this year.</p><p><a href="https://new.mta.info/article/bus-fare-evasion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On a webpage posted Monday</a> to announce the recent effort, the M.T.A. said that fare beaters who refuse to pay may asked to leave the bus and may receive a summons.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Ley is a Times reporter covering New York City’s mass transit system and the millions of passengers who use it.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-ley">More about Ana Ley</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Bus Fare Evasion Surges:</strong> In New York City, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/nyregion/nyc-bus-subway-fare-evasion.html">48% of bus riders fail to pay</a>, one of the worst fare evasion problems of any major city in the world.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Parrots vs. the Co-op Board: </strong>Three pet parrots at a Manhattan building irritated their neighbors, who moved to evict them and their owner.
