The officers and transit officials had singled the woman out after receiving cues from an undercover inspector who was observing riders on the bus.</p><p>The woman appeared stunned and burst into tears. She was still crying when she boarded the next M96 bus that pulled up. This time she paid her fare.</p><p>While most of New York’s enforcement initiatives have focused on the subway, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/nyregion/nyc-bus-subway-fare-evasion.html" title="">fare evasion is much more prevalent</a> on city buses, and transit leaders this week expanded efforts on buses, where one out of two passengers fails to pay. According to the latest statistics from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency lost $285 million in 2022 to fare evasion in the subway system and $315 million on buses, even as roughly twice as many passengers rode the trains.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The police officers and transit workers stationed at the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 97th Street were part of a team assigned to stop fare beaters. Similar groups will continue to be deployed throughout the bus system permanently, according to an M.T.A. spokesman. On Thursday, teams fanned out across 41 of the bus system’s 314 routes in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island. Brooklyn is scheduled to be targeted on Friday.</p><p>“A lot of our customers have been saying, you know, ‘Why am I paying a fare and others aren’t?” said Demetrius Crichlow, the interim president of New York City Transit, the M.T.A. division that manages the subway and bus systems. “This is really our response to those customers.”</p><p>But it is a tough task for transit leaders, because the disregard for fares is deeply ingrained in many bus riders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Last year, the Police Department created a unit dedicated to bus fare evasion.

Union leaders advise bus drivers not to confront passengers who skip the fare, out of concern for the drivers’ safety. And some riders feel justified in not paying the $2.90 fare because heavy traffic and a lack of bus lanes means that bus service can be slow and unreliable. Officials have also said that a sense that the fare was optional was reinforced by a period during the pandemic when bus rides were free.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The problem has only deepened as riders return to the system. On buses, <a href="https://metrics.mta.info/?bus/fareevasion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the fare evasion rate</a> jumped to 48 percent during the first three months of the year, up from 39 percent during the same period in 2023.</p><p>During Thursday’s crackdown, riders appeared bewildered. A woman tried to shove her way onto the bus, past the officers huddled around the entry handing out fliers detailing the added enforcement. Many commuters rushed off the bus and grabbed the fliers without giving them a glance.</p><p>Several people said they were happy to see the rules being enforced.</p><p>Michelle Rosario, 50, who lives in New Jersey and takes a train and a bus to get to work at a Manhattan hospital, said she was tired of seeing riders sneak onto buses without paying and harassing bus drivers when they tried to enforce the fare.</p><p>“People should pay their fare just like everybody else,” Ms. Rosario said.</p><p>The ramped-up enforcement seeks to help an agency facing a dire financial future. The authority has predicted <a href="https://new.mta.info/document/147291" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deficits of almost $1 billion</a> by 2028, largely because of lower-than-expected fare revenue.</p><p>For years, the agency has sent groups of unarmed, uniformed employees to patrol buses and give tickets to riders who do not pay as part of its Evasion and Graffiti Lawlessness Eradication program, known as EAGLE. Last year, it <a href="https://new.mta.info/press-release/mta-eagle-teams-begin-bus-stop-hub-approach-part-of-enhanced-fare-enforcement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded the routes</a> the groups covered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At the same time, the Police Department created a unit specifically dedicated to bus fare evasion. As part of that effort, the department deploys officers alongside the transit agency’s teams to more effectively curb fare beating and keep the transit workers safe from retaliation.</p><p>It is unclear how successful the latest round of enforcement will be. Past attempts to rein in the problem have failed to yield results on the subway, where <a href="https://metrics.mta.info/?subway/fareevasion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14 percent of riders failed to pay</a> during the first three months of this year.</p><p>Ticketing efforts also risk slowing down buses. Riders on Thursday complained that the police officers and transit workers were interrupting their commute.</p><p>“We’re trying to get to work,” one man shouted.</p><p>Critics have argued that the M.T.A.’s fare evasion enforcement measures only add to the revenue loss. In New York and across the country, <a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/auditor/auditor-reports/all-landing-pgs/2018/-/media/depts/auditor/new-web-docs/2018/rapidride-2018/rapidride-2018.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=48CC62AD93C71768170F8B8DFD3BBB07" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fare evasion tickets often go unpaid</a>. If a summons is not paid, offenders can have their wages garnished or tax returns seized.</p><p>Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group, said the expanded effort would do little more than make service even worse in a city where buses move slower than anywhere else in the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“There’s an immense cost to squeezing riders for additional transit fares,” Mr. Pearlstein said. “And there’s a huge waste in this operation in terms of riders’ time.”</p><p>M.T.A. union leaders said the money for enforcement would be better spent to fully subsidize fares. Left-leaning politicians in Albany have sought to fully fund the bus network through taxes, the same way the state pays for services such as public education and the police.</p><p>Civil rights advocates raised concerns that the tighter fare enforcement would disproportionately affect the city’s most vulnerable residents. The bus system generally serves people who are older and poorer than those who take the subway, and fare evasion summonses and arrests have typically affected Black and Latino New Yorkers. Advocates added that the use of undercover operatives was a significant invasion of people’s privacy.</p><p>Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a privacy and civil rights group based in New York, described the enforcement action as a publicity stunt.</p><p>“This is yet another example of the M.T.A. choosing public relations over public safety,” Mr. Cahn said. “It is a guaranteed way to lose money.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>M.T.A. officials responded to the criticism by saying that said that they were targeting bus routes based on fare evasion rates and not singling them out based on the demographic makeup of their ridership. They said that in order to improve bus speeds, the authority needs to be able to pay for service, and fares are a crucial source of funding.</p><p>At the bus stop in Manhattan on Thursday, another woman, who declined to identify herself, was escorted off the bus and handed a ticket. She said that she usually pays and was unable to do so today, but she did not elaborate.</p><p>“This is crazy,” she said. “Are they doing this to everyone?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Ley is a Times reporter covering New York City’s mass transit system and the millions of passengers who use it.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-ley">More about Ana Ley</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>17</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>M.T.A.
