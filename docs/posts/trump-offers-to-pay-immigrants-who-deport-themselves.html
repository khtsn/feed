    <h1>Trump Offers to Pay Immigrants Who Deport Themselves</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“But what we thought we’d do is a self deport where we’re going to pay each one a certain amount of money and we’re going to get them a beautiful flight back to where they came from, and they have a period of time, and if they make it, we’re going to work with them so that maybe someday, with a little work, they can come back in if they’re good people,” he said.</p><p>It’s unclear how people could return.</p><p>The money being offered to migrants who leave on their own will be paid after they confirm their travel home through a government app the Trump administration unveiled earlier this year called CBP Home, officials said. Trump officials say the program will save the government money by avoiding the costs necessary to arrest, detain and fly people out of the country on government-chartered planes.</p><p>“If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest,” Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement.</p><p>The Trump administration announced last week that it had deported around 140,000 migrants from the U.S. since January. The numbers, at this point, do not put the administration on track to fulfill a central <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/17/us/immigrants-trump-deportations.html" title="">campaign promise of Mr. Trump: removing millions</a> of people who are in the country illegally.</p><p>Deportations can be costly and time-intensive as U.S. officials often must detain migrants for a long period, coordinate travel documents and prepare chartered planes to many different countries. There are often issues as well involving migrants from countries that do no accept their nationals or make the process so cumbersome that it takes even longer to remove people.</p></div></div>
