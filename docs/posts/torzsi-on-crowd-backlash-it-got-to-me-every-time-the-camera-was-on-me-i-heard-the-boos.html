                  <p>After <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/4494/mouz" data-tooltip-id="uid717148942">MOUZ</a> secured third place at PGL Cluj-Napoca with a 2-0 win over <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/6248/the-mongolz" data-tooltip-id="uid1827669076">The MongolZ</a>, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/18072/torzsi" data-tooltip-id="uid194074102">Ádám <span>&#34;⁠torzsi⁠&#34;</span> Torzsás</a> stopped by HLTV&#39;s microphone to talk about third-place deciders and the aftermath of his crowd-antagonizing antics.</p>
                  <p>His on-stage interview after eliminating <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/4608/natus-vincere" data-tooltip-id="uid1975977348">Natus Vincere</a>, in which he told the fans to &#34;fuck off&#34; after being booed, resulted in the fans favoring <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/12467/parivision" data-tooltip-id="uid383825927">PARIVISION</a> in their semi-final matchup the next day and booing <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/18072/torzsi" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid194074102">torzsi</a> louder than ever before any time the camera was on him.</p>
                  <p>In a self-reflective comment on the situation, the Hungarian admitted that the &#34;justifiable&#34; fan response affected him and took responsibility for putting his team &#34;not in the best position&#34; ahead of the semi-final, which <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/4494/mouz" data-tooltip-id="uid717148942">MOUZ</a> ended up losing 0-2.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>I didn&#39;t find the right words there and I was a little bit too harsh</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p>&#34;To be honest, it got to me. I knew every time the camera was on me, I heard the boos, and it was tough to focus,&#34; <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/18072/torzsi" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid194074102">torzsi</a> said.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I think [the response] was justifiable a little bit. Maybe I was not in the best headspace to go for that interview,&#34; he admitted. &#34;I didn&#39;t find the right words there and I was a little bit too harsh.&#34;</p>
                  <p>&#34;We are doing a lot of really good work and we are being really consistent, we&#39;re doing our best to show up in the games, and there is still a lot of criticism around us. Sometimes it&#39;s a lot and maybe I let it out not in the best moment,&#34; <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/18072/torzsi" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid194074102">torzsi</a> concluded.</p>
                  
                  <hr/>
                  <p><strong>Congratulations on third place. You&#39;ve played a fair few of these matches in the last couple of months and they&#39;ve become a bit of a topic again. What did you think about these matches? Do they bring something to the tournament?</strong></p>
                  <p>It&#39;s a good question. It definitely means a lot for the VRS points and also how much money you win, it all counts for VRS points. For the system, I think it is important. But it&#39;s still a question of how fired up the players can be for a game like this, you know? You just lost a game yesterday and you have a lot of thoughts in your head, and you have to reset again for a third-place decider. Personally, I think it&#39;s good, it&#39;s decent, but it&#39;s a tough question.</p>
                  <p><strong>What about this one? How seriously did you guys take it and how fired up were you for the game?</strong></p>
                  <p>I wouldn&#39;t say we came 100%, but I think we were pretty fired up to win because, as you said, this was our fourth third-place decider and we won one and lost two times. We were really not happy with how we performed in those games because we got crushed both times, 13-5, 13-7 I think in the last versus Spirit in Krakow.</p>
                  <p>We wanted to prove that even in games like this we can show up and play a good game and we wanted to leave the arena with a good game left. We felt like we were playing pretty good CS here, and I think the PARIVISION game was also pretty close, I would say. The only bad games we played here was versus [Vitality], which was really not good, but other than that I think we were showing good CS and we wanted to be consistent on it.</p>
                  <p><strong>After your interview after beating NAVI, it was pretty clear in the match against PARIVISION how the crowd responded. What did you think about that, playing the semi-final after that?</strong></p>
                  <p>I was expecting it a little bit. It distracted me, to be honest, on Dust2 especially I felt it a lot. It got to me, I will be honest, it got to me. Which is fine, I will learn from it. I think it was also justifiable a little bit. Maybe I was not in the best headspace to go for that interview, I would say, which I take responsibility for, of course. Maybe I made a mistake and maybe I put my team not in the best position for the crowd, to play the semi-finals.</p>
                  <p>To be honest, it got to me. It was annoying. Yes, it was annoying, I knew that every time the camera was on me I heard the boos, and it was tough to focus, to be honest. On Dust2, it was hard to focus. I had a really good start, but after that I was making some mistakes and it got in my head.</p>
                  
                  <p>I knew instantly after we lost that I really have to be prepared for today because it would be the same. Maybe it was not that bad as yesterday, but it was still the same case. I would say that maybe I didn&#39;t find the right words there and I was a little bit too harsh.</p>
                  <p>It is life. Sometimes we take a lot of criticism. I think we are doing a lot of really good work and we are being really consistent, we&#39;re doing our best to show up in the games, and there is still a lot of criticism around us. Sometimes it&#39;s a lot and, yeah, maybe I let it out not in the best moment.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>Looking back at the games, we are in really good situations and we just can&#39;t convert them</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>Can you tell me about the PARIVISION game in general? Your team spoke in the past about your issues on stage when it comes to the elite teams, but generally not the teams just below that level. What were the issues in that game?</strong></p>
                  <p>The Dust2 game was 13-11 and we consider PARIVISION as one of the best Dust2 teams next to Vitality, Falcons and Spirit. They are really, really good, and we know it is one of our weakest maps. I think we had really good situations on Dust2.</p>
                  <p>There is one round where we got a 4v4 on the CT side and I made a mistake on searching Short, but also another round where we were stacked B, they came B and we didn&#39;t kill them. I feel like we are just so close to be really good, and I know it sounds repetitive, but I think that&#39;s the case. Looking back at the games, we are in really good situations and we just can&#39;t convert them. Counter-Strike is also about killing the others, and I don&#39;t know, I feel like in that game we were just not shooting hard enough.</p>
                  <p><strong>You&#39;re attending EPL, unlike some of the other top teams who chose to skip it. What&#39;s your mindset like heading into the tournament?</strong></p>
                  <p>EPL is gonna be online. As far as I know, maybe we will have a bootcamp and play from there. I&#39;m not sure yet. I think that&#39;s the plan. Then we&#39;re gonna be on the road for a long time because then it&#39;s gonna be playoffs, Rotterdam and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s next...</p>
                  <p><strong>Rio, I think.</strong></p>
                  <p>Yeah. So it&#39;s gonna be a lot of travels, so now we will just rest a little bit and get ready for EPL. That&#39;s the plan.</p>
