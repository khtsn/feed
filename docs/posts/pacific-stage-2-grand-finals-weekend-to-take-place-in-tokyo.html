<em>The #VCTPacific Stage 2 Grand Finals Weekend will be held in Tokyo, Japan!</em></p>

<p>This will mark the first time that the Pacific region&#39;s finals weekend will be held outside of Korea. It will also be Tokyo&#39;s first VCT event since hosting <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1494/champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo" target="_blank">Masters Tokyo</a> in 2023. A specific venue for the matches has not been revealed.</p>

<p>The final weekend of league play typically consists of the lower finals and the grand final, as it was for the end of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1191/champions-tour-2023-pacific-league" target="_blank">Pacific League</a> in 2023 and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2005/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-2" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> in 2024.</p>

<p>The Pacific region&#39;s season begins in a few days at Pacific Kickoff, with matches from January 17 to February 9. Per Riot&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425094/riot-unveils-vct-2025-season-overview" target="_blank">preseason overview</a>, Stage 1 internationally will begin March 22 and end May 16, while Stage 2 begins July 12 and ends August 29.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> will take place in Seoul at the Sangam SOOP Colosseum. Venue information for Stage 1 and the earlier matches of Stage 2 has yet to be disclosed.</p>

			<p>W I really like this.</p>
<p>Shanghai, Seoul, LA and Berlin + 3 may seem like a lot on paper, but since 4 of those are fixed it leaves me with the feeling of wanting more cities (Personally, one of the coolest things about something like F1 is the fact that you get to see a ton of cities/countries, and it really gives an &#39;international&#39; feeling to the sport)</p>
<p>I hope it goes well, would love to see similar implemented in Americas and EMEA (I believe CN has already done something similar)</p>		</div>

		<p>cn &amp; apac productions are just on a different level. cn 2024 playoff gf looked like a fucking masters venue. and there was a whole ass opening ceremony for apac. i doubt emea or amer is gonna do anything more than some smoke and lights here and there. always optimistic tho</p>

		<p>Yeah, to be fair I only considered the logistical (specifically the visa) side of the argument, funding definitely has a big role in it too. The best we can do is stay optimistic as you said, but seeing something like this does give me a glimmer of hope </p>

		<p>If VCT Pacific can do this then what&#39;s stopping Riot from hosting VCT Americas or a part of VCT Americas in LATAM / BR?</p>

		<p>The visa system in East Asia is probably more efficient than the US, it took 4 months for a lot of SA teams to get visas for the US, imagine if they had to do that for a one-off final in lets say Vancouver, they might apply and pay the fees months in advance and not even make playoffs</p>

			<p>I kind of touched on this in #1, but it should be pretty reasonable if it&#39;s within the US right?</p>
<p>(ofc this doesn&#39;t address the whole latam/br thing, I just wanted to bring it up separately) </p>		</div>

		<p>Riot&#39;s guideline is to simply host Regional League Finals in the studio. Remember the Amer and EMEA finals. Holding them in stadiums is something that only happens in Asia (Riot Korea is the largest of Riot&#39;s branches, and in China, Tencent has full control of the tournament) where the organizers are more independent.</p>
