<em>The #VCTPacific Stage 2 Grand Finals Weekend will be held in Tokyo, Japan!</em></p>

<p>This will mark the first time that the Pacific region&#39;s finals weekend will be held outside of Korea. It will also be Tokyo&#39;s first VCT event since hosting <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1494/champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo" target="_blank">Masters Tokyo</a> in 2023. A specific venue for the matches has not been revealed.</p>

<p>The final weekend of league play typically consists of the lower finals and the grand final, as it was for the end of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1191/champions-tour-2023-pacific-league" target="_blank">Pacific League</a> in 2023 and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2005/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-2" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> in 2024.</p>

<p>The Pacific region&#39;s season begins in a few days at Pacific Kickoff, with matches from January 17 to February 9. Per Riot&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425094/riot-unveils-vct-2025-season-overview" target="_blank">preseason overview</a>, Stage 1 internationally will begin March 22 and end May 16, while Stage 2 begins July 12 and ends August 29.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> will take place in Seoul at the Sangam SOOP Colosseum. Venue information for Stage 1 and the earlier matches of Stage 2 has yet to be disclosed.</p>

			<p>W I really like this.</p>
<p>Shanghai, Seoul, LA and Berlin + 3 may seem like a lot on paper, but since 4 of those are fixed it leaves me with the feeling of wanting more cities (Personally, one of the coolest things about something like F1 is the fact that you get to see a ton of cities/countries, and it really gives an &#39;international&#39; feeling to the sport)</p>
<p>I hope it goes well, would love to see similar implemented in Americas and EMEA (I believe CN has already done something similar)</p>		</div>

		<p>If VCT Pacific can do this then what&#39;s stopping Riot from hosting VCT Americas or a part of VCT Americas in LATAM / BR?</p>
