It was not clear by how much flights could be reduced.</p><p>The comments came after an air traffic control facility that guides planes at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/business/newark-airport-radar-outage.html" title="">Newark had a brief radar outage on Friday</a>, after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/nyregion/newark-airport-delays-disruptions-issues.html" title="">similar 90-second outage at the end of last month</a>. Another air traffic equipment outage on Sunday morning <a href="https://x.com/FAANews/status/1921578482863104259" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">led to a ground stop</a> for about 45 minutes for flights arriving to Newark, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p>The<strong> </strong>problems have resulted in major delays and cancellations, led to safety concerns for travelers and emerged as a major challenge for the Trump administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>When asked whether it remained safe to fly out of Newark, Mr. Duffy maintained that “we are the safest airspace,” and added that he and his family regularly traveled through the airport.</p><p>Still, Mr. Duffy said that the country and Congress had not paid enough attention to improving the “antiquated systems” across major airports, and described the recent issues at Newark as a consequence of “stress on an old network.”</p><p>“What you see in Newark is going to happen in other places across the country,” Mr. Duffy said in the interview, on NBC’s “Meet the Press With Kristen Welker.” “It has to be fixed.”</p><p>He added, “I’m concerned about the whole airspace.”</p><p>The F.A.A. said in a <a href="https://x.com/FAANews/status/1921578482863104259" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement on social media</a> that the Sunday outage was the result of a “telecommunications issue” at a Philadelphia facility that guides aircraft in and out of Newark airspace.</p><p>The agency said that it “briefly slowed aircraft in and out of the airport while we ensured redundancies were working as designed,” and that operations had returned to normal by about 10:50 a.m.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The troubles at the nation’s airports have created significant havoc for travelers, stranding some far from their destinations. In Georgia, an equipment outage on Sunday led to a ground stop for more than an hour at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the area’s largest airport, <a href="https://www.fly.faa.gov/adv/adv_otherdis.jsp?advn=52&amp;adv_date=05112025&amp;facId=ATL&amp;title=ATCSCC%20ADVZY%20052%20ATL/ZTL%2005/11/2025%20CDM%20GROUND%20STOP&amp;titleDate=05/11/2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the F.A.A</a>.</p><p>After the brief outage at Newark in April, in which air traffic controllers were temporarily unable to communicate with pilots or see aircraft, there were thousands of cancellations and delays stretching more than five hours at Newark in the following days.</p><p>Mr. Duffy’s pitch to improve air travel includes investments in digitizing flight data management tools and upgrading the radio systems controllers use to communicate with pilots, though many details remain unclear, and his plan would require approval from Congress. He is also seeking to extend the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers under existing laws. The retirement age is 56 and can be extended to 61.</p><p>The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/musk-cuts.html" title="">cut about 400 probationary workers</a> from the F.A.A. in recent months, largely as a result of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-doge-federal-job-cuts.html" title="">Elon Musk’s large-scale reductions</a> at federal agencies.</p><p>When asked on Sunday whether Mr. Musk’s efforts had contributed to problems at Newark, Mr. Duffy denied that they had played a major role. He said that no air traffic controllers or safety-related positions had been eliminated, and that many laid-off workers had been brought back to the agency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The F.A.A. has attributed many of the problems at Newark to equipment failures and shortages of controllers and other staff members.</p><p>On Sunday morning, the F.A.A. warned travelers at Newark to <a href="https://www.fly.faa.gov/flyfaa/flyfaaindex.jsp?ARPT=EWR&amp;p=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brace for more misery</a> because of staffing issues: Some arriving flights were delayed by an average of two hours and 32 minutes.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Troy Closson is a Times education reporter focusing on K-12 schools.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>14</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Duffy Warns That Outages At Airports May Continue<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Legal Tool Key to Civil Rights Enforcement:</strong> President Trump has ordered federal agencies to halt their use of “disparate-impact liability,” which has been used to assess <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/trump-civil-rights.html">whether policies discriminate against different groups</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Librarian of Congress Is Fired:</strong> The White House said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/politics/trump-librarian-congress-carla-hayden.html">Carla Hayden</a>, the first African American and first woman to serve as the head of the institution, was fired because she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/hayden-library-of-congress-dei.html">promoted diversity, equity and inclusion</a>.
