He could not finish his homily, passing it to an aide and saying, “I have trouble breathing.”</p><p>Three days later, at his <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/it/events/event.dir.html/content/vaticanevents/it/2025/2/12/udienza-generale.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weekly Wednesday audience</a>, the ailing pope had an aide read his speech. But then he shook hands with dozens of prelates, many leaning over to whisper greetings, and took photos with Spanish faithful, Milanese military recruits and nuns from Mother Teresa’s order.</p><p>Two days after that, Francis was rushed to the hospital, with what doctors said was a complex medical condition that evolved into pneumonia in both his lungs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many who know him said in interviews that Francis, driven by a sense of mission and a discipline born of his early training, essentially worked himself into the hospital.</p><p>He is now bedridden after weeks of ceremonies and audiences — both private and public — that only intensified with the start in December of the 2025 Jubilee, a year of faith, penance and forgiveness of sins that takes place only every quarter century.</p><p>But the pope’s grueling schedule — which would exhaust anyone, let alone an 88-year-old with a series of health issues — is in keeping with Francis’ personality and with his vision of the papacy, say doctors, biographers and Vatican observers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Francis speaking with an aide during Mass at the Vatican on Feb. 9.

A year into his papacy, he told reporters that he thought he would be pope for two or three years, then “off to the house of the Father.”</p><p>That prediction was clearly wrong. Instead, he established a schedule — waking up before 5 and at his desk by 6 to tackle a full day of work — that Nelson Castro, the author of the book “The Health of Popes,” called “crazy.” Just last September, Francis took the longest and most complicated trip of his tenure: an 11-day, four-country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/asia/pope-francis-asia-trip.html" title="">tour in the Asia-Pacific region</a>.</p><p>“For Francis, it’s all or nothing,” said Austen Ivereigh, a Catholic commentator and papal biographer. In Francis’ view, it was “an essential dimension of the papacy” that people had constant access to him, and there was no time to be inaccessible for health reasons.</p><p>“His primary concern isn’t to extend his life, his primary concern is to exercise the papal ministry in the way that he believes it must be exercised, which is all in, 100 percent,” Mr. Ivereigh said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“He has a crazy agenda,” said another biographer, the Argentine journalist, Elisabetta Piqué. Alongside his official morning schedule, he has a parallel, equally full agenda for the afternoon. “He always says, I’ll have time to rest in the next world,” she said. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Francis keeps an extremely busy schedule, including international travel.

As a young man, he had the upper lobe of his right lung removed, and he has suffered bouts of influenza and bronchitis during the winter months.</p><p>“He’s so obstinate; he’s a testardo,” said Dr. Castro, using the Italian word for stubborn. And the pope has admitted to being “a very difficult patient,” he added.</p><p>The pope once told him that he liked to keep his distance from doctors, Dr. Castro said, “meaning that he wants to make the decisions” about what he can and cannot do.</p><p>Mr. Ivereigh said that Francis had admitted that one of his “big faults” was obstinacy. “He’s very strong willed and doesn’t readily listen to suggestions that he cut things back,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Musso pointed out that a few hours before he was taken to hospital, Francis held audiences with the prime minister of the Slovak Republic, the president of CNN and representatives of a charity that works in Puerto Rico. “He has an enormous capacity for work,” he said. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People praying near a statue of Pope John Paul II, outside of the Gemelli Hospital in Rome, where Pope Francis was admitted for treatment.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Remo Casilli/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The pope does not go away for summer vacations, Mr. Musso added. That habit, said Ms. Piqué, is a source of chagrin for many Vatican employees. His last real vacation was in 1975, Francis himself said in his autobiography “Hope.”</p><p>John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI summered at the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, though the former also opted for mountain stays in northern Italy.</p><p>Francesco Antonio Grana, a Vatican reporter for the Rome daily newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano, said it did not help that Francis surrounded himself with “yes men” who indulged the pope.</p><p>“This hospitalization could have been avoided” had someone put the brakes on the pope’s schedule, Mr. Grana said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“I prefer a live pope than a pope who died because he kept one more commitment on his agenda,” he added. “With Donald Trump in the White House, the world needs a live and combative pope.”</p><p>The same week that he went into the hospital, Francis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/europe/pope-trump-immigration-deportations.html" title="">wrote an open letter to bishops</a> in the United States criticizing President Trump’s policy of mass deportations of immigrants, and he has stood up to Mr. Trump on issues like climate change.</p><p>Francis’ workload was not only arduous but also brought him into contact with hundreds of people who could potentially transmit diseases, said Massimo Andreoni, professor emeritus of infectious diseases at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. “So perhaps he should be more careful when he has a cold or bronchitis and maybe slow down a little and look after himself a little more,” he added.</p><p>There are a few signs that the pope may be ready to slow down.</p><p>Francis was visited in the hospital on Wednesday by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy. Reporting on the meeting, the Milan daily newspaper Corriere della Sera wrote that Francis complained to the prime minister: “The doctors said I have to take some time off” and that “I have to be careful with my health, otherwise I go straight to heaven.”</p><p>At a news briefing on Friday, Francis’ doctors made clear they would keep him at the hospital as long as he needed treatment that he could only receive there, rather than bring him home to his residence in Casa Santa Marta.</p><p>“We think it’s prudent,” said Dr. Alfieri. “If we brought him to Santa Marta, he’d start working like before, we know this.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
