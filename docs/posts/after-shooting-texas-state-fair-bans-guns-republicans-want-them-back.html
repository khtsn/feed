The state attorney general, Ken Paxton, has threatened to sue the City of Dallas, which owns the fairgrounds, if the policy is not reversed.</p><p>The dispute cuts to the heart of what has been a difficult balance between state laws that increasingly allow people to carry guns in public and the need to protect large public events from devastating outbreaks of gun violence.</p><p>It also underscores a fundamental rift between those who support broader Second Amendment rights as a means of self-defense, and gun control advocates who argue that a greater number of guns in public increases the likelihood of deadly violence.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“While it may be that your new policy placates some, the result will make your patrons less safe,” <a href="https://x.com/Burrows4TX/status/1823078562196516966/photo/3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read a letter</a> signed by dozens of Republican members of the Texas Legislature and several Republican candidates who are on the ballot in November. “Gun-free zones are magnets for crime because they present less of a threat to those who seek to do evil.”</p><p>The state party’s <a href="https://texasgop.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-RPT-Platform.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">platform</a> calls for an end to “gun-free” zones across Texas.</p><p>Organizers of the state fair said that the decision was reached after careful consideration, “reviewing the policies of similar Texas events and consulting with all of our security partners.” In the organization’s statement, Karissa Condoianis, a spokeswoman, said that the fair continues to be “a strong supporter of the rights of responsible gun-owning Texans.”</p><p>Texas law allows business owners and nonprofit groups to prohibit people, even licensed gun owners, from entering private property with a weapon. Other large events in Texas, like major sports competitions and the Houston Rodeo, do not allow guns.</p><p>But the Texas State Fair occupies a certain symbolic place in the state, starting with its towering “Big Tex” statue of a cowboy who greets fairgoers. Big Tex is not visibly armed, though some have jokingly suggested that he may be carrying a derringer in his boot.</p></div></div><div><p>The debate over the fair’s gun policy united Republican lawmakers from rival factions of the party who have otherwise been openly warring with one another since the last legislative session. Those who signed the letter said they would take action during the next session, which starts in January, if the fair’s policy does not change.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The mayor of Dallas said he believed the city’s police department could provide adequate security at the fair. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elias Valverde/The Dallas Morning News, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick suggested that the fight could eventually end up in the courts, which would prolong the debate well past the start of the fair in late September; it runs through Oct. 20.</p><p>“If litigated, we trust our courts will uphold this sacred right,” Mr. Patrick <a href="https://x.com/LtGovTX/status/1824088515442889034" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>In previous years, the fair allowed Texans to carry a concealed weapon if they had a permit, but otherwise banned guns. That policy continued even after the Texas Legislature changed state law in 2021 to allow most adult Texans to carry a handgun without a permit.</p><p>The shooting last year rattled the city of Dallas and forced a temporary closure of the fair. According to court documents, a 22-year-old fairgoer was inside a food court on an October evening when he got into a dispute with several other men, pulled a gun and fired. He told officers that the shooting was in self-defense; he did not have a permit, <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/state-fair/dramatic-video-shows-chaos-inside-food-court-after-gunman-opened-fire-state-fair-of-texas/287-07ee6519-dfb5-41db-972b-ab04c829b9b7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">officials said at the time</a>.</p><p>The fair, which <a href="https://bigtex.com/the-2023-state-fair-of-texas-by-the-numbers/#:~:text=The%20State%20Fair%20of%20Texas,million%20fairgoers%20through%20the%20gates." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attracts millions of visitors</a>, is operated by a non-profit organization, not by the city. But because it takes place on fairgrounds that are owned by the City of Dallas, Mr. Paxton’s office said in its letter, the “implication” is that the city government is violating state law by barring concealed-carry permit holders from bringing guns onto the grounds.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Not all Republicans have opposed the new policy.</p><p>The mayor of Dallas, Eric Johnson, who was elected as a Democrat but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/22/us/eric-johnson-dallas-mayor-republican.html" title="">switched parties last year</a> — to great Republican fanfare — said in a statement that he believed the police could provide adequate security at the fair, implying that fairgoers did not need to arm themselves to be safe.</p><p>“I do not comment on pending litigation,” Mr. Johnson said. “But I will say that I have absolute confidence in the Dallas Police Department and in the organizers of the nonprofit State Fair of Texas to keep people safe.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>J.
