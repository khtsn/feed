It was about Clarksdale.</p><p>The film and its worldwide success have brought a burst of attention to the small city in the Mississippi Delta, known as the birthplace of the blues. Set there in the 1930s, it follows twin brothers — both played by Michael B. Jordan — and vampires who are lured by the music performed in their juke joint.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Clarksdale’s unexpected moment in the spotlight has galvanized a number of young Black residents, some of whom successfully lobbied the director, Ryan Coogler, to visit last week and screen “Sinners” at an auditorium. It has also gotten people there talking — not for the first time — about how to transform Clarksdale’s rich musical history into economic growth that will benefit those who live and work there.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hundreds of people came for the screenings of “Sinners.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The screenings drew not only locals, but people from hours away who were eager to see the movie and pay homage to its setting.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Coogler introduced screenings on the first day of a three-day program dissecting the film and Clarksdale’s history and brainstorming about its future.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I think it’s really important to understand our culture as our capital,” said Rebekah Pleasant-Patterson, the executive director of Griot Arts, a local nonprofit. “We can’t give it away.”</p><p>The skewed distribution of power and money in Mississippi, dating back to when the labor of enslaved Black people made white plantation owners tremendously wealthy, has not spared Clarksdale, once known as the “golden buckle of the Cotton Belt.” More than 80 percent of residents are Black, and about 40 percent live in poverty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The number of residents <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/clarksdalecitymississippi/PST045224" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dropped by about seven percent</a> between 2020 and 2024, to fewer than 14,000.</p><p>“It hurts my feelings to see Clarksdale in its current state as opposed to how it was when we grew up — this was a beautiful city,” said Shawnya Graves-Messenger, 54, whose husband, Mike, drives down each weekend from their home in Tennessee to open up Messenger’s Pool Hall and keep his grandfather’s business alive. When she saw “Sinners” and heard a character reference Messenger’s, she excitedly whispered to her son, “they’re talking about your granddaddy and your great-granddaddy’s business.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Murals dedicated to local blues history remain on buildings in downtown Clarksdale.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-15"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from left, Ground Zero Blues Club is co-owned by the actor Morgan Freeman; Blues memorabilia is in the storefront; J’s Grocery, a Black-owned store and a mural of the legendary bluesman Robert Johnson at The Crossroads.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Over the years, there have been efforts to structure a tourism industry around the blues musicians that Clarksdale nurtured. City leaders have revived annual festivals, programmed live blues performances every day of the year and highlighted the legacies of musicians like Muddy Waters, Ike Turner and others at the Delta Blues Museum.</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/la-xpm-2011-mar-25-la-na-mississippi-blues-20110325-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Red’s Blues Club</a> is still thriving, even after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/arts/music/red-paden-dead.html" title="">the death of its eponymous owner</a>. The actor Morgan Freeman, who grew up nearby, helped open another blues venue, Ground Zero, in 2001 and still visits.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Yet there has been an ongoing debate over who profits from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/26/arts/who-owns-the-blues.html" title="">music’s legacy</a>, especially since some of the tourism can gloss over the pain of a segregated South that helped lead to the blues. The music and lives of many famous blues musicians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/arts/music/buddy-guy-sinners-blues.html" title="">were shaped by</a> the hardships of sharecropping work in the Delta.</p><p>And as people have left for better opportunity elsewhere, Clarksdale has struggled to turn around. And the Trump administration’s steep budget cuts — some carried out already, some just proposed — have many there worried that things could become worse. After losing a few grants, the staff at Griot Arts is worried about what additional cuts could mean for the group’s $26 million plan to rebuild a dilapidated 107-year-old theater downtown.</p><p>Much of Clarksdale has an abandoned feel. Still, it is hard to hold a conversation on its sidewalks without someone honking hello or rushing up for a quick greeting. The town recently celebrated the <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/19/js-grocery-reopening-clarksdale/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reopening</a> of J’s Grocery, a Black-owned store which is making a point of selling fresh produce in what had been a food desert.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Legend says Mr. Johnson sold his soul to the devil at The Crossroads.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rev.

Tyler Yarbrough, a community organizer who helped with the grocery store reopening, started <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/open-letter-to-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-and-the-cast-and-crew-of-sinners-to-visit-clarksdale?source=direct_link" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an open letter</a> urging Mr. Coogler to screen the film in Clarksdale. The closest movie theater is more than an hour away.</p><p>“Sinners” was shot in Louisiana — in part, Mr. Coogler has said, because Mississippi could not offer as many incentives and infrastructure for filming. By coming to Clarksdale, Mr. Yarbrough wrote, the director could “experience firsthand the living, breathing legacy that inspired your work and the people who are sustaining and reimagining its future.”</p><p>Mr. Coogler and Warner Brothers, which made “Sinners,” heeded the call. Within weeks, a series of screenings had been scheduled, part of a three-day program dissecting the film and Clarksdale’s history and brainstorming about its future.</p><p>In some ways, it was enough for residents to gather and talk about the obstacles and the possibilities, feeding off the excitement that the film generated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“It was important for ourselves to see that we could get it done,” Mr. Yarbrough said in an interview, growing emotional as he spoke about the chance to introduce Mr. Coogler to the community. And it was important for Clarksdale, he added, to see “that young people are ready to drive this next era of blues economy, tourism and creativity.”</p><p>The vampires did not appeal to everyone who showed up for the screenings. But the movie made residents and visitors alike curious about life a century ago in Clarksdale’s New World District, which was home to Black and immigrant businesses. It also prompted discussions about the Chinese immigrants and Choctaw tribal members who once lived on the same land and are featured in the movie.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I think it’s really important to understand our culture as our capital,” said Rebekah Pleasant-Patterson, the executive director of Griot Arts, a local nonprofit. “We can’t give it away.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-27"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Paramount marquee remains inside the abandoned movie theater.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A staircase for only African Americans to use during segregation remains on the side of the abandoned Paramount movie theater.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“I would not have gone to see this movie based on the trailers that came out,” Gilroy Chow, a longtime <a href="https://www.cityofclarksdale.org/leaders/chow/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clarksdale</a> resident, told a crowd on Friday. “Once I saw the movie — because I had heard there was talk about the different cultural aspects of Mississippi — I was blown away.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The success of the younger community members who brought the movie to Clarksdale is making many residents hopeful.</p><p>“It feels like I’m part of a team, part of some upward mobility,” said Jermeria Skillom, 26, who helped organize the screenings and related programming. Referring to the region’s Black population, she added, “The first wave was coming out of slavery into sharecropping, the second wave was coming out of sharecropping, and the third wave is a generation of people being proud of it — genuinely proud of being from Mississippi and trying to switch the stereotype and the stigma.”</p><p>“I’m not just living here because I’m from here,” she added. “There’s a purpose.”</p><p>Mr. Coogler, who introduced the film on Thursday along with its breakout star, Miles Caton, and its top producers, said that in writing it, he drew in part from his uncle’s stories about growing up in Mississippi and <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/podcast/sinners-ryan-coogler-inspiration-explained-1235115400/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his love of blues music</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Yarbrough said it was important for Clarksdale to see “that young people are ready to drive this next era of blues, economy, tourism and creativity.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rory Doyle for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The success of the younger community members who brought the movie to Clarksdale is making many residents hopeful.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>He said that he had never visited the state before making “Sinners,” but his research — and his visits — affirmed that Clarksdale was the right place to base a story about Black life in the Jim Crow South, with a heavy supernatural element. (According to legend, it was in Clarksdale that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/obituaries/robert-johnson-overlooked.html" title="">the bluesman Robert Johnson</a> sold his soul to the devil in exchange for extraordinary guitar talent.)</p><p>“It really changed me, just to come here,” Mr. Coogler told Aallyah Wright, a reporter for the nonprofit news outlet Capital B and a Clarksdale native, <a href="https://capitalbnews.org/clarksdale-ryan-coogler-sinners-screening/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who first wrote about the push for the screening</a>.</p><p>Hundreds of people poured into the six screenings, snacking on flavored popcorn and drinking cocktails made with liquor distilled on a Delta sweet potato farm. When “Clarksdale, Miss., Oct. 16, 1932” flashed on the screen as the movie opened, the room roared.</p><p>The screenings drew not only locals, but people from hours away who were eager to see “Sinners” one more time and pay homage to its setting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Among them was Valerie Arnold, 36, who grew up in the small town of Crossett, Ark. It was similar, she said, to Clarksdale.</p><p>“One thing that has really hurt our community as a whole is that people love to enjoy our things, but don’t pour back in,” Ms. Arnold said. “If you’re going to be inspired and you’re going to use the stories, you need to support the town, too.”</p><p>Tasha Lewis heard about the movie after her husband, Christopher, returned home enthusiastic about the accurate depiction of Clarksdale. (He first went primarily for the vampires.)</p><p>She emerged dazzled from the screening on Thursday.</p><p>“It kind of fills me up,” Ms. Lewis said. “It makes me so proud to say I am from Clarksdale, Mississippi.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the Country</h2><h3>We’re exploring how America defines itself one place at a time.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Bentonville, Ark.: </strong>Buoyed by the interests of the family behind Walmart, Bentonville has become an unexpected hub for cycling with dozens of immaculately kept trails for every level.</p></li><li><p><strong>Myrtle Beach, S.C.: </strong>Canadians have long flocked to this South Carolina beach town.
