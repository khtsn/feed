Officials said no injuries were reported.<span>  </span></p><p>“We’ve handled maybe 20, 25 rescues at this point,” Jonathan Dayton of Potomac Fire Company No. 2, the volunteer fire department of Westernport that moved the students to higher ground, said after 5 p.m. “There’s been incidents all day long.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Dayton added that most of the 911 calls the department handled were for people trapped in their homes. Several hundred residents who live in the downtown area of Westernport, a town of about 1,800 residents, were also asked to evacuate.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/13/multimedia/13wea-floodssoutheastmidatlantic-gljf/13wea-floodssoutheastmidatlantic-gljf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/13/multimedia/13wea-floodssoutheastmidatlantic-gljf/13wea-floodssoutheastmidatlantic-gljf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/13/multimedia/13wea-floodssoutheastmidatlantic-gljf/13wea-floodssoutheastmidatlantic-gljf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Boats transport students wearing life vests across a flooded street.

David Roth, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center, said the state has been particularly at risk since Hurricane Helene.</p><p>“Helene just made everything worse,” he said. “There were some landslides in western North Carolina from it. It takes a while to recover from a tropical cyclone. So their ground is more sensitive.”</p><p>Mr. Roth said North Carolina’s complex terrain was another factor of concern.</p><p>“They have a lot of up and down variation,” he said. “Even without Helene, almost every time it rains moderately, to have the mountains, basically you get these small waterfalls.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Weather Prediction Center also noted that the hills and mountains stretching from southern Pennsylvania through Virginia could receive additional rainfall because of the way the air is being pushed up the slopes. Recent rainfall has saturated the ground in this region, further elevating the risk of flash flooding.</p><p>The storm has brought repeated rounds of heavy rain to the Southeast since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/weather/southeast-storms-floods-rain.html" title="">last week</a>. Its slow-moving nature and a continuous feed of moisture from the Gulf and Atlantic are the main risk factors for flash floods.</p><p>Forecasters have called this an atmospheric river, a term more commonly associated with the steady streams of moisture that soak the West Coast but that also describes patterns <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/weather/atmospheric-rivers-midwest-california.html" title="">responsible for rain in the East</a>.</p><p>The system is expected to reach the Great Lakes by Wednesday, when thunderstorms will most likely become more scattered and less intense. However, a lower-level risk for flash flooding, 1 out of 4, was expected across parts of the Carolinas and into southern Pennsylvania until Thursday morning.</p><p>Judson Jones<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nazaneen Ghaffar is a Times reporter on the Weather team.</p></div><div><p>Simon J.
