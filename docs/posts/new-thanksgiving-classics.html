In his latest book, he reimagines “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” through the eyes of Jim, the enslaved runaway who accompanies Huck on his escapades but remains slightly out of the spotlight in Twain’s tale. Here, James not only has a formal name, he has depth, gumption and — perhaps the ultimate key to freedom — an education. It’s the rare author who can breathe new life into a classic, but Everett pulls off the feat, earning “James” a spot in the modern literary canon and elevating his protagonist from trusty sidekick to star.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>End-of-year lists are coming soon.

We spoke about her four years training to be a K-pop idol, about the genre’s intense fans and about her album, which was made away from the system that turned her into a global phenomenon.</em></p><p><strong>One of the things that is unique about K-pop is that the fan culture is so specific and so enormous. Can you tell me a little bit about that relationship? How authentic did you feel you could be? How authentic did you want to be?</strong></p><p>We were trained to always present ourselves in the most perfect, <em>perfect </em>way. And so even when we were interacting with fans online, it was when I was ready to give perfect answers and give them what they wanted — and making sure that I’m a perfect girl for everyone. That was the culture. And that’s why leading into this album, it was more of a personal want and need to be able to write an album like an album that I grew up with, music that I could relate to. In order for that, I’m sure artists had to be vulnerable, but we hadn’t trained to talk about our emotions and feelings and experiences.</p><p><strong>When you had to sit down with yourself and write this album, what was that like to have to dig deep?</strong></p><p>To be honest, that was like breathing. All the stories in there are stories that anyone around me has heard more than 20 times. It was about time I wrote it in a song. I had moments where I was like, Wait, can we say this? Wait, maybe we shouldn’t put that word in there. Maybe this is too much. Should we not?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p><strong>The themes are heartache, lost love, anger sometimes — the range of human emotions.</strong></p><p>Yeah, romance. But even that — it’s scary for me. I could see the faces of the producers and songwriters, they were like, So interesting, Rosie! Why are you so nervous about this? And I’m like, You guys, you don’t know.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/magazine/rose-blackpink-kpop.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id="link-640bc3b8"><span><strong>THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Montgomery for The New York Times.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p><strong>Click the cover image above to read this week’s magazine.</strong></p><h3 id="link-7fc2b962"><span><strong>THE MORNING RECOMMENDS …</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Wicked,” left, and “Gladiator II,” right. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures; Aidan Monaghan, via Paramount Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Leonhardt runs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/us-morning-briefing">The Morning</a>, The Times’s flagship daily newsletter.
