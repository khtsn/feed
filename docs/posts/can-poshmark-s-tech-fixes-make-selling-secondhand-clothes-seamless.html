    <h1>Can Poshmark’s Tech Fixes Make Selling Secondhand Clothes Seamless?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lauren Eager got into thrifting in high school. It was a way to find cheap, interesting clothes while not contributing to the wastefulness of fast fashion.</p><p>In 2015, in her first year of college, she downloaded the app for Poshmark, a kind of Instagram-meets-eBay resale platform. Soon, she was selling as well as buying clothes.</p><p>This was the golden age of online reselling. In addition to Poshmark, companies like ThredUp and Depop had sprung up, giving a second life to old clothes. In 2016, Facebook debuted Marketplace. Even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/business/goodwill-goodwillfinds-ecommerce.html" title="">Goodwill</a> got into the action, starting a snazzy website.</p><p>The platforms tapped into two consumer trends: buying stuff online and the never-gets-old delight of snagging a gently used item for a fraction of the original cost. During the Covid-19 pandemic, as people cleaned out their closets, enthusiasm for reselling intensified. It was so strong that Poshmark decided to go public. On the day of its initial public offering in January 2021, the company’s market value peaked at $7.4 billion, roughly the same as PVH’s, the company that owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, at the time.</p></div></div>
