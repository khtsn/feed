It was a way to find cheap, interesting clothes while not contributing to the wastefulness of fast fashion.</p><p>In 2015, in her first year of college, she downloaded the app for Poshmark, a kind of Instagram-meets-eBay resale platform. Soon, she was selling as well as buying clothes.</p><p>This was the golden age of online reselling. In addition to Poshmark, companies like ThredUp and Depop had sprung up, giving a second life to old clothes. In 2016, Facebook debuted Marketplace. Even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/business/goodwill-goodwillfinds-ecommerce.html" title="">Goodwill</a> got into the action, starting a snazzy website.</p><p>The platforms tapped into two consumer trends: buying stuff online and the never-gets-old delight of snagging a gently used item for a fraction of the original cost. During the Covid-19 pandemic, as people cleaned out their closets, enthusiasm for reselling intensified. It was so strong that Poshmark decided to go public. On the day of its initial public offering in January 2021, the company’s market value peaked at $7.4 billion, roughly the same as PVH’s, the company that owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, at the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Then, the business of old clothes started to fray.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On the day of its initial public offering in January 2021, the company’s market value peaked at $7.4 billion. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan McDermid/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Using the Poshmark app, Ms. Eager and others said, started to feel like trying to find something in a messy closet. The app was cluttered with features that did not work or that she did not use, and it felt “spammy,” she said, sending too many push notifications.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
