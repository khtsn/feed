In March, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan sentenced Mr. Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison.</p><p>In the 102-page appeal, a lawyer for Mr. Bankman-Fried called for a new trial, pointing to several rulings by Judge Kaplan that limited the FTX founder’s ability to introduce evidence and hampered his defense.</p><p>“Sam Bankman-Fried was never presumed innocent,” wrote the lawyer, Alexandra A.E. Shapiro. “He was presumed guilty by the judge who presided over his trial.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A spokesman for Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, said the office had no plans to comment on the filing.</p><p>An appeal of a federal conviction is always a long shot. Mr. Bankman-Fried, 32, has maintained he is innocent from the moment prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/business/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-bahamas.html" title="">charged him with fraud</a> shortly after FTX collapsed in November 2022. He has been serving his sentence at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he has been held since shortly before his trial.</p><p>Just two years ago, Mr. Bankman-Fried was a billionaire crypto icon, his face plastered on billboards and magazine covers. But a run on deposits at FTX exposed an $8 billion hole in its accounts, causing the company to implode and prompting a criminal investigation.</p><p>Three of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s top advisers at FTX pleaded guilty to fraud and testified against him at trial. The first of those cooperators, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html" title="">Caroline Ellison</a>, who was Mr. Bankman-Fried’s on-and-off girlfriend, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 24.</p><p>In the appeal, Ms. Shapiro criticized a ruling by Judge Kaplan that prevented Mr. Bankman-Fried from arguing in court that FTX’s users had not actually lost money, because they are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/business/ftx-bankruptcy-recovery.html" title="">poised to recover funds</a> in the bankruptcy process.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The government thus presented a false narrative that FTX’s customers, lenders, and investors had permanently lost their money,” the filing said. “The jury was only allowed to see half the picture.”</p><p>The filing also argued that Judge Kaplan had improperly prevented Mr. Bankman-Fried from testifying that he relied on legal advice to make some of the business decisions that prosecutors attacked at the trial. Mr. Bankman-Fried spent several days on the witness stand, in a risky bid to win the jury’s sympathy.</p><p>Ms. Shapiro took issue with an order Judge Kaplan made during the trial that required Mr. Bankman-Fried <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/10/26/business/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-trial" title="">to sit for “a pre-testimony deposition”</a> outside the presence of the jury, before he took the stand. The judge said the hearing was necessary to decide how much Mr. Bankman-Fried could tell the jury about his discussions with FTX’s lawyers.</p><p>Ms. Shapiro argued that the preview of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s testimony was an “unprecedented proceeding” that “permitted a prosecutor to conduct cross-examination going way beyond the supposed purpose of this preview hearing.”</p><p>A new trial should be conducted before a different judge, the filing said.</p><p>“The judge repeatedly made biting comments undermining the defense,” Ms. Shapiro wrote. “Even deriding the defendant’s own testimony during the preview hearing and in front of the jury.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried’s lawyer also objected to the role of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, which served as FTX’s outside legal counsel and later became its main bankruptcy lawyer. She argued the law firm wrongfully pushed him to resign as FTX’s chief executive and became a de facto arm of the government by providing information to federal prosecutors.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Yaffe-Bellany writes about the crypto industry from San Francisco.
