data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Chrystia Freeland, the deputy prime minister who led Canada’s response to the first Trump administration, resigned abruptly on Monday from the cabinet in a stinging rebuke to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, marking the first open dissent from any cabinet member and raising questions about his hold on power.</p><p>The revelation, in a letter of resignation, came hours before Ms. Freeland, who had been the finance minister, was scheduled to outline the government’s commitments to improve border security with the United States as part of an interim budget.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet, which was meeting in Ottawa soon after the letter was made public, seemed stunned by the development.</p><p>“Chrystia Freeland is a good friend, someone I work with very, very closely,” Anita Anand, the transport minister told reporters in Ottawa. “This news has hit me really hard.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trudeau’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comments.</p><p>On Monday, another senior cabinet member and rising star within Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal Party, Sean Fraser, the housing minister, announced he would resign, compounding the sense that the prime minister’s lieutenants were abandoning him.</p><p>Ms. Freeland’s high-profile departure comes at a treacherous moment for Canada: President-elect Donald J. Trump has warned that he will impose 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico unless the two countries do more to curb the flow of undocumented migrants and drugs into the United States.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau needs to call an election by October, and his party is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/europe/trudeau-confidence-vote-canada.html" title="">deeply unpopular</a>, according to polls, badly trailing the Conservative Party, which is led by Pierre Poilievre.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau’s poor standing and the prospect of a federal election have given rise to speculation about a leadership contest to replace him as leader of the Liberal Party. Ms. Freeland is considered a likely contestant, alongside other senior cabinet members such as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/canada/melanie-joly-foreign-affairs-profile.html" title="">foreign minister, Mélanie Joly</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>While some Liberal members of Parliament who are not in the cabinet have called for Mr. Trudeau to step down as leader, until Monday his ministers had been publicly, and strongly, supportive of the prime minister.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau arrives on Parliament Hill on Monday in Ottawa, Canada.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Chan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trudeau has repeatedly vowed to lead the Liberal Party in the next election. There is no formal mechanism to remove him as the leader of the Liberal Party and, therefore, as prime minister.</p><p>Technically, calling an election before October is solely Mr. Trudeau’s prerogative, but his grip on power could become quickly untenable should more cabinet ministers follow Ms. Freeland and Mr. Fraser out of the door.</p><p>In the past, cabinet resignations doomed other Liberal prime ministers.</p><p>The economic statement Ms. Freeland was scheduled to deliver on Monday would need to be approved by a parliamentary vote in a process that is likely to begin when Parliament returns from the holiday recess in late January.</p><p>But hours after Ms. Freeland’s resignation, it was not clear whether the economic statement would even be unveiled on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Like all budget measures, if it was rejected by Parliament, the government would fall immediately and the country would be thrust into an election. Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals do not hold a majority of votes in the House of Commons and rely on alliances with opposition parties to pass laws.</p><p>To insiders, it was clear that Ms. Freeland and Mr. Trudeau had not been seeing eye to eye. Mr. Trudeau did not include Ms. Freeland when he visited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/world/canada/trudeau-trump-mar-a-lago-tariffs.html" title="">Mar-a-Lago</a> to see Mr. Trump in person last month.</p><p>In her resignation letter, Ms. Freeland indicated that Mr. Trudeau tried to force her out of the position on Friday. Ms. Freeland had been playing a prominent role in formulating Canada’s response to the incoming Trump administration, leading a team of government officials preparing for the transition to a new president.</p><p>Two people familiar with the events said that during a Zoom meeting on Friday Mr. Trudeau asked Ms. Freeland to continue leading the government’s response to Mr. Trump, but to step down as finance minister.</p><p>Ms. Freeland reacted to Mr. Trudeau’s suggestion by saying that she would not be able to credibly lead the transition efforts without commanding the Finance Ministry, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss the private meeting publicly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>By all accounts, Ms. Freeland was the most experienced cabinet member in Mr. Trudeau’s government to deal with Mr. Trump. She had successfully renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement with the first Trump White House.</p><p>“For the last number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,” Ms. Freeland wrote to the prime minister.</p><p>She also described Mr. Trump’s threatened tariffs as “a grave challenge.”</p><p>“How we deal with the threat our country currently faces will define us for a generation, and perhaps longer,” Ms. Freeland said.</p><p>Ms. Freeland is married to a New York Times reporter who works for the Culture desk.</p><p>Recent spending decisions by Mr. Trudeau apparently made to increase the Liberal Party’s popularity, including a sales tax holiday and sending checks to taxpayers, Ms. Freeland said, would undermine Canada’s economic ability to deal with Mr. Trump’s threat.</p><p>Vjosa Isai<!-- --> contributed reporting from Toronto.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ian Austen reports on Canada for The Times based in Ottawa.
