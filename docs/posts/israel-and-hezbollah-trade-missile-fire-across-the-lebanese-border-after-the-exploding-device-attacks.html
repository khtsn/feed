Such security measures failed in extraordinary fashion this week when pagers used by Hezbollah members exploded en masse on Tuesday and walkie-talkies detonated on Wednesday in sophisticated attacks widely attributed to Israel.</p><p>Israeli officials did not take responsibility for the attacks, but they suggested at the same time that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/19/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas#israel-war-focus-hezbollah-lebanon" title="">their focus was shifting</a> from the war against Hamas in Gaza to the fight against its ally, Hezbollah, after months of tit-for-tat strikes across the Israel-Lebanon border that have forced more than 150,000 people in the two countries to flee their homes.</p><p>With Hezbollah vowing to continue its strikes until Israel ends its war in Gaza, Israeli leaders have faced mounting pressure to launch a wider offensive against the group. Analysts have argued that neither Israel nor Hezbollah wants a major escalation, which would likely devastate both countries, but that tensions are running so high that either side could set one off.</p><p>Here is what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Second wave:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/19/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas#hezbollah-israel-walkie-talkie-explosives" title="">A second round of deadly blasts</a> rocked Lebanon on Wednesday when walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members blew up, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/19/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas/726b8bda-2634-5b08-9d92-432267f4541c?smid=url-share" title="">killing at least 20 people</a> and wounding more than 400.

Others unplugged the inverters and solar systems powering their homes. Many kept their cellphones away from them and refused to answer calls. Baby monitors, televisions, laptops — residents of Lebanon viewed them all with suspicion. Could they be the next devices to unexpectedly explode?</p><div><p>After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/lebanon-explosions-radios.html" title="">two consecutive days of attacks</a> — in which hand-held communication devices detonated across Lebanon, killing dozens and injuring thousands — the tiny Mediterranean nation was rattled. The explosions were an apparent attack by Israel on members of Hezbollah, the powerful <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/what-is-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">Lebanese militant group</a>. But that did not stop others from fearing for their lives.</p><p>“Maybe tomorrow lighters will explode, too,” said Hussein Awada, 54, who works as a private driver. “If you want to light a cigarette, it will just explode in your hand.”</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Awada witnessed the second wave of attacks on Hezbollah, when<span>  </span>walkie-talkies owned by the group’s members exploded, a day after thousands of Hezbollah pagers blew up. He had watched as a man had his hand blown off by the two-way radio he was holding.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A walkie-talkie at a shop in Lebanon that has had its battery removed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aziz Taher/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The blasts were part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html" title="">an elaborate Israeli operation to infiltrate Hezbollah’s</a> supply chain, according to officials briefed on the attack, though Israel has neither confirmed nor denied any role in the explosions. On Thursday, Lebanon’s civil aviation authority banned pagers and walkie-talkies from all flights leaving Beirut’s airport.</p><p>The attacks have further ratcheted up fears of a major <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-impact.html" title="">war between Israel and Hezbollah</a>, which have exchanged thousands of missiles and rockets since the war in Gaza began in October.</p><p>To Mr. Awada, the clandestine work that went into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html" title="">booby-trapping Hezbollah’s devices</a> and the apparently seamless coordination of the attack were like a work of fiction.</p><p>“I saw stuff today that you can only see in movies,” he said.</p><p>At least 32 people have died in the attacks, a significant number of which Hezbollah confirmed as members, although children and health workers were among the dead. More than 3,000 other people were confirmed to have been wounded in the attacks since Tuesday afternoon, many maimed with hand or face injuries.</p><p>Hezbollah is Lebanon’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/middleeast/hezbollah-lebanon-israel.html" title="">dominant military and political force</a> and is designated a terrorist group by Israel and the United States. But for many Lebanese, it is an organization with deep roots in society, providing a roster of social services and welfare programs across the country in the place of the ailing state.</p><p>Everyone, it seems, had some connection to the dead and wounded.</p><p>“In Dahieh, it’s hard to find anyone who doesn’t know someone who was affected,” said Mortada Smaoui, 30, a local business owner, using the Arabic name for Beirut’s Hezbollah-dominated southern suburbs. “Either it’s your friend, or a relative or a friend of friend, so you can clearly feel the sorrow and the anger.”</p><p>After the first attack on Tuesday, Mr. Smaoui rushed to the nearest hospital, heeding calls for volunteers to donate blood. There he witnessed the chaos firsthand: bodies being carried away in blood-soaked sheets, family members frantically searching for their loved ones and the wails of injured victims who were being turned away because of a lack of beds.</p><p>Still, Mr. Smaoui said after the first attack that it had shown Lebanon at its best, with citizens from across the country’s sectarian patchwork coming together to clear roads and give blood, so much so that hospitals had to turn away prospective donors.</p><p>“I felt unity,” he said.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People gathered outside American University of Beirut Medical Center in Beirut on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohamed Azakir/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>That sentiment was shattered on Wednesday when he was once again confronted by the carnage.</p><p>“There are buildings burning right now in front of me,” Mr. Smaoui said in the minutes after the second round of explosions, staring up at an apartment block engulfed in flames.</p><p>Dr. Salah Zeineddine, the chief medical officer at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, said the attacks were “beyond any catastrophe” he had dealt with before. Nearly 200 patients were rushed into the hospital in just three hours on Tuesday after the first wave of explosions, quickly swamping it.</p><p>“There have been so many catastrophes and mass casualties in Lebanon, but this was the first time we have seen so many casualties in such a short period of time,” Dr. Zeineddine said.</p><p>The wounded were still being tended to on Wednesday when the second round of blasts struck.</p><p>“People in the streets were screaming,” Adnan Berro, 61, said. “It was chaos. There was so much blood — on their hands, their faces, everywhere.”</p><p>“I have never seen anything like it,” he said.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzkzOTBhMGQ4LWNjZTMtNTBjNi04NmU1LTMwMDkzMTNkZDE5Mw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/19/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas#israel-and-hezbollah-trade-missile-fire-across-the-lebanese-border-after-the-exploding-device-attacks" data-source-id="100000009705556"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg"><img alt="Matthew Mpoke Bigg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/01/reader-center/author-matthew-bigg/author-matthew-bigg-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/01/reader-center/author-matthew-bigg/author-matthew-bigg-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/01/reader-center/author-matthew-bigg/author-matthew-bigg-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-19T10:07:54.596Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 19, 2024, 6:07 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rockets fired from southern Lebanon are intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system over the Upper Galilee region in northern Israel on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jalaa Marey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Israel and the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah traded cross-border attacks overnight, continuing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/18/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas" title="">a pattern of strikes</a> after two extraordinary days in which hand-held devices belonging to Hezbollah members exploded, killing over 30 and wounding thousands of others.</p><p>Two anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon toward the Upper Galilee region of Israel injured eight people, six lightly and two more seriously, according to Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster.

Both militant groups are supported by Iran and want to eliminate the state of Israel.</p><p>The daily exchange of fire between Hezbollah and Israel has been destructive, disruptive and sometimes deadly for Israelis and Lebanese living along the border, and it has raised concerns among world leaders that a wider regional war could break out and draw in Iran.</p><p>For months, international diplomats have been working to avert that outcome. There was, until recently, hope that a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas to end the fighting in Gaza in exchange for the release of dozens of hostages kidnapped from Israel would also resolve the conflict with Hezbollah. But the cease-fire talks have stalled, and tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been steadily mounting in recent months.</p><p>In July, Israeli forces struck a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, and assassinated a top Hezbollah commmander, Fuad Shukr. The Israeli military said Mr. Shukr’s killing was in response to a rocket attack on the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights that killed a dozen children in Majdal Shams, a Druze Arab village, though Hezbollah did not claim responsibility for that strike. Hezbollah vowed to avenge Mr. Shukr’s death, and in late August it launched about 300 rockets into Israel, claiming that it struck an Israeli military target.</p><p>Military experts have noted that so far Israel and Hezbollah have exercised relative restraint. But there are fears that the conflict may escalate if a diplomatic resolution does not come soon. Israeli officials on Wednesday appeared to be signaling that such an escalation was fast approaching.</p><p>The Israeli military’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, on Wednesday reviewed contingency plans for a possible conflict with Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border, according to a military statement.</p><p>“We are very determined to create the security conditions that will return the residents to their homes, to the communities, with a high level of security, and we are ready to do all that is required to bring about these things,” General Halevi said, adding that “at each stage, the price for Hezbollah must be high.”</p><p>Still, Israeli leaders are bracing for a difficult fight. In his address on Wednesday, Mr. Gallant said that Hezbollah would be a more challenging opponent than Hamas had been in Gaza. “It’s not Hamas,” he said. “This is something else, and we need to prepare for this accordingly and take it into account.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE0Nzc2MTk3LWU2ZTQtNTQ2YS05ZWY0LTIzNDFhYmEzYjAwZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/19/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas#hezbollah-israel-walkie-talkie-explosives" data-source-id="100000009704243"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christiaan-triebert"><img alt="Christiaan Triebert" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/29/reader-center/author-christiaan-triebert/author-christiaan-triebert-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/29/reader-center/author-christiaan-triebert/author-christiaan-triebert-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/29/reader-center/author-christiaan-triebert/author-christiaan-triebert-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aric-toler"><img alt="Aric Toler" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/18/reader-center/author-aric-toler/author-aric-toler-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/18/reader-center/author-aric-toler/author-aric-toler-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/18/reader-center/author-aric-toler/author-aric-toler-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-18T19:56:26.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 18, 2024, 3:56 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The two-way radios that exploded in Lebanon on Wednesday were larger and heavier than the pagers that blew up across the country on Tuesday, and in some cases set off larger fires, according to a New York Times analysis of the available visual evidence.</p><p>The devices, seen in photos and a video of the aftermath of Wednesday’s attacks, were nearly three times heavier than the pagers, and while the blasts on Wednesday were not as widespread as the earlier ones, they set off more large fires, suggesting that they might have contained more explosives.</p><div><p>The Lebanese health ministry said that at least 20 people had been killed and more than 450 wounded.

These included the poisoning of a nuclear scientist in 2007 and the killing of another in 2010 by a remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle. </p><p>Between 2010 and 2012, four people with links to Iran’s nuclear program were killed by hit men riding motorcycles. In one case, in 2010, an assassin attached a sticky bomb to a car door. In others, gunmen approached vehicles in the Iranian capital, Tehran, and fired through the window before speeding off. </p><p>In November 2020, Iran’s top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was killed by gunshots fired from a truck-mounted machine gun that had been attached to a remote-controlled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-fakhrizadeh-assassination-israel.html" title="">robotic apparatus</a>. Experts said the operation had taken months, and likely years, of planning. </p><h3 id="link-28917cd4"><span><strong>Cyber warfare and nuclear secrets</strong></span></h3><p>Starting in 2006, U.S. military and Israeli intelligence officials began a <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/how-a-secret-cyberwar-program-worked.html?hp" title="">top-secret cyberwar program</a> against Iran’s nuclear enrichment program.</p><p>Israel’s Dimona complex, the heart of its never-acknowledged nuclear arms program in the Negev desert, was used as a testing ground for the Stuxnet computer worm. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html" title="">destructive program</a> was eventually credited with wiping out roughly a fifth of Iran’s nuclear centrifuges, which Tehran needs to produce a nuclear weapon.</p><p>In 2018, Israeli spies armed with torches broke into a warehouse in Tehran and seized a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/15/us/politics/iran-israel-mossad-nuclear.html" title="">trove of documents</a> about Iran’s nuclear program. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel later used the documents to accuse Iran of lying for years about its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/world/middleeast/israel-iran-nuclear-netanyahu.html" title="">efforts to build</a> a nuclear weapon.</p><h3 id="link-ede9f92"><span><strong>After Oct. 7</strong></span></h3><p>Since the Hamas-led attack on Israel last Oct. 7, Israel has conducted a series of assassinations of commanders of Iran’s regional proxy forces, including Hamas and Hezbollah.</p><p>These attacks have come at the same time as Israel’s wide-scale military offensive in Gaza, which health officials there say have killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. The United Nations, human rights groups and some governments have accused Israel of using disproportionate force in its war in Gaza against Hamas. Israel says its use of force is justified and legal.</p><p>In April, Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/01/world/middleeast/iran-commanders-killed-syria-israel.html" title="">bombed a building </a>that was part of the Iranian Embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, killing seven people including a general who oversaw Iran’s covert military operations in Syria and Lebanon. In response, Iran launched a missile and drone attack on Israel, the first time it had attempted to strike the country directly after a decadeslong shadow war.</p><p>In July, Israel assassinated a senior leader of Hezbollah, Fuad Shukr, in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/middleeast/fuad-shukr-hezbollah-israel-strike.html" title="">airstrike on a house</a> in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. Israel claimed responsibility for the killing, which it said was retaliation for an attack on the Israeli-controlled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/world/middleeast/israel-golan-heights-lebanon-rocket.html" title="">Golan Heights</a> days earlier that had killed at least 12 people.</p><p>Hours later, the leader of Hamas’s political office, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed by an explosive device hidden in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-dead.html" title="">guesthouse in Tehran</a> where he was staying after he had attended the inauguration of Iran’s president.
