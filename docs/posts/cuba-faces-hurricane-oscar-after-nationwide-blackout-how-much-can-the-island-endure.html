So, arguably, is people’s lack of hope. The threat of upheaval is real, experts said, which would likely lead to a harsh crack down on human rights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Nearly 2 million people — almost 20 percent of the population — have left the country in the past two years, sapping the nation of its work force, according to analysts and estimates.</p><p>“It’s chaos. Really, the word you would use is ‘chaos,’” said Omar Everleny, a Cuban economist in Havana. “Anyone who was thinking of leaving is now accelerating those plans. Now you’re hearing ‘I am going to sell my house and go.’”</p><p>Power was restored to much of Havana, the capital, on Monday, but the authorities canceled school nationwide through Wednesday to try to save electricity. The power grid is being split up into smaller systems in the effort to keep one failure from knocking out power to the entire country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People lined up on Monday to buy food outside a state store in Havana that had no power. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yander Zamora/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The Cuban government blames the power crisis on the U.S. trade embargo, and sanctions that were ramped up by the Trump administration, which severely restricts the Cuban government’s cash flow. <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm784" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The U.S. Department of the Treasury</a> blocks tankers that have delivered oil to Cuba, which drives up the island’s fuel costs, because Cuba has a limited pool of suppliers available to it.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In addition, Cuban power plants are nearly half a century old and the government has put off important maintenance and upgrades, leaving the power grid to rely on decrepit, aging and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/world/americas/cuba-power-outage.html" title="">unreliable infrastructure</a>, analysts say. A fuel shortage exacerbated the problem, officials said.</p><p>“The country is experiencing an exceptional situation, marked by two fundamental and complex events: the energy emergency and, on the other hand, the cyclone alarm phase for the eastern provinces,” President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez said.</p><p>He acknowledged the dire situation, but after some people in Havana publicly protested, he also issued a clear threat that they would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p><p>“We will not accept or allow anyone to act by provoking acts of vandalism, and much less disturbing the civil tranquillity of our people,” the president said. “And that is a conviction, and that is a principle of our revolution.”</p><p>Blackouts and challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic set off major protests in 2021, with thousands of people taking to the streets. Hundreds were sent to prison.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Many discontented younger people have left the country since then, which could actually wind up being a lifeline for the Cuban government. Not only are millions of unhappy people gone, but they tend to send money back home, which prevents a total collapse of the economy.</p><p>In addition, many dissidents, activists and independent journalists who openly criticized the government were forced into exile.</p><p>Most Cubans would rather leave than collectively protest, said Ted Henken, a Cuba scholar at Baruch College in New York, “especially when the government has clearly demonstrated its willingness to violently repress protesters and imprison even those who protest peacefully or those who post about such protests on social media.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view of Havana, Cuba’s capital, at dawn on Monday, the fourth day of a nationwide power failure.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yamil Lage/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Every time <a href="https://www.facebook.com/victor.alonso.1217" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lázaro Manuel Alonso</a>, a journalist for a state news outlet, posted an optimistic update about the progress to restore electricity this weekend, Cubans from all over the country responded, letting him know they were still in darkness.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“It’s already been 80 hours in Pinar, and it’s hopeless,” one user posted.</p><p>It had been 72 hours in Santo Suárez, another user said, “and not to mention that there’s no water either.”</p><p>In eastern Cuba, areas that were never before known to have flooded were under three feet of water after the passage of Hurricane Oscar, which made landfall on Sunday, the Cuban <a href="https://www.granma.cu/cuba/2024-10-21/en-guantanamo-se-concentran-las-principales-afectaciones-de-oscar-21-10-2024-13-10-58" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government reported</a>. About 15,000 people had been evacuated from Imías and another nearby city.</p><p>In Baracoa and Maisí, both in the province of Guantánamo, more than 1,700 homes sustained roof damage, and dozens of others partially collapsed.</p><p>Coffee crops were also damaged.</p><p>Sebastián A. Arcos, the interim director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University in Miami, said it would be unwise to speculate about whether the cascading problems threaten the future of the Cuban revolution. He remembers being convinced that the Cuban government would collapse after the fall of the Soviet Union. That was over 30 years ago.</p><p>Mr. Díaz-Canel assumed office in 2019, but former president Raúl Castro, a committed Marxist who along with his brother Fidel led the revolution that took power in 1959, still holds outsized influence, Mr. Arcos said.</p><p>“It’s a critical and dramatic moment,” said Mr. Arcos, who left Cuba in 1992 after spending a year in prison for trying to escape from the island. “It shows in a very dramatic way the collapse of the Cuban economy after 65 years of mismanagement by this regime.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Frances Robles is a Times reporter covering Latin America and the Caribbean.
