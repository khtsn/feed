By 3 a.m., flames were nearing the iconic Malibu pier. </p><p>Residents in central and eastern Malibu, a city of more than 10,000 people, were under an evacuation order, which extended to the eastern limits of Los Angeles and included much of the eastern Santa Monica Mountains. More than 10,000 people were <a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/check-outage-status" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">without power</a> in Los Angeles County, according to local utilities. </p><p>The fire ripped through the dry terrain of the Santa Monica Mountains near Pepperdine University, which <a href="https://x.com/pepperdine/status/1866409992309584049" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a shelter-in-place order</a> around 1 a.m. Tuesday as flames were seen from the campus.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/pepperdine/status/1866433837557006779" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement posted to X</a> early Tuesday morning, the university said that it had suspended operations at its Malibu campus and urged students and staff members to continue sheltering. <a href="https://x.com/pepperdine/status/1866444912725766377" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">It later said</a> the worst of the fire had passed the area, but that shelter-in-place orders would remain at least until daylight.</p><p>The City of Malibu also closed all schools on Tuesday. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The blaze broke out in an area notorious for fast-spreading wildfires, where the dangerous Santa Ana winds meet the parched canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains. Officials had issued an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/09/weather/california-santa-ana-winds-ventura-county/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“extremely critical”</a> fire alert on Monday as very high winds were expected. </p><p>The National Weather Service issued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/weather/southern-california-wind-fire-weather-forecast.html" title="">red flag warnings</a> this week for Ventura and Los Angeles counties, with particularly strong winds expected Monday night into Tuesday. In the windiest locations, likely including Ventura and San Diego counties, isolated gusts are expected to exceed 80 miles per hour in the mountains.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Peak wildfire season is still in full swing in Southern California. Weather officials said the conditions are similar to those of early November, when dangerous winds belted Ventura County and fueled the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/mountain-fire-ventura-california.html" title="">Mountain fire</a>, a nearly 20,000-acre inferno that damaged 243 structures, including homes.</p><p>Amy Graff<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
