The <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2024/12/9/franklin-fire" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Franklin fire</a> burned more than 2,200 acres overnight, according to California fire officials, and <a href="https://x.com/CityMalibu/status/1866443334023024918" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leaped across the Pacific Coast Highway</a>, threatening the iconic Malibu pier.</p><p>Residents in central and eastern Malibu, a city of more than 10,000 people, were under an evacuation order, which extended to the western limits of Los Angeles and included much of the Santa Monica Mountains. The fire ripped through dry terrain near Pepperdine University, which <a href="https://x.com/pepperdine/status/1866409992309584049" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a shelter-in-place order</a> as flames were seen from the campus.</p><div><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Firefighting efforts</strong>: Winds slowed before daybreak in Malibu, giving firefighters a window to make progress on the ground and from the air by dropping water. But forecasters were expecting more gusts as strong as 60 m.p.h. later Tuesday morning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Classes disrupted</strong>: Pepperdine officials <a href="https://x.com/pepperdine/status/1866433837557006779" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that they had suspended operations at the university’s Malibu campus and urged students and staff members to stay inside. <a href="https://x.com/pepperdine/status/1866444912725766377" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">It later said</a> the worst of the fire had passed the area, but shelter-in-place orders would remain at least until daylight. The City of Malibu also closed all schools on Tuesday.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fire’s origins</strong>: The blaze broke out in an area notorious for fast-spreading wildfires, where the dangerous Santa Ana winds meet the parched canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains. Officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/weather/southern-california-wind-fire-weather-forecast.html" title="">had issued an “extremely critical” fire alert</a> on Monday, warning that high winds were expected this week.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seasonal concerns</strong>: Peak wildfire season is in full swing in Southern California. Weather officials said the conditions are similar to those of early November, when dangerous winds belted Ventura County and fueled the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/mountain-fire-ventura-california.html" title="">Mountain fire</a>, a nearly 20,000-acre inferno that damaged 243 structures, including homes.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
