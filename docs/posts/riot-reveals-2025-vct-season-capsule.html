		<p>Riot Games has unveiled their new limited-time Season Capsules for the 2025 VCT ahead of Masters Bangkok. </p>

<p>Similar to the Miseric√≥rdia knife released for LOCK//IN, the 2025 capsule will feature a melee alongside four reactive charms and animated player cards aiming to &#34;celebrate the identity of each International League.&#34;</p>

<p>Taking on a karambit design, the capsule is the first melee in Valorant to feature five chromas, including four variants themed around each International League and an additional grayscale variant representing the VCT as a whole.</p>

<p>Similar to the Champions collection, the 2025 season capsule will continue to split a portion of the revenue generated from sales back towards every team across the International Leagues. Riot took this initiative after spotting disparities greater than expected regarding the distribution of individual team bundles throughout 2024, directly stating that &#34;some teams benefitted significantly more than others from Team Capsules&#34;, and that the best performing Team Capsules of 2024 came from either teams who won global events or dominated regional fan bases. With the revenue split for Valorant&#39;s 2025 Season Capsule in mind, Riot aims to raise the baseline for all VCT competitors with their esports cosmetics, which raised over $44 million USD for the VCT partnered teams throughout 2024.</p>

<p>Players can purchase the 2025 season bundle starting February 6, which will remain available until the end of Masters Bangkok on March 2nd.</p>

		<p>no way so many designers just thinks this is a cool look for knife, it could be just riot&#39;s task to make it look like it so they can&#39;t do something they want, idk. If they are all came to conlcusion this is a good knife, they are such an ass designers. there is not details or something, it&#39;s just stencil on which the paint fill was used</p>
