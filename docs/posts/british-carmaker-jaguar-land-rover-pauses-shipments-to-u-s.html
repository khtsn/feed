    <h1>British Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover Pauses Shipments to U.S.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The auto tariffs pose a particular challenge for British luxury carmakers, which also include Bentley and Aston Martin, because they sell relatively few vehicles and, therefore, tend to have only a small number of production sites. For them, setting up manufacturing in the United States hasn’t been economical, leaving them without an easy way to circumnavigate tariffs.</p><p>Jaguar Land Rover sells about a fifth of its cars in the United States. In its financial year that ended in March 2024, it sold about 95,000 cars and reported £6.5 billion in revenue for sales in the United States. If the company were to add the full cost of the tariffs to the price of its cars, it would add thousands of dollars.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/world/europe/uk-trump-tariffs.html" title="">Other British exports to the United States face a 10 percent tariff</a>, which Mr. Trump announced this past week on what he called “Liberation Day.” So far, the British government hasn’t retaliated, and officials have said they are focused on reaching a trade deal with the United States focused on technology. At the same time, officials are consulting with businesses over the next four weeks on a list of U.S. imports that could face retaliatory British tariffs.</p><p>The United States is Britain’s second-largest trading partner, though that trade is easily dwarfed by the flow of goods and services between Britain and the European Union. Britain’s trade with the United States is heavily skewed toward services.</p><p>The trade in goods, which President Trump has been concentrating on, is relatively in balance. In 2023, Britain imported about £58 billion of goods and exported about £60 billion to the United States, according to the British Office for National Statistics.</p></div></div>
