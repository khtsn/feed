The brothers were tried together but in front of separate juries, each of which deadlocked. A mistrial was declared.</p><p>When the brothers were tried a second time, there were no television cameras in the courtroom, and much of the testimony and evidence about the claims that Jose Menendez, Lyle and Erik’s father, had molested his sons was excluded. The brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 and were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. At the time of the murders, Lyle Menendez was 21 and Erik was 18.</p><p>The case never fully faded from the culture, and has been the subject of a steady stream of documentaries and dramatized treatments. Two recent productions, a docudrama and a documentary released by Netflix, generated renewed attention and led to a recent decision by George Gascón, the outgoing district attorney of Los Angeles County, to recommend that the brothers be resentenced.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Gascón, who lost his re-election bid earlier this month, has recommended that the brothers’ sentences be changed to 50 years to life. Because the brothers were under age 26 at the time of the crimes, doing so would make them immediately eligible for parole.</p><p>“I believe that they have paid their debt to society,” Mr. Gascón said late last month.</p><p>The brothers are serving their sentences in a state prison near San Diego.</p><p>Tim Arango<!-- --> and <!-- -->Matt Stevens<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
