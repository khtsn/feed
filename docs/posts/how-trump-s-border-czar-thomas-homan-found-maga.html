Homan was a frustrated immigration bureaucrat ready to call it quits.</p><p>A former border patrol agent with a lawman’s steely demeanor, he had been an odd fit for the Obama administration. Top officials would call on him when they wanted a hard-liner’s take. But his proposals — including an early version of the controversial family separation policy to deter migrants — were often rejected.</p><p>In the years since, Donald J. Trump’s rise has fully unleashed Mr. Homan and his ideas. In Mr. Trump’s first administration, Mr. Homan helped make the family separation policy a chaotic reality. And in the second, Mr. Homan is poised to be the White House “border czar,” tasked with making good on the incoming president’s promise to carry out the largest deportation campaign in American history.</p><p>Mr. Homan’s ascent completes his transformation from dutiful official in a Democratic administration to full-throated Trump world fixture.</p><p>Where he once signed off on transgender care guidelines and the Obama administration’s targeted immigration policy, he now endorses far-right theories about immigration and elections. He has boasted that he is completely unbothered by criticism of the family separation policy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>When he was first approached about joining a second Trump administration, Mr. Homan says he told Mr. Trump that he was so angry about the border that “I’ll come back for free.”</p><p>Mr. Homan, whose post does not require Senate confirmation, has acknowledged his mission is virtually impossible, much less in four years. Mr. Trump has vowed to remove all of the roughly 11 million people in the country illegally — which experts say is far-fetched and would be shockingly disruptive if carried out.</p><p>Yet Mr. Homan has described plans for a methodical and aggressive campaign. He has said he intends to focus on deporting “the worst first” — people arrested over crimes unrelated to immigration, people who already have deportation orders, and two million others he deems security risks.</p><p>But he has also promised that the effort’s reach would eventually be broader.</p><p>He says he already has met with technology executives about tools to find undocumented immigrants, like facial-recognition software or license-plate readers. He has proposed a hotline for people to report neighbors they suspect are living in the country illegally.</p><p>He has threatened to arrest state and local leaders who try to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And if ICE officers can’t rely on local help, they will go into communities to find their targets, he has said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At times, Mr. Homan, who is 63, has tempered Mr. Trump’s talk of using the military or emergency powers for what the president-elect said could be a “bloody story.” Yet Mr. Homan has made clear his goal is the same: deporting as many people as possible, and conceding nothing to his critics.</p><p>“The talk is tough but it has to be tough,” Mr. Homan told The New York Times in an interview. “Everything I say I mean.”</p><h2 id="link-50798bd8">Pursuing Smugglers, Not Immigrants</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/us/politics/00pol-homan2/00pol-homan2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/us/politics/00pol-homan2/00pol-homan2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/us/politics/00pol-homan2/00pol-homan2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Jeh Johnson speaks at a lectern.
