<p>While celebration erupted on one side of the stage, sadness and uncertainty was present on the other end at the end of today&#39;s pair of 2-0 sweeps.</p>

</span>, a win extended their VCT life span. The Ascension squad entered the playoffs knowing a top-two finish was needed to avoid needing to fight for survival at Ascension this year, while reaching Champions extends their stay in VCT for one more year.</p>

<p>The series opened on Nongshim&#39;s pick of Lotus, a map that has been shaky for the squad throughout Stage 2. The team has made a couple of comp changes throughout the stage, at times experimenting with Duelist <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/31827/dambi">
		Dambi	</a>
</span> on Waylay in a double-Controller, double-Initiator setup. Against T1, Nongshim went back to what was familiar, with Dambi on Neon and <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/31829/ivy">
		Ivy	</a>
</span> on Deadlock.</p>

<p>While the comp put the Nongshim players on their best roles, Lotus is still one of T1&#39;s stronger maps. It was a trademark of their run leading up to and including a trophy-lifting campaign at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>. T1 continued with its double-Duelist look, which has become synonymous with its success, and found great success on its opening attacker side.</p>

<p>T1 opened up on a roll. Neon player <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/29833/izu">
		iZu	</a>
</span> caused chaos and capitalized on it, finding five first bloods. He ended the map with a game-high six first bloods. His disruption, paired with <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span>&#39;s support, saw T1 claim ten rounds on the attack side. T1 gave up an eco round to a Nongshim force buy to start the second half, but that was a mere hiccup. T1 gave up four straight rounds, but quickly recovered to steal the Nongshim map pick 13-6.</p>

<p>T1&#39;s map pick of Ascent was a fairly strong map for Nongshim in Stage 2. Nongshim went 3-0 on the map with a unique Viper-Omen comp. Meanwhile, T1 had a double-Sentinel comp, with <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span> on Vyse and BuZz on Chamber. Nongshim claimed seven rounds on defense to enter halftime with a slim lead, but that quickly evaporated with losses in the pistol and anti-eco rounds. Five on attack seemed to be more than enough for T1.</p>

<iframe type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/h-FUCDWKBP4?si=jml30uEQ6gevQaNB&amp;clip=UgkxQsjL96KefHbSNtlQv9AFDOwl5d-85oOg&amp;clipt=EOC9oAQY5d-jBA&amp;showinfo=0&amp;origin=https://www.vlr.gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p><em>Meteor shows great flair to slip the net.</em></p>

<p>T1&#39;s excellent control of the map using the double-Sentinel utility made entering either site a nightmare for Nongshim, which did not get its first spike planted until it was down 11-9. Even when the bomb did get down, T1 made use of strong, well-coordinated retakes to secure two consecutive defuses en route to a 13-9 win.</p>

<p>T1 moves on to the lower semifinal to play the winning team between <span data-ref-id="7">

</span>, while Nongshim now seems poised for a trip to Pacific Ascesion if it wishes to be in VCT in 2026. With the win, T1 clinches a Champions 2026 spot on points.</p>



<p>In the second elimination match of the day, RRQ went up against DRX in a match that would have Champions Paris implications. A win would secure a top-four finish, which in turn meant earning three championship points. Three points would give the winning team the edge in the battle between the two for third place and, with there being just four teams left, qualification to Champions.</p>

<p>The series opened on Rex Regum Qeon&#39;s Icebox, a usually strong map for both squads. Getting the operator into sharpshooter <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/24895/jemkin">
		Jemkin	</a>
</span>&#39;s hands was paramount to RRQ&#39;s success on defense. While he did not find as many kills as he may have wanted, the one-shot, one-kill gun set down the longest sightlines of the map to help RRQ to a 9-3 advantage after ending its defender side. </p>

<iframe type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/h-FUCDWKBP4?si=81ia3YCovVDFlUkd&amp;clip=UgkxtAf-4wF_BmBBPxywK84-jqojWAMe7FRK&amp;clipt=EM316wUY24jvBQ&amp;showinfo=0&amp;origin=https://www.vlr.gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p><em>Ice cold from Jemkin to seal what could have been a disastrous round for RRQ.</em></p>

<p>On attack, with plenty of room for error, RRQ cleaned up well, with the pistol and anti-eco the beginning of the end to a clean 13-7 win on their own map pick.</p>

<p>The series then moved to DRX&#39;s Corrode, a map that neither team has looked the strongest on. Both teams went for the Omen-Viper Controller pairing that&#39;s become popular as of late, but the similarities stop there. While DRX went for Vyse, Fade, and <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/28400/hyunmin">
		HYUNMIN	</a>
</span>&#39;s Neon to complement their Controllers, RRQ went for the aggressive double-Duelist, zero Sentinel approach that they used to eliminate <span data-ref-id="11">

</span> just days before. </p>

<p>Disruption was the name of the game for RRQ on defense. On a side without a Sentinel, RRQ won six rounds. With the likes of Jemkin on Waylay and <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/8497/monyet">
		Monyet	</a>
</span> on Neon leading the charge, sharp mechanics was behind most of that. The pair combined for 22 kills in the half, but the efforts of <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4871/xffero">
		xffero	</a>
</span>, who had a match-leading 14 kills in the first half, cannot be understated.</p>

<p>RRQ&#39;s made it look easy on attack, with two of the games&#39; most chaotic Duelists attracting the crosshairs of DRX in holding positions. With the ability to enter either site and the ability to take quick control of mid, RRQ broke down DRX&#39;s defense to win 13-9.</p>

<p>With the win, RRQ qualifies for its first-ever Champions event, while DRX will have to wait from home. With RRQ securing top four and sitting top-three in the points standings, they will qualify automatically, while DRX is relying on <span data-ref-id="14">
