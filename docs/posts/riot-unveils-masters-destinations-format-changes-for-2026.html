    <h1>Riot unveils Masters destinations, format changes for 2026</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>Riot has released an <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/status/1973839880938492201" target="_blank">announcement video</a> with news about what to expect from the Valorant Champions Tour in 2026, including the locations of both Masters events, more roadshows for the International Leagues, and major format changes, which involve more bracket play and a path for Challengers teams to qualify to Champions 2026. </p>

<p>&#34;As we spoke last June, we&#39;re planning big changes to the VCT in 2027. We&#39;re building the next era of the sport, a VCT that&#39;s more open with more events and more variety of competition,” said Leo Faria, Global Head of Valorant Esports. “We are very excited, so much that we&#39;re not going to wait until 2027, and we&#39;ll start introducing these changes next year.&#34;</p>



<p>The first Masters event of 2026 will be held in Santiago, Chile, making it the first global event in Latin America and the first return to South America since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo" target="_blank">LOCK//IN São Paulo</a> in 2023. The second Masters will be held in London, United Kingdom. Champions will be hosted in Shanghai, China to cap off the season as <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/525728/riot-announces-shanghai-as-host-of-champions-2026" target="_blank">announced previously</a> in August. </p>



<p>The Stage 2 playoffs for all four International Leagues will take place in new cities in their respective regions in a move that expands the circuit&#39;s global reach. This comes after the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2500/vct-2025-pacific-stage-2" target="_blank">Pacific Stage 2</a> Grand Finals Weekend this year was held in Tokyo, Japan, and the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2499/vct-2025-china-stage-2" target="_blank">China Stage 2</a> playoffs from the upper semifinals onwards were held in Chongqing, China. </p>

<p>China will take an even larger step; the region will take their entire 2026 season on the road, visiting five new cities over the course of the year. </p>



<p>Starting in 2026, all domestic and international VCT events will use bracket formats, departing from the current Swiss stage and group stage arrangements. Kickoff will be extended with a new triple-elimination format, and Masters Santiago will feature 12 teams from around the world instead of the eight teams seen at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1921/champions-tour-2024-masters-madrid" target="_blank">Masters Madrid</a>. </p>

<p>Lastly, Challengers teams will have the chance to qualify to Champions by competing in the Stage 2 playoffs of their respective International Leagues, a first step in bridging the gap between tier 1 and tier 2 in the partnerships era. This prospective path to Champions will replace Ascension and visitor slots for the year as the circuit prepares to transition into a more open competitive landscape in 2027. </p>

<em>A new path for Challengers teams around the world.</em></p>

<p>Challengers teams that qualify to Champions will receive the same access to Champions digital goods revenue as other Champions-qualifying teams, as well as their share of the Stage 2 prize pool. Faria also shared <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxAhHwF_EtHaZ7PlyUAA5uMXInZG9URsNh?si=MOBTaRSVvRNqFdjL" target="_blank">on the Plat Chat podcast</a> that Challengers teams that make it to the Stage 2 playoffs will receive an additional stipend that “depending on where you are in the world…should pay for the project an entire season.” </p>

<p>&#34;This is just the beginning of the next era of the VCT,&#34; Faria <a href="https://x.com/lhfaria/status/1973845606457278924" target="_blank">commented</a> regarding the announcement. &#34;Lots more coming in 2027 and beyond!&#34;</p>
