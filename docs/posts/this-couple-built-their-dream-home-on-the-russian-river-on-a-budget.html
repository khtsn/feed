Also, his San Francisco-based architecture firm, <a href="https://jensen-architects.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jensen Architects</a>, had built projects there. And it was an easy hour-and-a-half drive north from the couple’s loft in the city.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A bird’s-eye view of the house and the river." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg/03Location-Healdsburg-02-pzbg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="401"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The steep, narrow lot descends to the Russian River.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Fletcher</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Maybe most important is just that it’s super beautiful,” said Mr. Jensen, 62.</p><p>In 2012, the couple, who had a limited budget, looked at unloved properties in the Fitch Mountain neighborhood of Healdsburg. Eventually, they found a vertiginous riverside lot with a house that was in far worse shape than the typical fixer-upper: a condemned, structurally unsound building that had been illegally converted into apartments, with outdoor spaces overgrown by weeds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The home is clad in board-and-batten siding.

From the outset, they knew they would be limited to building within the footprint of the existing structure. But even before they could develop plans and get the needed permits, they were required to remove the illegal apartments.</p><p>“We had to strip it down to where it started before the planning and building department would even talk to us about our remodel,” Mr. Jensen said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The 600-square-foot primary living space extends outside to a deck with a retractable awning.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Fletcher</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>At the same time, he and Ms. Grawunder spent weekends hacking back the overgrown foliage around the house, and were surprised by what was revealed. “We found all these beautiful terraces along the river, with handmade concrete work and embedded abalone shells and tiles,” Mr. Jensen said. “It was like excavating in Pompeii.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Superstudio Quaderna dining table reminds the couple of time they spent working in Italy.

Because the road is at the top of the lot, which descends all the way to the river, the front door opens into the loft level and a spiral staircase curls down to the main living space.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>To reach the front door, they climb a spiral staircase.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Fletcher</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>To build a kitchen, they installed stainless steel base cabinets along one wall. For a work surface, they added a wood trestle table that Mr. Jensen built himself. Rolling carts tucked under the table provide extra storage for pots and pans, and lights are hidden in an open section of ceiling.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Instead of a bedroom, the house has an open sleeping loft.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Fletcher</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>A Malm fireplace anchors the living room, and the dining area is organized around a long Quaderna dining table, designed in 1972 by the Italian collective Superstudio. The table is a reminder of the time the couple spent working for the Florence-based architect Cristiano Toraldo di Francia, a founder of Superstudio, in the 1980s.</p><p>Most of the construction was complete by 2016, at a cost of about $500,000. But Mr. Jensen and Ms. Grawunder continued to tinker and customize the property over the following years, adding decks and planted terraces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-22"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Jensen and Ms. Grawunder call the space beneath one of the decks “the cabana.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Fletcher</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>They discovered appealing concrete terraces and stairs with embedded shells and tiles when they cut back overgrown weeds.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Fletcher</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>One deck with a retractable awning runs the full width of the house off the living space. Another, closer to the water, has a floor of metal grates that doubles as a pergola above an outdoor dining space.</p><p>“It’s metal grating that’s usually used for stairs, so it’s tough and robust when it floods,” Mr. Jensen said. “But the perforations also make this beautiful dappled light in the space underneath it, which we call the cabana.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>There are 72 steps between the river and the road above.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Fletcher</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Living on so many levels is appealing, but isn’t always easy. “There are 72 steps between the river and the road,” Mr. Jensen said. “And, inevitably, when we go down to the river to have lunch, we forget something.”</p><p>To ease the burden of carting things back and forth, they devised a creative solution: a wicker basket on a rope that can be hoisted from the deck off the primary living space.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Although the house wasn’t intended to be a primary residence, the couple now find it difficult to leave. “It’s really hard to jump in the car when I’m here looking at the river,” Ms. Grawunder said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Fletcher</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Although the house was intended to be a second home, the couple moved in full-time at beginning of the pandemic and turned the basement into a home office.
