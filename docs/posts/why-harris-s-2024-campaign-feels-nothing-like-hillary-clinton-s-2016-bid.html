prospect of “Madam President.”</p><p>But eight years after Hillary Clinton became the first woman to lead a major party’s presidential ticket, Democrats are sending American women a more sober and urgent message even as they try to elect another barrier-breaking candidate.</p><p>Republican policies, they argue, have had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/20/us/abortion-save-mothers-life.html" title="">disastrous and once-unthinkable consequences</a> for the health and autonomy of women and their families since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. A second term for former President Donald J. Trump, they warn, would be even more dangerous.</p><p>“Simply put,” Vice President Kamala Harris said this week from the stage of her party’s convention, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/kamala-harris-dnc-speech.html" title="">they are out of their minds</a>.”</p></div></div><div><p>From the women who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/politics/harris-dnc-abortion-rights.html" title="">described harrowing pregnancies</a> and their difficulties receiving medical care to Ms. Harris’s finale on Thursday night, the tone and emphasis were a radical departure from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/us/politics/clinton-women-reaction.html" title="">optimistic feminism</a> and chants of “I’m with her” that dominated Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 campaign.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the convention, Kaitlyn Joshua recounted how, in the middle of a miscarriage, she had been turned away from two hospitals in Louisiana that feared the potential liability of caring for her.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“This is a time where the rights of women are fundamentally under attack as it relates to abortion, I.V.F., when and how to have a family,” said Senator Laphonza Butler, Democrat of California and a close Harris ally. “It’s not about minimizing the importance of race or gender. It is about appreciating that in this moment in the history of our country, this election is bigger than anybody’s race or gender.”</p><p>Much of what has transpired in the last eight years was unfathomable to the Democrats caught up in their excitement about Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. The idea that Mr. Trump — a man who had bragged about sexual assault — would win, and that his Supreme Court nominees would help erase the constitutional right to abortion, seemed remote.</p><p>“In 2016, people felt they had the luxury of equality in the law and reproductive freedom in the law, and I think many people didn’t see risk ahead of them,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York.</p><p>The Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/us/politics/abortion-roe-wade-midterm-elections.html" title="">decision to wipe out Roe</a> two years ago unleashed a cascade of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" title="">far-reaching abortion bans</a> in many states across the country. Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/05/us/politics/abortion-roe-midterm-elections-moderate-women.html" title="">quickly harnessed shock and fury</a> over the decision into political momentum in key races that year and since. At the convention this week, Democrats offered their clearest signs yet of just how central the issue will be to their fall campaign.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“The abrogation of our rights has been so severe and so aggressive in red states across the country that the wake-up call has been received,” Ms. Gillibrand said. The senator, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-2020-drop-out.html" title="">ran for president in the 2020 campaign</a> on a message anchored in issues of women’s equality, said that the moment required a “fighter,” and added of Ms. Harris: “It doesn’t matter that she’s a woman, to be honest. It matters that she’s a fighter. And it’s just great that she also happens to be a woman.”</p><p>In ways overt and subtle, plenty of speakers also highlighted the history-making potential of Ms. Harris, who is already the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to accept a major party’s nomination. If elected, she would be the first female president in American history.</p><p>Mrs. Clinton cast Ms. Harris’s bid as a continuation of her efforts to shatter what she has called the “highest and hardest glass ceiling.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rally for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Others recoil from discussion of identity.</p><p>“Sometimes I feel like, when you talk about ‘first woman,’ it’s like ‘first woman’ becomes the focus,” said Mayor Cherelle Parker of Philadelphia, the first woman to lead the city. “That is extremely important. But don’t forget about the work that went in to ensure that she could be prepared to meet every opportunity.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Many Democratic women <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/politics/hillary-clinton-kamala-harris.html" title="">credit Mrs. Clinton’s candidacies</a> with helping Americans grasp what a female presidential nominee might look and sound like, giving Ms. Harris running room to define herself more broadly this time around. (Of course, Mrs. Clinton — a former first lady, senator and secretary of state — hardly reduced her campaign to her gender, either.)</p><p>“The focus today is, it seems to be on a discussion really about a much more holistic view of identity, and I think that’s important for where we are as a country,” said Gov. Maura Healey, the first woman and first openly L.G.B.T.Q. person to be elected governor of Massachusetts, who also emphasized that “representation really matters.”</p><p>Mrs. Clinton, she added, “broke that glass ceiling.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many Democratic women credit Mrs. Clinton’s candidacies with helping Americans grasp what a female presidential nominee might look and sound like, giving Ms. Harris room to define herself more broadly now.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>In a campaign in which Mr. Trump, a white man, has already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/trump-harris-race.html" title="">tried to question Ms. Harris’s racial identity</a>, Democrats are bracing for sexist and racist attacks on Ms. Harris.</p><p>This week, Michelle Obama, the former first lady, warned her party against complacency, saying that there were many “who are ready to question and criticize every move Kamala makes, who are eager to spread those lies, who don’t want to vote for a woman.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>“We cannot indulge our anxieties about whether this country will elect someone like Kamala, instead of doing everything we can to get someone like Kamala elected,” she said.</p><p>So far, Mr. Trump has struggled to press a consistent and effective message against Ms. Harris, but leading Democrats do not bank on that lasting.</p><p>On Friday, at least, Mr. Trump — who relies on the support of social conservatives and has said he is “proudly the person responsible” for overturning Roe v.
