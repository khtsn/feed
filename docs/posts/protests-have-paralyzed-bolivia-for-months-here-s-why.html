A longstanding political rivalry has boiled over, with supporters of the president and his chief opponent <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24ed766lpo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clashing in the streets</a>. Protests have blocked the movement of goods, exacerbating fuel shortages.

Ecuador, Peru and Colombia — Bolivia’s neighbors to the west and north — are all facing significant levels of political turmoil, causing intense anger among their populations.</p><p>Behind the discontent in Bolivia is a rupture within the Movement for Socialism, or MAS, a leftist party that has dominated the country’s political landscape for two decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Bolivia’s president, Luis Arce, and his onetime mentor, former president Evo Morales, are fighting over the party’s leadership — and both insist that they will be the party’s candidate in next year’s presidential elections.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Luis Arce participating in an Indigenous ceremony last month in El Alto, Bolivia.

He held office for 14 years — longer than any other leader.</p><p>Bolivia’s top court ruled last month that Mr. Morales could not run for a fourth term, seemingly closing the door to the possibility of a Morales candidacy.</p><p>Analysts disagree over whether Mr. Morales constitutionally has any legal recourse to run again, but most agree that the justice system is so intertwined in politics that it is hard to trust any decision that it makes.</p><p>“People have realized that the government is ruling through this court,” said Veronica Rocha, a Bolivia political analyst.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>As protesters in La Paz, the capital, shouted that they were hungry last month, Mr. Arce, in another part of the city, <a href="https://www.local10.com/espanol/2024/11/28/arce-celebra-la-victoria-sobre-morales-por-la-conduccion-del-oficialismo-en-bolivia/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">celebrated</a> the court’s ruling against Mr. Morales in an Indigenous ceremony.

He also ignored constitutional rules that his own government had rewritten barring him from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/world/americas/bolivia-evo-morales-elections.html" title="">running for a third and then a fourth term</a>.</p><p>When he fled the country during a disputed election in 2019 — amid accusations of fraud — he tapped Mr. Arce, his finance minister and protégé, to run in 2020.</p><p>But after he won, Mr. Arce shrugged off his role as Mr. Morales’s heir and instead sought to govern on his own terms.</p><p>That set off a power struggle with Mr. Morales, who returned to Bolivia the day after Mr. Arce was sworn in, with the intention of returning to power.</p><p>While Mr. Morales is less popular than he once was, several recent polls show he still commands far more support than Mr. Arce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Morales, the former president, has rejected a court ruling banning him from running for president. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Karita/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But now he faces the possibility of imprisonment after prosecutors in October charged him with statutory rape, accusing him of impregnating a 15-year-old girl in 2016, when he was president.</p><p>Mr. Morales claims the charges are politically motivated, and he rallied supporters in his home province of Chapare to protest.</p><p>Several key highways pass through the rural region, and weeks of demonstrations made them impassable, blocking shipments of fuel and food across the country of 12 million.</p><p>The blockades kept Josué Espinoza, 28, a truck driver hauling cement, stuck on the road for 23 days. Nearby residents gave him and other trapped truckers food.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Some eventually left on foot to find alternate transportation. “The people got desperate because they had to pay their bills at the bank and there was nothing to eat,” he said, referring to truckers who abandoned their vehicles.</p><p>But Mr. Espinoza, fearful his truck might get stolen, stayed and slept in his vehicle.</p><h2 id="link-399943d2">Why else are people upset?</h2><p>Fuel shortages, rising prices and a lack of access to U.S. dollars and imported goods have also provoked fury.</p><p>When Mr. Arce served in the Morales administration, he was widely credited as the key person behind what was seen as the country’s economic miracle, buoyed by a commodities boom driven by a thriving natural gas industry.</p><p>But then the boom went bust, prices fell and production slowed. Now Mr. Arce’s government struggles to import fuel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People waiting with plastic containers to buy fuel.

But Carlos Saavedra, a Bolivian political analyst, said the electoral outlook was fluid, with the outcome hard to predict.</p><p>“You are going to have many candidates fighting for small fragments of power,” he said. “I see an ultra-fragmented and ultra-polarized election.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
