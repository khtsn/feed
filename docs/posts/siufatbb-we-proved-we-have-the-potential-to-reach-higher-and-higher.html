<p><strong>What experiences have you drawn from the international stage that you will bring forward into the next stage of CN Valorant and Champions to allow this to be a more consistent trend and not a one-time spree?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fayde: “I think the experience we gained from this event is how to handle different teams better. Even back in VCT CN, teams have different playstyles. This is one of the most valuable experiences we gained here. The ability to adapt quicker during a match also kind helped. I&#39;m sure it will be very useful in the future.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Do you have any words for all your teammates and fans that support Wolves, SiuFatBB?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SiuFatBB: “First of all, I want to say thank you to all our fans who always support us. I know that some of you might call my name to cheer for me, or even sing a song, supporting me, which is really fun. To those who are  watching from home or cheering for us on the spot, I feel so fortunate. I want to say something to my teammates as well: I think we have done enough. We have proved we have the potential to reach higher and higher. Hopefully after this tournament, we can improve to reach our peak and to prove to ourselves and the audience that our good performance is not a one-time thing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What were some of the struggles adapting to FNATIC in the best of five?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fayde: “I think the first couple of maps we played too passive… We couldn&#39;t get into the site as quickly as possible, especially on Split. We gave them too much map control, same on Icebox. We somehow managed to play five-on-five retake most of the rounds, which is really bad considering the comps. This is one of the experiences that we have absolved during this event. We really have to understand the strength of different comps from different teams, their playstyles and stuff so we know how to handle it better.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Do you feel that now that you&#39;ve made this run at Masters Toronto, you&#39;ve paved the way for all VCT CN teams, not just EDward Gaming, to challenge for trophies consistently?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SiuFatBB: I used to give support to EDG a lot from home. When they were on the international stage, I would film some short videos to give them support. I brought their spirit to Masters Toronto this time. I think that even though we made top three at Toronto, the gap is not that large. We need to actually grind, and I hope that the environment and community could be more kind to us since every professional player&#39;s career is tough. Without attention and support you need to carry it all by yourself, step by step, brick by brick. The only thing you need to do is have faith in yourself and keep going on. I hope there would be more tolerance talking about judging professional players so that they would have little pressure to show out on the international stage. I really want to appreciate every audience member and every team from VCT CN.</p>
