Her posts have suggested that iodized salt is “toxic” and described fluoride as “poison.” And her popularity on the platform — where she goes by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cleanlivingwithava/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@cleanlivingwithava</a> — has earned her a paid partnership with a fluoride-free toothpaste company and affiliate work with other brands, including one that sells “non-toxic” skin care products.</p><p>Ms. Noe, a self-described “crunchy teen,” is just one of a number of young influencers who appeal to other health-conscious kids their age. At times, their anti-establishment viewpoints fall in line with those of Robert F.

And last year, Ms. Zude decided to start her own health account on TikTok, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thatcrunchygirlannika" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@thatcrunchygirlannika</a> — inspired, she said, by how bad ultra-processed foods made her feel.

To find inspiration, he studies popular influencers’ videos and tries to repackage them for a teen audience, he said. His regular “What I Ate Today” videos often cater to his age group’s limited budget.</p><p>Other videos offer advice on topics like how to “heal” acne through diet alone.</p><p>Mr. Siskos’ mother, Aleisha Aziz, said her son’s focus on health sometimes concerns her, but she prefers it to him downing energy drinks and regularly eating out.</p><h2 id="link-4daf805d">Online Trust, Real-Life Concerns</h2><p>Danielle Shine, an accredited dietitian in Australia, said she recently learned that a teenage client was sourcing health information from Ms. Zude.</p><p>The client believed that Ms. Zude “really knew what she was talking about,” Ms. Shine said. “There’s a lot of trust developed there — quite a strong parasocial relationship.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>That was concerning to Ms. Shine, who studies online nutrition misinformation and sees Ms. Zude’s posts as oversimplified.

(“That’s why we’re given Jell-O at hospitals,” she said.) In one of Ms. Zude’s videos, she also made an unproven connection between cereals and autism.</p><p>Mr. Zude supports his daughter’s social media efforts and believes people give “young teenage girls who want to eat healthy a bad rap,” he said, adding: “I’ve never met a person that has an unhealthy obsession with health.”</p><p>Adhering to a healthy lifestyle, though, can get in the way of typical teenage pursuits. There are times, Ms. Noe acknowledged, when her regimen requires her to end a night with friends early. When they ask her to stay a little longer, she stands strong.</p><p>“I just want to go home and do my red light therapy, put my glasses on, make my sourdough and go to bed,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Rina Raphael is the author of “The Gospel of Wellness: Gyms, Gurus, Goop, and the False Promise of Self-Care.”</p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">A Guide to Better Nutrition</h2><hr/><ul><li><p>We talked to nutrition experts and came up with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/well/eat/healthy-eating-tips.html">10 tips for healthier eating</a>.</p></li><li><p>Nutrition experts say frozen foods are not only as good as fresh, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/well/eat/frozen-food-health-benefits-tips.html">they’re often better</a>.</p></li><li><p>Could dark chocolate reduce your risk of diabetes? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/well/eat/dark-chocolate-diabetes-study.html">A new study suggests that it might</a>.</p></li><li><p>We asked scientists to help <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html">clear up the confusion about how seed oils</a> — canola oil, corn oil, sunflower oil and other refined oils made from the seeds of certain plants — affect our bodies.</p></li><li><p>How healthy are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/well/eat/chickpeas-health-benefits-recipes.html">chickpeas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/well/eat/citrus-health-benefits-recipes.html">citrus fruit</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/well/eat/sweet-potatoes-health-benefits-recipes.html">sweet potatoes</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/well/eat/apples-health-benefits-recipes.html">apples</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/well/eat/tuna-fish-mercury.html">tuna</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/well/pasta-chickpea-bean-legume.html">legume pasta</a>?
