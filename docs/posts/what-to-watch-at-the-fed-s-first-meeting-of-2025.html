After lowering interest rates by a full percentage point last year, central bank officials are at a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/business/fed-rate-cute-pause-why.html" title="">turning point</a>.</p><p>A strong labor market has afforded the Fed room to move more slowly on reducing rates as it seeks to finish off its fight against high inflation. Officials see the economy as being in a “good place” and their policy settings as appropriate for an environment with receding recession risks but nagging concerns about inflation.</p><p>Stoking fears are a spate of economic policies in the pipeline from President Trump, which include sweeping tariffs, mass deportations, widespread deregulatory efforts and lower taxes. The economic impact of those policies is unclear, but policymakers and economists appear most wary about the possibility of fresh price pressures at a time when progress on taming inflation has been bumpy.</p><p>The Fed will release its January policy statement at 2 p.m. in Washington, and Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, will hold a news conference right after.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is what to watch.</p><ul><li><p><strong>A prudent pause: </strong>A pause on interest rate cuts from the Fed has been an a highly expected outcome ever since Mr. Powell stressed this fall that the central bank was not “in a hurry” to bring them down. The argument for a gradual pace of rate cuts rests on the fact that, despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has held up well, gradually cooling but not cracking.</p></li><li><p><strong>How restrictive are rates? </strong>Beyond how long a pause might last, there is also debate over how much the Fed will be able to reduce rates overall to balance its goals of bringing down inflation while maintaining a healthy labor market. The answer depends on how much distance officials think they need to travel to reach a level of interest rates that they perceive as “neutral” for the economy. In December, Mr. Powell said that at the current range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, rates were still “meaningfully restrictive.” How Mr. Powell characterizes the current level of interest rates on Wednesday will signal the scope of cuts the Fed may be planning for this year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s policies in the limelight:</strong> When officials pulled together their latest projections for where they expected inflation and interest rates to be at the end of 2025, some layered in assumptions about what President Trump’s second term would bring. Others adjusted their forecasts based solely on the incoming data, and a third cohort declined to specify their approach. Mr. Powell is likely to face questions about how the Fed is thinking about policies like tariffs and deportations now that Mr. Trump has started to follow through on those campaign promises.</p></li><li><p><strong>Short versus long term:</strong> Will Mr. Trump’s policies affect the economy in a temporary way, in which the Fed will likely look past those effects? Or, will they alter the course for inflation and the labor market more meaningfully and require the Fed to act? In Mr. Trump’s first term, the Fed responded to heightened trade tensions by pre-emptively lowering rates to ward off an unnecessary economic slowdown. Inflation at the time was subdued, vastly different from the current backdrop. Mr. Trump has said he wants rates to come down — and fast — setting up a potential clash with the central bank if the economic conditions do not warrant rate cuts.</p></li><li><p><strong>New Fed voters:</strong> This week’s meeting will feature a changing of the guards, with a new set of policymakers casting votes on policy decisions this year. Each of the Fed’s seven governors in Washington vote at every meeting, as does the president of New York’s regional bank, John Williams. Four of the remaining 11 regional presidents vote on a rotating basis. This year’s newest voting members are Susan Collins of Boston, Austan Goolsbee of Chicago, Alberto Musalem of St. Louis and Mr. Schmid of Kansas City. All four have urged patience on additional rate cuts.</p></li></ul></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
