		<div>
			
			<p>I&#39;m not saying crashies is bad, but calling eeiu a t2 player while he was performing well on a team placing 4th at a masters event is insane.</p>
<p>Also sorry but saying 100T&#39;s run was a fluke because they lost one match to KRÜ and simultaneously arguing that NRG was actually good and it was &#34;a combination of things&#34; is wild.</p>
<p>Eeiu was better than crashies this year. You&#39;re free to believe crashies still has more potential for next year. But eeiu was the 5th highest rated player in Americas stage 2, while crashies barely beat out Xeppaa by 0.01 rating points.</p>
<p>Calling eeiu a t2 player while praising crashies after watching this year of valorant is so far beyond delusional it&#39;s not even funny.</p>		</div>

	<div data-post-id="4082629">

			<p>When did I say NRG was good? They weren&#39;t good lmao, I said they COULD have been good but their year was a disaster for those reasons I listed (ch0t and bad roster moves, benching demon1 specifically was the most braindead move)</p>
<p>Like be real, if you swapped eeiu for crashies on that nrg roster and re-do the year, he&#39;s going to perform undoubtedly worse. NRG was a disaster, nobody on that team did well and no replacement would have done better</p>
<p>And I will call 100t&#39;s run a fluke because if they can SLAP sentinels (who placed 4th at champs and won masters madrid), they should not be losing to KRU (who got weaker imo. they made champs because it was 100t standing in their way this time and not leviatan, an actual threat)</p>
<p>eeiu is a good player (who stood out on a mediocre team) I&#39;m not saying he should retire or anything braindead like that but seeing people stating that he or verno (who is 110% a t2 player) are suddenly better than crashies because he had a down year are out of their mind</p>		</div>
