</span>, who was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/587079/talon-removed-from-vct-pacific" target="_blank">recently removed</a>. As they enter the league, they have <a href="https://x.com/fullsense_gg/status/1997958076176159154" target="_blank">signed</a> the full roster of Talon, with <span data-ref-id="2">Thanyathon		&#34;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/27254/leviathan">Leviathan</a>&#34;
		Nakmee</span> coming in to replace <span data-ref-id="3">Thanamethk		&#34;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3977/crws">Crws</a>&#34;
		Mahatthananuyut</span>, who has moved to the coaching role.</p>

<p>FULL SENSE has been present in the Pacific scene since 2020, competing in Challengers Thailand. They were a top team in the league, and were contenders for qualifying to international events in the wider SEA region. Eventually, the orange flame was represented on the international stage for the first time at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/449/valorant-champions-2021/group-stage" target="_blank">Champions 2021</a> after winning the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/560/champions-tour-asia-pacific-last-chance-qualifier" target="_blank">APAC LCQ</a>. Unfortunately, at Champions, Full Sense took a swift exit, being eliminated in last place without winning a map.</p>

<p>After 2021, FULL SENSE has yet to return to the international stage, but have continued to consistently field competitive Thai rosters in Pacific. In <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2146/champions-tour-2024-pacific-ascension" target="_blank">2024</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2535/vct-2025-pacific-ascension/group-stage" target="_blank">2025</a>, they managed to reach Ascension Pacific as a top team from the SEA region.</p>

<p>Now, after three full seasons competing in Challengers, FULL SENSE will get to see the VCT stage for the first time in Pacific. Maintaining Thai representation in the league, they will retain Talon&#39;s previously top three roster of Thai players.</p>

	<p>Killua even confirmed it’s jitboys. Maybe right now FS bot acc are mad at me and downvoted my post because they can’t accept the fact that if Crws joins any org that wants to keep the roster together, as Frost sent to Riot, Crws won’t retire. They’re trying to create a narrative that Crws wants to retire 😥 </p>
