Normally, the governor is in charge of the National Guard, and in Los Angeles, local and state authorities had not sought help in dealing with the protests. So nobody asked for this, and it’s only going to make things worse. And in Los Angeles, there’s a word for that: ‘Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“There has been some pelting of police and I.C.E. agents with rocks and garbage. For instance, people began throwing objects at law enforcement in a protest that started when demonstrators took over the 101, though locals were quick to point out they should’ve taken over the 405 to the 5, saved at least 10 minutes on the road to fascism.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Also, if you’re against property damage and protesters flying un-American flags, you guys would’ve hated Jan. 6.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“And quick question for those of you who live in that area: Is your city ever not on fire? Whether you win a basketball championship, a World Series championship, whether you have an exploding piñata gender reveal gone wrong — congratulations, it’s a boy and an evacuation! — or you’re just protesting the Trump administration’s expanded deportation raids, L.A. continues to be our most flammable city.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-302dde52">The Punchiest Punchlines (The Long Breakup Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“Everybody’s still talking about Trump’s feud with Elon Musk, and apparently, Trump is considering getting rid of the Tesla that he bought a few months ago — although that’s the same feeling every Tesla owner has.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Giving up the car makes sense. I mean, after a breakup, you always get rid of things that remind you of your ex.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“I wouldn’t worry. The dude has plenty of breakups. You know his policy — don’t cry because it’s over, frown because it happened.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“When asked in a phone call on Friday with The New York Post about his feud with Elon Musk, President Trump said, ‘Nothing catches me by surprise. Nothing.’ Right, except for that time you won, that time you lost, and wind.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“Amid his escalating feud with Elon Musk, President Trump said last week that he was ‘not even thinking about Elon.’ Which is weird, because the question was about tariffs.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“When asked in a new interview about Elon Musk tweeting that he was in the Jeffrey Epstein files, President Trump said, ‘That’s called old news.’ Never a good sign when someone accuses you of being in the Epstein files and your response is, ‘Please, everybody knows that already. I’ve done so much worse.’” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>John Oliver delved into the wild world of salmon facials with a med spa segment on Sunday’s “Last Week Tonight.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><h2 id="link-102ce59">What We’re Excited About on Tuesday Night</h2></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Bella Ramsey, star of “The Last of Us,” will discuss the show’s season finale on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Phillipa Soo, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Jasmine Cephas Jones and the rest of the original “Hamilton” cast reunited Sunday night at Radio City Music Hall to perform a medley of songs on the Tonys broadcast.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
