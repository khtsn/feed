So it’s time to ask once again: What should the U.S. be doing now?</p><p>Today I am talking with Megan Stack about Ukraine. She is a contributing writer for The New York Times and was the Moscow Bureau chief for The Los Angeles Times for more than three years. Megan and I have been writing about the Ukraine war since the Russian invasion, and I wanted to have a conversation with her about the state of the conflict, the state of international diplomacy and what might come next.</p><p>Megan, thanks so much for joining me.</p><p><strong>Megan K. Stack:</strong> Thank you so much for having me.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> You wrote <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/opinion/trump-ukraine-russia-war.html" title="">a piece</a> last November after the presidential election, in which you argued that Donald Trump needed to move to try to end the war right now to try to stop the bloodshed, even if that meant ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia. But as we’ve seen, Trump has not solved this problem “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-vowed-end-ukraine-war-24-hours-conflict-still-rages-rcna203085" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in 24 hours</a>.” Trump seems to be growing increasingly frustrated with the state of negotiations. What do you think has changed since the November election?</p><p><strong>Stack:</strong> Fundamentally, Trump has come slamming into the wall of reality — several realities. The first being that Putin doesn’t want to end the war yet and doesn’t see himself as having any real incentive to make a deal. The other problem is the security guarantees. We tend to talk about Ukraine and its territorial integrity, which is a very real and very deep emotional issue, but it’s actually not the most difficult issue in resolving this. The biggest problem in the view of the Ukrainian government is: If we have a cease-fire and Russia comes back and attacks us again, who’s going to do what for us? Who can we count on?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And what they really want, first of all, would be an invitation to join NATO, and barring that, they want something that’s basically a carbon copy of Article 5 of NATO without formally being NATO. And that is a real problem because there has always been a reluctance to allow Ukraine into NATO, and so this becomes an intractable puzzle. Trump — I don’t think he fully understood those realities, and I think he was overconfident in his own ability to kind of talk his way through them.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> So here’s how I would describe, in broad brushstrokes, how I see the state of not just the conflict but people’s perceptions of the conflict: I would say two cycles of irrational optimism now replaced by grim reality. Cycle No. 1 of irrational optimism would’ve been Russian. It was the idea that they — with a really relatively small force — could invade this large country, by European standards, and take it and end its independent existence in 72, 96 hours — whatever the original timetable was. And that turned to ashes almost immediately.</p><p>But then you had this Ukrainian cycle — and maybe not truly Ukrainian, in the sense of the Ukrainians themselves having this optimism, but certainly the supporters of Ukraine in the West — when Ukraine repelled that initial assault and people thought for half a second: Ukraine can just push them out. But then the Ukrainian counteroffensive of 2023 was a bloody failure. And now it seems we’re in this position where it looks like nobody has grounds for optimism. There’s not a rational reason to believe that there’s going to be a clean breakthrough from either side. Although there are certainly rational reasons for one side or the other to think it could ultimately prevail.</p><p>But where do you see the state of the conflict right now? Who has the upper hand? How meaningful is it?</p><p><strong>Stack:</strong> My feeling is that Russia retains the upper hand, in a very slow, grinding way, on a pure military level. Russian history is full of these wars that are won not by skill or daring but really by endurance — endurance of horrible conditions for the civilian population at home and an unbelievable amount of death suffered by the troops. And then eventually you just wear the other side down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>I kind of wonder what Putin is thinking right now, because if I were Putin, I would be looking at how things are going in Europe and how quickly the dialogue about Russia is changing in Europe. And I would think that if there was a chess game going on, that I was, in fact, losing a bit. Dynamics are changing very fast and partly because of Trump. Ironically, on this level, Trump has been very bad for Putin, by making Europeans understand that it’s possible that Trump will simply disengage and that the U.S. could just disappear.</p><p>And having to contemplate what that looks like for Ukraine and for the rest of Europe while facing Putin has actually caused a more productive discussion in Europe. It seems they’re now suddenly willing to pay more. There’s discussion of peacekeeping troops, things that are happening in Europe that haven’t been happening ever, until this point. I think because they realize that there’s — even if it’s a faint possibility — a possibility that Trump will just pull the U.S. out of this somehow. And that’s really bad for Putin. Strategically, that’s terrible for Putin.</p><p><strong>French: </strong>I’ve sort of been thinking about it in the terms of three periods: short term, medium term, long term. In the short term, I don’t think there’s any real prospect for a true Russian breakthrough. In other words, they’re moving backward but very slowly, at immense cost to Russia. There’s just no short-term prospect for that kind of breakthrough.</p><p>Medium term, though, that’s what really alarms me for Ukraine. With the United States potentially pulling all the way back out from its support, the Western allies are not nearly in the position that they need to be to fill that gap. And that’s where Russia is going to have an opportunity. But then in the long term, these large-scale promised European defense expenditures will begin to bear fruit, and that’s where I see it turning against Putin. So I’m very worried about this medium-term span.</p><p><strong>Stack:</strong> Let’s talk about what you just said, because it’s pretty interesting. I agree, especially with your middle-term assessment, and I am positive that Putin is also looking at that middle term and thinking: Why should I get into these cease-fire talks? I’m going to hold on. Because I suspect that there’s a part of Putin that is still at least entertaining the idea of taking Kyiv and trying to take the entire country. Let’s suppose he does it. What’s going to happen at that point? Look at these Ukrainian forces. Can they beat the Russians? Probably not. Can they make the Russians’ lives absolutely miserable? Absolutely. They have become phenomenal at this sort of asymmetric warfare, the kind of insurgency that would no doubt get mounted with enthusiastic backing from the West.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Does Putin want to deal with that? I don’t want to deal with that if I’m Putin. I also think we have learned that Putin is extremely ambitious, extremely focused, and he does play a very, very, very long game. Realistically, so much of it hinges on Trump, and so then you’re sort of looking at Trump and trying to figure out what’s realistic from him, and he changes his mind so often and reverses course.</p><p>I have the sense lately that he does not want to just hang the Ukrainians out to dry altogether. It does seem he has walked back a lot of his most angry and churlish “America First” absolutist statements, like when he was saying he wanted Ukraine to pay him back for the military aid they’d received. He came in, he cut off aid to Ukraine, then he restored the aid to Ukraine. He asked for this very ambitious minerals deal. Then he kind of settled for a much less advantageous deal, from a U.S. pure economics perspective. And so I no longer have a strong sense of where he’s going with all of this. I don’t know what he’s doing. So that’s one factor. What do you think?</p><p><strong>French:</strong> I don’t think I know where he’s going, either. I don’t think he knows necessarily where he’s going, to be honest, because I think that he thought he could cut a deal with Putin, that he thought he had a kind of relationship with Putin where he could cut a deal. I think he thought he could get this thing done and that he thought that Ukraine was the real barrier here. By all words, by all actions, that’s how he was behaving. And then to encounter Putin — surprise! Underneath the Vladimir Putin mask is Vladimir Putin. He’s the same guy he’s always been, and to the extent that he’s changed at all, he’s hardened.</p><p>There’s been so much blood spilled, so many resources expended that Putin is more intractable, not less. And so my question — and I don’t think the administration knows the ultimate answer to this — is: Do they respond to Russian stubbornness, and do they respond to Russian aggression — further aggression and escalation of attacks on cities — by restoring support for Ukraine or re-upping a next round of support for Ukraine? Or do they respond by just washing their hands and sort of walking away from the whole thing, which may be JD Vance’s preferred outcome, to just leave this thing entirely, walk away from it, say: We tried. You deal with it. It’s your problem, Europe.</p><p>I feel that might be the most realistic, anticipated approach from the Trump administration. And if that’s the case, my short-, medium-, long-term analysis grows even more acute. That medium term grows even more dangerous.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>It seems to me that the Russian theory of victory would go something like this. I’d love to get your thoughts on this, and then I can walk through what I think the Ukrainian theory of victory is. I think the Russian theory of victory is not necessarily taking Kyiv and having to deal with a partisan insurgency and all that but what you might call annexation plus Belarus. In other words, the parts of the Donbas and Crimea that they have already annexed would remain annexed. They would annex and then continue to place pressure on Ukraine in the hopes that the Zelensky government ultimately falls and they get something like the satellite state that they had before. So that way, there’s an “independent” Ukraine; it’s just a satellite. And so that would, I would say, be the realistic Russian vision.</p><p>And the Ukrainian theory — I don’t think Ukrainians think they’re going to sweep the Russians back out. I don’t think that they think that they can retake the Donbas or Crimea. I don’t think that they necessarily believe Putin would keep his nuclear weapons on the shelf if Crimea, for example, were about to fall.</p><p>But I do think that they think a South Korea kind of arrangement could be possible, maybe not where they’re joining NATO — and not where there’s American boots guaranteeing security — but taking advantage of potential French and British willingness to deploy troops as that kind of tripwire force, as that deterrent force.</p><p>I could see that as a Ukrainian theory of victory: cease-fire, deployment of European troops, massive military assistance to turn itself into something like a porcupine: just too tough for Russia to try to attack again. How attainable do you think it is that you could get a cease-fire agreement out of Russia that would ultimately allow, say, French or British troops to help backstop Ukrainian troops after a cease-fire? Is that even something realistic to think about?</p><p><strong>Stack: </strong>I don’t necessarily see Europe easily contributing peacekeeping troops. I know that the British and the French have talked about it. I think the Germans talked about it in sort of a noncommittal, squishy way. And I do think one of the contributions that Trump can make here is to force a greater Europeanization of this situation and the response to it, because I think that is appropriate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>We can talk later about what America’s interests are in this situation at this point in geopolitics and to what extent can we afford to be the guarantors of former Soviet republics faced with a revanchist threat from Putin. To a certain extent, Europe is a bit lost in that puzzle, because for Europe this is an existential threat, and I don’t think it’s an exaggeration.</p><p>And this is the other problem that’s unsolved by the idea of just the peacekeeping troops: There is an existential problem of Putin and what Putin will do. We sometimes make the mistake of understanding Putin as a single person, and I don’t really see him that way anymore. He would not be the only one to continue the project of Putin. If he were not there, there are other people who would probably come into power and whose politics are quite similar and in some cases even worse.</p><p>I don’t think we have an answer to how to deal with Putin. If I had that answer, I would’ve written it in The New York Times already. I don’t know what we should do with Putin. I think it’s really, really hard.</p><p><strong>French: </strong>Same, same.</p><p><strong>Stack: </strong>Not to be a downer, and I wish I could say that would solve things. It might put a Band-Aid on things for a little bit, but I still think there would be a lot of disintegration and eventually another blowup.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> I’m glad you raised that this is beyond Putin, because one of the other cases of irrational optimism I’ve seen is this idea that if Putin goes away, this war goes away, that Putin is some sort of unique manifestation of Russian ambitions and not a historical manifestation of Russian ambitions, which he absolutely is. And it’s not as if there were this vibrant, lively, liberal democratic alternative that’s just hovering out there ready to take the scene. He’s done a very good job of stamping out those elements of society, and he does have critics from his right — in other words, people who would want greater aggression.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>I’m starting to feel this is not the most uplifting podcast that’s ever been recorded.</p><p><strong>Stack:</strong> Yes, I agree with everything you just said about Putin. He is not singular, and in fact, yes, he does get criticized from his right. And there are probably political figures in Russia who already might have veered toward the nuclear option in dealing with some of the things that have happened in Ukraine, and Putin didn’t, and he was criticized. So let’s get that established. That’s all true.</p><p>With that said, no sensible Russian leader is going to want to stay mired in that kind of isolation. In many ways it’s a cultural isolation, Russia’s isolated from the part of the world that it really feels it belongs with, which is Europe. Eventually, when Putin is gone, whoever comes in, at least there will be a clean slate. With Putin, there’s so much damage, and there’s so much — it’s not even water under the bridge; it’s blood under the bridge. He doesn’t like us. He will never trust the U.S. He will never trust the West. And I don’t think the U.S. and the West will ever trust him.</p><p>So in that sense, it would be good. But I think there’s too much optimism, I agree, with the idea that when Putin is gone, these problems will be resolved. I don’t think that’s true.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> I’m starting to think that if we have a title for this podcast, it should be called “Too Much Optimism.” [Stack laughs.]</p><p>So let’s end with trying to forecast a little bit of what the historical perspective will be. When this conflict kicked off, the Biden administration was an administration that was still part of what you might call the postwar consensus — to the extent that we had a lot of consensus in approaching, say, the Soviet Union after World War II.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>It was centered on NATO. It was centered on a global network of alliances. That is not the case now. I think America will still be in NATO in 2028. But I’m not certain that it will be. There is a lot that’s much more contingent. It’s just very different.</p><p>When we’re looking back in history at this war, where’s this going to sit? Is this going to be considered a tipping point? Is this going to be considered one of those conflicts that’s the harbinger of a sea change, or is it going to be sort of seen as an aberration in a hopefully long and enduring record of post-World War II great-power peace? And I know that’s a very hard question.</p><p><strong>Stack:</strong> I’m gathering my many thoughts. Look, we are in an era that will be remembered as the changing of world order in some way.</p><p>There is the rise of China. There is the weakening of the West, to a certain extent. But there are also new forces that are getting a greater stage to talk about world affairs from their own perspective. We talk about, for instance, the global south.</p><p>And we’re in a moment now when there are rising countries like China but also India. You see the BRICS countries, and they have a different view of world affairs, and they have a different set of priorities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>So the Ukraine war is challenging the U.S. to explain what our priorities are as a country and where we need to go and fight and what is worth defending and what is not worth defending.</p><p>We’re seeing the U.S. turn inward more culturally at this point, in a way, and this idea that there’s a cynicism — unfortunately not unfounded — after the series of conflicts that I would say started probably with the Vietnam War.</p><p>Americans are no longer as easily convinced that this is a moral war and therefore we’re just going to go fight it, because they’ve seen too many holes in that argument and they’ve seen too many things happen that didn’t correspond to that.</p><p>I’m being vague, but I do think it is possible that the Ukraine war will be remembered — I don’t know if this is a good comparison — a bit like the Afghanistan war by Americans, in that they may end up seeing it as a place where they sank a huge amount of effort and there was a resentment about the money spent there and that somehow we still didn’t forestall what was going to happen anyway.</p><p>I also think it’s possible that somehow Ukraine will drag along and that Europe will step up and that we will maintain some level of support that at least allows the situation to limp along until some sort of Ukrainian independence is somehow safeguarded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>But Biden thought of foreign policy in terms of NATO, and I just don’t think 20 years from now, NATO is going to have much relevance.</p><p>So I don’t think it is the catalyst for these changes, but I think it will be remembered as an inflection point. Wars don’t really make their mark in history until the end comes.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> In the run-up to the 2024 election, the one thing I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt was that 100 years from now, historians will be talking about this war. And the outcome of this war could very well dictate what happens in Western Europe and, by extension, much of the rest of the world for a generation or more.</p><p>And so I’ve thought about it in different terms from Afghanistan. One of the things that was so discouraging about Afghanistan wasn’t just the difficulty in defeating the Taliban and the inherent incredible frustration of counterinsurgency warfare. But there was also this sense that we poured resources into people who didn’t really stand on their own. And that the instant we lifted American presence from Afghanistan, the place just folded, almost faster than a house of cards collapses. It was remarkable how fast.</p><p>Ukraine, on the other hand, is very, very different in two senses. One, it’s not American boots on the ground. And two, we have poured resources into people who are fighting with unbelievable courage. Now, that’s not to denigrate — there were Afghans who fought courageously. But as a whole, the people of Ukraine are fighting with unimaginable courage and sacrifice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>And my view is, so long as the courage is sustained, so should the support. If Ukraine is going to fall, it should not fall because of a lack of American and Western support. And if it falls because of a lack of American and Western support, then that will make the conflict even more important for a generation and even more catastrophic for a generation.</p><p><strong>Stack:</strong> I see that, and I hear that argument. I don’t see it in exactly the same way.</p><p>I don’t think we disagree at all about the foundational causes of the war or who’s good and who’s bad. But we have a different take on where it fits into American interests and our involvement.</p><p>Because I look at it — and I don’t think this is all it is, but after watching the U.S. interact with Ukraine and Russia over many years and watching almost the train wreck of this war coming about — I don’t think we can ignore the fact that there is a perceived strategic advantage in this war for the United States.</p><p>I wrote <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/opinion/trump-ukraine-russia-war.html" title="">a piece</a> some months ago in which I said it is fair to call Ukraine a proxy war. I don’t think Ukraine is only a proxy war, and I completely agree with you about the courage of the Ukrainians and the righteousness of their cause. But I do think that to some extent, the question of “What do we do about Russia and what do we do about Putin?” has found an answer in the idea that one thing that we can do, since the Ukrainians are fighting anyway, is we can back them, and we can put as much resource as we can into their fights so that we can drain Russia and wear Russia down and hopefully weaken Russia to an extent where they become less formidable. And there’s a strategic advantage in doing that.</p><p>I fully believe that is a crucial layer of what the U.S. thinks when they look at Ukraine and why we’ve decided to do this. And I don’t know if that’s moral or immoral toward Ukraine. On the one hand, our strategic interest in that sense does align with what Ukraine wants to do anyway. On the other hand, I have watched over and over as we and the West have sort of encouraged Ukraine and dangled things that we weren’t really going to deliver and emboldened them to face off against Russia but never really come in at a level that would be required to protect them from Russia when the wrath comes their way.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>I am not sure that our behavior as the U.S. has been ethical. I have a lot of disagreements with it. I guess that’s the counterpoint to what you were saying.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> If there’s one thing to take away from this, it’s that we should approach this situation with humility because it is extraordinarily difficult, extraordinarily dangerous, with a very long and tangled history, and so it does not lend itself to easy answers.</p><p>I appreciate you very much for coming on and hashing this out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/opinion/05opinions-french-stack/05opinions-french-stack-mobileMasterAt3x-v3.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/opinion/05opinions-french-stack/05opinions-french-stack-mobileMasterAt3x-v3.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/opinion/05opinions-french-stack/05opinions-french-stack-mobileMasterAt3x-v3.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A drone carrying a bomb" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/opinion/05opinions-french-stack/05opinions-french-stack-articleLarge-v3.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/opinion/05opinions-french-stack/05opinions-french-stack-articleLarge-v3.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/opinion/05opinions-french-stack/05opinions-french-stack-jumbo-v3.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/opinion/05opinions-french-stack/05opinions-french-stack-superJumbo-v3.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1633w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/848fc788-45b3-594b-9932-7f348f24cc88" decoding="async" width="600" height="600"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Illustration by The New York Times; photograph by Paula Bronstein/Getty</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p><strong>Thoughts?</strong> Email us at <a href="mailto:theopinions@nytimes.com" title="">theopinions@nytimes.com</a>.</p><p>This episode of “The Opinions” was produced by Derek Arthur.
