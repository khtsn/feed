Among those killed were the owner of the bar and the bar owner’s children, the interior minister, Danilo Saranovic, said at a news conference.</p><p>The authorities identified the gunman as a 45-year-old man named Aco Martinovic. “At this moment, we are focused on arresting him,” Mr. Saranovic said. </p><p>Later in the day, Prime Minister Milojko Spajic said that the suspect was dead.
