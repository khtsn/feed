    <h1>Warren Questions Bessent Over Musk Access to Treasury Payment System</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“I am alarmed that as one of your first acts as secretary, you appear to have handed over a highly sensitive system responsible for millions of Americans’ private data — and a key function of government — to an unelected billionaire and an unknown number of his unqualified flunkies,” wrote Ms. Warren, who also sits on the Senate Finance Committee.</p><p>The Musk allies who have been granted access to the payment system were made Treasury employees, passed government background checks and obtained the necessary security clearances, according to two people familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal arrangements. While their access was approved, the Musk representatives have yet to gain operational abilities and no government payments have been blocked, the people said.</p><p>Mr. Musk on Sunday accused career Treasury officials of “breaking the law every hour of every day by approving payments that are fraudulent or do not match the funding laws passed by Congress.”</p><p>The misleading accusation, which he lobbed without evidence on his social media platform, X, is the only official explanation that the Trump administration has provided about its interest in scrutinizing the Treasury Department’s payment system. The system is typically run by civil servants at Treasury, which carries out payments submitted by agencies across the government and disbursed more than $5 trillion in the 2023 fiscal year.</p><p>The Treasury Department has declined to comment about the matter, which has dominated Mr. Bessent’s first week in the job.</p></div></div>
