    <h1>Israeli Ground Forces Seize Part of Gaza Corridor, Raising Pressure on Hamas</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Israel ground forces pushed deeper into the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, taking over parts of a major corridor that bisects the Palestinian enclave, in the most significant ground operation since the collapse of the cease-fire with Hamas.</p><p>The operation followed wide-scale Israeli aerial bombardment in Gaza that began early on Tuesday morning, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-cease-fire-hamas.html" title="">ending the fragile truce</a> between Israel and Hamas that had held since mid-January. More than 400 people were killed, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>The Israeli military said soldiers had begun “targeted ground activities” along the road — known as the Netzarim Corridor — to create a “partial buffer zone” between northern and southern Gaza. Israeli forces had widened their control “to the center of the Netzarim Corridor,” the military said.</p><p>Israel has not returned to full-scale war in Gaza that would match the intensity of its 15-month aerial bombardment and ground invasion. But by gradually stepping up attacks, Israeli leaders appeared to be trying to force Hamas to come to more favorable terms for a settlement.</p></div></div>
