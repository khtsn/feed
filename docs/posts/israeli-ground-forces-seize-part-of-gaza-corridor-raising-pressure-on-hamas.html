More than 400 people were killed, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>The Israeli military said soldiers had begun “targeted ground activities” along the road — known as the Netzarim Corridor — to create a “partial buffer zone” between northern and southern Gaza. Israeli forces had widened their control “to the center of the Netzarim Corridor,” the military said.</p><p>Israel has not returned to full-scale war in Gaza that would match the intensity of its 15-month aerial bombardment and ground invasion. But by gradually stepping up attacks, Israeli leaders appeared to be trying to force Hamas to come to more favorable terms for a settlement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a televised address, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, vowed that Israel would negotiate only alongside attacks on Hamas.

Palestinians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/middleeast/northern-gaza-palestinians-return.html" title="">returned home en masse</a> in emotional scenes, often finding little but rubble where their homes and neighborhoods once stood. </p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
