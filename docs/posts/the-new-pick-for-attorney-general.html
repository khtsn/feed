She left that post in 2019 and became a lobbyist for a powerhouse Republican firm. While there, she represented major corporations and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/pam-bondi-trump-ag-lobbyist.html" title="">foreign governments with interests before the U.S. government</a>.</p><p>Like Gaetz, Bondi is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/pam-bondi-attorney-general-trump.html" title="">a Trump loyalist</a>. She served on Trump’s legal team during his first impeachment and oversaw the filing of voting-related lawsuits in battleground states. </p><p>The president-elect has been keen to install a close ally at the Justice Department. He has vowed to purge the agency of what he calls “deep state” foes — suggesting an end to the department’s longstanding practice of independence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The aftermath of an attack in Beirut, Lebanon, this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-284544ee">Terms of Lebanon cease-fire begin to take shape</h2><p>After weeks of punishing combat between Israeli forces and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, the contours of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-lebanon.html" title="">potential cease-fire agreement appear to be taking shape</a>, several officials said.</p><p>The proposed agreement calls for a 60-day truce, during which Israeli forces would withdraw from southern Lebanon and Hezbollah fighters would pull back to the north.
