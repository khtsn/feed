On Friday evening, officials announced a curfew in parts of the city until 6 a.m.</p><p>“This is going to be a very exhausting and extensive search pattern,” Commissioner Jenkerson said.</p><p>The Barnes-Jewish Hospital, Missouri’s largest hospital, received about 20 to 30 injured patients. A number were in critical condition, but most were expected to be discharged on Friday, a spokeswoman said. The St. Louis Children’s Hospital received 15 patients with storm-related injuries, all but two of whom were expected to be released on Friday.</p><p>The National Weather Service in St. Louis said it confirmed a tornado on its radar on Friday afternoon.</p><p>Large portions of the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic were at significant risk of severe weather on Friday, as a multiday storm system moved slowly east. A bull’s-eye centered over parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky was at risk for some of the most severe weather.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/16/multimedia/16weather-damage-bpfg/16weather-damage-bpfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/16/multimedia/16weather-damage-bpfg/16weather-damage-bpfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/16/multimedia/16weather-damage-bpfg/16weather-damage-bpfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Piles of bricks on the front lawn of a church with damaged car parked in front." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/16/multimedia/16weather-damage-bpfg/16weather-damage-bpfg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/16/multimedia/16weather-damage-bpfg/16weather-damage-bpfg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/16/multimedia/16weather-damage-bpfg/16weather-damage-bpfg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/16/multimedia/16weather-damage-bpfg/16weather-damage-bpfg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/80855103-dc8d-591b-8c24-8713222b6b3b" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Part of Centennial Christian Church in St. Louis, Mo., collapsed on Friday after a tornado swept through the city.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Phillis/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-12b77b55">Here are the key things to know:</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wick3dweather/video/7505138769897508126" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Images on social media</a> showed numerous trees down in St. Louis.

But the area of highest concerns were in Bloomington, Ind.; Evansville, Ind.; Louisville, Ky.; and St. Louis.</p><p>Those areas were at particular risk of supercells, highly organized, longer-lasting storms that produce stronger winds and larger hail — in the case of Friday, bigger than baseballs — than typical thunderstorms.</p><p>The National Weather Service office in St. Louis warned of hail of nearly three inches in diameter and damaging winds. <a href="https://x.com/JakeNea2/status/1923471144771846636" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Large hail</a> was reported in Van Buren, Mo., about 150 miles south of St. Louis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Parts of Kentucky particularly and southern Ohio will have the potential for multiple rounds of thunderstorms and each producing heavy rain,” said Richard Bann, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center.</p><p>On Friday, a curtain of dust pushed into Chicago at about 6:30 p.m. and visibility dropped to a quarter-mile at Chicago Midway International Airport and near zero on highways.</p><p>Weather Service forecasters in Chicago issued a dust storm warning for portions of northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, including the Kankakee River Valley.</p><p>This is only the third time the office has ever issued a dust storm warning.</p><p>“This is not common at all,” said Zachary Wack, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Chicago.</p><p>Mr. Wack said webcams along sections of Interstates 55 and 57 showed zero visibility. The dust storm was kicked up by powerful winds generated by thunderstorms that raced across central Illinois.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The threat of thunderstorms comes to the Midwest in a week marked by unseasonably warm weather.</p><p>The heat was expected to continue on Friday, with many locations across the region forecast to record afternoon highs in the 80s and 90s. Lower temperatures are predicted to arrive this weekend as cooler, drier air sweeps in from the northwest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-3b17cd53">The Northeast also saw severe weather earlier in the day.</h2><p>On Friday afternoon, thunderstorms moved through southern New Jersey, northern Delaware, northern Maryland and southeastern Pennsylvania.</p><p>The area was under a severe thunderstorm watch, with the storms capable of delivering hail as big as limes and winds up to 70 miles per hour.</p><p>Flash-flood warnings were issued across several areas, including Philadelphia and Trenton, N.J., and a few tornado warnings were in effect in southern New Jersey.</p><p>Aimee Ortiz<!-- --> and <!-- -->Simon J.
