    <h1>Syria Rebels Take Aleppo Airport and Attack Hama, Officials and a Monitor Say</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“The United States, together with its partners and allies, urge de-escalation, protection of civilians and minority groups, and a serious and credible political process that can end this civil war once and for all,” Mr. Savett said.</p><p>A Syrian government statement said that Mr. Assad had spoken to the leaders of the United Arab Emirates and Iraq on Saturday, vowing that Syria would “defeat the terrorists, regardless of the intensity of their attacks.” Syrian officials routinely refer to rebels as terrorists.</p><p>Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, referred to the situation in Syria in Parliament on Sunday, saying that “Islamic countries must intervene to prevent America and Israel from exploiting the internal conflicts of countries and prevent the continuation of these crises.”</p><p>And the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he was heading to Damascus on Sunday. Ali Moujani, an Iranian diplomat, said on X that the foreign minister was making the trip in a show of support for the Syrian government.</p><p>The Syrian military said in a statement on Saturday that its operation to push back the rebels was “successfully” progressing and that it would soon initiate a counterattack. It tried to discredit reports about rebel advances, saying that the armed groups were spreading “false news” to “undermine the morale of our people and our brave army.”</p><p>Across the territory that had flipped back to the rebels, people could be seen tearing up Syrian government flags and pictures of Mr. Assad, including fighters and former Aleppo residents who were returning to their homes for the first time in years. Photos taken in Aleppo also showed the toppling of a statue that had apparently depicted Bassel al-Assad, the president’s elder brother.</p><p>Hwaida Saad<!-- --> contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, <!-- -->Rania Khaled<!-- --> from Cairo and <!-- -->Leily Nikounazar<!-- --> from Brussels.</p></div></div>
