Oklahoma when it was hit by Japanese torpedoes at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and who was among the last living service members who survived the surprise attack, died on March 1 in Alexandria, La. He was 102.</p><p>His death, in a nursing center near his longtime home in Many, La., was confirmed by his grandson John Mahaffey.</p><p>Mr. Mahaffey later survived the sinking of another Navy ship that was torpedoed by the Japanese in the Pacific. In an interview on Sunday, John Mahaffey, his grandson, said that Mr. Mahaffey would talk about his time in the Navy only when his relatives would ask him about it, which they did often.</p><p>A month or less before one of the ships was attacked — John Mahaffey is fairly sure it was the Oklahoma — Mr. Mahaffey was given a new assignment and was moved from a room where powder was stored.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“He went from being in the hull to on the deck, and that saved his life,” his grandson said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mahaffey swam to the U.S.S.

Within minutes, the battleship capsized, trapping hundreds of men below deck. “It didn’t take that long to come back to the other side,” he said. “It turned upside down and we had to slide over the bottom of the ship into the water.”</p><p>He managed to swim to the U.S.S. Maryland, another battleship that was moored at Pearl Harbor.</p><p>In total, 429 crew members from the Oklahoma were killed in the attack, which left more than 2,400 U.S. military personnel and civilians dead and nearly 1,800 wounded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Less than a year later, he was serving on the U.S.S.

Mr. Mahaffey, who was 5-foot-3, was a pole climber who refused to accept jobs that would require him to work indoors, John Mahaffey said.</p><p>“They kept trying to give him promotions, to come inside, to take a desk job or to run the crews or to be a supervisor, and he would never take it,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mahaffey in an undated family photograph.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via John Mahaffey</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After he was discharged from the Navy, Mr. Mahaffey worked for Southwestern Bell, the regional phone company, for about 30 years, his grandson said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via John Mahaffey</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>At 100, Mr. Mahaffey was still able to drive and look after his large garden, though his health started to decline in the past year or so, his grandson said.

The oldest is 105, Ms. Farley said in an email. John Mahaffey said his family had been told that his grandfather was one of just two or three remaining survivors from the U.S.S. Oklahoma.</p></div></section></article></div>
