Specifically, toy stores.</p><p>“You know, somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are going to be open,’” Mr. Trump said. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.”</p><p>This, from the billionaire, crypto-salesman, golf-club-operating, Palm Beach-by-way-of-Fifth Avenue president with the golden office and the golden triplex apartment. There he sat, surrounded by the other billionaires with whom he has filled his cabinet, telling the boys and girls of America they’ll just have to make do with fewer toys this year for the greater good.</p><p>This grinchy pronouncement by the president had the value of being truthful.</p><p>Many American toymakers and retailers have started to pause their orders as the effects of Mr. Trump’s tariffs ripple out, threatening to snarl supply chains. It could all have a big impact on this year’s holiday season since it takes months to manufacture, package and ship many products to the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Greg Ahearn, chief executive of the Toy Association, a U.S. industry group representing 850 toy manufacturers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/trump-tariffs-christmas-china.html" title="">told The Times</a> that there is now a “frozen supply chain that is putting Christmas at risk.”</p><p>“If we don’t start production soon,” Mr. Ahearn said, “there’s a high probability of a toy shortage this holiday season.”</p><p>You hear that, kids?</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shawn McCreesh is a White House reporter for The Times covering the Trump administration.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
