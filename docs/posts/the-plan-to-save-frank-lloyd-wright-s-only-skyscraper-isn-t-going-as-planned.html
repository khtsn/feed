Designed by Wright to resemble a tree, with green, oxidized copper paneling, it’s featured on a mural nearby that depicts bison, an oil well and other anchors of the city’s heritage.</p><p>But the tower is now in trouble.</p><p>Once a buzzy hub of business life, and briefly occupied by Phillips Petroleum, the oil company that has long called Bartlesville home, it has struggled for many years to find an anchor tenant. It was reinvented as a nonprofit arts center in 2001 and soon added a boutique hotel and restaurant, but its major benefactor, the former Phillips chief executive <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/business/2014/12/17/former-phillips-petroleum-ceo-dies-in-bartlesville/60777194007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C.J.

There was even going to be a new upscale restaurant, called Sinatra’s.</p><p>“It seemed like there was a hero there,” said Scott Perkins, a former curator of Price Tower’s museum collection and now a senior official at Fallingwater, the home that is perhaps Wright’s most famous creation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After nearly two years, though, the $10 million has not materialized. The new owners have sold some one-of-a-kind furnishings that Wright designed for the building. And the building itself is up sale, listed on a commercial real estate auction website next to hollowed out strip malls and an empty Burger King.</p><p>Ms. Blanchard said she underestimated the challenge of profitably operating the tower and that selling some of the furnishings was necessary to meet expenses.</p><p>“We have done nothing illegal or nothing wrong,” she said of the Copper Tree Group’s handling of the building. “We’ve tried to do everything with the utmost transparency and professionalism.”</p><p>That rationale has done little to assuage preservationists who have worked for decades to protect the building as part of Wright’s legacy. The Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, which has a preservation easement on the property, is working to block any further sale of the furnishings by filing liens against Ms. Blanchard’s company.</p><p>“Under the terms of the easement, they are not to sell easement-protected items without our consent,” said Barbara Gordon, the executive director of the conservancy.</p><p>For some Bartlesville residents who see the tower as the town’s centerpiece, it has been disappointing to watch a rescue effort unveiled with such optimism dissolve with such speed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“My sweet, 88-year-old mom is like, ‘I wish I could win the lottery and buy the tower,’” said Maria Swindell Gus, the tourism director for Bartlesville. “I’ve heard that from a lot of people.”</p><h2 id="link-3153cdd9">The tree that escaped the crowded forest</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Wright, with a model of Price Tower in Oklahoma. “Now the skyscraper comes into its own,” he said at the building’s dedication, in 1956, “on the rolling plains of Oklahoma.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettmann, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Skyscrapers were never really a core part of Wright’s vision. For his mentor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/31/arts/design/31antiques.html" title="">Louis Sullivan</a>? Yes. But Wright was known for low-lying houses that sunk into their natural environments.</p><p>His design for a skyscraper with copper panels and single-pane glass windows that maximize natural light was intended to be part of a series of towers to be built in New York in the 1920s. But the Depression intervened and the design lay dormant for decades until Wright was approached in 1952 by Harold Charles Price, a welder who had applied his skills to pipeline construction and rode them to success as Bartlesville’s oil fortunes bloomed.</p><p>Those oil fortunes began with the Phillips brothers, who drilled their first successful well outside the city in 1905. Their company would later become two companies, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66, and each would move their headquarters to Houston. But enough business operations remained to make those two companies Bartlesville’s top employers, even today.</p><p>The idea to get Wright involved in a new office building for the H.C. Price Company is credited to one of Price’s sons, Joe, who had studied architecture at the University of Oklahoma. He thought it would be great for Price to bring the one-of-a-kind Wright building to the city as a gesture that the company was giving something back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Wright, then in his mid-80s, saw the project as an opportunity to express his mature architectural vision, David De Long, a Wright expert, wrote in a 1982 study of the tower’s interior.</p><p>Wright, holistic in his approach, viewed exterior and interior as a whole, and spent time designing the offices and other spaces as well as the furnishings. It made for an odd office building, with few right angles. Wright thought a variety of angles encouraged more flexible human movement. Some of Wright’s furniture — chairs, desks, stools and tables — took on the same angled forms as the building.</p><p>At the building’s 1956 dedication, Wright spoke of the tower as an “upraised hand on the prairie,” as “the tree that escaped the crowded forest.”</p><p>“Now the skyscraper comes into its own,” he said, “on the rolling plains of Oklahoma.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-14"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Price Tower, appraised to be worth $6.2 million last year, is now listed for sale on an online auction site with a starting bid of $600,000.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joseph Rushmore for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The lobby of the tower, which was dedicated in 1956.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joseph Rushmore for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>When the Price company relocated to Dallas in 1981, the tower was sold to Phillips, which briefly used it for office space and storage. When the company’s need for it diminished, the building sat vacant for years before local organizers led by Mr. Silas, the former Phillips chief executive, and his wife, Theo, drove an effort to repurpose it as an arts hub for the city. Despite its small size, Bartlesville, population 37,795, has long had a certain cosmopolitan flair, with a ballet company and an annual Mozart festival, in addition to its highest-profile cultural icon, the Price Tower.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A hotel room in Price Tower, which housed a 21-room boutique hotel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joseph Rushmore for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The space of the former Copper Restaurant + Bar in Price Tower.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joseph Rushmore for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In 2001, the Phillips company donated the building to the nonprofit organization known as<span>  </span>the Price Tower Arts Center and the building soon featured a 21-room boutique hotel and the Copper Restaurant + Bar. Guests at the hotel were invited to “spend a night with Frank Lloyd Wright” and take in art exhibitions and installations that discussed the architect’s vision for the building.</p><p>In 2011, during a period when the building was seeking recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage site, the Wright conservancy was given a preservation easement on the property, empowering it to review changes in the building’s design. And when the budget did not balance in a given year, the Silases were there to close the gaps.</p><p>But after Pete Silas died in 2014 and Theo Silas in 2017, the nonprofit lost a major source of revenue and had to dip deeper and deeper into its reserves. Brad Doenges, who became the chairman of the organization in 2017, said that last year, when the building was sold to the group led by Ms. Blanchard, the only other option beyond selling was bankruptcy.</p><p>Mr. Doenges said the nonprofit was comforted by the fact that the conservancy had a preservation easement and that the new owners had a plan.</p><p>“The merits of it, the reality of it, I really can’t say,” he said in an interview. “It didn’t come to fruition, obviously.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p><h2 id="link-306cc58c">“Where History Meets the Future”</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cynthia Blanchard grew up nearby and has fond memories of seeing Price Tower as a kid. “It’s just a special place,” she said.

But she said she didn’t fully appreciate the building until she was an adult, visiting home.</p><p>“It’s just a special place,” she said. “People fall in love with it.”</p><p>Ms. Blanchard and her husband, Anthem, met in New Orleans in 2004. She was working in music publishing and had once been a background singer on a Reba McEntire album. He had been raised in New Orleans, the son of James U. Blanchard III, a wealthy pioneering seller of gold and other precious metals.</p><p>Mr. Blanchard also went into the precious metals trade, then pivoted to cryptocurrency entrepreneurship with a series of companies he started that included HeraSoft, a blockchain-based cybersecurity technology company that he co-founded with Ms. Blanchard. When the Covid lockdown began several years ago, the Blanchards relocated to Bartlesville to be closer to Ms. Blanchard’s parents, and decided to anchor HeraSoft in Bartlesville’s old, historic Washington County Courthouse.</p><p>In 2023, as the tower’s woes deepened, they were encouraged by friends with an office in the building to consider acquiring it. The nonprofit was open to the idea.</p><p>Under the sale agreement, the real estate subsidiary company of the Copper Tree Group led by Ms. Blanchard agreed to assume a standing $600,000 loan that had been taken out by a member of the nonprofit board to cover operating costs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Ms. Blanchard said her husband helped her think through how to rejuvenate Price Tower but never had a formal role and is not part of the Copper Tree Group. The plan the company put forward included a suite of revenue-generating ideas, including a new restaurant, a private membership club and a line of marketable non-fungible tokens based on the tower.</p><p>The Bartlesville Development Authority chipped in, providing $88,000 to help kick-start the two restaurants — Sinatra’s, which changed its name to WrightSteak after a trademark dispute, and a downstairs spot called Love 66 Bistro.</p><p>The new plan also came with an inspiring motto: “Where History Meets the Future.”</p><p>Little of this would ultimately materialize.</p><p>Ms. Blanchard says the $10 million was always “more of a wish list,” a combination of an expected $5 million loan that fell through and theoretical funding from state tax credits. She argued that the nonprofit had pressured her into closing on the sale too soon, before the finances were fully set; Mr. Doenges denied that characterization.</p><p>“Our due diligence wasn’t as complete as it should have been, because we jumped in with so much faith,” Ms. Blanchard said.</p><p>Still, she said, she was proud of her efforts, even though it never felt like she owned the building.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“I was just the steward,” she said. “I was kind of assigned by God to do this.”</p><h2 id="link-662a6e78">Selling off Wright’s furnishings</h2></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-28"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mural of glass and mirrors, along with some of Wright’s original furniture, in H.C.

In April, Andy Dossett, a reporter for The Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise, said he watched as two men loaded bubble-wrapped chairs and stools from the tower into a large white van.</p><p>The Copper Tree Group has sold 10 of the furnishings to a Dallas midcentury furniture reseller. Some copper tables, stools and panels, an armchair, and what is believed to be the only example of a Wright-designed office directory board, are expected to command high prices. The <a href="https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/building-garden/architectural-elements/frank-lloyd-wright-custom-casual-arm-chair-price-tower-1956/id-f_40280402/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">armchair, for example, is listed at $88,000</a>.</p><p>The Wright conservancy is trying to block any sales of the items, asserting they are covered by the preservation easement. Under the 2011 easement, the conservancy says it has the right to preserve the condition of the tower and its furnishings.</p><p>Ms. Blanchard said she believes the easement expired with the transfer of ownership to her Copper Tree Group, a position the conservancy rejects.</p><p>Ms. Blanchard said she only sold the Wright furnishings because she was “up against the wall” financially. She noted that the nonprofit, with the conservancy’s approval, had sold other furnishings in earlier years. Ms. Gordon said those items had been duplicates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Liz Waytkus, the executive director of Docomomo US, an organization that works to preserve modern architecture, said it strongly opposes any sale of the Wright materials.</p><p>“They’re trafficked goods,” Waytkus said. “The same that you would say of pottery or vases from Egypt or Mesopotamia that were obtained through illegal ways, these pieces from Frank Lloyd Wright should be thought of in the same exact way.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-32"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Two-story-high copper curtains in the restaurant-bar space at Price Tower.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joseph Rushmore for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The antique elevator in the 19-story Price Tower.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joseph Rushmore for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><h2 id="link-423d2597">For sale: A very tall Wright landmark</h2><p>The financial crisis that has befallen Price Tower will not be solved by the sale of some furniture, no matter how pricey.

The starting bid is $600,000.</p><p>There has been some concern that no local employer is in need of as much office space as the tower provides, so the new owners would likely need to take on a hodgepodge of tenants, and look to address needed renovations.</p><p>But a broker handling the sale, Scott Schlotfelt, said the building is drawing interest and Ms. Blanchard’s group may decide to accept an offer before the scheduled Oct. 7 auction.</p><p>One snag going forward could be a lawsuit filed by McFarlin Building LLC, a Tulsa development firm, that says it has a formal agreement signed by Ms. Blanchard in May to purchase the building.</p><p>Ms. Blanchard contests that claim, saying that the company put forth unreasonable last-minute purchase terms. Mr. Schlotfelt, the broker, said he is not concerned that the dispute would affect any sale or scare off bidders.</p><p>Whoever takes over the building will find a welcome partner in the conservancy, which said it is very interested in working to preserve a building that offers a unique example of Wright’s vision. “Price Tower is still a very important building,” Ms. Gordon said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>Many residents of Bartlesville, like Patti Grissom, 73, share that view. Ms. Grissom remembers walking into the tower in 1977, a young woman beginning a career in accounting with H.C. Price and excited to work at the swankiest building in town.</p><p>She later spent years working at the nonprofit as Pete Silas’s executive assistant. She said the building still had energy then and it was disappointing now to see it emptied out and vacant.</p><p>“I’m kind of heartbroken for the tower, because I just didn’t know what was going to become of it,” she said. “I just keep hoping for good news.”</p><p>Kitty Bennett<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
