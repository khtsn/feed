Several companies, including Exxon Mobil, are developing projects in Arkansas to produce lithium, which is dissolved in underground brine.</p><p>Energy and mining companies have long produced oil, gas and other natural resources in the Smackover, which extends from Texas to Florida. And the federal and state researchers said lithium could be extracted from the waste stream of the brines from which companies extracted other forms of energy and elements.</p><p>The energy industry, with the Biden administration’s encouragement, has been increasingly working to produce the raw materials needed for the lithium-ion batteries in the United States. A few projects have started recently, and many more are in various stages of study and development across the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Most of the world’s lithium is produced in Australia and South America. A large majority of it is then processed in China, which also dominates the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries.</p><p>“The potential for increased U.S. production to replace imports has implications for employment, manufacturing and supply chain resilience,” David Applegate, the director of the United States Geological Survey, said in a statement announcing the study. “This study illustrates the value of science in addressing economically important issues.”</p><p>Federal researchers also have identified other potential resources that could produce large quantities of lithium, including the Salton Sea in Southern California, where Berkshire Hathaway Energy and other companies are working to extract lithium from hot liquid pumped up from an aquifer more than 4,000 feet below the ground by geothermal power plants.</p><p>Exxon Mobil recently drilled exploratory wells in Arkansas and was evaluating whether it could extract lithium in a cost-competitive way, Dan Ammann, the president of the company’s Low Carbon Solutions business, said in an interview last month.</p><p>“We know we have an attractive resource. We’re working on understanding that cost equation, understanding the supply and demand picture,” Mr. Ammann said at the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Exxon said last year that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/business/energy-environment/exxon-mobil-lithium-arkansas.html" title="">aimed to enter production in 2027</a> and to be churning out enough lithium by 2030 to supply more than a million electric vehicles per year.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Penn is a reporter based in Los Angeles and covers the energy industry.
