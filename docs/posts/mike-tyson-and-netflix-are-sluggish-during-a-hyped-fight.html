Many fans watching at home were just as displeased: Netflix, which was airing the fight as part of its expansion into live programming, experienced a variety of technical difficulties.</p><p>Here are three takeaways from the event:</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-1"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-37992eda">A Made-for-Streaming Spectacle</h2><p>The night’s final match was not one to remember, but it capped days of spectacle.</p><p>During their weigh-in on Thursday, Tyson slapped Paul across the face, explaining later that Paul had stepped on his foot. After the fight, Paul and Tyson seemed to forgive each other in the ring. “That was a good slap, I liked that,” Paul said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Paul had entered the ring after a dramatic walkout during which he and his brother, Logan, approached in a slowly moving car. Paul, who has compiled an 11-1 record since his first professional boxing bout in 2020, easily won the fight by landing effective punches that broke through Tyson’s defense. Tyson, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/sports/othersports/tyson-quits-fight-and-may-quit-boxing-next.html" title="">last fought an official match in 2005</a>, fell to 50-7.</p><p>Netflix took advantage of the event to show off for its more than 280 million subscribers. People dressed as characters from “Squid Game,” whose second season releases next month, were shown ringside. After one of the night’s earlier fights, Netflix played a trailer from Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz’s upcoming movie, “Back in Action,” which will premiere in January.</p><p>Though the Paul-Tyson clash was underwhelming, Katie Taylor did defeat Amanda Serrano in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/arts/television/amanda-serrano-katie-taylor-womens-boxing.html" title="">a thrilling rematch of a 2022 title fight</a>.</p><h2 id="link-3faa8741">Netflix Takes Its Own Lumps</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Netflix has aggressively expanded its ambitions into live programming, but fans on Friday complained about buffering and a fuzzy picture.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brett Carlsen/Getty Images for Netflix</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Netflix’s inexperience with live events showed on Friday night as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/business/media/netflix-outage-crash-boxing.html" title="">fans on social media complained</a> about buffering, a fuzzy picture and other issues.

In 2023, a live episode of “Love Is Blind,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/arts/television/love-is-blind-netflix-reality-show.html" title="">a buzzy reality dating show</a>, was delayed by more than an hour.</p><p>Netflix is known primarily for movies, television shows and documentaries, but it has expanded its ambitions into live programming, often through sports and comedy specials. The streaming service will air two National Football League games on Christmas. In January, it will become the exclusive distributor in the United States for “Raw,” World Wrestling Entertainment’s flagship weekly program, as part of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/business/netflix-wwe-raw-wrestling.html" title="">10-year, $5 billion contract</a>.</p><p>Friday’s event was produced by Netflix and Most Valuable Promotions, a company co-founded by Paul. There were technical challenges throughout the evening.</p><p>Jerry Jones, the longtime owner of the Dallas Cowboys, needed to switch microphones during an interview.
