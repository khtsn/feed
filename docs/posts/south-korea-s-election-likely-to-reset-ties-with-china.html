Under Mr. Yoon, South Korea became more confrontational toward North Korea, shunning dialogue and encouraging the spread of outside information into the isolated country. North Korea <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/world/asia/north-korea-reunification-policy.html" title="">abandoned</a> its long-held policy of supporting reunification with South Korea, redefining the South as an enemy that must be subjugated, if necessary, with ​its nuclear weapons.</p><p>Mr. Yoon also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/asia/south-korea-us-diplomacy.html" title="">disturbed a delicate balance</a> South Korea <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/world/asia/korea-china-us-thaad-missiles.html" title="">had always ​struggled to maintain</a> between Washington and Beijing. While China emerged​ as ​South Korea’s biggest trade partner in the post-Cold War decades, the United States remained as its only military ally. Mr. Yoon​ not only openly sided with ​the United States in the strategic competition between Washington and Beijing, but he also antagonized Beijing by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-conspiracy-theories.html" title="">raising suspicions</a> that it has sent spies to South Korea and may have manipulated its elections.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“The relations between South Korea and China became the worst ever,” said Lee Jae-myung, the candidate most likely to win the presidential election according to pre-election polls. He has criticized Mr. Yoon’s policy toward China. “I will stabilize and manage the relations,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Korea’s former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, took a strong line against Chinese influence.

They pledged ​to invest more in South Korea’s defense capabilities ​and strengthen a joint deterrence with the United States to counter North Korea’s growing nuclear threat​. And they supported trilateral cooperation with the United States and Japan for regional security.</p><p>Mr. Lee and Mr. Kim ​also recognized an urgent need to establish a rapport with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/world/asia/south-korea-trump-kim-jong-un.html" title="">President Trump</a>, who is asking South Korea to pay more for 28,500 American troops based on its soil while imposing steep tariffs on cars, steel and other exports that are key for its ally’s export-driven economy.</p><p>But ​there are sharp differences too. Mr. Lee and Mr. Kim represent opposing views of a country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/world/asia/south-korea-protests.html" title="">deeply divided</a> over North Korea and China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Kim and his​ right-wing People Power Party, which had supported Mr. Yoon, called his left-wing Democratic Party opponents “pro-North Korea” and “pro-China” forces, saying they would undermine Seoul’s alliance with ​Washington for the sake of improving ties with ​Beijing and Pyongyang.</p><p>During the campaign, Mr. Kim tried to tap into widespread sentiments against North Korea, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/world/asia/korea-china-election-young-voters.html" title="">especially against China,</a> among older South Koreans and young male voters​. He called Mr. Lee ​an irresponsible fence-sitter in the geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing​, while describing himself as staunchly pro-American.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Korea’s presidential candidates Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party, left, and Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party during a TV debate in Seoul in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Kim Hong-Ji</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“China was our enemy, whose Communist Party invaded our country during the Korean War,” Mr. Kim said during a TV debate last month. “Then how can we treat China at the same level with the United States?”</p><p>Mr. Lee and his party called such accusations ​part of a witch hunt that ​South Korean ​conservatives have used to “demonize” ​their liberal rivals ever since the Cold War era.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He reiterated that he would prioritize the alliance with the United States, if he had to choose. But he accused Mr. Kim of “unnecessarily antagonizing” China, North Korea and Russia. He said he would seek “pragmatic diplomacy” and try to improve ties with those countries, within the framework of its alliance with​ Washington, to ease tensions around the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>“Cooperation with the United States and Japan is essential,” he said. “But we should not put all our eggs in one basket.”</p><p>Mr. Lee is saying “many of the right things,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. But the question, he said, was: “Are those statements coming out of the candidate’s camp a policy preview or are they campaign clichés?”</p><p>Officially, both Mr. Lee and Mr. Kim support dialogue with North Korea​. But they diverge sharply over how to deal with ​the North​’s nuclear threat.</p><p>Mr. Kim appealed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/world/asia/south-korea-nuclear-arsenal.html" title="">growing calls</a> among South Koreans for their country to build its own nuclear weapons, promising that if elected he would negotiate with Mr. Trump to be able to enrich uranium and reprocess spent nuclear fuel from ​South Korea’s nuclear ​power plants. That is what is needed to produce materials for an atomic bomb.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Koreans have closely watched North Korea’s missile tests.

He supported enriching uranium ​to secure a stable supply of fuel for South Korea’s nuclear power plants but not to build nuclear weapons.</p><p>​&#34;If we reintroduce American tactical nuclear weapons, we cannot demand that North Korea denuclearize,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Choe Sang-Hun is the lead reporter for The Times in Seoul, covering South and North Korea.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
