In the other one, federal agents converged at a Home Depot where day laborers regularly gather in search of work.</p><p>The raid at the clothing wholesaler began about 9:15 a.m. in the Fashion District, less than two miles from Los Angeles City Hall.</p><p>It was an extraordinary show of force. Dozens of federal agents wearing helmets and green camouflage arrived in two hulking armored trucks and other unmarked vehicles, and were soon approached by a crowd of immigrant activists and supporters. Some agents carried riot shields and others held rifles, as well as shotguns that appeared to be loaded with less-than-lethal ammunition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Agents cleared a path for two white passenger vans that exited the area. A short time later, as officers boarded their vehicles to leave, a few agents lobbed flash-bang grenades at groups of people who chased alongside the slow-moving convoy. Some protesters had thrown eggs and other objects at the vehicles. At one point, the vehicles snagged and crushed at least two electric scooters that protesters had used.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06nat-raid-01-btqh/06nat-raid-01-btqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06nat-raid-01-btqh/06nat-raid-01-btqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06nat-raid-01-btqh/06nat-raid-01-btqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Three people, two in green hats, assisting a man sitting on a curb and leaning against a light pole." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06nat-raid-01-btqh/06nat-raid-01-btqh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06nat-raid-01-btqh/06nat-raid-01-btqh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06nat-raid-01-btqh/06nat-raid-01-btqh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06nat-raid-01-btqh/06nat-raid-01-btqh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/5b461045-8474-5ee9-86b8-10f23a28e1bc" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David McDaniel said he was injured by a flash-bang grenade thrown by agents.

We will not stand for this.”</p><p>Hours after the raid, a second clash between protesters and federal agents broke out outside a federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles, where those who were detained were taken. At one of the entrances, protesters chanted and approached the building as officers fired less-than-lethal projectiles and squirted what appeared to be pepper spray. Some protesters threw a chair and other objects, and appeared to spray-paint anti-ICE graffiti on the building.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>By 7 p.m., the Los Angeles Police Department declared an unlawful assembly, ordered demonstrators to disperse and a line of police in riot gear started to clear the area.</p><p>The morning raid took place at a business called Ambiance Apparel.<span>  </span></p><p>Omar Diaz, 26, was working inside when several agents entered the building and corralled the roughly 20 to 30 workers inside and lined them up against a wall.</p><p>“They interviewed us one by one,” Mr. Diaz said. “They would take us separately, ask us where we were born, and then they wanted our ID and our information.”</p><p>After being detained for about an hour, Mr. Diaz, who said he is a U.S. citizen, and a few others were let go. But some of his co-workers, who are mostly immigrants from Mexico and South Korea, remained with the authorities, Mr. Diaz said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“My friend is still in there, too, so I’m worried about him,” Mr. Diaz said outside the front entrance of the building.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Omar Diaz, a worker at a clothing wholesaler, spoke to a crowd after a federal raid at his workplace in Los Angeles on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alex Welsh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A group of activists aboard a truck repeated a list of rights over a loudspeaker, hoping those detained inside could hear them.</p><p>Gloria Miguel, an organizer with a local workers group, said she saw two women crying as the raid unfolded.</p><p>“The woman was crying: ‘My husband is in there. I need help,’” Ms. Miguel said in Spanish, adding that there was another woman who was crying because her father was inside.</p><p>Agents at the scene were wearing patches on their uniforms identifying themselves as being with the F.B.I., Homeland Security Investigations and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security Investigations, said 45 people were arrested at three locations in Los Angeles after Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers executed four federal search warrants. Of the 45 people who were arrested, 44 were “administratively arrested” and one person was arrested for obstruction.</p><p>Homeland Security Investigations did not say where the three warrants were executed and did not elaborate on the meaning of “administratively arrested.”</p><p>The U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, Bill Essayli, <a href="https://x.com/usattyessayli/status/1931156650968088931?s=46&amp;t=8H3FDbkvfJkXNtBv_SrGPg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said agents arrested David Huerta,</a> the California president of the Service Employees International Union, for impeding federal agents carrying out the raid by blocking their vehicle. </p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom and other California leaders condemned the detention of Mr. Huerta, who is a well-known figure in the state’s labor movement.</p><p>“David Huerta is a respected leader, a patriot, and an advocate for working people,” the <a href="https://x.com/cagovernor/status/1931163239066509555?s=46&amp;t=8H3FDbkvfJkXNtBv_SrGPg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">governor said in a social media post</a>. “No one should ever be harmed for witnessing government action.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In recent weeks, ICE has ramped up enforcement across the country — boosting daily arrest numbers. Stephen Miller, President Trump’s deputy chief of staff, has said that ICE was looking to make a minimum of 3,000 arrests a day. The Trump administration has long targeted so-called sanctuary jurisdictions like Los Angeles, arguing that they would have to boost arrests in communities because they don’t have the same access to county jails, where they prefer to pick up immigrants.</p><p>Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. field office in Los Angeles, said the F.B.I. was supporting its partners with the Department of Homeland Security, under the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p><p>“As we have been asked to do, we are sending agents to participate in these immigration enforcement efforts,” Ms. Eimiller said. “That includes assisting in cities where major operations are already underway and where we have special agents embedded on operational teams with D.H.S.”</p><p>Officials did not detail any injuries. One man on the street said he was injured by a flash-bang grenade.</p><p>“They started throwing flash-bangs and blew everybody up with it,” the man, David McDaniel, said as he held his bloody foot. “I got shrapnel all over my body,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Mr. McDaniel said he was not part of the protest and was just trying to get by. Bystanders and legal observers assisted him as they waited for an ambulance.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters walked on the street near where the immigration raid took place. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alex Welsh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Chief Jim McDonnell of the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that his agency was not involved in civil immigration enforcement efforts.</p><p>“While the LAPD will continue to have a visible presence in all our communities to ensure public safety, we will not assist or participate in any sort of mass deportations,” Chief McDonnell said, adding that the department would not attempt to determine anyone’s immigration status.</p><p>The Los Angeles police have had a policy in place since 1979 that bars officers from initiating police action for the sole purpose of determining someone’s immigration status. California law also prohibits state and local resources from being used to help with federal immigration enforcement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The immigration sweeps in Los Angeles came one week after a similar operation in San Diego. Video of that raid showed federal agents using what appeared to be flash-bang grenades in an effort to disperse a group of people protesting the action.</p><p>That raid prompted members of Congress to write to the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, with questions about the tactics used by federal agents.</p><p>Hamed Aleaziz<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Orlando Mayorquín is a Times reporter covering California.
