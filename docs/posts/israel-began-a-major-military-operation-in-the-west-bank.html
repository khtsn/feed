    <h1>Israel Began a Major Military Operation in the West Bank</h1>

At least 10 Palestinians were killed, the Palestinian Health Ministry said, in operations that Israeli officials described as an effort to target militants.</p><p>The raids were concentrated in the cities of Tulkarm and Jenin, where Israel has targeted militant groups for several years. But the groups‚Äô strongholds have persisted, said my colleague Adam Rasgon, who is based in Jerusalem. Today‚Äôs operation, he added, appears ‚Äúto be a more significant effort than usual to challenge these groups and try to undermine their hold on authority.‚Äù</p><p>The raids followed months of escalating Israeli operations in the West Bank. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed there since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault on Israel, according to the U.N., in violence involving both the Israeli military and extremist Jewish settlers.</p><p>For Israel, the operations represent a third front in conflicts that now extend from Egypt‚Äôs border with the Gaza Strip to southern Lebanon. They also came after American, Israeli and Iranian officials said that Iran is secretly smuggling weapons to the West Bank in an effort to foment unrest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><hr/><p>üá∫üá∏ 2024</p><p><em>The presidential election is </em><strong><em>69 days away.</em></strong><em> Here‚Äôs the latest from the campaign trail.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Georgia today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-54550deb">Democrats target red counties and blue states</h2><p>Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, embarked today on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/28/us/harris-trump-election" title="">bus tour through the rural counties of southeast Georgia</a>, seeking to build Democrats‚Äô momentum in the Sun Belt.</p><p>Ahead of what is expected to be a tight election, the Democrats are looking to stem their losses outside of the cities and suburbs where they are most popular.
