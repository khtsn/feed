Tim Walz of Minnesota was to relitigate the campaign controversies of the last month — to get the candidates to talk about the major narratives of the election so far — then it was a rousing success. Harris easily dispatched questions about her identity and gave a strong defense of President Biden’s record. Walz, likewise, made short work of the charge that he had misled the public when he spoke about using one fertility treatment when it was actually another, similar treatment.</p><p>But if the goal was to learn something about a prospective President Harris — to gain insight into how she might make decisions, order priorities and approach the job of chief executive — then I think the interview was not a success. Not so much for Harris or the viewing public.</p><p>It might be interesting to journalists to know how Harris explains her changing views from 2019, when she ran for the Democratic nomination, to now, when she is the nominee. But it is not at all clear to me that it is interesting to viewers, who may be less concerned with how she deals with the question and more concerned with the actual substance of what she wants to do as president. A soft-focus question about a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/politics/kamala-harris-nomination-grand-niece-photo/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photograph</a>, however iconic, seems less valuable than a question about Harris’s view of the presidency now that she’s spent almost four years in the passenger’s seat as vice president.</p><p>Speaking for myself, I am less interested in hearing candidates navigate controversies or speak to narratives than I am in hearing them talk, for lack of a better term, about their theory of the office. How does a candidate for president conceptualize the presidency? What would she prioritize in office and how would she handle an endless onslaught of crises and issues that may, or may not, demand her attention? How does she imagine her relationship with Congress and how would she try to achieve her goals in the face of an opposition legislature? How does she imagine her relationship with the public and what value does she place on communication and the bully pulpit? Are there presidents she most admires — and why? Are there presidential accomplishments that stand out and how so? What are the worst mistakes a president can make? Why do you want this job in the first place?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>I can think of other questions along these lines, but you get the gist. To know what candidates for president think about the office and their role in it is, I believe, a better guide to what they may do in the White House than almost anything else. The only thing better is prior experience. These kinds of questions may not make for the most scintillating television, but I think they could provide the kind of insights that could actually help Americans decide what they want out of a national leader.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-2c42345c">Now Reading</h2><p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/dnc-2024-palestine-israel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ta-Nehisi Coates</a> on Palestinians at the Democratic National Convention for Vanity Fair.</p><p><a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/a-demonstration-of-working-class-power/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael Kazin</a> on Labor Day for Dissent.</p><p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/how-arizonas-maricopa-county-became-the-battleground-for-election-conspiracies" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rachel Monroe</a> on election conspiracy theories for The New Yorker.</p><p><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-misogyny-kamala-harris.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sarah Jones</a> on the misogyny of Donald Trump for New York.</p><p><a href="https://www.gq.com/story/michael-keaton-gq-hype" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gabriella Paiella</a> on Michael Keaton for GQ.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><h2 id="link-44fd954">Photo of the Week</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamelle Bouie</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>I took this while I was in New Orleans this spring.

That meant a week of simple pasta dishes like this one, which was incredibly easy to throw together. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6078-pasta-green-beans-and-potatoes-with-pesto" title="">Recipe from NYT Cooking.</a></p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><ul><li><p>2 cups packed tender young basil leaves</p></li><li><p>¼ cup pine nuts</p></li><li><p>1 teaspoon salt</p></li><li><p>2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and crushed with flat blade of a knife</p></li><li><p>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste</p></li><li><p>½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or more to taste</p></li><li><p>Salt to taste</p></li><li><p>½ pound small potatoes, peeled and sliced about ¼-inch thick</p></li><li><p>¼ pound tender young green beans, cut into 1-inch lengths</p></li><li><p>1 pound trenette, or other long, thin pasta</p></li></ul><p><strong>Directions</strong></p><p>Make pesto: In the bowl of food processor, add basil, pine nuts, salt and garlic. Pulse until mixture is coarse and grainy. With the motor running, add oil in slow, steady stream. Add cheese; process just enough to mix well. If sauce is too dry, add a little more oil. Taste; add more cheese or salt, if desired.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Bring 6 quarts water to rolling boil. Add at least 2 tablespoons salt and the potato slices. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until potatoes have started to soften but are not cooked through. Add green beans, and continue boiling another 5 minutes.</p><p>Add pasta, and stir. Start testing pasta at 5 minutes. When it is done, and when potatoes and beans are tender, drain and turn pasta and vegetables immediately into preheated bowl. Add pesto, and mix thoroughly. Serve immediately.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jamelle Bouie became a New York Times Opinion columnist in 2019.
