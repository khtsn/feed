    <h1>Federal Spending Freeze Does Not Apply to Student Loans and Pell Grants</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. Department of Education said in a statement on Tuesday morning that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/white-house-pauses-federal-grants.html" title="">the memo</a> sent to government agencies the day before calling for a broad pause on federal spending did not apply to federal student loans or Pell grants. That money will continue to flow, the statement said.</p><p>“The temporary pause does not impact assistance received directly by individuals,” said Madison Biedermann, who, according to the department, is currently delegated to perform spokesperson duties. This assistance includes funds like federal direct student loans and Pell grants that the department provides to “individual students,” her statement said.</p><p>Part of the confusion, which included <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/news-feed.bsky.social/post/3lgsu3xmhfw2a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/weisselberger.bsky.social/post/3lgrlugu2ek2v" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alarmed</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/publiccitizen.bsky.social/post/3lgspp6x35k2d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posts</a> on social media, sprung from the “received directly” portion of the Office of Management and Budget memo. Grants and loans for education can be sent to the school, so students may never receive the money directly.</p><p>In a follow-up statement, the department confirmed that no Pell grants or loans would be paused or delayed because of the order. Funding for the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/work-study" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal work-study program</a>, which helps pay for campus jobs, will continue to flow, too.</p></div></div>
