That money will continue to flow, the statement said.</p><p>“The temporary pause does not impact assistance received directly by individuals,” said Madison Biedermann, who, according to the department, is currently delegated to perform spokesperson duties. This assistance includes funds like federal direct student loans and Pell grants that the department provides to “individual students,” her statement said.</p><p>Part of the confusion, which included <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/news-feed.bsky.social/post/3lgsu3xmhfw2a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/weisselberger.bsky.social/post/3lgrlugu2ek2v" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alarmed</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/publiccitizen.bsky.social/post/3lgspp6x35k2d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posts</a> on social media, sprung from the “received directly” portion of the Office of Management and Budget memo. Grants and loans for education can be sent to the school, so students may never receive the money directly.</p><p>In a follow-up statement, the department confirmed that no Pell grants or loans would be paused or delayed because of the order. Funding for the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/work-study" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal work-study program</a>, which helps pay for campus jobs, will continue to flow, too.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The federal government, including agencies like the National Institutes of Health, also provides grants to conduct research at universities, and those programs may provide grants and stipends to graduate students who are working for them. It was not immediately clear whether any of that funding would be affected.</p><p>Persis Yu, deputy executive director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group, said the memo generated a lot of fear and chaos for students and their families because it came at a time when many of them were waiting for their federal loans.</p><p>“Millions of students are waiting for disbursements of their federal aid so that they can continue their education, and eat and keep a roof over their heads,” she said. “Wielding this fear is an abuse of power.” </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ron Lieber has been the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/your-money">Your Money</a> columnist since 2008 and has written five books, most recently “The Price You Pay for College.”<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ron-lieber">More about Ron Lieber</a></span></p></div><div><p>Tara Siegel Bernard writes about personal finance, from saving for college to paying for retirement and everything in between.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tara-siegel-bernard">More about Tara Siegel Bernard</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The First 100 Days of the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Military Changes:</strong> President Trump moved toward pushing openly transgender people out of the military and directed the Pentagon to end diversity programs as he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-military-transgender-dei-orders.html">sought to reshape America’s armed forces</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Firing Prosecutors:</strong> The acting attorney general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/justice-department-firings-trump-jack-smith.html">fired more than a dozen prosecutors</a> who worked on the investigations into Trump for the special counsel Jack Smith, saying they could not be trusted to “faithfully implement” the president’s agenda.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration:</strong> When Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, refused military planes carrying deportees, infuriating Trump, he revealed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/americas/colombia-trump-deportation-flights-migrants.html">how heated the question of deportations has become</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Health:</strong> Conservative Christian moms believe in home-schooling and distrust food and drug companies.
