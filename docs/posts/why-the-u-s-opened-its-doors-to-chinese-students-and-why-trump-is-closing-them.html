He was a graduate student in sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p><p>“People were curious about us, inviting us to their homes, wanting to be friends,” Mr. Shue said on Thursday, describing an openness that defined his early years in a country then seen by many in China as a beacon of opportunity.</p><p>“It was an extraordinary time,” he said.</p><p>That era of academic exchange between China and the United States, beginning in the 1970s under President Jimmy Carter as a form of soft power diplomacy, now stands in sharp contrast to the Trump administration’s recent stance toward the country.</p><p>The administration announced this week that it would aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or for those studying in broadly defined “critical fields.” The administration also plans to enhance vetting of future applicants for student visas, including looking at social media posts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Those policies promise to reduce the number of students from China coming to the United States, who have been a fixture on American university campuses for decades. In 2024, there were roughly 277,000 students.</p><p>The Trump administration says China exploits U.S. universities to bolster its military and technological capabilities. And Trump officials argue that some Chinese students may pose risks of espionage and technology theft.</p><p>“We are using every tool at our disposal to know who wants to enter this country and whether they should be allowed in,” Tammy Bruce, a State Department spokeswoman, said. “Every visa adjudication is a national security decision.”</p><p>To Mr. Shue, 64, now president of United Chinese Americans, a Washington D.C.-based civic group, the policy change stirs profound disappointment. His journey to the United States in the late 1980s was emblematic of a period of increasing friendliness between the two superpowers.</p><p>Mr. Shue recalled the generosity of Americans. David Scott, a wealthy businessman with ties to the Reagan administration, funded his education through a foundation. That period, Mr. Shue remembered, was characterized by the bipartisan embrace of Chinese students, culminating in the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992, which granted legal residency to thousands of Chinese students in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It was overwhelming support and care and concern,” said Mr. Shue, who helped push for the legislation and has long advocated easing China’s authoritarian rule and increased freedom within the country.</p><p>Mr. Shue expressed dismay at the Trump administration’s actions, viewing them as a betrayal of the U.S.’s image as a “beacon for humanity.”</p><p>The history of Chinese students in America is long and complex, dating back to the 1850s, when Yung Wing of Yale College became the first Chinese student to graduate from an American university. As Robert Kapp, a retired historian of China and former president of the U.S.-China Business Council, explained, early students sought Western knowledge to modernize China.</p><p>The normalization of U.S.-China relations in the 1970s under President Richard M. Nixon and China’s premier, Zhou Enlai, ushered in a new era of academic exchange. Later, China agreed to send thousands of students to the U.S., a number that later swelled to hundreds of thousands annually. </p><p>President Carter, Dr. Kapp recalled, “said, ‘Why don’t you send some students to the United States?’”<span>   </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And, he said, Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, responded, “‘Well, how about 10,000?’ — it went from there.”</p><p>For China, it was a crucial step in the country’s modernization. For the U.S., welcoming China’s students was a form of soft power.</p><p>The 1980s and 1990s witnessed a surge of talented Chinese students, many of whom have made significant contributions to American academia, business, science and technology. And the makeup of the Chinese student population at American universities shifted as well, from primarily graduate students in the 1980s to a growing number of undergraduates today.</p><p>“Opening up education was important for establishing ties, for building bridges,” said Professor David Bachman, an international relations expert at the University of Washington.</p><p>But now, he said, “I can imagine that there’ll be very few Chinese students here in 10 years,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And vice versa. As geopolitical tension between the U.S. and China ramped up during the Covid pandemic, the number of American scholars studying in China fell to fewer than 1,000 in 2024 from about 11,000 in 2019, said Rosie Levine, executive director of the U.S.-China Education Trust. </p><p>President Trump’s latest move, Ms. Levine said, may lead Beijing to retaliate, too, further limiting the number of American students in China — and with it, she said, the United States’ overall understanding of a critical global power.</p><p>While acknowledging the need to address security threats, she said that U.S. policies need nuance.</p><p>“These policies are so broad,” she said, “that they don’t give U.S. officers the ability to effectively distinguish between individuals who pose security risks and those who are just genuinely seeking educational opportunities.”</p><p>Ms. Levine said she believed that the administration’s focus on ties to the Chinese Communist Party also raised questions about the new vetting procedures.</p><p>“There’s 99 million CCP members in China,” she said. “Working for the Communist Party or being a member of the Communist Party is a really poor determinant of someone’s intentions.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>For Mr. Shue, the moment is personal. After the Trump administration’s announcement, he found himself unable to sleep, mulling the contrast between the United States of four decades ago and the nation he lives in today.</p><p>“It’s something I can barely wrap my head around,” he continued. “How did we deteriorate to this point where foreign students, especially those from China, are viewed as a potential liability rather than assets?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kurt Streeter writes about identity in America — racial, political, religious, gender and more.
