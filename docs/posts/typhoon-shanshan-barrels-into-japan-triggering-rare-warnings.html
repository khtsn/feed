Waves towered nearly 30 feet high in southern Kyushu on Thursday, and wind speeds of up to 45 meters per second were predicted, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Record-breaking rainfall in the Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures were expected over the next several days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Emergency warnings were issued for storm surge and high waves in Kagoshima Prefecture, and are the highest category of warnings possible in Japan.
