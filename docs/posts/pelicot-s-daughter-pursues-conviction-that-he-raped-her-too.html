She was overwhelmed by despair.</p><p>The trial had ended and she hadn’t gotten the answers she’d hoped for from her father, Dominique Pelicot, who she believes drugged and raped her, too.</p><p>“Dominique was not tried for what he did to his daughter,” Ms. Darian, 46, said in a recent interview over lunch at a Parisian restaurant off the Champs-Élysées. “He wasn’t even confronted adequately for what he did to his daughter.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The trial that led to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/france-rape-trial-pelicot.html" title="">convictions of 51 men</a> forensically inspected the horror <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/world/europe/france-dominique-pelicot-rape-trial.html" title="">Mr. Pelicot</a> inflicted upon his wife over almost a decade, as he mixed sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication into her drink and food and then, when she was deeply passed out, dressed her up in lingerie and invited strangers to come over and join him in raping her while he took photos and filmed.</p><p>But the s<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/france-rape-trial-caroline-darian-testimony.html" title="">uspicions of his only daughter, Caroline</a>, were little more than a sidelight of the trial. Instead of coming away with a degree of healing, Ms. Darian felt deeply wounded.</p><p>“My case, in that court, it was like it didn’t exist,” said Ms. Darian, who uses a pen name.</p><p>“It was terrible,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Darian, second from left, in the courtroom with her mother and brothers. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christophe Simon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>This month she filed her own police complaint against her father for rape and sexual assault. It coincided with the publication of Ms. Darian’s second book about her father’s crimes and the cataclysmic impact they’ve had on her life.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Her first book, a raw journal documenting the intimate horror she suffered in the year after her father’s arrest, is being released in the United States on Tuesday as “<a href="https://read.sourcebooks.com/non-fiction/9781464257957-ill-never-call-him-dad-again-tp.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I’ll Never Call Him Dad Again</a>.” She agreed to an interview with The New York Times in conjunction with its publication.</p><p>At the heart of her case are two intimate photos that her father had erased but that forensic investigators managed to retrieve from Mr. Pelicot’s electronics. Both capture Ms. Darian asleep in bed, with the lights on and the covers pulled back to reveal her beige underwear. </p><p>The underwear, Ms. Darian told the court, was not hers. She said that she had no recollection of the photos being taken and that she was a light sleeper. She believes that she, too, was drugged, and that her father used the same modus operandi on her as he had on her mother.</p><p>During the trial, Mr. Pelicot at first denied having taken the photos and said he did not believe they were of his daughter. Later, he said he had taken them because he was being blackmailed.</p><p>Investigators also found evidence of an erased folder with the title, “My naked daughter” and photo collages of Ms. Darian and Ms. Pelicot, both naked, that Mr. Pelicot had shared with strangers online. In one exchange on Skype, he referred to his “trapped daughter.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But when it came to his daughter, he was convicted only on charges of having taken the intimate photos without her permission.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gisèle Pelicot became a feminist icon in France for insisting the trial of her husband and 50 other men be public and refusing to feel ashamed as a rape victim.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lewis Joly/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Darian is convinced they are evidence of much more serious crimes that investigators missed or ignored, overwhelmed by her mother’s case.</p><p>Her 30-page police complaint, seen by The New York Times, includes material found by investigators though not brought up in the trial.</p><p>They include transcripts of Skype interactions Mr. Pelicot had with another user in 2020 when he had shared photo montages. After the user admired his daughter, Mr. Pelicot wrote: “It’s been more than eight years I’ve been offering her up like this. Do you want to see her when she was 30?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Pelicot’s lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro, said she had not seen the complaint yet. She noted that the general prosecutor in last year’s trial had acknowledged Ms. Darian’s grievances but had said there were not enough “objective elements” to prosecute Mr. Pelicot for them.</p><p>During the trial, Mr. Pelicot repeatedly said that he had never drugged his daughter. He denied sexually touching her or any of his children and grandchildren, the eldest of whom has also filed a police complaint that he, too, was sexually abused by Mr. Pelicot.</p><p>Before their father’s arrest, neither she nor her brothers suspected he was a sexual predator, they told the court. They were a tight-knit family, often gathering for vacations down in Provence, where Mr. and Ms. Pelicot had retired. Their parents had been together for 50 years and seemed very happy.</p><p>His arrest, and his admission to crimes against their mother, caused a sudden profound shock<strong>. </strong>Ms. Darian began suffering panic attacks. She stopped sleeping and was briefly hospitalized in a psychiatric ward.</p><p>“Until I was 41, I thought my father was a good, kind person,” Ms. Darian said. “In 2020, all our foundations as children crumbled.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In 2019, Ms. Darian was crippled with pain from an anal tear that doctors could not explain and that required three operations, according to her police complaint. She now believes it was probably caused by her father or men he may have invited to rape her.</p><p>In addition to the police complaint for sexual abuse filed by his eldest grandson, Mr. Pelicot has also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/world/europe/gisele-pelicot-husband-rape-murder-victims.html" title="">indicted in two cold cases</a>, involving young female real estate agents in the 1990s. The first was raped and murdered; the second managed to escape an attempted rape and took refuge in a closet.</p><p>During the trial, while Ms. Pelicot remained calm and emotionally detached, Ms. Darian was a cyclone of emotion. Anger and suffering rose off her in waves. Part way through the trial, she announced on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBmEh77vfqE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=309d4378-b9a8-4b25-bf5b-dfdddbc6ea6d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a> that she was checking herself into a clinic “to be able to sleep again.”</p><p>“You are lying — you don’t have the courage to tell the truth,” she hollered near the end of the trial, when her father once again denied having abused her. “You will die with your lies, alone with your lies.”</p><p>Remembering that day months later over lunch, Ms. Darian broke into tears. Her father’s refusal to acknowledge the evidence and explain it, she said, was “the ultimate betrayal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“He owed me the truth,” she said. “I am not just any victim. I was his daughter.”</p><p>Ms. Darian has lost not just her father, but her mother, too. The two are no longer speaking, she said. While she is sure her father abused her, her mother was more equivocal. When asked in court, she responded only that “it could not be ruled out.”</p><p>To Ms. Darian, it felt like abandonment.</p><p>“My relationship with my mother will never be the same again,” she said. </p><p>Gisèle Pelicot has refused all interview requests. One of her lawyers says said she won’t speak publicly before appeals of the convictions are heard, if ever.</p><p>Ms. Darian’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/europe/gisele-pelicot-rape-trial-france.html" title="">younger brother, Florian Pelicot,</a> 38, said he believed their mother showed enormous strength in facing the horrors her husband, and dozens of other men, inflicted upon her. Opening her mind to his sister’s accusations, he thinks, “would have made her collapse.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>“You can’t save yourself and rebuild yourself and also help your children to rebuild themselves too,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“He owed me the truth,” she said. “I am not just any victim.

I know that he must have done some very serious things. And I’ll get to the bottom of it.”</p><p>Ségolène Le Stradic<!-- --> contributed reporting from Paris.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
