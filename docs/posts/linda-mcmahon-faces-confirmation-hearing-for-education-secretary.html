Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he would like to smother, if not disassemble, the department, setting up a Senate hearing on Thursday with few parallels in American history.</p><p>Ms. McMahon will list off her qualifications to oversee the health of the country’s schools in the midst of open discussions in the White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/musk-education-department.html" title="">about whether to close the department down</a>. Less than a day before Ms. McMahon was scheduled to appear for the hearing, Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he wanted to see the department shuttered “immediately,” calling it “a big con job.”</p><p>Ms. McMahon is expected to speak about the dismal results documented last month on a national exam, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which showed pervasive learning loss across the country’s public schools since the Covid-19 pandemic. Conservative think tanks and lawmakers have pointed to the results as evidence that the nation’s education system requires deep changes, and as justification for policies aimed at expanding access to private and religious schools.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>She is also expected to speak about the priorities Mr. Trump has already set for the agency through executive orders in recent days. One of the orders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/trump-executive-orders-local-control-schools.html" title="">focused on school choice,</a> a topic she will most likely highlight. The administration’s other priorities revolve around cultural issues, such as gender, race and sexuality, and combating antisemitism.</p><p>Recent appointees of Mr. Trump have already taken steps to turn the department into a vehicle to clamp down on schools and organizations perceived as hostile to the president’s agenda. On Wednesday, the department started new investigations into two interscholastic sports associations in Minnesota and California, which had signaled they would allow transgender athletes to continue compete on teams corresponding to their gender identity.</p><p>Ms. McMahon is also expected to promote novel ways to train the country’s future work force, even as the workplace she stands to inherit has gone through a litany of painful changes led by Trump appointees and Elon Musk.</p><p>The president has charged Mr. Musk with shrinking the federal government, and his associates have combed through the Education Department’s data, flagging programs and grants for cancellation. The specter of coming staff reductions and a fundamental reorientation of the agency’s functions have left hundreds of the department’s more than 4,200 workers demoralized and sounding the alarm about the effect on educators.</p><p>Since last week, more than 70 employees in the department have been put on administrative leave because of their connection to longstanding diversity, equity and inclusion programs. And between Monday and Tuesday, the department canceled dozens of grants underpinning most of its research operations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Trump signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">order</a> demanding wide-ranging reductions in the federal work force through “attrition” and severe directives, including that agencies hire “no more than one employee for every four employees that depart.”</p><p>Like most of Mr. Trump’s nominees, Ms. McMahon is seen as a loyal lieutenant, but one with an unusually long record of supporting the president’s political ambitions and preserving a position within his orbit.</p><p>During his first term, she served as the head of the Small Business Administration until stepping down in 2019 to run a political action committee supporting Mr. Trump. She then became chairwoman of the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank heavily staffed by former Trump officials, where she crafted policy ideas in preparation for a second Trump presidential term.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s relationship with Ms. McMahon and her husband, Vince McMahon, dates to the 1980s, a period through which Mr. Trump cultivated an interest in their wrestling ventures and success in television. He served as a sponsor for the W.W.E. broadcast WrestleMania when it appeared in Atlantic City, N.J., and even appeared as a performer several times, including in a scripted feud against Mr. McMahon billed as the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NsrwH9I9vE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Battle of the Billionaires</a>.”</p><p>Their relationship has only grown more intertwined, as Ms. McMahon has emerged as a committed megadonor in Mr. Trump’s last three bids for the presidency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. McMahon and her husband, from whom she is separated, were the sixth-largest donors to Mr. Trump during his 2024 campaign, funneling more than $20 million into Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign and to associated PACs, according to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/11/big-money-big-stakes-5-things-everyone-should-know-about-money-in-2024-election" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> compiled by Open Secrets, a government transparency group. She personally <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=linda+mcmahon&amp;contributor_employer=MCMAHON+VENTURES+LLC&amp;two_year_transaction_period=2020&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2019&amp;max_date=12%2F31%2F2020" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gave</a> over $360,000 to help support Mr. Trump’s previous presidential campaign in 2020.</p><p>Ms. McMahon has also gained standing and influence through her association with the president, taking on senior advisory roles in multiple conservative policy organizations and the Daily Caller, a conservative news site. She also receives a $18,400 quarterly retainer from the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, the parent company of Mr. Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, and received thousands of shares in the company in compensation for her work with the group.</p><p>Many who have worked with Ms. McMahon have noted her political acumen and staying power within the president’s inner circle. Mr. Trump praised her as a “superstar” when she stepped down from his cabinet in 2019.</p><p>She has vowed to resign from those positions and divest from Mr. Trump’s business if confirmed.</p><p>Like Betsy DeVos, the education secretary during Mr. Trump’s first term, Ms. McMahon is exceptionally wealthy, reporting millions in annual income from her holdings in the professional wrestling empire she built, according to a <a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/1562CD2295BCAD8385258C2A00320E73/$FILE/McMahon%2C%20Linda%20%20final278.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financial disclosure</a> filed ahead of the hearing.</p><p>But the business empire she created that produced that wealth has also prompted serious questions about Ms. McMahon’s management and oversight of ethical breaches.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Under her leadership, various iterations of World Wrestling Entertainment have produced a stream of complaints describing rampant substance abuse and sexual misconduct throughout the business. Ms. McMahon was named as a defendant in a pending <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/linda-mcmahon-sexual-abuse-lawsuit-trump-education-secretary.html" title="">lawsuit</a> in Maryland that claims she failed to take action against employees accused of sexually abusing minors working for the organization.</p><p>Critics have said her relative lack of experience in education amid a tide of conservative resentment directed toward the department leaves her little prepared to navigate the effects that Mr. Trump’s agenda may have on the nation’s schools. She earned a certificate to teach French and served a brief stint on the Connecticut State Board of Education. She has also been a university trustee at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn., for many years.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
