</span> roster that finished second at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1653/champions-tour-2023-americas-ascension/" target="_blank">Americas Ascension</a> in 2023, eeiu was added to 100 Thieves for the 2024 season. As one of the backbones of the team, he played a key role in the team&#39;s achievements that year as they went on to win <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2004/champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-1" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> and place fourth at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai" target="_blank">Masters Shanghai</a>. Their year later ended one step away from Champions after falling at the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/371272/kr-esports-vs-100-thieves-champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-2-lr1" target="_blank">final hurdle</a> to KRÃœ Esports.</p>

<p>In 2025, the thieves had middling results, consistently making domestic playoffs appearances but finding themselves unable to qualify to international VCT events with top-six finishes in both <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2347/vct-2025-americas-stage-1" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2501/vct-2025-americas-stage-2" target="_blank">Stage 2</a>. </p>

<p>In the offseason, 100 Thieves allowed almost every member on the team to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/549441/boostio-the-latest-to-depart-100-thieves-in-offseason-of-goodbyes" target="_blank">explore their options</a>, indicating the possibility of a major rebuild after they had historically maintained a stable core in the partnerships era. eeiu&#39;s official departure from the team follows those of <span data-ref-id="4">Anthony		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/26482/zikz">Zikz</a>&#34;
		Gray</span>, <span data-ref-id="5">Drew		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/9094/kess">Kess</a>&#34;
		Lee</span>, and <span data-ref-id="6">Kelden		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/604/boostio">Boostio</a>&#34;
		Pupello</span> earlier this month. With the rest of the team allowed to explore options, the team currently does not have any official active members.</p>
