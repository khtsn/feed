		<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2500/vct-2025-pacific-stage-2" target="_blank">VCT Pacific Stage 2</a> returned this week after nearly two months away from the stage, which was filled by top performances from the region&#39;s teams at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a> and the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2449/esports-world-cup-2025" target="_blank">Esports World Cup</a>.</p>

<p>Action in the region that is home to both Masters trophies this year revved back up with a gauntlet week, meaning all 12 teams in the region played two matches each. With twelve matches played in six days, here&#39;s a look at the standings in each group and how each team fared:</p>



<h2>1. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/17/gen-g" target="_blank">Gen.G</a></strong> 1-1</h2>

<p>Gen.G was faced with a quick turnaround following a third-place finish at EWC, but returned to home soil in style. A quick 2-0 got Gen.G its first win over DRX in 2025, leaving their match against rivals Rex Regum Qeon a crucial one. A win would make Gen.G the only 2-0 team in Group Alpha, while a loss would mean all six teams enter the next week of play at 1-1. The three-map series, which was a rematch of the Stage 1 grand final, saw Gen.G fall short once again, losing 13-11 in the decider map. With a slight upper hand in round differential, Gen.G claims the top spot.</p>


<p><em>The t3xture clip farm did not miss a beat.</em></p>

<h2>2. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/918/global-esports" target="_blank">Global Esports</a></strong> 1-1</h2>

<p>After going 1-4 in Stage 1, Global went to the drawing board and added <span data-ref-id="0">

</span>, who rounds out the squad&#39;s Korean trio, helped GE to a 13-5 victory on RRQ&#39;s pick of Haven en route to a clean 2-0 victory over the reigning Pacific champions. Global ran into troubles against Team Secret though, falling 2-1 with the final map ending in a narrow 13-11 fashion. At 1-1, GE enters the second week of play 3-2 in maps and with a +18 map differential.</p>


<p><em>Papi with the clutch.</em></p>

<h2>3. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/11060/nongshim-redforce" target="_blank">Nongshim RedForce</a></strong> 1-1</h2>

<p>Needing to reach <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions Paris</a> to automatically secure its stay in VCT, Nongshim RedForce made a big splash signing by picking up former DRX and <span data-ref-id="3">

</span> began with a 2-1 victory over Team Secret. In their second match of the week, NS and Rb went up against his former colors in DRX, coming daringly close in a 2-1 loss, falling 13-11 in the decider map.</p>

<h2>4. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/6199/team-secret" target="_blank">Team Secret</a></strong> 1-1</h2>

<p>Team Secret had a disappointing Stage 1, going 1-4. Three changes were made during the team&#39;s downtime, as the squad picked up <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/7437/kellys">
		kellyS	</a>
</span>, <span data-ref-id="8">

</span>, and <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/14225/n1zzy">

</span>. After stealing away Nongshim RedForce&#39;s map pick to start their series, Team Secret got their own pick stolen away before losing the decider 13-3. In a bounce-back, the same pattern repeated in a 2-1 win over Global Esports, with TS ending up on top.</p>

<h2>5. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/8185/drx" target="_blank">DRX</a></strong> 1-1</h2>

<p>After lifting the Pacific Kickoff trophy, DRX came up just short of qualifying for Masters Toronto in Stage 1. With <span data-ref-id="10">

	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/51100/flicker">
		Flicker	</a>
</span> called up from the academy roster, DRX has expanded to a seven-man roster. With two players to back up the core starting five, DRX could field a few different looks in Stage 2. After the 2-0 loss to Gen.G, DRX had a bounce-back 2-1 win against Nongshim to move to 1-1.</p>

<h2>6. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/878/rex-regum-qeon" target="_blank">Rex Regum Qeon</a></strong> 1-1</h2>

<p>Since lifting its first VCT trophy in Stage 1, Rex Regum Qeon has looked shaky. Swift eliminations from Masters Toronto and EWC have been a far cry from the dominant run they made through the Stage 1 playoffs. After the 2-0 loss to Global, RRQ clashed with rivals Gen.G in a three-map thriller, which ended in elation for the Southeast Asian squad. </p>



<h2>1. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/8304/talon" target="_blank">TALON</a></strong> 2-0</h2>

<p>After a 5th-6th finish in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/vct-2025-pacific-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> cemented 2025 as the third straight year of no Masters events for TALON, the Thai squad began the second half of the regular season with a determined look. Chasing a second-straight Champions appearance, TALON broke their win-loss pattern with two straight 2-0 victories against BOOM Esports and ZETA DIVISION. Dominant showings in both matches leave TALON at the top of the Group Omega table thanks to a +30 round differential.</p>


<p><em>Icing on the cake for TALON on Icebox.</em></p>

<h2>2. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/624/paper-rex" target="_blank">Paper Rex</a></strong> 2-0</h2>

<p>Also unbeaten through two games with no maps dropped is Paper Rex, the Masters Toronto winners. In a heavyweight slugfest against Masters Bangkok winners T1 to open the stage, they claimed a 2-0 victory. The series was a close one, with both maps going to overtime. PRX&#39;s second match was against DetonatioN FocusMe, the team that eliminated them at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/vct-2025-pacific-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Kickoff</a> to start the year. Clean 13-7 wins on both maps gave the train a positive start on the tracks with a +16 map differential to show for it.</p>


<p><em>PRX and T1 made Haven look defender-sided in map one.</em></p>

<h2>3. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/14/t1" target="_blank">T1</a></strong> 1-1</h2>

<p>After failing to live up to their Masters Bangkok billing with an underwhelming showing in Stage 1, T1 made personnel changes ahead of Stage 2, bringing on academy player <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/43057/dh">
		DH	</a>
</span> in place of <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4056/sylvan">
		Sylvan	</a>
</span>. The rookie went up against PRX in his debut, and after shaking off some early rust, put up a solid 44/44 scoreline in the loss to PRX. While he had a comparatively quieter performance against a dangerous BOOM Esports, the stars of T1 glimmered against the Ascension squad. <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span> led the side to a 2-0 win, with the latter on Chamber for both maps.</p>

<h2>4. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/278/detonation-focusme" target="_blank">DetonatioN FocusMe</a></strong> 1-1</h2>

<p>In a back-and-forth Japanese derby, DFM traded 13-1 maps with ZETA DIVISION on each other&#39;s map picks, which set the stage for what may have been the best individual performance of the week. A 39-kill domination from <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/6672/meiy">
		Meiy	</a>
</span> helped DFM to a 13-7 victory on the decider map of Icebox. The win was DFM&#39;s first in league play after a winless Stage 1. That same magic couldn&#39;t be found against Paper Rex, resulting in a 2-1 loss for the Japanese squad.</p>


<p><em>Mystical. Magical. Meiy.</em></p>

<h2>5. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/5448/zeta-division" target="_blank">ZETA DIVISION</a></strong> 0-2</h2>

<p>ZETA DIVISION welcomed <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/424/dep">
		Dep	</a>
</span> back into the starting lineup after a spell on the sidelines to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/472620/zeta-signs-tenten-from-t1-academy-to-replace-dep" target="_blank">address a shoulder injury</a>. With full-time Duelist player <span data-ref-id="18">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/29839/tenten">
		TenTen	</a>
</span> having entered the fray midway through Stage 1, Dep has settled into the Sentinel and secondary Controller role. After losing in the Japanese clash, ZETA struggled against TALON, managing just 11 rounds total to fall to 0-2 to start the stage. </p>

<h2>6. <i></i> <strong><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/466/boom-esports" target="_blank">BOOM Esports</a></strong> 0-2</h2>

<p>BOOM Esports was an untouchable force in Stage 1, going 5-0 in the group stage before crashing out as an early exit in the playoffs. BOOM has failed to recapture that group stage form by beginning Stage 2 with two straight losses, albeit against two of the tougher teams in Group Omega. BOOM failed to win a single map in losses to TALON and T1, ending the week on the bottom of the leaderboard.</p>
