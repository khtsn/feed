Many were pushed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/29/us/illegal-border-crossings-data.html" title="">political repression, gang violence and economic desperation</a>, among other factors. The smuggling of migrants into the United States has became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/25/us/migrant-smuggling-evolution.html" title="">a billion-dollar business</a>, with organized crime controlling many operations.</p><p>The number of crossings at the southern U.S. border has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/biden-border-immigration.html" title="">fallen sharply</a> in recent months following asylum restrictions imposed by the Biden administration.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The National Civil Police of Guatemala said on Wednesday that officers had conducted an operation against a group of human smugglers called “Los Orozcos” in connection with the 2022 Texas migrant deaths. They arrested seven people, including the group’s leader, Rigoberto Ramón Miranda Orozco, also known as Don Rigo, for human trafficking, said Edwin Monroy, a police spokesman.</p><p>There was an “arrest warrant for extradition purposes” for Mr. Orozco, Mr. Monroy said. Francisco Jiménez, Guatemala’s interior minister, said in <a href="https://x.com/FJimenezmingob/status/1826398423202861307" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post on X</a> that the operation had “dismantled” Los Orozcos.</p><p>The operation against the group was conducted with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The Justice Department said it would hold a news conference on Thursday in San Antonio to announce “a significant arrest in the case.”</p><p>The arrests in Guatemala were the first outside the United States in this case. So far, three have pleaded guilty to charges related to the episode.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The smugglers locked at least 66 migrants, including eight children and a pregnant woman, in the tractor-trailer, <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/4-arrested-2022-tractor-trailer-smuggling-incident-resulted-53-deaths" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to U.S. authorities</a>.</p><p>As temperatures reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the migrants “screamed and banged on the walls for help,” and some clawed at the insides of the trailer to try and escape, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/28/us/migrant-deaths-san-antonio-texas.html" title="">according to one of the indictments</a>. The migrants had paid up to $15,000 each for their passage to the United States, the indictment said.</p><p>The dead included people from Guatemala, Mexico and Honduras.</p><p>Edgar Sandoval<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
