The police fired one shot while arresting the man.</p><p>Memories are still fresh of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/europe/germany-christmas-market-crash.html" title="">a car ramming attack in December</a>, when a man drove into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, in central Germany, injuring as many as 300 people and killing six.</p><p>The suspect in that case, a 50-year-old man originally from Saudi Arabia, had a social media presence that included posts criticizing Germany for what he called the authorities’ tolerance of radical Islam. In his social media, the man also expressed support for the AfD.</p><p>Photographs and videos of the crash site on Thursday showed a severely dented beige Mini Cooper, which witnesses said had been driven into the crowd.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A rescue helicopter and several ambulances were on site to bring victims — at least 28 were injured, two of them severely — to the hospital.</p><p>The crash site was less than a mile from the venue of the Munich Security Conference, which opens tomorrow and attracts high-profile participants and journalists from around the world. The police do not think the crash was connected to the conference.</p><p>Sandra Demmelhuber, a journalist for Bayerischer Rundfunk, the Bavarian public broadcaster, was at the crash site and described a chaotic scene.</p><p>“There is a person lying on the street and a young man was led away by the police. People sitting, crying and shaking on the ground,” she <a href="https://x.com/SDemmelhuber/status/1889975253180493842" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p><p>The demonstration had been organized by Verdi, one of Germany’s largest unions, which had called a one-day strike for city workers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The police have set up a command center in a nearby restaurant and have asked witnesses to come forward.</p><p>The police confirmed that the man they apprehended was known for being involved in minor crimes, such as shoplifting and drugs. Beyond those details, however, he was not publicly identified.</p><p>The crash comes on the heels of another high-profile case involving an Afghan asylum seeker, who killed a toddler and a man in a knife attack in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg last month.</p><p>Migration has been a consistently prominent issue in German politics, and the timing of that attack, coming so close to the general election, gave it added resonance.</p><p>After Thursday’s crash, Mr. Söder — whose Christian Social Union, a regional sister party of the Christian Democrats, has governed Bavaria for decades — wasted no time calling for action.</p><p>“It was not the first such act,” Mr. Söder said at the site of the crash. “Today I feel compassion for the people, but at the same time I am determined that something must change in Germany and quickly,” he added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
