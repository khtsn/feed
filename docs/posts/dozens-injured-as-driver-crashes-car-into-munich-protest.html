The police fired one shot while arresting the man.</p><p>Memories are still fresh of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/europe/germany-christmas-market-crash.html" title="">a car ramming attack in December</a>, when a man drove into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, in central Germany, injuring as many as 300 people and killing six.</p><p>The suspect in that case, a 50-year-old man originally from Saudi Arabia, had a social media presence that included posts criticizing Germany for what he called the authorities’ tolerance of radical Islam. In his social media, the man also expressed support for the AfD.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Photographs and videos of the crash site on Thursday showed a severely dented beige Mini Cooper, which witnesses said had been driven into the crowd.</p><p>A rescue helicopter and several ambulances were on site to bring victims — at least 28 were injured, two of them severely — to the hospital.</p><p>The crash site was less than a mile from the venue of the Munich Security Conference, which opens tomorrow and attracts high-profile participants and journalists from around the world. The police do not think the crash was connected to the conference.</p><p>Sandra Demmelhuber, a journalist for Bayerischer Rundfunk, the Bavarian public broadcaster, was at the crash site and described a chaotic scene.</p><p>“There is a person lying on the street and a young man was led away by the police. People sitting, crying and shaking on the ground,” she <a href="https://x.com/SDemmelhuber/status/1889975253180493842" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The demonstration had been organized by Verdi, one of Germany’s largest unions, which had called a one-day strike for city workers. About 2,500 people were at the rally when the crash took place.</p><p>The police have set up a command center in a nearby restaurant and have asked witnesses to come forward.</p><p>The police confirmed that the man they apprehended was known for being involved in minor crimes, such as shoplifting and drugs.</p><p>The man is believed to have failed in his request for asylum, but had an official status that allowed him to stay in the country at least temporarily, according to Joachim Herrmann, Bavaria’s state interior minister. Beyond those details, however, he was not publicly identified.</p><p>The country has been shaken by a series of seeming random attacks by male asylum seekers, mostly from Afghanistan and Syria. On Thursday, the trial opened for an Afghan man who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/europe/activist-officer-stabbing-germany.html" title="">is accused of stabbing to death a police officer</a>, and wounding several others, in Mannheim last spring.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And the crash comes on the heels of another high-profile case involving an Afghan asylum seeker, who killed a toddler and a man in a knife attack in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg last month.</p><p>Migration has been a consistently prominent issue in German politics, and the timing of that attack, coming so close to the general election, gave it added resonance.</p><p>After Thursday’s crash, Mr. Söder — whose Christian Social Union, a regional sister party of the Christian Democrats, has governed Bavaria for decades — wasted no time calling for action.</p><p>“It was not the first such act,” Mr. Söder said at the site of the crash. “Today I feel compassion for the people, but at the same time I am determined that something must change in Germany and quickly,” he added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
