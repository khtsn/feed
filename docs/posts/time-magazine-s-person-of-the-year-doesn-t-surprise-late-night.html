That was also the same week Hillary Clinton canceled her subscription and smashed her server with a hammer.” <em>— DANA PERINO, guest host of “Gutfeld!”</em></p><p>“The editorial board mentioned Trump’s historic comeback, his impact on global politics and how we increased his votes from Blacks, Latinos and people named Biden.” <em>— DANA PERINO</em></p><p>“The difference: In 2016, the cover called him ‘President of the divided states of America.’ This year, it’s simply his name, even though there was plenty of room for ‘Cry harder, losers.’” <em>— DANA PERINO</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Now, obviously, Donald Trump is the person of the year. At this point, he’s basically America’s main character.” <em>— MICHAEL KOSTA</em></p><p>“Sadly, there’s no one left to roll it up and spank him with it. Maybe Elon will do it for him, I don’t know.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“According to the Time website, the person of the year is bestowed upon ‘a person, group, or concept that had the biggest impact for good or for ill.’ Which, that’s him, all right. It was a no-brainer in every sense of the word.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“By the way, just to put Trump’s Time cover in context, it’s not exactly a mark of greatness. The president who currently holds the record for the most Time magazine covers, it isn’t a universally beloved one, like F.D.R., J.F.K. or George Washington. Not because Time wasn’t around in the 1700s, but because Washington was more of a People magazine time of guy.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“But I guess once again, Time has not been kind to Joe Biden.” <em>— MICHAEL KOSTA</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-6301e0d6">The Punchiest Punchlines (Clemency For Christmas Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“President Biden announced the largest act of clemency in modern history today and said, ‘America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances.’ Adding, ‘And man did that come back to bite us.’” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“Because today, on his way out of office, he used his power of the presidency to commute 1,500 sentences and pardon 39 people. Wow, I did not know he had 39 sons — that’s impressive.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“After announcing the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history today, President Biden suggested he would pardon additional Americans and said, ‘I will take more steps in the weeks ahead.’ Well, careful, ’cause steps aren’t your strong suit.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><blockquote><p>“It is the biggest single act of clemency in modern American history. Before this, the biggest act of clemency was on election night.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“He’s handing out pardons like they’re Werther’s Originals.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Twenty years after the end of “Friends,” Lisa Kudrow told Jimmy Fallon she still can’t escape fans asking her to sing “Smelly Cat.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shailene Woodley, Christopher Sears, Rebecca Henderson and Zachary Quinto star as siblings with plenty of grudges in “Cult of Love” at the Helen Hayes Theater in Manhattan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
