Last week, before that rate went into effect, the United States collected $160 million to $212 million a day in customs and excise taxes.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s figure may be derived from a projection from Peter Navarro, his trade adviser, that the administration’s more sweeping tariffs would bring in $600 billion annually, or about $1.6 billion daily. But as The Washington Post has reported, that figure is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/09/navarro-tariff-revenue-fact-checker/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not credible.</a> And Mr. Trump’s claim is even less probable, as those sweeping tariffs had not taken effect when he spoke and were in effect for mere hours before he paused them.</p><p>What Was Said</p><p><em>“If you look at China, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in my term, hundreds of billions. They never paid 10 cents to any other president, and yet they paid hundreds of billions.”</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><em>“For decades, they gave up to China. I’m the only one that — do you how much — China has paid almost $700 billion in tariffs under me.”</em></p><p><strong>False. </strong>Tariffs imposed on imports of foreign goods do not mean another country is paying the bill. The costs are largely passed on to American companies and consumers, as a vast body of research has shown.</p><p>The United States has collected tariffs on Chinese products since the 1700s. In the decade before Mr. Trump took office, annual duties on Chinese imports ranged from $13 billion to $21 billion, <a href="https://dataweb.usitc.gov/trade/search/GenImp/HTS" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to data from the United States International Trade Commission</a>. That rose to $23.5 billion in 2018, when Mr. Trump placed additional tariffs on Chinese imports, and totaled $85.6 billion in his first term — not quite $100 billion, let alone “hundreds of billions.” (In comparison, duties collected under former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. totaled $118.5 billion.)</p><h2 id="link-5771b8e6">Exaggerations about deficits and tariff rates</h2><p>What Was Said</p><p><em>“We lose close to $2 trillion a year on trade. We lose $1 trillion a year to China, a trillion.”</em></p><p><em>“We have a deficit with the European Union of $350 billion.”</em></p><p><strong>This is exaggerated. </strong>Mr. Trump’s figures are at least double, if not several times larger, that of official estimates of trade deficits, the gap between how much a country imports and exports with another, not a measure of that country “losing” money.

He is also wrong that the country grew less prosperous in 1913, when a permanent federal income tax was introduced. Historians also disagreed with his assessment that reducing tariffs caused the Great Depression.</p><p>The United States is far richer now than it was from the 1870s to 1910s, even when accounting for inflation. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-maddison-project-database?tab=chart&amp;country=~USA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gross domestic product</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-maddison-project-database?tab=line&amp;country=~USA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">G.D.P. per capita</a> are higher now than they were then. And relative to other countries, the United States was just as rich or richer in the post-World War II era than in the Gilded Age. Inequality, though, reached a peak during the Gilded Age.</p><p>The income tax did not appear out of the blue, as Mr. Trump implies. Rather, the Underwood-Simmons Act of 1913 created a federal income tax after <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/history-income-tax-history-16th-amendment-trump-tariffs-great-depression" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decades of efforts</a> from Congress and presidents of both parties and <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/16th-amendment" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ratification of the 16th Amendment</a>.</p><p>“I chuckle over ‘for reasons unknown to mankind,’” said Douglas Irwin, a trade historian at Dartmouth College. “We made the change because the tariff is a regressive tax, hitting lower-income households more, and the income tax was progressive, making higher income households pay more.”</p><p>The Underwood Act also reduced tariff rates from about 40 percent to about 25 percent. While the legislation led to income taxes, rather than tariffs, generating most of federal revenue, tariffs were not abandoned altogether before the Great Depression.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>In fact, “substantial” tariffs remained in place throughout the 1920s, said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and an expert on the Great Depression. The Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act of 1922, for example, <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c13857/c13857.pdf#page=28" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised tariffs to an average of 36.2 percent</a>. From 1920 to 1929, the <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr172.pdf#page=7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">average rate</a> on all imports was 13 percent and 35.1 percent on imports subject to duties.</p><p>After the Great Depression started in 1929, President Herbert Hoover signed into law the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 in an effort to protect domestic industries. Historians broadly agreed that the policy deepened the Great Depression by causing many foreign countries to impose retaliatory tariffs and further slowing international trade. <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Passes_Smoot_Hawley_Tariff.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A historical primer</a> on the Senate’s website characterizes Smoot-Hawley as “among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history.”</p><p>The White House spokesman pointed to a recent book by the economist Art Laffer and others <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/tax-increases-great-depression" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arguing that tax increases were a primary cause of the Great Depression</a>. But the book, which features a foreword written by Mr. Trump and challenges the <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/the-great-depression/curriculum/economic-episodes-in-american-history-part-5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consensus view of the Great Depression</a>, notably includes the Smoot-Hawley Act as one of the causal tax cuts.</p><p>Asked whether Mr. Trump’s claim had any merit, Professor Eichengreen asserted, “There’s no way to recover a sensible statement from the sentence you quote.”</p><p>What Was Said</p><p><em>“It was formed to really do damage to the United States in trade. That’s the reason it was formed. It was formed with all of the countries from Europe. I guess, most of them, not all of them, but most of them and they formed together to create a little bit of a monopoly situation to create a unified force against the United States for trade.”</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>False.</strong> European nations did not band together to scheme against the United States through trade, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/us/politics/fact-check-trump-european-union.html" title="">despite Mr. Trump’s repeated accusations</a>. The European Union was created in 1993, with the support of the United States, to expand cooperation among member states, establish European citizenship and introduce a single monetary policy with the euro.</p><p>The White House spokesman argued that the United States’ trade deficit with the European Union has more than doubled in the past 20 years.</p><p>After World War II, European countries created several predecessor organizations to <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/history-eu_en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">foster cooperation</a> and prevent further bloody conflicts.</p><p>The European Union was specifically formed at the end of the Cold War to strengthen security and economic integration, goals strongly supported by the United States, said Desmond Dinan, a professor at George Mason University who has written several books on the European Union.</p><p>American government officials, business leaders and researchers believed that deeper European integration would increase prosperity and, thus, trans-Atlantic trade with and investments in the United States. The United States had already “benefited greatly from European economic integration since the 1950s and looked forward to benefiting even more from the launch of the E.U.,” Professor Dinan said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Linda Qiu is a reporter who specializes in fact-checking statements made by politicians and public figures.
