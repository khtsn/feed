On Saturday, search teams, including divers, were still recovering bodies from the frigid water and retrieving wreckage.</p><p>American Eagle Flight 5342, operated by PSA Airlines for its parent carrier, American Airlines, had taken off from Wichita, Kan., carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. The collision occurred in clear skies as the plane approached Reagan National Airport around 9 p.m.</p><p>The helicopter, a UH-60 Black Hawk with a three-person crew, had been on a military training flight, the Army said. Federal investigators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/washington-dc-plane-crash-ntsb-investigation.html" title="">are examining the events</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/washington-dc-plane-crash-ntsb-investigation.html" title="">have said</a> that it is too early to speculate on its cause. But the crash has raised concerns about staffing, congestion and safety at one of the nation’s busiest airports.</p><p>Among the victims were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/figure-skaters-dc-plane-crash.html?smid=url-share" title="">figure skaters</a> from the United States and Russia who had attended the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita.</p><p>Here is what to know about the crash.</p><h2 id="link-526676e5">The explosive collision and crash left no survivors.</h2><p>The jet, a Bombardier CRJ700, had been close to landing when it collided with the helicopter, setting off an explosive fireball followed by a trail of smoke.</p><p>The moment was captured in several videos, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/washington-dc-plane-helicopter-crash-timeline.html" title="">dashcam footage</a> and a <a href="https://www.earthcam.com/usa/dc/?cam=dc_kennedycenter" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live webcam</a> operated by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a few miles to the north.</p><p>Before the crash, the plane had been on approach to Runway 33 at Reagan Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Emergency units immediately rushed to the crash site, battling dark, windy and near-freezing conditions.</p><p>The next morning, officials said that no one had survived the crash, and that efforts had shifted to recovering bodies. As of Saturday evening, 42 sets of remains had been recovered, 38 of which had been positively identified, authorities said.</p><p>The plane’s fuselage, inverted and broken in three sections, was found in waist-deep water, officials said, and the debris was spread across an area of less than a mile.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-51e0ab7">The accident raised concerns about aviation safety.</h2><p>Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, an independent federal agency, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/washington-dc-plane-crash-ntsb-investigation.html" title="">leading the inquiry</a> into the collision. Officials said they would look at the flight data from the two aircraft, review traffic control communications and conduct interviews.</p><p>Teams have recovered two so-called black boxes from the plane — a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder — which may offer insights into the moments before the crash. A black box from the Army helicopter was also retrieved, federal officials said on Friday.</p><p>Already, questions have emerged about the planes’ flight paths and whether staffing at the air traffic control tower contributed to the collision.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/plane-crash-washington-dc/staffing-was-not-normal-at-airport-tower-according-to-a-preliminary-faa-report?smid=url-share" title="">A preliminary report by the Federal Aviation Administration</a>, which was reviewed by The New York Times, found that a controller working that night was performing jobs typically assigned to two controllers: handling helicopters in the airport’s vicinity and also instructing planes that were landing and departing from runways. The staffing at the tower was “not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,” the report said.</p><p>The Army helicopter — which was operating out of Fort Belvoir, Va., with what <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/plane-crash-washington-dc" title="">officials described as an experienced crew</a>, had been approved to fly a specific route that would have let it avoid the American Airlines plane. But it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/army-helicopter-dc-plane-crash.html?smid=url-share" title="">did not follow the intended route</a>, according to four people who were briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly. The route it took was a half-mile away and higher in attitude, they said.</p><p>Shortly before the collision, the plane’s pilots were asked to pivot their landing route from one runway to another, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/jet-pilot-plane-crash-runway.html?smid=url-share" title="">according to a person briefed on the event</a> and conversations between an air traffic controller and the pilots overheard on audio recordings.</p><p>On Friday, the F.A.A. indefinitely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/business/faa-helicopter-flights-restricted-reagan-airport.html" title="">restricted</a> two commonly used helicopter routes into Reagan Airport to all but the most essential flights, calling it a critical new safety measure.</p><h2 id="link-13656b53">Figure skaters and hunters were among the plane’s passengers.</h2><p>Figure skaters, their family members and their coaches were among those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/plane-crash-victims-washington-dc.html?smid=url-share" title="">onboard the plane</a>, according to U.S. Figure Skating, the American governing body for the sport.</p><p>Russians, including figure skaters, were also onboard. Among them were the married skating champions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/europe/russian-figure-skaters-dc-plane-crash-vadim-naumov-yevgeniya-shishkova.html" title="">Yevgeniya Shishkova, 52, and Vadim Naumov, 55</a>, according to the Skating Club of Boston. They worked as coaches in the United States.</p><p>Two skaters from New England — Spencer Lane, 16, of Barrington, R.I., and Jinna Han, 13, of Mansfield, Mass. — were also killed along with their mothers, Christine Lane and Jin Han.</p><p>A group of friends who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/plane-crash-washington-dc#friends-returning-from-a-hunting-trip-were-among-the-passengers" title="">had spent days</a> in Kansas on a hunting trip were on the plane, along with a four-person crew. Officials have not released a list of the victims, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/plane-crash-victims-washington-dc.html" title="">more of their identities</a> have become public.</p><p>Army officials on Friday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/army-helicopter-crew.html?" title="">identified two of the three aviators</a> on the helicopter: Staff Sergeant Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Ga., and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Md. On Saturday, officials identified Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, 28, of Durham, N.C., as also having been on board. The Army did not immediately release Captain Lobach’s identity at the family’s request.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Mark Walker<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jack Healy<!-- -->, <!-- -->Julie Bosman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jenna Russell<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jesus Jiménez<!-- -->, <!-- -->Mitch Smith<!-- --> and <!-- -->Christina Morales<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
