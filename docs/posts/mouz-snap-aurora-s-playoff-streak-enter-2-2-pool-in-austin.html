</span> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498622/g2-esports-vs-paper-rex-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-ubqf" target="_blank">2-0</a> in the opening <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025" target="_blank">Masters: Toronto</a> playoffs match. The win pits them against either <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498621/xi-lai-gaming-vs-sentinels-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-ubqf" target="_blank">Sentinels or Xi Lai Gaming</a>, an opportunity to reach the upper final and guarantee a top three finish.</p>

<p>This matchup had only occurred twice prior to the series, with G2 having won both times in the 2024 season. In <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters: Shanghai</a>, Paper Rex was the top seed, and they <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/353830/masters-shanghai-playoffs-are-set" target="_blank">picked G2 Esports as their opponent</a> following the Swiss stage. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/355527/g2-heretics-pick-up-wins-in-shanghai-playoffs" target="_blank">G2 won</a> with a 2-1 comeback, as the North American team would end third, while Paper Rex ultimately went out in the top six.</p>

<p>“G2 is a great team,” <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9801/f0rsaken">
		f0rsakeN	</a>
</span> said before the series. “They&#39;re good against us.”</p>

<p>“We like playing against Paper Rex,” <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/15500/trent">
		trent	</a>
</span> added, complimenting their style. </p>

<p>The match opened on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498622/g2-esports-vs-paper-rex-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-ubqf/?game=221150&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>, picked by Paper Rex. A fairly even first half, G2 took the pistol round but Paper Rex was able to stabilize, as the teams went pound for pound in opening duels. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxygGz2_PGe6iX1NwAPE9wzjV0sIiaK2DG" target="_blank">A key d4v41 play</a> and  support from his teammates kept G2 at bay to take the lead 5-3, but G2 expertly alternated fast-paced site takes with default-heavy rounds to win four in a row and end the attack in their favor. </p>

<p><em><span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/13744/patmen">
		PatMen	</a>
</span> turned the series back in his team&#39;s favor with an easy 1v3.</em></p>

<p>Heading into the second half, G2 further extended their lead with the second pistol win of the series, going up 9-5. A 3K from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/7378/jinggg">
		Jinggg	</a>
</span> turned momentum back in Paper Rex&#39;s favor, and a <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/13744/patmen">
		PatMen	</a>
</span> clutch all but sealed the deal, setting off a round streak to reach match point. G2 was able to stall for one round, but Paper Rex ended their map one round later with a 13-10 win.</p>

<p>After the map, coach <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9804/alecks">
		alecks	</a>
</span> commented on his team&#39;s attack performance. “The composure, we played well together,” he said. “I&#39;m very proud of them.”</p>

<p>“I think [Paper Rex&#39;s] comp has some weaknesses,” <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/52/joshrt">
		JoshRT	</a>
</span> said regarding the upcoming map. “We&#39;re always a good Lotus team.”</p>

<p>G2 Esports&#39; map pick, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498622/g2-esports-vs-paper-rex-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-ubqf/?game=221151&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Lotus</a>, continued the series. Paper Rex took the opening pistol round, but G2&#39;s Stinger buy reset the score and the economy. The North American squad opted for early aggression and quick executes, a strategy which fit their Neon play but led to a back-and-forth as Paper Rex was able to step up to G2&#39;s style with a solid defense. </p>

<p>Paper Rex won the second pistol round to start their attack, and was able to stave off G2&#39;s Stingers to take the economic advantage and a comfortable 9-6 lead. G2 remained in the series, their defense countering Paper Rex&#39;s quick entries. alecks called for a timeout after 10-9, and the adaptation kept G2 from tying the scoreline. G2&#39;s own timeout helped them narrow the gap again at 12-11, as a <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3885/valyn">

</span> 4K avoided an early loss for his team. </p>

<p><em>A no-noise default and heavy Vyse stall from Paper Rex left G2 lost, letting the Pacific team reach map point.</em></p>

<p>Without any tactical pauses left, Paper Rex opted to continue with a fast execute, which had not found them success the past two rounds. A Breach Fault Line from <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4581/jonahp">
		JonahP	</a>
</span> forced them to reconsider, however, as they pivoted to A. The Southeast Asian squad was able to set up a post-plant due to G2 planning on a full retake. In the end, Paper Rex was able to turn G2&#39;s favorite weapon against the Americas team, keeping G2 from entering the site despite PRX&#39;s low economy, and closing out the series with a 13-11 victory. </p>

<p>“We knew that G2 was going to pick us,” <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9803/d4v41">
		d4v41	</a>
</span> said after the series. “The better team won.”</p>

<p>“Even though we closed out 2-0, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s notes we can work on,” he added. </p>

<p>d4v41 also commented on his region&#39;s strengths. “In terms of aggressiveness, Pacific plays better,” he said. </p>

<p>Paper Rex will next play against the winner of Sentinels vs. Xi Lai Gaming. Outside of the immediate rewards like potentially winning their first Masters trophy, Paper Rex will look to achieve a high placement in order to maximize their <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/vct-2025/standings" target="_blank">Championship Points</a> for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions: Paris</a> qualification. </p>

<p>G2 Esports, meanwhile, will need to play an elimination series to remain in the tournament. As with Paper Rex, a better finish can be the key to their Champions attendance, as a grand final appearance can guarantee their qualification via Championship Points. </p>
