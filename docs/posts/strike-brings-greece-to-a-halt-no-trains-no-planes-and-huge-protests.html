A police official estimated that the Athens protest attracted at least 180,000 people, the largest demonstration in the Greek capital in years.</p><p>All commercial flights to and from Greek airports were grounded, and no ferries or trains were running. Limited public transportation was operating in Athens to allow demonstrators to get to the rally. </p><p>Schools and hospitals were affected as teachers and health care workers joined the action. Lawyers and ambulance workers walked out, too, while many shops closed. Several popular artists also canceled planned shows.</p><p>At the rally in Athens, many expressed anger and frustration.</p><p>“We need to send them a message,” said Nikolas Κatsambanis, 19, a student of music production, referring to Greece’s politicians. “They lie through their teeth,” he said, adding that he no longer travels by train, having known one of the crash survivors. “My best friend’s sister was in the seventh car, and she’s still in shock.”</p><p>Niki Antypa, 68, said that she used to take “nice trips” by train but was now also scared to travel, even on public transit. “They have no control of the railways,” she said, accusing the authorities of scrambling to hide evidence about the state of the rail network after the crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-32bab647">What happened in the train accident?</h2><p>On the night of Feb. 28, 2023, a passenger train and a freight train collided head-on near Tempe, in central Greece, on a route linking Athens with the northern port of Thessaloniki. Many of those who died in the crash were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/02/world/europe/greece-train-crash.html" title="">young students returning from a holiday weekend</a>.</p><p>At the time, the Greek authorities blamed human error, saying that a routing mistake by a station master had put the passenger train onto the same track as an oncoming freight train. But they also admitted to shortfalls in Greece’s railway infrastructure and delays in installing modern safety systems that could have averted the disaster.</p><p>The deadly episode set off days of protests as people demanded accountability and greater rail safety.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/27greece-strike-jkwz/27greece-strike-jkwz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/27greece-strike-jkwz/27greece-strike-jkwz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/27greece-strike-jkwz/27greece-strike-jkwz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Large sheets of metal lie crumpled on the ground, next to a derailed passenger train.

The infrastructure and transportation minister, Christos Staikouras, told Greek television on Thursday that modern signals and remote surveillance systems had been added along the entire Athens-to-Thessaloniki route after the accident.</p><p>But a cyclone then damaged the systems, leaving them not fully functional on “a significant part” of that route, Mr. Staikouras said.</p><p>He said the damage would be repaired by summer 2026 and that Greece was working on an plan agreed upon with the European Commission to improve training for railway workers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Flowers and banners to remember victims at the 2023 train crash site, near Tempe, Greece, on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sakis Mitrolidis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The authorities have said that a judicial investigation is continuing into who may be responsible for the crash.
