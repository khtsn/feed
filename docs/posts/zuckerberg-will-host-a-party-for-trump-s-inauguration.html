And has announced a series of changes at Meta since the election in November that have delighted advisers to Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg is one of several tech-company leaders positioning themselves for a Republican administration that will have considerable influence over their industry.</p><p>Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is expected to be seated on the dais at the inauguration alongside other major tech executives, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
