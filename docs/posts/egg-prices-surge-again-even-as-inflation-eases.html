    <h1>Egg Prices Surge Again Even as Inflation Eases</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Egg prices continued their upward climb in February despite some easing in overall inflation, further straining consumers seeking relief from rising prices in the grocery aisles.</p><p>Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released on Wednesday showed that egg prices rose 10.4 percent from the previous month, to nearly $5.90 for a dozen large Grade A eggs, as an outbreak of avian influenza continued to contribute to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/business/egg-shortage-prices.html" title="">a nationwide shortage</a>. That is slightly lower than the 15-percent-plus surge in January, the largest monthly increase in egg prices in a decade. But since last year, egg prices are up nearly 60 percent.</p><p>Food prices more broadly rose 0.2 percent in February, or 2.8 percent compared with the same time last year.</p><p>Eggs have driven overall increases in grocery prices in recent months.

But the steep rise in consumer staples, including eggs, has complicated that promise as his tariff policies stoke further concern about inflation.</p></div></div>
