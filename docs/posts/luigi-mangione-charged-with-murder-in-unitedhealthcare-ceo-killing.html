    <h1>Luigi Mangione Charged With Murder in UnitedHealthcare CEO Killing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Luigi Mangione on Tuesday was accused of first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive, a charge that branded him a terrorist.</p><p>“This was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation,” said Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, at a news conference on Tuesday.</p><p>The assassination of the chief executive, Brian Thompson, on Dec. 4 in the heart of Manhattan set off a dayslong manhunt and mesmerized Americans, many of whom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/uhc-shooting-luigi-mangione-brian-thompson.html" title="">vented their frustrations</a> on dealings with health insurance companies. Some voiced their support for the gunman and rooted for him to elude capture.</p><p>But on Tuesday, prosecutors said that Mr. Mangione’s actions were meant to further terrorism and therefore merited a charge of first-degree murder. They were, prosecutors said, “intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population” and to “affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder.”</p></div></div>
