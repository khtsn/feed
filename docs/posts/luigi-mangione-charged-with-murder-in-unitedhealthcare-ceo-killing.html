This was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation. It occurred in one of the most bustling parts of our city, threatening the safety of local residents and tourists alike, commuters and businesspeople just starting out on their day.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/nyregion/18NY-uhc/18NY-uhc-threeByTwoLargeAt2X.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The first-degree murder charge branded him a terrorist over the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive, Brian Thompson.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko"><img alt="Hurubie Meko" title="Hurubie Meko" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/24/reader-center/author-hurubie-meko/author-hurubie-meko-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></a></p></div></div><p><time datetime="2024-12-17T16:19:37-05:00"><span>Dec. 17, 2024</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Luigi Mangione on Tuesday was accused of first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive, a charge that branded him a terrorist.</p><p>“This was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation,” said Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, at a news conference on Tuesday.</p><p>The assassination of the chief executive, Brian Thompson, on Dec. 4 in the heart of Manhattan set off a dayslong manhunt and mesmerized Americans, many of whom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/uhc-shooting-luigi-mangione-brian-thompson.html" title="">vented their frustrations</a> on dealings with health insurance companies. Some voiced their support for the gunman and rooted for him to elude capture.</p><p>But on Tuesday, prosecutors said that Mr. Mangione’s actions were meant to further terrorism and therefore merited a charge of first-degree murder. They were, prosecutors said, “intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population” and to “affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While some states define first-degree murder as a premeditated killing, <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/125.27" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York</a> requires an additional aggravating circumstance, one of which is terrorism. Others include torture and killing a witness or law officer.</p><p>Prosecutors also charged Mr. Mangione, 26, with second-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism and another count of second-degree murder. He also faces weapons charges.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Mangione, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, declined to comment on the new charges on Tuesday.</p><p>Mr. Bragg said that they came in response to the “brazen, targeted and premeditated shooting,” adding that he couldn’t think of another office “more equipped to handle a terrorism charge.”</p><p>If convicted on the highest charges, Mr. Mangione faces a sentence of life in prison without parole.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pa., after a customer recognized him as the suspect in the shooting and an employee called the local police.</p><p>On Thursday morning, Mr. Mangione is scheduled to return to a courthouse in Pennsylvania for two hearings, including one on gun and forgery charges he faces in that state and another on efforts to extradite him to New York. Mr. Bragg said Tuesday that his office had “indications” that Mr. Mangione would waive his extradition hearing, allowing the transfer to occur faster.</p><p>Last week, prosecutors said that Mr. Mangione would face a second-degree murder charge. Anna Cominsky, director of the criminal defense clinic at New York Law School, said that the terrorism charges were interesting because “this isn’t traditionally how we think of terrorism.”</p><p>“What they’re saying is because it was done in the location that it was done in, because of the manner in which it was done, that the aim was to terrorize, that it was to scare people,” she said. “Not just to kill this individual.”</p><p>Prosecutors most likely sought the additional charges because “they want to charge all the things that the facts support,” Ms. Cominsky said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The killing at the center of Mr. Mangione’s charges unfolded early in the morning of Dec. 4.</p><p>The police said Mr. Mangione arrived outside a Hilton hotel on West 54th Street — masked and hooded — and waited. After nearly an hour, according to prosecutors, Mr. Thompson arrived to prepare for a UnitedHealthcare investors’ day gathering. As Mr. Thompson walked to the hotel’s entrance, prosecutors say, Mr. Mangione came up behind him, raised a 3-D-printed 9-millimeter handgun fitted with a suppressor and shot him.</p><p>The police launched a citywide manhunt for the shooter, who fled on what they have said was an electric bicycle. Investigators released surveillance pictures of the suspect, including one of him smiling, taken at the front desk of a hostel on the Upper West Side where the police said he had stayed.</p><p>The police also traced the movements of the shooter from the scene of the killing, to a bus terminal and the 190th Street Station in Washington Heights, where the police said he took the A train downtown to Pennsylvania Station.</p><p>Mr. Mangione was arrested at an Altoona McDonald’s while eating hash browns and looking at his laptop when a fellow customer remarked to a friend that he resembled the person in photos the police had released. An employee who overheard called the police.</p><p>The police said Mr. Mangione was found with a handgun, ammunition, fake identification cards and what they say was a 262-word handwritten manifesto. Authorities have said that he appeared to take responsibility for the killing in the document.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>After the killing, many people vented their frustrations — and outright fury — at the health insurance industry.</p><p>“We have seen a shocking and appalling celebration of cold-blooded murder,” Jessica S. Tisch, New York’s police commissioner, said on Tuesday. “Social media has erupted with praise for this cowardly attack.”</p><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs<!-- --> and <!-- -->Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko">More about Hurubie Meko</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>17</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Mangione Charges Include Accusation of Terrorism<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
