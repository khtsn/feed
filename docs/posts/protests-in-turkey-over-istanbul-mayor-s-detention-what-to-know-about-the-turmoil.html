Many people have accused the government of using the courts to sideline a perceived political threat to Mr. Erdogan, who has led Turkey since 2003, and have called for his release.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-2d1b88ec">Who is Ekrem Imamoglu?</h2><p>Mr. Imamoglu became the mayor of Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city and economic engine, in 2019, after defeating a candidate backed by Mr. Erdogan. He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/01/world/middleeast/turkey-election-results.html" title="">re-elected</a> twice, and some polls suggest that he could beat Mr. Erdogan in a head-to-head race for the presidency.</p><p>On March 19, scores of police officers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/middleeast/turkey-istanbul-mayor-arrest.html" title="">arrested</a> Mr. Imamoglu at his home after state prosecutors accused him of corruption in municipal business and supporting terrorism. Four days later, the government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/world/middleeast/turkey-ekrem-imamoglu-istanbul.html" title="">removed him from office</a> and jailed him pending trial on the corruption charges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/24/multimedia/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/24/multimedia/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/24/multimedia/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Demonstrators with red and white Turkish flags stand and sit atop a stone structure, with more standing below." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/24/multimedia/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/24/multimedia/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/24/multimedia/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/24/multimedia/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq/24int-turkey-wtk-02-zgjq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/05e94f29-bf38-5cac-9f0e-62911497da81" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters in Istanbul took to the streets on Sunday after the city’s mayor was jailed and ousted from his role.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dilara Senkaya/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That same day, Turkey’s main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party, or C.H.P., held a primary to choose Mr. Imamoglu as its candidate in the next presidential election. Millions of party members from across the country voted, and nonparty members cast symbolic ballots to voice their support for him.</p><p>Mr. Imamoglu has vowed to fight the government. But his detention is not the only hurdle he faces in seeking the presidency. The day before his arrest, his university annulled his diploma, which could preclude him from a presidential bid. He faces an array of other court cases, too, including some that could see him temporarily barred from politics. He has called them politically motivated, too, and is contesting them in court.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-39c7656c">What is the government saying?</h2><p>State prosecutors accused Mr. Imamoglu of leading a criminal organization and overseeing bribery, bid rigging and other financial misdeeds at City Hall. They also accused him of supporting terrorism through his political coordination with a pro-Kurdish group during last year’s municipal elections, a claim that is still under investigation.</p><p>Government officials say that the accusations are not politically motivated and have called on Turks to have faith in the courts and wait for the legal process to conclude. The government has also issued protest bans in major cities, limited access to social media sites and flooded pro-government news channels with leaks aimed at indicating Mr. Imamoglu’s guilt.</p><p>Security forces have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the protests. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya has said that more than 1,100 people have been detained in relation to the protests following Mr. Imamoglu’s arrest and that more than 100 police officers were injured in clashes with demonstrators.</p><p>“Some circles in recent days are abusing the right to demonstrate, attempting to disrupt public order and attack our police officers as they fan street events,” Mr. Yerlikaya said in <a href="https://x.com/aliyerlikaya/status/1904117286409031840" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post on X</a>. “Such actions aim to disrupt the peace and safety of our people.”</p><h2 id="link-1dab89c8">What could this mean for Turkey’s future?</h2><p>The moves against Mr. Imamoglu are the latest examples of what Mr. Erdogan’s critics call his increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/world/middleeast/turkey-erdogan-democracy-istanbul-mayor-detention.html" title="">authoritarian tactics</a>. In his more than two decades in power, Mr. Erdogan has gathered state power in his hands while extending his influence over the news media and the judiciary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Erdogan’s second term expires in 2028. The Constitution limits presidents to two full terms, but he could legally run again if Parliament called for early elections and cut short his second mandate.</p><p>If Mr. Imamoglu, 54, can escape his legal troubles, that would put him in a head-to-head race with Mr. Erdogan, 71. The president has not said whether he will run, but he has no clear successor and many people expect him to do so.</p><p>Turkey’s stock market and the value of its currency have dropped substantially since Mr. Imamoglu’s arrest, although they have since regained some of their losses. Some investors, however, could avoid the country out of fears about the rule-of-law and the possibility of more instability.</p><p>Some European leaders have criticized Mr. Imamoglu’s arrest as anti-democratic, but senior American officials have said little about it.</p><p>Recent global events may have left Mr. Erdogan in a good position. The Trump administration has expressed few concerns for how American partners govern their countries. And fear that the United States will withdraw support for Ukraine in its war with Russia has led European countries to seek greater defense ties with Turkey that they may not want to risk jeopardizing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators threw flares and firecrackers at the police during protests in Istanbul on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kemal Aslan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Safak Timur<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Hubbard is the Istanbul bureau chief, covering Turkey and the surrounding region.<span> </span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>South Korea’s Martial Law: </strong>President Yoon Suk Yeol came close to disabling Parliament with a few hundred troops.
