The agency collected about $11 billion of additional revenue through personal income audits of 2010 returns. More recent tax years have a significant percentage of audits still being processed, but additional revenue is trending downward.

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Bryan Camp, a professor at the Texas Tech School of Law who previously worked at the I.R.S., said a decrease in staffing would inevitably lead to fewer audits. He said the decline in audits over the last decade was primarily because of the loss of I.R.S. workers; the agency cut its head count by about 20 percent from 2010 to 2020.</p><p>Congressional Republicans in the 2010s successfully <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/us/politics/irs-fights-back-against-house-republicans-attacks.html" title="">cut appropriations</a> for the I.R.S. President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s administration tried to reverse this trend as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. During Mr. Biden’s term, the I.R.S. added about 20,000 employees.</p><p>The goal was to increase I.R.S. enforcement spending by about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/06/us/politics/irs-agents-fact-check.html" title="">$45 billion</a> over 10 years in hopes of increasing revenue by about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/13/upshot/whats-in-the-democrats-climate-health-bill.html" title="">$125 billion</a> over the same period.</p><p>It’s not clear if any increased revenues from the Biden plan will materialize. The Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57444" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated</a> at the time that it would take 30 months for the I.R.S. to collect additional revenue from its new workers because of training time and the length of the average audit. By the time 30 months had elapsed, President Trump was back in office. And congressional Republicans have since rescinded or frozen the extra I.R.S. enforcement funding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump has long feuded with officials over his own tax compliance. As a candidate in 2016, he said he had been under audit for years and believed it was “very unfair.” The Trump Organization was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/06/nyregion/trump-org-verdict-guilty.html" title="">found guilty of tax fraud</a> in 2022, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html" title="">New York Times investigation</a> in 2018 found Mr. Trump participated in tax schemes in the 1990s that included instances of fraud.</p><p>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/irs-taxes-trump-musk-federal-workers.html" title="">laid off 7,000 I.R.S. probationary employees</a> this year. (They have been rehired after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-federal-workers-rehire-ruling.html" title="">court orders</a> and in some cases have been asked to return to work.) And the agency lost 5,000 employees who opted to take a buyout offer.</p><p>If the Trump administration were to cut I.R.S. staffing levels by the more extreme 50 percent, the former Biden Treasury official Natasha Sarin, now president of the Budget Lab at Yale, estimates a loss of $350 billion to $2.4 trillion in revenue over 10 years.</p><p>Although that estimate <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/revenue-and-distributional-effects-irs-funding" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a> by the lab covers a wide range, she said it was clear that funding the I.R.S. pays for itself. “Every estimate has within it some sense that every dollar provided to the I.R.S. generates X dollars over time,” she said. “Exactly how productive those dollars are is a subject of intense academic debate.”</p><p>Less revenue for the government would add to the deficit, even as Elon Musk, who is leading Mr. Trump’s cost-cutting efforts, says he is trying to narrow the deficit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But Republicans say audits amount to harassment of taxpayers. Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means committee, <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025/01/23/president-trumps-cease-and-desist-to-irs-protects-middle-class-families-and-small-businesses-from-irs-audits-and-weaponization/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement shortly after Mr. Trump’s inauguration that the president’s approach with the I.R.S. would help “middle-class Americans and small businesses living in fear” of more audits.</p><p>A White House spokeswoman, Liz Huston, did not answer specific questions about I.R.S. staffing levels or audit rates, but said in a statement: “President Trump has made it clear that he is committed to making the federal government more efficient without compromising mission-critical operations. There will be no disruptions to service.” The I.R.S. did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Beyond I.R.S. staffing levels, there are other reasons the audit rate has fallen since 2010, said David Hasen, a professor at the University of Florida’s law school. One of them is that Congress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/upshot/tax-code-irs-problems.html" title="">has moved</a> many time-consuming administrative roles to the I.R.S.</p><p>“The I.R.S. is asked to do more and more,” he said. “The Affordable Care Act involves the I.R.S. Other programs like the child tax credit do too.
