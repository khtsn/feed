Fans could boo and players could complain, but the game went on. Instant replay changed that a few decades ago, allowing coaches to challenge a call and ask the referees to review it. That made games fairer, but it also made them slower.</p><p>Now, many professional sports are on the verge of a new technological breakthrough: automated referee systems, which get the call right every time and significantly reduce delays from reviews.</p><p>Leagues insist that these systems, which they are testing in the minors or in preseason games, are not meant to eliminate officials. Umpires and referees are still necessary to make nuanced calls — checked swings in baseball, charging in basketball, pass interference in football. But the leagues believe automated systems could make games both fairer and faster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain what this technology can do as well as the concerns that some league officials have about it.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Referees check an instant replay during an N.F.L. game. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Hunger/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-347b36ff">State of the tools</h2><p>Technology is built into the rules of professional sports. The N.F.L. requires instant-replay reviews of all scoring plays and turnovers to ensure that the calls are right.</p><p>That was on display on the final play of the season-opening game in Kansas City. The Baltimore Ravens tight end Isaiah Likely caught a potential game-tying pass in the back of the end zone. But after a 90-second video review, officials determined that <a href="https://youtu.be/aejbS3c7nvg?si=uQ3X_eapERvsVT90" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Likely’s toe was out of bounds</a>, negating the pass and handing Kansas City the win.</p><p>It was an example of what technology does best in sports: help referees make a decision about an easily defined play. But it also highlighted one pitfall of the current system: For fans, that 90-second wait can feel a lot longer.</p><p>Automating those decisions would allow games to move more quickly. And for one sport, that has already happened at the highest level. Sony’s Hawk-Eye Live system, which for years allowed tennis players to challenge calls and see exactly where a shot had landed, has gotten so good that it now handles all the line calls at the U.S. Open and the Australian Open.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Holding the first down chain. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Comer/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-2499e6f8">On the horizon</h2><p>America’s big professional sports leagues have not moved to automated refereeing yet, but most of them are testing their own systems.</p><p>Baseball appears to be nearing a major change. It has used a system that automatically determines whether a pitch is a ball or a strike in its minor leagues, across more than 8,000 games. The system could make its first appearance in the majors next year, when the league <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5641760/2024/07/16/mlb-automated-strike-zone-test-2025/" title="">may test it during spring training</a>.</p><p>The N.F.L. is also testing computerized officiating. This preseason, the league introduced cameras that help spot the ball after plays. The technology could mean <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/sports/football/01chains.html" title="">the end of the chain gangs</a> who run onto the field with two poles connected by a 10-yard chain to measure first downs.</p><p>And the N.B.A. is testing technology to automatically detect goaltending calls, which involves determining whether the ball was moving upward or downward when it was blocked.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-7953faac">The human element</h2><p>When baseball began testing its automatic umpire system in the minor leagues, it introduced two variations. One determines balls and strikes on every pitch and notifies the umpire, who signals the result. The second variation, which uses the same technology, is called upon only when a pitcher, catcher or batter challenges an umpire’s call.</p><p>Umpires have been right on about half of those challenged calls. But players still said they preferred the challenge system to the automated one. Some said that challenges add a strategic element.</p><p>“Originally, we thought everybody was going to be wholeheartedly in favor” of the fully automatic calls, said Rob Manfred, the M.L.B. commissioner. But, he said, “players feel there could be other effects on the game that would be negative if you used it full-blown.”</p><p>Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons, leads the N.F.L.’s committee on game rules and had similar feelings about the potential for automated calls in football. “When you take the officiating out of the game and try to put it in a different place, I’m just nervous about what that leads to,” he said. “You’d have to rewrite all the rules.”</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-5c825635">Republican Campaign</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><ul><li><p>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/05/us/politics/trump-butler-rally-musk.html" title="">returned to the stage in Butler, Pa.</a>, where a gunman tried to kill him in July.

Her last best seller, “The Plot,” plumbed the depths of a middling novelist’s career, showing how far he’d go for a hit. Her new novel, “The Sequel,” picks up where that one left off, but from the perspective of the novelist’s widow, Anna Williams-Bonner, who’s written a book of her own. As she’s traveling the country, hopscotching from festival to bookstore to hotel room, she realizes that her new career isn’t the blank slate she’d hoped for … because somebody knows her secret back story. Will Anna’s debut double as a finale? As sequels go, Korelitz’s is remarkably independent. You don’t need to cram “The Plot” to get your bearings, but you might want to just for fun. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/books/review/the-sequel-jean-hanff-korelitz.html" title="">Read our review of “The Sequel” here</a>.</p><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>As a literary agent, Betsy Lerner is well acquainted with the foibles of novelists.

[Laughs.] I couldn’t tell you. Nobody’s ever said that. They did say things to me in the theater, and I had to adjust. One director came up to me once, when I was young, and he says, “The character did this, and then he’s feeling this way here, and he does this.” So I said to him, “You seem to really relate to this person.” He said, “What?” I said, “Maybe <em>you</em> should play him.” Dead silence. I don’t like that kind of talk. A director who’s directing you and is helping you with your part is telling you how to do it? I don’t understand that.
