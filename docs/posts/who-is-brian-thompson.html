The division reported $281 billion in revenues last year, providing coverage to millions of Americans through the health plans it sold to individuals, employers and people under government programs like Medicare. The division employed roughly 140,000 people.</p><p>During his tenure, the company’s profits rose, with earnings from operations topping $16 billion in 2023 from $12 billion in 2021. Mr. Thompson received more than $10 million in salary and compensation last year.</p><p>He was well-respected by Wall Street analysts, where he was known for his reassuring description of the company’s outlook.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Those who worked with him during his oversight of the company’s government programs in Medicare and Medicaid said he was responsive to concerns about how to best serve the individuals in those programs. “Every interaction with him felt extremely genuine,” said Antonio Ciaccia, a consultant who discussed using pharmacists to help provide better care for people receiving Medicaid. “He was a very good listener.”</p><p>On a recent call with Wall Street analysts and investors to discuss the company’s financial results, Mr. Thompson provided a confident voice when questioned. When asked about the employer segment, he told one analyst, “I feel really good about not only our performance, but our cost management inside our commercial business.”</p><p>Mr. Thompson had presided over the division as it has faced multiple inquiries and has been criticized by congressional lawmakers and federal regulators who accused it of systematically denying authorization for health care procedures and treatments.</p><p>The insurance arm of UnitedHealth Group has also been under federal scrutiny because the parent company was the victim of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/health/cyberattack-healthcare-cash.html" title="">broad cyberattack</a> on its billing and payment system, ChangeHealthcare. Private information, including health data, from more than 100 million Americans was compromised in the ransomware attack. The parent company paid $22 million in an effort to stop the hackers.</p><p>After Mr. Thompson joined UnitedHealth Group in 2004, he rose steadily, running such key businesses as the company’s government plans, which include its profitable Medicare Advantage operations, which are private plans. UnitedHealthcare’s management of those plans has also been scrutinized by the federal government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Before he went to work at United, Mr. Thompson spent nearly seven years at PricewaterhouseCoopers, also known as PwC, the large accounting firm. He graduated from the University of Iowa with an accounting degree in 1997.</p><p>News of his killing rippled through the vast health care business communities of insurers, providers and officials.</p><p>Gail Boudreaux, chief executive of Elevance Health, said: “Leadership in health care is marked by dedication, compassion, and a profound commitment to improving lives, and Brian embodied these qualities and more.’’</p><p>“Brian’s leadership and dedication to improving health care access and outcomes for millions of Americans will leave a lasting impact,” said Mary Beth Donahue, chief executive of Better Medicare Alliance, which represents health insurers and others that participate in the private Medicare Advantage program.</p><p>UnitedHealth Group issued a statement shortly before noon on Wednesday: “We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the C.E.O. of UnitedHealthcare. Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian’s family and all who were close to him.”</p><p>Mr. Thompson, 50, lived with his family in a suburb of Minneapolis. He is survived by his wife, Paulette R. Thompson, a physical therapist who works for a Minnesota health system and two children.</p><p>Joe Rennison<!-- --> contribute reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reed Abelson covers the business of health care, focusing on how financial incentives are affecting the delivery of care, from the costs to consumers to the profits to providers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/reed-abelson">More about Reed Abelson</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
