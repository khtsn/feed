</span> following the organization&#39;s relegation from the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2498/vct-2025-emea-stage-2/group-stage" target="_blank">VCT EMEA League</a>.</p>

<p>The day before his announcement, AvovA made a <a href="https://x.com/AvovAFPS/status/1960030706836373693" target="_blank">post</a> recapping his time with Apeks, describing difficulties handling change throughout the season and never quite feeling like himself.</p>

<p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure what the future holds after this disappointing season, but I believe everything happens for a reason,&#34; he said.</p>

<p>Winning Ascension with Apeks was not AvovA&#39;s first stint in VCT. Before joining the organization, AvovA also played for <span data-ref-id="2">

</span> during its time in Europe.</p>

<p>AvovA joined Apeks ahead of the 2024 season as part of a five-man signing class including <span data-ref-id="4">

</span>, and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9554/kaajak">

</span>. With the new roster, the squad dominated the Northern Europe Challengers circuit, winning both <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1943/challengers-league-2024-northern-europe-polaris-split-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2065/challengers-league-2024-north-polaris-split-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> before being crowned the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2143/champions-tour-2024-emea-ascension/playoffs" target="_blank">EMEA Ascension</a> champions.</p>

<p>As Apeks prepared for its maiden VCT campaign, it went through several roster changes. kaajak and soulcas were picked up by other EMEA teams, which was followed by the additions of <span data-ref-id="9">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/18615/batujnax">

</span>. The changes, which AvovA described as a big proponent for the team&#39;s struggles this past season, were followed by a winless campaign for Apeks, going 0-12 in regional play.</p>
