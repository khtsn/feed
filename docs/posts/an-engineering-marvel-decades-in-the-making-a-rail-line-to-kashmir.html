Indian officials called it a transformative leap for the restive region after overcoming physically and politically treacherous terrain to build the railway. But many Kashmiris see the project less as a lifeline and more as an effort to entrench the central government’s control over Kashmir.</p><p>The formal opening of the rail connection had been repeatedly delayed, most recently because of a terrorist attack in late April on the Indian-administered side of Kashmir, which set off days of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/world/asia/india-pakistan-conflict.html" title="">deadly conflict</a> between India and Pakistan.</p><p>The new 170-mile line, known as the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail link, was built at a cost of about $4.4 billion through some of the world’s most breathtaking landscapes. It includes one of the world’s tallest railway bridges and a nearly seven-mile-long tunnel through a mountain range.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Indian officials say the rail line will help Kashmir share in India’s steady economic growth, and improve connectivity between Kashmir and the rest of India. Until now, the only land connection was a single road that is frequently blocked by snow during the winter.</p><p>“This will change everything,” said Naveed Hassan, a 28-year-old entrepreneur. “Tourists can come directly from Delhi now. Our businesses will grow.”</p><p>But many other Kashmiris say that the government has glossed over the rail line’s limitations. Passengers will face detours for security checks, making journeys more arduous, and freight carriages will not be part of the initial rollout because terminals have yet to be built.</p><p>Passengers traveling from Srinagar, the capital city of the Jammu and Kashmir region, to New Delhi will have to get off the train in Katra, 170 miles south of Srinagar, for security checks before boarding another train, adding up to two hours to the journey.</p><p>Many Kashmiris’ views of the rail line are colored by political mistrust, which has deepened since 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi stripped the region of the semiautonomous status it had enjoyed since India’s independence in 1947.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Modi took that step, a core wish of the Hindu right wing, after a decisive election victory. The central government assumed full administration of the Muslim-majority region and placed it under a strict military lockdown. Internet and phone services were cut off for months. Thousands of political leaders were detained.</p><p>Democracy in Kashmir remained suspended for nearly five years, until a regional <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/asia/kashmir-election.html" title="">election held last September</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voters lining up to cast ballots in September in Kashmir.

About a decade later, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee formally announced the project, in line with his Hindu-nationalist party’s vision of fully integrating the region into India.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the early years, tracks were laid between two major towns in the Kashmir Valley, Baramulla and Anantnag, that are on flat land. After that, the challenges mushroomed.</p><p>The most difficult segment required cutting through the Pir Panjal mountain range, a barrier that had isolated Kashmir. In 2008, construction stopped because of unstable rock formations and landslides. After years of effort to explore engineering alternatives, the tunnel through the mountain range was completed in 2013.</p><p>Another ambitious part of the rail line was the Chenab Bridge, with a steel arch that soars 359 meters, or nearly 1,200 feet, above a river. The $180 million bridge, which was completed in 2022 after two decades of work, is designed to withstand earthquakes and bomb blasts.</p><p>Still, the rail project has been dogged by questions about the quality of construction. Engineering and safety experts, including a <a href="https://x.com/trains_are_best/status/1893862887275508057" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former chief engineer</a> with Indian Railways, have expressed concerns about design flaws and inadequate risk assessment, warning that the project went ahead in India’s most seismically active zones without adequate safeguards.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Saqib Yousuf, an official with Indian Railways in Kashmir, said the agency’s safety commissioner had taken the concerns into account and “assured the safety of the project.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chenab Bridge, whose steel arch soars 359 meters, or nearly 1,200 feet, above a river. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tauseef Mustafa/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Kashmiri traders and fruit growers are particularly upset that no freight trains will operate on the route, at least initially. They had been told that the railway would boost Kashmir’s horticulture industry, especially sales of its signature apples. Officials said that freight trains remained part of the plan and would begin running once terminals were built.</p><p>Growers are among those who made sacrifices for the rail line. Entire orchards were razed, and many families displaced, to make way for the train. Most have been compensated for their land, while some are still entangled in the legal process for getting compensation.</p><p>Mujib Mashal<!-- --> contributed reporting from New Delhi.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
