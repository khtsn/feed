Mr. Starmer and Mr. Macron are leaning toward giving permission but want to coordinate with Mr. Biden, who could soon decide to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/biden-ukraine-weapons.html" title="">support Britain and France in loosening their restrictions</a> before the United States does anything similar, U.S. officials say.</p><p>Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Mr. Biden has feared an escalation into a Russia-versus-NATO war and has only gradually given Ukraine certain weapons systems and slowly loosened some restrictions on their use.</p><p>Ms. Frederiksen said in the joint interview that the United States and Europe must prepare to support Ukraine in a war that could last for years longer, and that means loosening arms restrictions.</p><p>“I don’t think Ukraine can win with one arm on their back,” she told The Times. “So I think we need to end that discussion, to give what is needed, and actually to put it the other way around — ask Ukraine what is needed to win this war. And then we have to ensure that they will have what they need.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Denmark, Sweden and Finland, all NATO members, have said Ukraine can do as it wishes with military aid from those countries. Mr. Zelensky and Ukrainian commanders say they want to use Storm Shadow missiles from Britain, as well as a similar missile supplied by France, to strike deep into Russia. In May, Mr. Biden agreed to let Ukraine use American weapons for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/us/politics/biden-ukraine-russia-weapons.html" title="">short cross-border strikes</a> against Russia but still banned long-range attacks.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said on Tuesday that allies had given a lot in recent years, but never the full amount he has requested.</p><p>Both Mr. Zelensky and Ms. Frederiksen also said the United States and European nations needed to increase their capacity to produce weapons, and that allied investment in the production of arms inside Ukraine would help alleviate the shortage.</p><p>“We need to shift our mind-set,” Ms. Frederiksen said. “We still have a peacetime mind-set in the rest of Europe.”</p><p>“Of course we could have more production faster in the rest of Europe, if we took the right decisions, but at the same time helping inside Ukraine, I mean, co-production and so on,” she added, saying governments needed to encourage more direct investment in factories in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky noted that the European nations currently still produce more arms than Russia, and said, “What do we have to do to get it, just to get it to Ukraine?”</p><p>When asked about the “victory plan” that he has said he will present to Mr. Biden and other American politicians this week, Mr. Zelensky said a central component was bolstering Ukraine’s military — “real strengthening, not slow packages.”</p><p>Both Mr. Zelensky and Ms. Frederiksen also said NATO member nations must expedite Ukraine’s entry into the security organization.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky denounced the direct weapons aid that North Korea and Iran have given Russia, while Ms. Frederiksen said she believed China’s commercial partnerships with Russia had been pivotal in allowing Moscow to sustain its war effort. The Biden administration has said China helped Russia rebuild its defense industry despite U.S.- and Europe-led sanctions.</p><p>“I don’t think it would be possible for Russia to have a full-scale invasion and war in a European country and at the same time mobilize in their own country without help from China,” Ms. Frederiksen said. “We need to push China more, because you cannot help Russia in invading a European country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky flew to the United States on Sunday and visited a factory in Scranton, Pa., that makes 155-millimeter howitzer artillery shells. He thanked the workers for their efforts in supporting Ukraine. </p><p>Mr. Zelensky said in the interview that he planned to have meetings in Washington after his United Nations visit.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Edward Wong reports on global affairs, U.S. foreign policy and the State Department.
