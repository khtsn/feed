He was 70.</p><p>His wife, Adrienne Mooney-Connelly, said the cause was metastatic prostate cancer. She said he died in bed under his favorite painting, “Animals in the Street,” in which animals — a bear, a lion, a horse, a giraffe, an elephant and others — walk garishly dressed as humans on a city street.</p><p>Mr. Connelly rose to renown in the early 1980s, when he was represented by the prestigious SoHo art dealer Annina Nosei and hobnobbed with hot fellow artists like Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. He made about $1 million from the sale of his paintings in that decade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Animals in the Street,” 2016.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chuck Connelly</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>At one point his fame and volatile persona led to his being hired as the model for an impassioned artist character played by Nick Nolte in Martin Scorsese’s “Life Lessons,” part of a trilogy of short films under the title “New York Stories” (1989).

He worked on a remarkable breadth of subjects, including his cat Fluffy; still lifes (one of them showed a box of Bran Flakes, a bowl and a hammer); the perilous loop-the-loop of a roller coaster (or maybe there are two?); and <a href="https://www.delcotimes.com/2013/12/05/artist-remembers-little-victims-of-sandy-hook-massacre/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">portraits</a> of the 20 children, all smiling, who were killed by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Sandy Hook Children,” 2012.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chuck Connelly</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Responding to an earthquake in Russia, Mr. Connelly in 2011 created a series of anguished pictures, in muted colors, of terrified and injured students and parents hugging their rescued children.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He was asked by <a href="https://bombmagazine.org/articles/1991/07/01/chuck-connelly/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bomb magazine in 1991</a> how the free and expressive way he handled paint — which the interviewer praised for its “playful, childlike beauty” — helped produce his “dark, underground” vision of crashes and accidents and even a suspicious-looking Santa Claus (with the word “Ho-Mo” scrawled across the painting).</p><p>“Sometimes I use a real event,” he said. “And other times I don’t know where it comes from. The mailman, for instance, you see him everywhere you go, and the dog’s always biting at his foot.

He graduated from the Tyler School of Art (now the Tyler School of Art and Architecture) at Temple University in Philadelphia in 1977.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>He then moved to New York, where he found a patron in Dr. Robert C. Atkins, the creator of the Atkins diet, whose support allowed Mr. Connelly to spend two years in Germany refining his work.

Close-ups of Mr. Connelly’s hand in the act of painting stood in for Mr. Nolte’s until the actor’s brushstrokes improved.</p><p>“He was as raw as you can get,” Mr. Connelly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/27/magazine/offbalance-heroes.html" title="">told The New York Times Magazine</a> in 1991. “Like an animal.” He and Mr. Nolte went out drinking during the film’s production and became close friends.</p><p>But Mr. Connelly said he ran afoul of Mr. Scorsese when he told Page Six of The New York Post, after “New York Stories” was released, that he thought “Life Lessons” was “mundane” and “clichéd.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“It ain’t no ‘Raging Bull,’” he told the paper, referring to another, acclaimed Scorsese movie.</p><p>He told The Post in 2015 that after that comment appeared, “momentum stopped immediately, and then it slowed downwards, a slow decline of the career.” Mrs. Connelly said that her husband’s “drinking and raging also hurt his career.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Martin Scorsese, at different ages, from 2015.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chuck Connelly</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Eventually, she said, the price of his paintings recovered, “and we were extremely careful who we sold to.” (In 2015, Mr. Connelly painted three portraits of Mr. Scorsese at different ages — to put the episode in the past, he told The Daily Mail.)</p><p>His works are in the collections of the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/632972" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, the <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/objects/112443" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brooklyn Museum</a>, the <a href="http://portlandartmuseum.us/mwebcgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=5828;type=701" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Portland Art Museum</a> and other institutions.</p><p>Ms. Connelly continued to paint while in hospice care. “We knew he was a goner when he hadn’t painted for 48 hours,” Mrs. Connelly said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Connelly at a gallery opening in 2009.
