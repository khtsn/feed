I had a difficult, painful childhood, and I needed distance from him in order to heal. When I was 29 years old, I learned he had received a terminal diagnosis, and I had to confront the relationship I’d tried to leave behind.</p><p>I wasn’t sure how to move forward. Should I reconnect with my father? Should I protect myself from further pain? I reached out to my friends and boyfriend for support, searching for a way to work through these complicated feelings. This short film, “The Final Chapter,” documents this process of grief and acceptance; ultimately, filming it served as its own form of catharsis.</p><p>Frøydis Fossli Moe is a filmmaker based in London.</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
