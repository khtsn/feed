She was 41.</p><p>Ms. Giuffre died by suicide, according to a statement by the family. Ms. Giuffre (pronounced JIFF-ree) wrote in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/virginiarobertsrising11/p/DH0vvDKzDvu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a> post in March that she was days away from dying of renal failure after being injured in an automobile crash with a school bus that she said was traveling at nearly 70 m.p.h.</p><p>In 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested and charged by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York with sex-trafficking and conspiracy, accused of soliciting teenage girls to perform massages that became increasingly sexual in nature.</p><p>Barely a month after he was apprehended, and a day after documents were released from Ms. Giuffre’s successful defamation suit against him, Mr. Epstein was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-suicide.html" title="">found hanged in his cell</a> in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan. His death, at 66, was ruled a suicide.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In 2009, Ms. Giuffre, identified then only as Jane Doe 102, sued Mr. Epstein, accusing him and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/nyregion/ghislaine-maxwell-trial-epstein.html" title="">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, his co-conspirator and the daughter of the disgraced British media magnate Robert Maxwell, of recruiting her to join his sex-trafficking ring when she was a minor under the guise of becoming a professional masseuse.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Giuffre in 2023 with a photo of herself as a teenager.

He flatly denied the accusations, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/world/europe/prince-andrew-quits-epstein.html" title="">relinquished</a> his royal duties in 2019.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 2021, she sued the prince, who is the younger brother of King Charles III of England, contending that he had sexually assaulted her at Ms. Maxwell’s home in London and at Mr. Epstein’s homes in Manhattan and Little St. James, in the Virgin Islands.</p><p>A widely published photograph showed Prince Andrew with his hand around her waist. He said he had no memory of the occasion.</p><p>After Prince Andrew agreed to settle the suit by Ms. Giuffre in 2022, he praised her in a statement for speaking out and pledged to “demonstrate his regret” for his association with Mr. Epstein “by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.”</p><p>The settlement included an undisclosed sum to be paid to her and to her charity, now called Speak Out, Act, Reclaim.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A widely published photograph showed Prince Andrew with his hand around Ms. Giuffre’s waist; he said he had no memory of the occasion.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse, via Us District Court - Southern District.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In interviews and depositions, Ms. Giuffre said she was recruited to the sex ring in 2000 while working as a locker room attendant in President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. By her account, she was reading a massage therapy manual when she was approached by Ms. Maxwell and invited to become Mr. Epstein’s traveling masseuse. She said the two of them then groomed her to perform sexual services for wealthy men.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Giuffre sued Ms. Maxwell for defamation in 2015; they settled for an undisclosed sum in 2017. Ms. Maxwell was convicted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/nyregion/ghislaine-maxwell-trial-epstein.html" title="">in 2021</a> of sex-trafficking and other counts. The verdict was viewed as the legal reckoning that Mr. Epstein had denied the judicial system, and his victims, by hanging himself. Ms. Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p><p>Virginia Louise Roberts was born on Aug. 9, 1983, in Sacramento to Sky and Lynn Roberts. When she was 4, the family moved to Palm Beach County, where her father was a maintenance manager at Mar-a-Lago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Giuffre in an undated photo that was released in 2021, the year she sued Prince Andrew, accusing him of sexual assault.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse, via Us District Court - Southern District</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>She said she ran away from home after having been molested by a close family friend since she was 7. She was placed in foster homes, boarded with an aunt in California, fled to the former hippie haven of Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, lived on the streets when she was 14, and spent six months with a 65-year-old sex-trafficker, who abused her.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Compared to living on the streets and earning $9 an hour for her summer job at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Epstein’s offer to make $200 a massage several times a day was, Mr. Cawthorne wrote, one that “Virginia had determined for herself she could not refuse.”</p><p>But her mandate went well beyond those duties. She told the BBC in 2019 that she was “passed around like a platter of fruit” to Mr. Epstein’s friends and ferried around the world on private jets.</p><p>In 2002, when she was 19, Ms. Giuffre enrolled in the International Training Massage School in Thailand to become a professional masseuse. There she met Robert Giuffre, an Australian martial arts instructor, and they married.</p><p>The couple had three children and lived in Australia, Florida and Colorado before settling in Perth in 2020. They have since separated. Information on her survivors was not immediately available.</p><p>Ms. Giuffre told The Miami Herald in 2019 that the birth of her daughter in 2010 prompted her to speak publicly about her victimization. She explained why she had originally agreed to let Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell groom her as a masseuse and to provide sexual services.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“They seemed like nice people,” she said, “so I trusted them, and I told them I’d had a really hard time in my life up until then — I’d been a runaway, I’d been sexually abused, physically abused. That was the worst thing I could have told them, because now they knew how vulnerable I was.”</p><p><em>If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.</em></p><p><em> Or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.</em></p><p>Hank Sanders<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sam Roberts is an obituaries reporter for The Times, writing mini-biographies about the lives of remarkable people.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/virginia-giuffre">Virginia Giuffre</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/prince-andrew">Prince Andrew</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/ghislaine-maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
