York City Marathon, support from the crowds gathered along the course is a highlight, from the first cheers coming off the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to the last as the race concludes along Central Park South.</p><p>Not sure where to stand? Here’s our guide to picking the right cheering location for you, whether you are following one runner’s progress or looking for a good spot to park yourself for the day with a cowbell and a sign.</p><h2 id="link-2847de5b">If you’ve never cheered for the marathon before …</h2><p>A few tips:</p><ul><li><p>Cowbells or other noisemakers can save your voice if you plan to be out there all day. Look for names written on runners’ shirts. Runners will appreciate hearing cheers aimed at them, especially in the later stages when the crowds start thinning out.</p></li><li><p>The funnier your sign, the better.</p></li><li><p>The last wave of runners won’t start the race until almost noon, and many will finish at dusk or after dark. The crowds will have dissipated by then, but if you stick around, the runners will appreciate it.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-72625f65">If you’re trying to follow a specific runner around the course …</h2><p>Start by finding out your runner’s bib number so you can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/track-runners-nyc-marathon.html" title="">track their progress</a> in the app. And make sure to find out what they’re wearing so you can more easily spot them in the crowds.</p><p>For your first cheering spot, you can take the N train to the 59th Street stop in Brooklyn, which will get you to <strong>Mile 4 on Fourth Avenue</strong> to catch your runner early on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After they pass, hop back on the N to Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center, which will let you off near the <strong>other end of Fourth Avenue, right before Mile 8</strong>.</p><p>From here, if you want to see your runner as many times as possible, you can catch a Manhattan-bound Q train to 96th Street. Once you get off, you can walk to <strong>First Avenue to cheer at Mile 18</strong>. After, you can head back to Fifth Avenue and find a spot <strong>around Mile 23,</strong> <strong>between East 110th and East 90th streets</strong>. You’ll see the runners right before they enter Central Park.</p><p>But if you need to get to the finish line more quickly, take a Manhattan-bound 2 or 3 train from Barclays to Central Park North (110th Street) and walk over to Fifth Avenue at the corner of Central Park, to cheer <strong>between Miles 22 and 23</strong> <strong>at Duke Ellington Circle</strong>. After your runner passes, you can retrace your steps and catch a 2 or 3 train back down to 72nd Street to meet them as they exit the park after finishing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Mile 14 of the marathon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rosem Morton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-af911a7">If you’re cheering with a group of friends …</h2><p>There are a few locations that are good if you’re cheering with a group of people who don’t live near each other, mostly because they have good subway access.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Central Park South in the final mile of the race</strong> is near three stations and many train lines: 59th Street-Columbus Circle for the A, C, D, and 1 trains; 57th Street-7th Avenue for the N, R and W; and 57th Street for the F.</p><p>You can also all meet <strong>between Miles 14 and 15 in Long Island City, Queens</strong>. That section of the race is near Court Square, which has the E, G and 7 trains, and Queensboro Plaza, for the N, W and 7. Just make sure you coordinate so members of your group don’t end up on opposite sides of the course because of where they came out of the subway.</p><p>The best option might be <strong>between Miles 8 and 9 on Lafayette Avenue in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn</strong>. You can walk there from the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center station, which is served by the D, N, R, Q, W, 2, 3, 4 trains and the Long Island Rail Road. Or you can take the C to Lafayette Avenue. The Fulton Street G stop is also nearby, but the exits leave you on the opposite side from the other stations, so plan accordingly to end up on the same side of the course as your friends.</p><h2 id="link-1fdcc3ee">If you want a party …</h2><p>Although most of the course feels like a block party, there are three areas that go all out with drum lines, dance crews and many, many cowbells.</p><p><strong>Lafayette Avenue</strong> <strong>in Brooklyn</strong> is one, thanks to local organizations and neighbors who show up ready to make some noise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Another is on <strong>First Avenue in Manhattan, between 59th Street and the Willis Avenue Bridge</strong>. Especially in the East 60s, this stretch is famous among marathon runners for being a wall of sound after the spectator-less Queensboro Bridge. Also, with plenty of bars and restaurants along the avenue, the party lasts all day.</p><p>The biggest celebration, though, might be around <strong>Mile 20 in the Bronx</strong>, right where marathoners are hitting a different sort of wall — where their energy and spirits flag and races often start to fall apart. New York Road Runners and several local running clubs will have cheering stations there. To join, take the 6 train to the 3rd Avenue-138th Street station or the 4 or 5 train to 138th Street-Grand Concourse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many run clubs, like the Boogie Down Bronx Runners, choose Mile 20 to cheer on marathoners.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-50c1ebbb">If you want to support runners where they need it most …</h2><p><strong>Mile 20 in the Bronx</strong> tops this list, which is why so many groups plan to cheer there.</p><p>But <strong>Fifth Avenue between 110th and 90th streets</strong> has a sneaky hill in the final miles that you might not notice while walking, but you definitely would while running. If you want to be on the park side of the street, take the 2 or 3 train to Central Park North. If you’d rather be on the other side, so that you have the option to also cheer along First Avenue, take the 6 train to the 96th, 103rd or 110th Street stops.</p><h2 id="link-64cbe70f">If you have a specific borough in mind …</h2><p>Here’s our unofficial list of the best spots to cheer, by borough.
