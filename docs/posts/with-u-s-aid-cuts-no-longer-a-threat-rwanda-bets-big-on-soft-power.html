But so far the strong words have done little to tarnish the country’s status as a premier destination for investors, tourists, athletes and celebrities.</p><p>In his first weeks in office, President Trump ended virtually all American foreign aid, cutting off development programs around the world and leaving the United States with one less negotiating tool when responding to conflicts. Now, with Mr. Trump attending to other crises and slashing government spending, experts say Rwanda is betting on its soft power and reputation as a security partner and investment hub in Africa to minimize the backlash to the offensive.</p><p>“Rwanda appears to have calculated that in this moment, the pressure will not be coordinated, and that it can weather the storm,” said Murithi Mutiga, the Africa director at the International Crisis Group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“The United States is also asserting that it can expand its territory,” Mr. Mutiga added, referring to Mr. Trump’s claims that the United States would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/europe/trump-greenland-speech.html" title="">“get” Greenland</a>. “It’s an era of strongmen, in which if you feel that you can assert yourself from a military perspective, it will be hard to draw back.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/11rwanda-3-ljvq/11rwanda-3-ljvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/11rwanda-3-ljvq/11rwanda-3-ljvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/11rwanda-3-ljvq/11rwanda-3-ljvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Guests swim and sit poolside at a hotel with a view." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/11rwanda-3-ljvq/11rwanda-3-ljvq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/11rwanda-3-ljvq/11rwanda-3-ljvq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/11rwanda-3-ljvq/11rwanda-3-ljvq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/11rwanda-3-ljvq/11rwanda-3-ljvq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/44205b36-e390-5af2-a080-c9e05f3274aa" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kigali’s image as a clean and orderly city draws tourists to places like Hotel Delight in Kigali, seen here last month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Walking in a car-free zone in downtown Kigali.
