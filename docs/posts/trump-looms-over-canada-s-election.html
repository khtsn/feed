    <h1>Trump Looms Over Canada’s Election</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Millions of Canadians went to the polls today to cast ballots in an election that many believe to be the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/canada/canada-election-issues-voters.html" title="">most important in their lifetime</a>. It will decide the country’s next leader — who will go toe to toe with President Trump. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/28/world/canada-election" title="">Follow for updates</a>.</p><p>Polling has suggested that Canada’s Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, entered the day with a slight advantage over the Conservative Party and its leader, Pierre Poilievre. Results are expected to come in later this evening. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/28/world/canada/results-canada-federal-election.html" title="">We will be tracking them here</a>.</p><p>Just a couple months ago, Canada was in store for a very different election. The country was struggling with high costs, high unemployment and a surge in homelessness and substance abuse. Many Canadians blamed a decade of Liberal rule under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Conservatives led by 25 points in the polls.</p><p>Then something extraordinary happened, our Canada bureau chief, Matina Stevis-Gridneff, said. Trump imposed tariffs that could significantly damage Canada’s economy and repeatedly threatened to annex the country. Suddenly, Carney — a political novice and former central banker who became prime minister after Trudeau resigned — appeared to many voters as the man best positioned to defend the country against Trump’s attacks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If the Liberals win, Matina said, “that will indicate that Trump is a potent factor in the politics of America’s allies.”</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>We talked to the comedian Mike Myers about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/style/mike-myers-elon-musk-snl-canadian-election.html" title="">his decision to get involved in Canada’s politics</a>. He is backing the Liberals.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L.

By tonight’s resignation deadline, more than 100 are expected to resign on top of earlier departures. The office would be left with about 140 attorneys, or possibly fewer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The site of a Russian attack in the Ukrainian city of Sumy this month. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3709d969">Putin promised another brief pause in fighting</h2><p>For the second time in a week, Russia vowed to temporarily halt its attacks on Ukraine. This time, the Kremlin said, Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/europe/putin-ukraine-ceasefire.html" title="">ordered a three-day cease-fire</a>, starting on May 8, in an apparent attempt to placate Trump. Yesterday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. would decide this week whether to continue pursuing a settlement.</p><p>Ukrainian officials responded with skepticism. “Why wait until May 8th?” the foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, wrote on social media. “Ukraine is ready to support a lasting, durable, and full cease-fire,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cardinals taking communion during the funeral for Pope Francis on Saturday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-6eabb93c">The conclave will begin next week</h2><p>The next pope will be elected at a conclave that is scheduled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/europe/papal-conclave-date.html" title="">begin on May 7</a>, the Vatican announced today. That leaves the 130 or so voting cardinals with just over a week to discuss, campaign and get to know the potential contenders — though most will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/europe/pope-conclave-campaigning.html" title="">act as though no politicking is involved</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, many Catholics are mourning the death of Pope Francis, who was buried this weekend.
