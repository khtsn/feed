All three are former Soviet republics and Russian troops occupy different slices of each.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protest outside Georgia’s parliament last week in Tbilisi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daro Sulakauri for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In Georgia, what concerns people here and beyond are the unmistakable echoes of Ukraine’s popular revolution in 2014 that succeeded in pulling the country away from Moscow but ultimately resulted in a devastating war.</p><p>“The government is trying to turn the country back to the Russian sphere of influence against the will of the people, who were moving toward the West, which felt almost inevitable,” said <a href="https://history.cornell.edu/cristina-florea" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cristina Florea</a>, a historian at Cornell University who specializes in Eastern Europe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It is creepily similar to what happened in Ukraine,” she said, and “so, so worrying.”</p><p>Ever since the ruling party announced in late November it was postponing its effort to join the European Union, thousands of outraged, pro-Europe Georgians have poured into the streets of Tbilisi, the capital, provoking a brutal response.</p><p>Lazare Maglakelidze, a 20-year-old computer science student, said men in unmarked black uniforms snatched him from a recent protest, dragged him into a van, pummeled his face, broke his nose and threatened to rape him.

The United States and its European allies have also tried to sway events in Georgia, supporting nonprofit organizations and segments of the population striving to bring the country closer to the West — at times rankling Georgia’s government.</p><p>The latest clashes have widened that divide. On Monday, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-statement-situation-in-georgia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Britain announced</a> it would reduce its support to the Georgian government, citing “shocking scenes of violence” toward protesters and journalists. The United States has been equally critical, accusing the ruling party of <a href="https://www.state.gov/statement-on-georgias-suspension-of-european-union-accession/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“anti-democratic actions”</a> and suspending what had been a longstanding U.S.-Georgia strategic partnership.</p><p>Tucked between Russia and Turkey in the rugged Caucasus region, Georgia has for centuries served as a vital corridor between East and West. But more and more it is looking West.</p><p><a href="https://caucasusbarometer.org/en/nm2023ge/GEOEU/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A recent survey</a> showed that 82 percent of the country, which has a population of 3.7 million, wanted to become part of the European Union. The goal of joining the E.U. — as well as NATO — is even enshrined in <a href="https://matsne.gov.ge/en/document/view/30346?publication=36" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Georgia’s constitution</a>. Protests started last year when the government began making moves that seemed to push Georgia further from this.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>First, <a href="https://verfassungsblog.de/challenges-to-georgias-eu-integration-is-the-georgian-russian-law-2-0-contrary-to-the-georgian-constitution/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it backed a measure that mirrored a Russian law</a> that went after human rights groups and nonprofits that received Western funding. Next it adopted a measure that <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/top-eu-diplomat-warns-georgia-over-law-restricting-lgbtq-rights/33124700.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">severely curtailed gay rights</a>.

For years, officials have passed all kinds of E.U.-friendly reforms, and Georgian business leaders have been angling for a bonanza in trade.</p><p>But now, opposition leaders say, the government has ditched this for what they call “the Russian blueprint.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Government officials push back, saying it’s wrong to label them anti-West or pro-Russia.</p><p>“Our position is very clear: We want to survive as a country,” said <a href="https://www.parliament.ge/en/parliament-members/6154/biography" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Levan Makhasvili</a>, a member of Parliament and one of the ruling party’s foreign policy leaders.</p><p>“Unfortunately, you don’t choose neighbors,” he said. “And we have existential security threats from Russia on a daily basis.”</p><p>Their solution, he said, was a “pragmatic” foreign policy that continues to move toward Europe, “but cautiously,” so as not to antagonize Russia. Many of the requests European officials have made, he said, could have provoked a confrontation with Russia or been hugely detrimental to Georgians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protester shot fireworks toward police in Tbilisi last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daro Sulakauri for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>He cited the West’s economic sanctions on Russia as an example. Georgia initially joined them but stopped after it became clear that cutting off trade with Russia would hurt the Georgian economy while barely laying a glove on Russia’s.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>More absurd, he said, was a Ukrainian request that Georgia allow easy passage for volunteer fighters to travel to Ukraine.</p><p>Such a move, he said, could have set off a military escalation with Russia, which already occupies about 20 percent of Georgia, stemming from a short, intense war in 2008.</p><p>Georgian Dream claims a mandate for making policy, having won elections this October. But many Georgians believe they were rigged and election observers have raised <a href="https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/3/0/579346.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concerns about pressure and intimidation</a>.</p><p>During the election, Georgian Dream candidates said that if Georgians didn’t want their country to plunge into war, they better vote for the party’s “pragmatic” approach.</p><p><a href="https://oc-media.org/georgian-dream-launches-campaign-ads-using-images-of-war-torn-ukraine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The party even put up billboards</a> contrasting Ukraine’s destruction with images of shiny buildings in Georgia and labeling the destruction side with little numbers that corresponded to the numbers on ballots assigned to opposition parties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Opposition figures say that Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire founder of Georgian Dream who is widely viewed as the puppeteer controlling Georgia politics, is steering the country away from the West.
