Trump’s election victory, his family business is poised to capitalize on his presidency with a variety of new ventures, according to a New York Times review of financial records and interviews with people knowledgeable about his finances. And unlike in his first term, the people said, the Trump Organization aims to issue a more limited ethics plan that is unlikely to significantly curb its growth.</p><p>As the inauguration approaches, Eric Trump, Mr. Trump’s second son and the company’s de facto leader, is expected to forgo deals directly with foreign governments. But he is not planning to revive the promise the company made eight years ago to swear off all other foreign deals while his father occupies the White House.</p><p>Without that guardrail — the centerpiece of the Trump Organization’s 2017 ethics plan — the company would be free to profit from an array of business in countries essential to American foreign policy interests. In the months leading up to Election Day, Eric Trump struck real estate deals in Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and he has shown interest in new hotel projects in Israel and other countries across the Middle East, Latin America and Asia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Trump family is also branching out to forge foreign ties beyond the real estate business.</p><p>World Liberty Financial, a new cryptocurrency platform that the Trumps helped create, recently received a lucrative investment from a Chinese entrepreneur, a deal that could ultimately pay the family about $22 million. The president-elect’s publicly traded social media company, which represents his single greatest source of wealth, is also open to foreign investment.</p><p>The new ventures — both of which will face oversight from federal regulators appointed by the president — underscore how the company’s recent expansion created an even more complicated web of conflicts than in Mr. Trump’s first term. And much like the Trump administration, the Trump Organization will be unleashed in the second term, free to pursue new deals that could blur the lines between the presidency and the business.</p><p>The company’s existing properties will also continue to mix business and politics like they did in Mr. Trump’s first term, when his supporters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/10/us/trump-properties-swamp.html" title="">spent lavishly at his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago</a>. Later this month, a Trump-aligned SuperPAC will hold a $1 million-a-plate “candlelight dinner” at Mar-a-Lago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>As president, Mr. Trump is exempt from civil and criminal conflict of interest laws that would otherwise require a senior federal official to sell holdings in companies that might benefit from his or her actions. Historically, it has been up to individual presidents to voluntarily take action to avoid conflicts, like when Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm into a blind trust.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Trump put his assets into a trust at the start of his first term, but his older sons remained in control of the company. And Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/17/us/politics/trump-emoluments-money.html" title="">still profits</a> from family business operations.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Trump Organization’s existing properties, like the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, will also continue to mix business and politics like they did in Mr. Trump’s first term.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I fear that Americans will look at public office as a job that is no longer about public service — it is a family business,” said Kedric Payne, senior director for ethics at Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that has filed ethics complaints against Democratic and Republican lawmakers and candidates.</p><p>While the Trump Organization is not planning to restore its ban on all foreign deals, it is considering other ethical safeguards it adopted during the first Trump presidency, the people familiar said, as it seeks to blunt public outrage and potential lawsuits.</p><p>The company is working on what it will call an ethics “white paper” that will detail those steps, including the prohibition on deals directly with foreign governments. The Trump Organization is also considering naming an outside ethics adviser — who might allow or restrict some of the company’s deal-making — and donating to the U.S. Treasury any profits collected at hotels or golf clubs from foreign government officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The precise details of the white paper are subject to change until they are announced in the coming weeks.</p><p>“I take it very seriously,” Eric Trump said in a statement to The Times. “Over the past 40 years, we’ve built one of the finest real estate portfolios in the world. I have a responsibility to thousands of employees, and at the same time, I understand the responsibility of being part of the First Family again.”</p><p>For years, the Trump Organization was a domestic real estate business with a portfolio of American hotels, golf courses, residential buildings and office towers — some that Mr. Trump owns, others that he was paid to put his name on. While the company still operates large hotels in New York, Chicago and Las Vegas, as well as nearly a dozen U.S. golf resorts or clubs, the company’s domestic footprint has receded as it looks abroad for growth.</p><p>Eric Trump is currently working on Trump-branded projects in Oman, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, India, Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates. He is also expected to negotiate additional deals with the Saudi Arabia-based real estate company Dar Al Arkan, which has become his most frequent new business partner and has close ties to the royal family there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Trump property under construction in Kolkata, India, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elke Scholiers for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>But his keynote speech to the Bitcoin conference on Tuesday will, more than any other recent move, encapsulate the complicated ethical environment the family is embracing this time around.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2043140/000204314024000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a late October filing</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the founders of World Liberty Financial listed Eric Trump, along with his brother, Donald J.

The president-elect and his business partners have marketed it as a portal for traders to invest in cryptocurrencies and use those assets for borrowing and lending. Though the platform hasn’t officially launched, the company this fall began selling a digital currency called <a href="https://www.worldlibertyfinancial.com/us/token-sale" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WLFI</a>.</p><p>One outside investment <a href="https://x.com/worldlibertyfi/status/1861470615749972169" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has already come</a> to World Liberty Financial from Justin Sun, a Chinese-born cryptocurrency entrepreneur.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“This investment reflects our commitment to supporting blockchain innovation and fostering growth worldwide,” Mr. Sun’s company, Tron, said <a href="https://x.com/justinsuntron/status/1861121947372773545" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of the investment</a> in World Liberty.</p><p>The S.E.C. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-59" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued Mr. Sun last year</a>, claiming that he fraudulently manipulated the price of his own cryptocurrency by rapidly buying and selling it to make it appear as if it was being actively traded. The company <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.596044/gov.uscourts.nysd.596044.67.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has disputed</a> those accusations, asserting the government is overstepping its authority.</p><p>Recently, Mr. Sun grabbed headlines when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/arts/design/cattelan-banana-sothebys-auction.html" title="">spent $6.2 million</a> at a Sotheby’s art auction to buy an artwork that consisted of a banana taped to the wall, which he then proceeded to eat.</p><p>Mr. Sun will also be speaking in Abu Dhabi next week.

Now Mr. Trump’s administration could pave the way for the company to market its coins to a wider swath of the public.</p><p>“This is terrible,” Mr. Massad said. “I fear the Trump family’s interest in World Liberty Financial will influence Trump’s choices of financial regulators and the choices these people make in how they regulate crypto.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mr. Trump this week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/trump-sec-paul-atkins.html" title="">announced</a> he intended to nominate Paul Atkins to lead the S.E.C.
