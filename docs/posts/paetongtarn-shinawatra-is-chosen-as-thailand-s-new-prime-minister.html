She is not popular: A recent poll found that only 6 percent of voters backed her for prime minister, trailing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/world/asia/thailand-pita-limjaroenrat-election.html" title="">Pita Limjaroenrat</a>, the former leader of the now banned Move Forward Party, and Srettha Thavisin, the prime minister who was dismissed on Wednesday.</p></div><div><div><p>Ms. Paetongtarn’s ascent was the clearest statement yet that Mr. Thaksin, who was ousted from the prime minister’s job in a 2006 coup but has remained a powerful behind-the-scenes player, and his Pheu Thai Party would remain at the forefront of Thai politics.</p><p>But she faces numerous challenges, including an ailing economy and a topsy-turvy political era in which the military and its royalist allies have repeatedly disrupted Thailand’s democratic processes.</p><p>Ms. Paetongtarn’s decision to accept the nomination was surprising. People close to her had previously said she was reluctant to jump into the fray. A former deputy chief executive of a family-run hotel management company, Ms. Paetongtarn has a thin resume for someone seeking national leadership, having played only advisory roles in government.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A recent poll found that only 6 percent of voters wanted Ms. Paetongtarn to be prime minister.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rungroj Yongrit/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>She was a front-runner candidate for prime minister for the Pheu Thai Party during national elections last year. But the Move Forward party, led by Mr. Pita, won substantially more votes, and it joined with Pheu Thai to put forward a new government.</p></div><div><div><p>Those plans were derailed, however, when allies of the military and monarchy in Senate voted not to let Mr. Pita become prime minister. His party, which had called for changing a law that makes criticizing the monarchy a criminal offense, was banned by the Constitutional Court this month.</p><p>Mr. Srettha, who was eventually fielded by Pheu Thai as its candidate, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/world/asia/thailand-thaksin-prime-minister.html" title="">became prime minister</a>, but he held the office for less than a year before he was ousted by the Constitutional Court on Wednesday.</p><p>It was more stark evidence that Thailand’s politics are perilous and heavily manipulated — and few understand that as intimately as the Shinawatras.</p><p>The youngest of Mr. Thaksin’s children, Ms. Paetongtarn spent 17 years away from her father as he lived in self-exile, mostly in Dubai, to escape what he said were politically motivated charges against him.</p><p>Her aunt, Yingluck, Thailand’s first female prime minister, was ousted in a 2014 coup and was forced to flee the country. Her uncle-in-law, Somchai Wongsawat, was also removed as prime minister when the Constitutional Court ordered the dissolution of his People Power Party in 2008.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Thaksin returned to Thailand last year as part of a grand bargain that he had made with the conservative establishment to keep Move Forward out of power. Despite being sentenced to eight years in prison for corruption, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/18/world/asia/thailand-prime-minister-paroled.html" title="">never had to serve a day in jail</a>, a fact that still rankles his enemies and a wide swath of the Thai public.</p><p>In June, he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/world/asia/thaksin-thailand-indicted-monarchy.html" title="">charged with insulting the monarchy</a>. Analysts called that a sign that the establishment was losing patience with him.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sui-Lee Wee is the Southeast Asia bureau chief for The Times, overseeing coverage of 11 countries in the region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sui-lee-wee">More about Sui-Lee Wee</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
