The National Transportation Safety Board directed questions to the Federal Aviation Administration, which did not immediately respond on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The sightseeing company operating the aircraft, New York Helicopter Charter, had flown tourists around New York City for decades <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/nyregion/nyc-hudson-river-helicopter-crash-escobar.html" title="">before the crash</a> on Thursday. All of the people onboard were killed: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/nyregion/seankese-johnson-nyc-helicopter-crash.html" title="">pilot</a>, Seankese Johnson, 36, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/world/europe/hudson-river-helicopter-crash-dead-spain-siemens-agustin-escobar.html#:~:text=agustin%2Descobar.html-,Spanish%20Family%20Killed%20in%20Helicopter%20Crash%20Was%20Celebrating%20a%20Birthday,three%20children%20and%20the%20pilot." title="">family visiting from Spain</a>: Agustín Escobar, Mercè Camprubí Montal and their three children, Agustín, 10, Mercè, 8, and Víctor, 4.</p><p>The last major inspection of the helicopter that crashed was on March 1, the statement said. It had taken seven flights on Thursday before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/nyregion/nyc-hudson-river-helicopter-crash-escobar.html" title="">its final</a> trip.</p><p>The deadly crash has turned attention to the company and its operations. Michael Roth, the owner and chief executive of New York Helicopter Charter, had developed a reputation in New York’s competitive flight tour industry for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/nyregion/nyc-helicopter-family-crash.html" title="">lawsuits and unpaid bills</a>. Mr. Roth once sued a company that had performed maintenance on one of his helicopters, saying its shoddy work had forced an emergency landing on the Hudson in 2013. He had also sued lenders over loan agreements and a heliport operator to regain access after a debt dispute.</p><p>Federal officials have met with representatives from Mr. Roth’s company “to review operational records, policies and procedures, safety management systems and the pilot’s experience,” according to the statement on Saturday.</p><p>Reached by phone on Friday, Mr. Roth declined to answer questions.</p><p>On Sunday, investigators continued to evaluate the flight control system found in the wreckage as Police Department divers searched for the aircraft’s tail rotor, main rotor, main gear box and most of its tail boom.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The cockpit and cabin, the vertical fin, the horizontal stabilizer finlets and the forward portion of the tail boom have all been recovered. Some of the parts will be sent to the safety board’s laboratories in Washington, D.C., for further inspection, the statement said.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius is a criminal justice reporter for The Times, covering the New York Police Department.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/national-transportation-safety-board">National Transportation Safety Board</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A New Retro Subway Map</strong><strong>:</strong> The M.T.A. revealed a revamped, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/nyregion/nyc-new-subway-map.html">brightly colored map of New York’s subway system</a> that takes its cues from a 1970s throwback and was cheered by design nerds.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘Life-Changing’ Child Care in Jeopardy:</strong> Vouchers for free or discounted child care for New Yorkers that have offered a lifeline amid rising costs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/nyc-child-care-day-care-vouchers.html">could start disappearing in weeks unless state lawmakers act quickly</a> to fund the program.</p></li><li><p><strong>Salt in the Drinking Water</strong><strong>:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/nyregion/nyc-drinking-water-salt.html">Road salt is leaching into reservoirs that hold New York City’s water</a> and could make some of it unhealthy to drink by the end of the century, according to a new study.</p></li><li><p><strong>Metropolitan Diary:</strong> Up early with Jimmie Dale Gilmore, trouble placing a familiar face and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/nyregion/metropolitan-diary.html">more reader tales of New York City</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
