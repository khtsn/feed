    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>On a cold and snowy night in November 1978, the members of Randy Brooks’s country band, Young Country, found themselves stranded after a gig at the Hyatt Hotel on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe. The brakes on their van were frozen. With nowhere to go, Mr. Brooks and his bandmates went back inside to watch the next act, a bluegrass group fronted by the husband-and-wife duo of Elmo Shropshire and Patsy Trigg.</p><p>That simple twist of fate would change the fortunes of Mr. Brooks, Mr. Shropshire and Ms. Trigg, and give the world one of the most enduring — and polarizing — Christmas songs ever recorded.</p><p>Elmo &amp; Patsy invited Mr. Brooks, then a 30-year-old aspiring songwriter from Dallas, onstage that night to play one of his novelty tunes. He’d written it the year before, after hearing a holiday song by Merle Haggard, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOkJkTh7sNA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grandma’s Homemade Christmas Card</a>,” that annoyed him.</p><p>“I was tired of that kind of country song, where they set you up to like a relative who gets killed in the third verse,” recalled Mr. Brooks, though Mr. Haggard’s lyrics only implied that the beloved grandmother was deceased. “I thought, it’s more honest to admit that grandma died up front.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Whenever he played the song, his subversive ditty about a grandmother who gets drunk on eggnog, wanders out in the night and gets killed by Santa’s reindeer, audiences whooped and cheered. Mr. Shropshire and Ms. Trigg, who’d met Mr. Brooks that night, asked him to teach them the song backstage after the show.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/fashion/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/fashion/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/fashion/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An old photo of Patsy Trigg, Randy Brooks and Elmo Shropshire, with Ms. Trigg holding a small dog." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/fashion/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/fashion/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/fashion/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/fashion/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb/12GRANDMA-02-jpqb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/40593a31-682e-554d-8516-d3ee6b4acb1a" decoding="async" width="600" height="489"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left: Patsy Trigg, Randy Brooks and Elmo Shropshire in the dressing room of the Hyatt Hotel on the night they first met in 1978.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rick Sparks</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UuDU66E_vw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,</a>” which Elmo &amp; Patsy first released independently in 1979, has become as synonymous with the holiday season as week-old fruitcake and re-gifting. In 1983, the song hit No. 1 on the Billboard<em> </em>Christmas Hits Singles chart, beating out Bing Crosby’s “White Christmas” and Bobby Helms’s “Jingle Bell Rock.” It matched that feat again in 1984 and 1985, and charted on the Holiday 100 as recently as 2016.</p><p>Unlike the grandma in the lyrics, “Grandma” the song refuses to die, despite regularly appearing on lists of the <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/weirdest-christmas-songs-all-time" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weirdest</a> or most hated holiday songs. It showed up in a pivotal scene in the 2005 war drama “Jarhead,” and inspired the title of an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy.” It has spawned a line of musical toys, <a href="https://www.hallmark.com/ornaments/keepsake-ornaments/grandma-got-run-over-by-a-reindeer-musical-ornament-2199QGO2584.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hallmark ornaments</a>, a <a href="https://nelottery.com/homeapp/scratch/1171/0/gamedetail/web" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scratch-off lottery game</a> and an <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267536/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">animated TV movie</a> airing next week, as it has every holiday season for more than two decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That’s partly due to luck. But the song’s longevity also owes to the tireless promotional efforts of Mr. Shropshire, a retired veterinarian from Northern California. Every December for decades, he has flogged his lone hit by selling self-produced albums, doing call-in interviews with radio D.J.s and performing concerts around the country.</p><p>This month, at 88, Dr. Elmo, as he is known, is back on the road as a solo act, playing several shows in New Jersey, whether audiences like it or not.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Shropshire, also known as Dr. Elmo, backstage before a performance.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Fraser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Trigg this month at a church in Alabama, where she sang “Grandma.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Charity Rachelle for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It’s kind of the most-hated Christmas song,” Mr. Shropshire said by phone ahead of his seasonal blitz. “One reviewer said it had a menacing hillbilly vibe to it. Another said, ‘Sounds like Santa has a tight grip on his throat.’”</p><h2 id="link-6b6f7835">‘Grandma’ starts to catch on</h2><p>A few months after Mr. Brooks’s brief encounter with Elmo &amp; Patsy, he received a cassette in the mail of the couple singing his song. They wanted to release “Grandma” as a 45 single.</p><p>“That was really exciting because my name was going to be on a record label,” recalled Mr. Brooks, 76, who still plays in bands around Dallas, where he lives. “Nobody other than me had sung one of my songs before.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At the time, Elmo &amp; Patsy were a regional act, a kind of country Sonny and Cher who bantered onstage between songs. Ms. Trigg was the guitar player, and Mr. Shropshire played banjo. By day, he owned a vet hospital in the Bay Area.</p><p>In 1979, the couple pressed 500 copies on their own label, Oink Records, and distributed them locally. Mr. Shropshire had no aspirations other than to make “a cute Christmas gag gift to give to a couple of my friends,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A vintage poster of Mr. Shropshire and Ms. Trigg, when they performed as the Homestead Act in the 1970s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patsy Trigg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Nevertheless, the couple sent their recording to Ms. Trigg’s parents in Tennessee, who ran a small music publishing company devoted to gospel and blues, and had the song copyrighted. This move would later prove critical, and lucrative; the Triggs’ company controlled the publishing — and royalties — rather than a record label or manager.</p><p>Accounts vary on how, but one way or another a copy of “Grandma” found its way to KSFO radio’s <a href="https://bayarearadio.org/people-2/nelson" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gene Nelson</a>, an influential San Francisco D.J. who had emceed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/sports/candlestick-park-fades-from-a-spotlight-it-made-a-habit-of-stealing.html#:~:text=For%20most%20of%20its%20first,there%20on%20another%20blustery%20night." title="">Beatles’ final concert, at Candlestick Park</a>. Mr. Nelson played “Grandma” on the radio during the holidays that year, delighting Mr. Shropshire and Ms. Trigg.</p><p>The following December, Mr. Nelson played the song again, and a couple of stations taped it from KSFO and gave it airplay as well, Mr. Shropshire said. “Grandma” was beginning to catch on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In those days, radio was still a local industry, not run by broadcasting conglomerates and algorithms. Ms. Trigg recalled that she and Mr. Shropshire would get calls at home from programmers and D.J.s all over the country who had heard about a song where a grandma gets clobbered by Santa and his sleigh.</p><p>“He would get on one phone, I’d get on the other phone and we’d play the song,” said Ms. Trigg, now 77. “That was the only copy the station would have until we sent them one.”</p><p>Over the next three years, “Grandma” reached an ever-wider audience during the holidays. <a href="https://www.drdemento.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Demento</a> invited Elmo &amp; Patsy to perform it on his popular radio show. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/opinion/sunday/gray-panthers-maggie-kuhn.html" title="">Gray Panthers</a>, an advocacy group for seniors, protested the song, claiming it was ageist and hostile to grandmothers. Some stations refused to play the song, because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/weekinreview/the-muzak-of-kaching.html" title="">it annoyed listeners</a> and out of respect for those whose grandmothers had died around the holidays. The controversy and press only fueled its renown.</p><p>Mr. Shropshire, who had aspirations for a music career, realized that he may have a hit on his hands. Elmo &amp; Patsy signed a distribution deal with a company called Nationwide Sound to press 250,000 copies of the 45, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Trigg’s solo road show, at Trinity United Methodist Church in Huntsville, Ala.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Charity Rachelle for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“It’s kind of the most-hated Christmas song,” said Mr. Shropshire, pictured here performing it with a band.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Fraser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>In 1983, Mr. Shropshire said, MTV put into heavy rotation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgIwLeASnkw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the music video</a> that he and Ms. Trigg had spent $30,000 to make and sent to the channel. The video, which was shot in the couple’s home, starred Mr. Shropshire as grandpa and in drag as grandma, playing up the song’s goofiness.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>For years, Elmo &amp; Patsy had sent their single to major labels and were ignored. But when “Grandma” hit the Billboard charts and the video began airing on MTV, the labels came calling. Epic Records, home to Michael Jackson, released a full-length holiday album from the duo, titled after the hit song, in November 1984.</p><p>By that Christmas, “Grandma” was inescapable.</p><h2 id="link-2899e8bc">A carol for shock jocks</h2><p>Mr. Brooks, who had by this point given up on a music career and had taken a job with American Airlines in the reservations department, recalled the first big royalty check he received, after the song he’d written in a day — starting with the chorus and the first verse, which he had scribbled down in bed — hit No. 1.</p><p>“I think I got a check for $16,000,” or almost a year’s salary, Mr. Brooks said. “The first thing I did was I called up four couples that were my closest friends and I took them out to dinner at one of the nicest restaurants in Dallas — with roses for all the ladies and a magnum of champagne.” His date that night became his wife.</p><p>It’s not easy to write a Christmas classic. Just ask the countless music superstars who have recorded utterly forgettable holiday songs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Brooks’s accolades for “Grandma” on display in his home in Dallas.

Only a few songs from the ’80s onward have achieved sing-it-with-your-kids-in-the-car status — notably, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/arts/music/mariah-carey-christmas.html" title="">“All I Want For Christmas Is You” by Mariah Carey</a> and “Last Christmas” by Wham!.</p><p>Nathan Wang, a composer for film and television who scored the animated special based on the song, said goofy as it may be, “Grandma” shares DNA with some of the classics.</p><p>The secret, Mr. Wang said, is its simplicity: “You listen to it once and you’re almost able to sing along by the end.”</p><p>And it doesn’t hurt that “Grandma” appeals to the adolescent humor of shock jocks. Playing the song on the radio became a naughty act, an antidote to chestnuts roasting on an open fire and other sentimental images of Christmas. Unsurprisingly, the song’s twisted humor also delighted actual adolescents, another constituency that kept “Grandma” culturally relevant.</p><p>As the years went on, “Grandma” became less an assemblage of music and lyrics than a cottage industry for Mr. Shropshire. His commitment to it outlasted Elmo &amp; Patsy: The duo broke up, and the couple divorced in 1990.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Trigg with the song’s titular grandma sometime in the 1980s in Los Angeles, where she worked for a time as an actress.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patsy Trigg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“The divorce turned my life upside down,” said Ms. Trigg, who returned home to Tennessee after acting for a few years in Los Angeles and now writes children’s books.</p><p>After the couple divorced, “Grandma” became the focus of a contentious legal battle between Mr. Shropshire, Ms. Trigg and her parents, who’d helped them publish the song all those years ago. A judge ruled that henceforth, the publishing of “Grandma” would be split between Mr. Shropshire and Ms. Trigg.</p><p>By the early ’90s, the song’s popularity was waning anyway. But that’s when Mr. Shropshire and his current wife, Pam Wendell, hatched a plan to revive it.</p><h2 id="link-3174cb3b">Grandma, Inc.</h2><p>Mr. Shropshire rerecorded “Grandma” for a solo album.

Then Ms. Wendell hit the pavement, convincing drugstore chains and Dollar General to stock the CD at their checkout counters.</p><p>Come Thanksgiving, Mr. Shropshire would wake up at 3 a.m. and do hundreds of promotional phone interviews. He also appeared on national TV programs like “Good Morning America” and later “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” where he sang <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qGmcmJstY4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Grandma” with the Roots</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Shropshire on Jimmy Fallon’s late-night show, playing “Grandma” with the Roots.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lloyd Bishop/NBCUniversal, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The song was adapted for a television movie in 2000.
