Evans, a moderate Republican who dominated Washington State politics as a three-term governor and a United States senator and who was repeatedly considered for the vice presidency, died on Friday night. He was 98.</p><p>His death at his home in Seattle, which was about five blocks away from where he grew up, was from natural causes, said Dan Evans Jr, a son.</p><p>“Dad lived an exceptionally full life,” said a written statement issued on Saturday by Mr. Evans’s sons, including Mark and Bruce Evans. “Whether serving in public office, working to improve higher education, mentoring aspiring public servants,” they said, “he just kept signing up for stuff right until the end. He touched a lot of lives.”</p><p>Descended from seafarers who founded a Puget Sound shipping business in the 19th century, Mr. Evans championed education, civil rights and environmental causes as Washington’s 16th governor from 1965 to 1977. He served in the Senate, with some frustration, from 1983 to 1989.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He was a mountain climber and skier, a master yachtsman, an eloquent speaker and, in his first term as governor, a fresh new face in national politics at a time when Republicans were reeling from Senator Barry M. Goldwater’s crushing defeat in the 1964 presidential election.</p><p>At the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach in 1968, where Richard Nixon was nominated for president, Mr. Evans was chosen to deliver the keynote address. Instead of the usual oratorical exercise in party self-congratulation, the rising Republican star challenged America to face its problems: the Vietnam War, urban decay, civil rights and unemployment.</p><p>Frequently mentioned as a potential running mate for Mr. Nixon, Mr. Evans had taken himself out of consideration by backing Mr. Nixon’s progressive rival, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York, incurring the wrath of conservatives, many of whom had backed Gov. Ronald Reagan of California.</p><p>Mr. Evans resisted the designation of moderate Republican, saying in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udaDPvJk94Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2010 speech</a> to the Rotary Club of Seattle: “I am tired of hyphenated Republicanism. ‘Moderate,’ ‘conservative,’ ‘mainstream’ are all adjectives which divide us.” But the term fit him, starting in 1965, his first year as governor, when he sought to purge members of the far-right John Birch Society and their allies from the state Republican Party.</p><p>“Let those who are false prophets, the phony philosophers, the professional bigots, the destroyers, leave our party,” he told the Republican state committee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He challenged many of the central causes of conservatives. He favored abortion rights, opposed a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget and argued that while “profligate spending” could lead to disaster, tax increases were sometimes necessary. “Fiscal integrity,” he said, “is not encompassed in the famous words of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/us/politics/george-hw-bush-dies.html" title="">George H.W. Bush</a>, ‘Read my lips, no new taxes.’”</p><p>President Gerald R. Ford considered Mr. Evans twice for the vice presidency, first in 1974 when he succeeded Mr. Nixon, who had resigned in the Watergate scandal, and again in 1976, when Mr. Ford won the Republican presidential nomination. But Mr. Ford ended up naming Mr. Rockefeller as vice president in 1974 and picked Senator Bob Dole of Kansas as his running mate in 1976, when Jimmy Carter won the presidency.</p><p>As governor, Mr. Evans increased aid for higher education and was instrumental in the creation of a state community college system. He also achieved laws for cleaner air, water and beaches, and for the protection of endangered species. In 1970, Washington became the first state to create a Department of Ecology.</p><p>When urban riots convulsed the nation, he went into Seattle’s poor neighborhoods and set up centers to deliver state services. Using executive powers, he established the Washington State Indian Affairs Commission in 1967 and the State Women’s Council in 1971. In 1969, he named the first Black members to the boards of the University of Washington and Seattle Community College. He also endorsed nuclear power, tax reforms and abolition of the death penalty.</p><p>Throughout his career he formed alliances with Democrats. In 2011, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/us/politics/thomas-foley-former-house-speaker-dies-at-84.html" title="">Thomas S. Foley</a>, the former Democratic speaker of the House who served as a congressman from Washington from 1965 to 1995, said that Mr. Evans “was one of the most thoughtful and effective governors in the country and one whose advice the largely Democratic congressional delegation always listened to and often followed. He had our respect and admiration.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Re-elected in 1968 and 1972, Mr. Evans promoted the state’s economy and created jobs as unemployment rose sharply. He went to the Soviet Union and China to attract business, and helped resettle Vietnamese refugees after the Vietnam War.</p><p>In 1977, he became the president of Evergreen State College in Olympia, an innovative four-year school he helped create as governor.</p><p>Gov. John Spellman in September 1983 appointed Mr. Evans to the vacancy created by the death of Senator Henry M. Jackson. Two months later, Mr. Evans won a special election for a six-year term.</p><p>As a senator, Mr. Evans sponsored the million-acre Washington State Wilderness Act and legislation creating the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. He also generally supported the agenda of President Reagan, but found the Senate frustrating and did not seek re-election.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/17/magazine/why-i-m-quitting-the-senate.html" title="">In a 1988 article</a> in The New York Times Magazine, “Why I’m Quitting the Senate,” he said he had looked forward to “the duel of debate, the exchange of ideas.” Instead, he found “speeches read before a largely empty chamber,” “bickering and protracted paralysis” and “a legislative body that had lost its focus and was in danger of losing its soul.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Daniel Jackson Evans was born in Seattle on Oct. 16, 1925, to Daniel Lester Evans, a civil engineer, and Irma (Ide) Evans.</p><p>He graduated from Roosevelt High School in Seattle in 1943, enlisted in the Navy and was deployed as an ensign on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific shortly after the end of World War II. After earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees in civil engineering at the University of Washington, he became a structural engineer in Seattle. In the Korean War, he was recalled as a lieutenant from 1951 to 1953, serving on a destroyer and as an aide at armistice talks at Panmunjom.</p><p>In 1959, he married the former Nancy Ann Bell, who <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/obituaries/nancy-evans-washingtons-former-first-lady-dies-at-90/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">died in January</a> at age 90. Besides their three sons, he was survived by nine grandchildren. </p><p>Mr. Evans resumed engineering from 1953 to 1965, and became a partner in a Seattle firm. But he also entered politics. He was elected to the State House of Representatives in 1956, and served four terms before running for governor in 1964. Nationally, that was an overwhelmingly Democratic year as Lyndon B. Johnson crushed Barry Goldwater in the presidential race. But Mr. Evans upset a two-term Democratic governor, Albert J. Rosellini, winning with 56 percent of the vote. He was re-elected in 1968 and in 1972, when he again defeated Mr. Rosellini.</p><p>In 1972, long before his serial killings became known, Ted Bundy, a University of Washington graduate, joined Mr. Evans’s campaign for a third term. For a time, he followed Mr. Evans’s opponent, Mr. Rosellini, around the state, recording his speeches and reporting back to Mr. Evans. It was a minor scandal when Bundy’s past was exposed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>After leaving politics, Mr. Evans founded a Seattle-based political consulting firm, and served on many corporate, cultural, civic and environmental boards. He was a regent of the University of Washington from 1993 to 2005, and was president of the Board of Regents in 1996-97. In 1999, the university’s school of public affairs was named after him.</p><p>The school remarked on his legacy <a href="https://evans.uw.edu/remembering-governor-dan-evans-48-49-and-his-lifetime-of-service-and-impact/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement published online</a> on Saturday. “He believed deeply in civility, mutual respect and bipartisanship, and throughout his long career in public service, he refused to sacrifice his principles for the sake of expediency or personal advancement,” it said.</p><p>His mountain-climbing passions stayed with him his whole life. As president of Evergreen in 1973, he rappelled down the face of the college’s 122-foot clock tower. Later, in his 80s, he explained to a friend from the college that he had a hip replaced so he could go hiking with his grandchildren. That goal was fulfilled in 2010 when Daniel Jackson III joined his father and grandfather for a multiday hike in the Olympic Mountains.</p><p>In 2017, a 1.5-million-acre wilderness area of Olympic National Park was renamed in his honor. In 2022, “Daniel J. Evans: An Autobiography,” was published. “I would like to have picked a sexier title,” he told KIRO Newsradio in Seattle, “but it’s not the title that makes any difference. It’s what’s in it.”</p><p>Hank Sanders<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p><p>Adam Clymer, a reporter and editor at The Times from 1977 to 2003, died in 2018.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Robert D.
