The move is the latest in a series of Education Department directives aimed at carrying out President Trump’s political agenda in the nation’s schools.</p><p>At her confirmation hearing in February, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said schools should be allowed to celebrate the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But she was more circumspect when asked whether classes that focused on Black history ran afoul of Mr. Trump’s agenda and should be banned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I’m not quite certain,” Ms. McMahon said, “and I’d like to look into it further.”</p><p>More recently, the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/media/document/frequently-asked-questions-about-racial-preferences-and-stereotypes-under-title-vi-of-civil-rights-act-109530.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Education Department said</a> that an “assessment of school policies and programs depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.”</p><p>Programs aimed at recognizing historical events and contributions and promoting awareness would not violate the law “so long as they do not engage in racial exclusion or discrimination,” the department wrote.</p><p>“However, schools must consider whether any school programming discourages members of all races from attending, either by excluding or discouraging students of a particular race or races, or by creating hostile environments based on race for students who do participate,” the Education Department said.</p><p>It also noted that the Justice Department could sue for breach of contract if it found that federal funds were spent while violating civil rights laws.</p><p>The federal government accounts for about <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/ed-overview/federal-role-in-education" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">8 percent of local school funding</a>, but the amounts vary widely. In Mississippi, for example, about 23 percent of school funding comes from federal sources, while just 7 percent of school funding in New York comes from Washington, according to the Pew Research Center.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,” Craig Trainor, the acting assistant education secretary for civil rights, said in a statement. “When state education commissioners accept federal funds, they agree to abide by federal anti-discrimination requirements.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael C.
