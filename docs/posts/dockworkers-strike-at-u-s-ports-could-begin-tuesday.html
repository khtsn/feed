name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Longshoremen on the East and Gulf Coasts are likely to strike on Tuesday, halting most activity at some of the busiest U.S. ports, if their union and employers fail to end a monthslong standoff over a new labor contract.</p><p>The walkout by members of the International Longshoremen’s Association would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/business/economy/port-strike-economy.html" title="">cost the economy billions of dollars a day</a>.</p><p>President Biden can use a federal labor law to force the longshoremen back to work, but on Sunday he said he was not considering using that power. In recent days, top government officials have pressed both sides to reach a deal.</p><p>“It’s not desirable for the Biden administration and for the economy,” Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in trade and labor issues, said of the strike prospect. “But it looks like it’s going to happen.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The I.L.A., which has 47,000 members, has not held a strike at all the East and Gulf Coast ports since 1977. The union and the United States Maritime Alliance, the employers’ negotiating group, are at loggerheads over wages and benefits. The union <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/business/economy/port-workers-robots-automation-strike.html" title="">is also resisting the use of automated machinery</a> at the ports.</p><p>Recently, big unions like the Teamsters and the United Automobile Workers have gotten much of what they asked for in contract negotiations. The longshoremen have even more leverage.</p><p>There is no practical alternative to the East and Gulf Coast ports for moving many goods in and out of the eastern half of the country. And the ports can’t operate without longshoremen, who move metal boxes called containers on and off ships and handle other economically crucial cargo, like cars and heavy machinery.</p><p>Over a dozen I.L.A. members at a union night out at Yankee Stadium on Friday said they supported a strike.</p><p>Fearing a strike, many businesses ordered goods early so that they cleared the East and Gulf Coast ports before Tuesday. But much cargo didn’t make it through in time and could be stranded at sea. Even if a strike is short, it could take weeks to clear the backlog.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>John Wrenn, the chief operating officer at MHW, an alcoholic beverages distributor based in Manhasset, N.Y., is concerned that a strike might delay shipments and leave his business short in the lead up to Thanksgiving.</p><p>“Those are big opportunities for sales that will just be lost because products will not be on the shelves,” he said. MHW imports over 2,000 containers a year through the Port of New York and New Jersey, the third busiest port in the United States.</p><p>The I.L.A. said a strike would not stop work on cruise ships. At the Port of New York and New Jersey, bulk foodstuffs like edible oils and orange juice will also be unaffected. But other food imports could stop, leading to shortages if a strike dragged on.</p><p>Stefanie Katzman, executive vice president at S. Katzman Produce, a fruit and vegetable supplier in the Bronx, is particularly concerned that mangos, which are imported from Brazil, will spoil if they are stuck on a ship. She is considering flying some mangos in, a much more expensive option. “There’s nowhere near as much room to fly product as there is to send it in by boat,” Ms. Katzman said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ports can’t operate without longshoremen, who move containers and other cargo on and off ships.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kristen Zeis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The West Coast ports will stay open because their longshoremen belong to another union, which agreed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/14/business/economy/west-coast-dock-workers-contract.html" title="">new contract last year</a>. Though some shipments are being diverted there, causing a recent surge in activity, those ports will not be able to absorb all the cargo that goes through East and Gulf Coast ports, which account for three-fifths of U.S. container traffic. And businesses say transporting cargo from the West Coast ports on trucks or trains to the East Coast is too expensive for many goods and destinations.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The I.L.A. broke off contract talks in June, saying it had discovered labor-saving technology at a port in Mobile, Ala. The technology, used to check trucks in and out of the port, has been at the port since 2008, when it opened, a person familiar with the port said. Last week, the Maritime Alliance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/business/economy/port-strike-dockworkers-negotiate.html" title="">asked the National Labor Relations Board</a> to force the I.L.A. to resume negotiations, though it could take many weeks before the board acts after investigating the alliance’s claims.</p><p>The union’s president, Harold J. Daggett, has recently focused the I.L.A.’s campaign more on wages, <a href="https://ilaunion.org/in-multiple-communications-with-ila-leadership-usmx-held-firm-to-stingy-wage-offers-rejected-by-ila-wage-scale-committee/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a> the raises offered by the Maritime Alliance were “insulting.”</p><p>Under the current contract, which expires on Monday, longshoremen earn a top rate of $39 an hour. The I.L.A. is asking for a $5-an-hour raise for each of the six years of the new contract, which would put them at $69 an hour in the final year of the contract. The pay of West Coast longshoremen will rise to $60.85 an hour in 2027, the last year of their contract.</p><p>With overtime and shift work, a longshoreman’s income can exceed $200,000. But longshoremen say they have to put in long work weeks to make that much money. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The employers in the Maritime Alliance include global shipping companies, which made windfall profits during 2021 and 2022 when the pandemic prompted a surge in trade. But since then, their business has met challenges, including a drought that reduced crossings through the Panama Canal and attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea that have forced ships to avoid the Suez Canal and take the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.</p><p>In 2002, President George W. Bush <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/09/us/president-invokes-taft-hartley-act-to-open-29-ports.html" title="">used the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act</a> to force port operators to reopen West Coast ports. The act allows a president to suspend a shutdown for 80 days, during which efforts can be made to reach a deal.</p><p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/28/us/politics/biden-rail-strike-congress.html" title="">with Mr. Biden’s urging, Congress intervened</a> to stop a freight rail strike. But labor experts said the president might be reluctant to pressure unions a little over a month before a national election.</p><p>“They just don’t want to have a fight with labor going into the election,” said Harry C. Katz, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, “because you need the unions to get out the vote.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Eavis reports on the business of moving stuff around the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-eavis">More about Peter Eavis</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/09/30/business/port-strike-dockworkers.html">0</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/09/30/business/port-strike-dockworkers.html">0</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Biden Administration</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Washington.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Executive Orders on Gun Safety:</strong> The president used a White House ceremony to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/politics/biden-executive-orders-ghost-guns-school-safety.html">pass the baton to Kamala Harris</a>, who has made gun safety an issue in her campaign.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chinese Software in Vehicles:</strong> The Biden administration announced an initiative to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/chinese-software-ban-cars-biden.html">ban Chinese-developed software from internet-connected cars</a> in the United States, justifying the move on national security grounds.</p></li><li><p><strong> Violence in the Middle East:</strong> President Biden is beginning to acknowledge that he is simply <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/biden-israel-hezbollah-hamas-gaza.html">running out of time to help forge a cease-fire and hostage deal with Hamas</a>, his aides say.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Final ‘Quad Summit’:</strong> Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/us/politics/biden-quad-summit.html">hosted the leaders of Australia, India and Japan</a> at his home in Wilmington, Del., seeking to use his final “Quad summit” to cement the alliance between the United States and Indo-Pacific nations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Subsidies for Carbon Capture:</strong> Some Democratic lawmakers, tax watchdogs and climate activists are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/us/politics/carbon-capture-irs-subsidies.html">questioning whether the federal government can accurately verify</a> a tax program for facilities that store planet-warming gases.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
