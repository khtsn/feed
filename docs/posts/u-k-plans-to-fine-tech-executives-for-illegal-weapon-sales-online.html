Those who fail to comply could face significant fines.</p><p>Holding social media executives personally liable for content from an advertiser or seller would represent a shift in regulation of the internet. Company leaders have largely been shielded from responsibility for the words, picture, videos and other content hosted on their platforms.</p><p>While the plans are still some way from becoming law, the initiative is part of a government commitment to fight growing cases of knife crime.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Although such crimes are below prepandemic levels, they increased <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4 percent in the 12 months before March 2024</a> in England and Wales, with a much larger rise of 13 percent in robberies involving knives. There were 225 homicides in England and Wales in the 12 months to June 2024, <a href="https://benkinsella.org.uk/knife-crime-statistics/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to one charity</a>.</p><p>Earlier this year and before he became Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer gave his personal commitment to the families of victims of knife crime, meeting with several of them, including Pooja Kanda, whose son, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-66821343" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ronan, 16, was murdered</a> in 2022 with a weapon bought online.</p><p>In a statement she said she was “very relieved that today the government have kept their promise to proactively ban the ninja sword that killed my son and protect others from having the same fate.”</p><p>Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said that “the epidemic of knife crime that has grown over the last decade is devastating families and communities right across the country,” adding that she wanted to halve knife crime over the next decade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Britain’s home secretary, Yvette Cooper, embracing Pooja Kanda, who campaigns against knife crime, at a Labour Party conference in Liverpool, in September.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Temilade Adelaja/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>As a first step the British government will consult on its proposals before likely embarking on a legislative process. Knife crime in Britain is concentrated in big cities and with 30 percent of all offenses recorded by London’s Metropolitan Police Service and 10 percent by the West Midlands Police, whose region includes the cities of Birmingham and Coventry.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In September the government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/zombie-style-knives-banned" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added to the list of prohibited weapons</a> machetes and “zombie knives” — weapons which are over eight inches in length and often have a serrated edge, spikes or more than two sharp points.</p><p>Britain’s proposal is part of a wider global trend of governments ramping up pressure on social media companies. In France, Telegram founder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/business/telegram-pavel-durov-arrest-explained.html" title="">Pavel Durov was arrested</a> in August on charges including complicity in criminal activity that occurred on his platform.</p><p>In Brazil, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/world/americas/brazil-elon-musk-x-blocked.html" title="">X was blocked</a> for over a month, starting in late August, when the company refused to remove certain content. In Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last week proposed a ban on social media for people under 16 years old.</p><p>The proposal comes at a time of intense global debate about regulation of the internet and free expression. Many policymakers, particularly those in Europe, want companies like X, Meta, Google and TikTok to police their platforms more aggressively.</p><p>But in the United States, President-elect Donald J. Trump and his supporters like Elon Musk, the owner of X, have said such rules often target conservative voices and undercut free speech.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephen-castle">More about Stephen Castle</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
