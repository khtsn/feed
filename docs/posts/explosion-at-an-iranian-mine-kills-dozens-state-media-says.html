IRNA, which said earlier Sunday that 51 miners had been killed, later put the figure at 34. Other state media had estimates of the number of people killed that ranged from 30 to 51.</p><p>At the time of the explosion on Saturday, in the eastern Iranian city of Tabas, there were 69 workers in the mine, IRNA said.</p><p>Many may still be trapped, according to <a href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2024/09/22/3162835/coal-mine-blast-kills-at-least-30-in-iran" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim news agency</a>, which is affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was not possible to independently verify details of the incident.</p><p>Officials say they are trying to work quickly to rescue the workers trapped in the mine, which is operated by the Madanjo Company, according to the <a href="https://farsnews.ir/Sayeh/1726984380536219858/30-Dead%2C-17-Injured-After-Methane-Explosion-in-Iranian-Coal-Mine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fars news agency</a>, affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards.</p><p>President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran ordered an investigation into the explosion, IRNA reported.
