Across the hallway, witches belt out show tunes.</p><p>That’s the sound of “Glicked.”</p><p>Last year, moviegoers swarmed to see “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/movies/barbie-oppenheimer-release-day.html" title="">Barbenheimer”</a> — the combined name for “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” — when the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/business/barbie-oppenheimer-weekend-box-office.html" title="">films opened</a> on the same day. Now, there is a push from <a href="https://x.com/BuzzingPop/status/1856385440804118866" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the casts</a> and fans of “Gladiator II” and “Wicked” — which both opened across the country on Friday — to recreate that energy for another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/movies/glicked-wicked-gladiator-ii.html" title="">double feature with a blended name</a>.</p><p>Isabelle Deveaux and Emma Rabuano skipped out of theater six at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Brooklyn at 2:38 p.m. on Friday, after watching “Gladiator II.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>At 6:15 p.m., the pair, both 25, planned to return to the Alamo Drafthouse to see “Wicked.” The crossover, Ms. Deveaux said, “felt so specifically catered to our interests.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/22/multimedia/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/22/multimedia/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/22/multimedia/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man wearing a pink top and a light pink skirt leaps inside the theater where he went to see the movie “Wicked.”" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/22/multimedia/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/22/multimedia/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/22/multimedia/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/22/multimedia/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg/22xp-glicked-02-mqcg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/5d565882-2366-5042-8b03-f3a0ebdf463f" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Diego Gasca of Los Angeles went with friends to the opening day of “Wicked” at AMC Lincoln Square 13 in Manhattan, but he said that he was not interested in seeing “Gladiator II.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Colin Clark for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On the surface, the two films, which have a combined running time of over five hours, appear vastly different. One is a family friendly musical prequel to “The Wizard of Oz,” while the other is an R-rated epic sequel about murder, war and the Roman Empire. But Ms. Deveaux and Ms. Rabuano see some common ground in the films.</p><p>“They actually have very similar themes in very different ways,” Ms. Rabuano said. Both movies are about standing up to oppressive regimes and fighting for a better future, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elizabeth DeEtte, 38, showing off her “Wizard of Oz” shirt at the AMC Lincoln Square 13 in Manhattan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Colin Clark for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Frankie Grande, 41, whose sister is Ariana Grande, who stars in “Wicked,” attending on opening day at AMC Empire 25 in Manhattan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Colin Clark for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Some customers who filed into theaters throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn were fans of only one of the two franchises. Diego Gasca, 32, who saw “Wicked” with friends at the AMC Lincoln Square 13 theater in Manhattan said that “Gladiator didn’t really speak to us as a crew.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A few young women who were covered in green face paint or decked out in witch costumes said they were completely unaware that “Wicked” shared an opening day with “Gladiator II.”</p><p>Yet many said they were there to see the two films on the same day, or saw one and had made plans to see the other. Some moviegoers even struck a compromise with the double feature.</p><p>Shanah Worley, 33, said she happily strode into “Wicked” at 8:30 a.m. in Manhattan with her husband, sister and brother-in-law after taking the day off work and dropping off her kids. Although she admitted that “the guys are the Gladiator fans” and said that she was seeing “Gladiator II” at 12:30 p.m. as “moral support,” she was excited to see how the story would play out.</p><p>Others were equally drawn to the two films, borne out of two <a href="https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">critically acclaimed</a> and <a href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/grosses/WICKED" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">massively popular</a> productions from the same era. “Gladiator” hit theaters in 2000 while the stage musical version of “Wicked” opened on Broadway in 2003.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The movies were advertised side by side in some theaters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Colin Clark for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It helps that both 2024 films are getting a good reception. The New York Times called “Gladiator II” a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/movies/gladiator-ii-review.html" title="">pleasurably immersive spectacle</a>,” and said “Wicked” was “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/movies/wicked-review.html" title="">consistently amusing</a>.”</p><p>Some viewers who saw “Wicked” were moved to tears.</p><p>“It all made me well up at different moments,” Gaelen Gilliland, 50, a former cast member in an early Broadway production of “Wicked,” said of the movie.</p><p>Mya Rozier-Williams, 20, came out of “Wicked” and advised the next wave of viewers to stock up on tissues.</p><p>The star power in the two films is also enough to draw out legions of fans. Ms. Rozier-Williams, of Brooklyn, said that she would have to see “Gladiator II” in the next few weeks because her mother “has a huge crush on Denzel.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Gladiator II” and “Wicked” both opened across the country on Friday, attracting some fans to the crossover viewing experience.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Colin Clark for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Yes, Denzel Washington, who plays a wealthy gladiator wrangler in “Gladiator II,” is worth the price of admission himself, some “Glicked” viewers said. </p><p>Despite the overlap between the fan bases, the viewing experiences were drastically different. A quiet theater crowd watched “blood gushing out at all angles” for two and a half hours at “Gladiator II,” according to Tia Abrams. Compare that to a morning viewing of “Wicked,” where audience members in Manhattan were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/movies/wicked-movie-singalong-debate.html" title="">belting out show tunes</a> with a different vibe, Ms. Worley said.</p><p>“I’ll teach you the proper ploys when you talk to boys,” Galinda sings in “Popular,” one of the most popular songs “Wicked.” Later, she adds: “I’ll show you what shoes to wear, how to fix your hair.”</p><p>Ms. Deveaux and Ms. Rabuano didn’t participate in “Barbenheimer” — they were not interested in the “enheimer” portion. But to them, “Glicked” was different. “Glicked” was perfect.</p><p>“When we found out they were on the same day I think the excitement just grew even more,” Ms. Rabuano said. “We were just like, ‘Wow, what a full circle of all of our interests melding into one.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-15"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hank Sanders is a Times reporter and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> </span></p></div><div><div><p>Kate Christobek is a reporter covering breaking news for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-christobek">More about Kate Christobek</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/denzel-washington">Denzel Washington</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/11/22/us/wicked-gladiator-release-glicked.html">19</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Find the Right Soundtrack for You</h2><h3>Trying to expand your musical horizons?
