Putin seems to be winning.</p><p>Russian forces are pushing ahead in Ukraine. President-elect Donald J. Trump is returning to the White House. War fatigue is spreading across Europe. North Korean troops have boosted the ranks of his army.</p><p>And yet on Thursday, Mr. Putin appeared weary, threatened and newly aggrieved as he took his bellicose threats against his Western adversaries to a new level.</p><p>Even with the prospect of a friendlier American administration around the corner, he has found himself struggling anew to confront perhaps the biggest failure of his war: Russia’s inability to deter the West from providing colossal amounts of military aid to Ukraine.</p><p>As a result, Mr. Putin is bringing Russia closer to a direct conflict with the United States than at any point in decades. He announced Thursday evening that Russia had struck Ukraine with a new intermediate-range missile, one with nuclear capabilities, using a televised speech to cast the West as an aggressor that left Moscow with no choice but to respond.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Two months from now, Mr. Trump’s second presidency could give Mr. Putin the chance to strike a peace deal with Ukraine that he could portray as a victory. But until then, people who study the Kremlin say, Mr. Putin is intent on driving home the chilling message that America risks nuclear war as it expands its support for Kyiv.</p><p>“The Russian side has clearly demonstrated its capabilities,” Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said on Friday. “The contours of further retaliatory actions, if our concerns are not taken into account, have also been quite clearly outlined.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Vladimir V.

The fight is only beginning.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ever since he launched his invasion in February 2022, Mr. Putin has mostly been careful to avoid direct military conflict with NATO, even as Western countries poured modern weaponry into Ukraine that killed tens of thousands of Russian soldiers.</p><p>But on Thursday, he said in the most explicit terms yet that he was ready for such an escalation: Russia was “entitled,” he said, to strike the military facilities of countries “that allow their weapons to be used against our facilities.”</p><p>The main reason for that shift appears clear: President Biden’s recent decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-are-atacms-missiles-ukraine-russia.html" title="">American-provided missiles</a> that have a range of 190 miles. That was followed by a similar decision by the British government.</p><p>While Ukraine’s present stock of Western missiles is not sufficient to change the course of the war, Mr. Putin appears to fear that the West could provide Ukraine with more powerful, longer-range missiles in the future.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“From that point onward,” Mr. Putin said Thursday, referring to Ukraine’s missile attacks this week, “the regional conflict in Ukraine provoked by the West has assumed elements of a global nature.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Damage from Russian shelling in eastern Ukraine, in October.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But some analysts see a second reason Mr. Putin may feel prepared to take bigger risks now: Mr. Trump’s looming return to the White House.</p><p>After all, Mr. Putin’s threats about a “global” war dovetail with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/us/politics/trump-rnc-speech-transcript.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s rhetoric about Mr. Biden risking World War III</a>. So Mr. Putin — who quickly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/world/europe/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">praised Mr. Trump</a> after he won the election — may believe that taking more aggressive steps now could help him strike a favorable deal once Mr. Trump is inaugurated.</p><p>“I don’t see him being concerned about ruining his chances for a deal with Trump — rather, quite the opposite,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “Trump took the position that Biden’s policies are leading to World War III, and what Putin is doing confirms this.”</p><p>Mr. Biden long resisted allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with American missiles, to Ukraine’s great frustration, amid concern about Mr. Putin’s response. In September, Mr. Putin said that such a move <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/europe/putin-warning-nato-missiles.html" title="">would put his country “at war” with NATO</a>, for the first time defining a specific “red line” that he was warning the West not to cross.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>This week, the Biden administration crossed it, citing Mr. Putin’s own escalation of the war this fall by bringing thousands of North Korean troops into the fight.</p><p>Biden administration officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">calculate that the risk of escalation by Mr. Putin diminished</a> with the election of Mr. Trump.</p><p>But in Moscow, some question that notion. A former senior Russian official who remains close to the Kremlin said “no one knows” if a deal with Mr. Trump is really possible. But “a threat after Biden’s decision has already emerged,” he added, “so we have to respond.” He spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive Kremlin deliberations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald J.

Separate from any preparation for future negotiations, he added, that spiral “is a sort of dynamic of its own.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anton Troianovski is the Moscow bureau chief for The Times.
