Once or twice a week, he climbed snow-capped Mount Chimborazo, Ecuador’s highest peak, to hack ice from a glacier with a pickax, wrap the 60-pound blocks in hay and transport them on the backs of his donkeys. He would then sell them to villagers who did not have electricity and needed refrigeration to conserve their food.</p><p>It started as a family business. Mr. Ushca’s father, Juan, was an ice merchant, as were his brothers, Juan and Gregorio, and they made their very modest livings off the Chimborazo ice.</p><p>But Mr. Ushca, who was 4-foot-11, chipped at the ice decades after modern refrigeration came to his village, by which time his job was nearly obsolete. He gradually became known as the last of his breed, selling his blocks of ice for a few dollars each largely to vendors in a market in Riobamba, Ecuador, for use in fruit drinks and making ice cream.</p><p>“The natural ice from Chimborazo is the best ice,” Mr. Ushca said in a short documentary, “El Último Hielero,” or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/travel/the-last-ice-merchant-of-ecuador.html" title="">“The Last Ice Merchant”</a> (2012), directed by Sandy Patch. “The tastiest and the sweetest. Full of vitamins for your bones.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Once he reached the market, he delivered the blocks of ice by carrying them on his back.</p><p>“My kids would say, ‘Why suffering so much?’” Gregorio Ushca said the documentary. “‘Being so cold, walking far, if you almost make no money?’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>The Last Ice Merchant</h2><h4>Since he was 15, Baltazar Ushca has harvested the glacial ice of Ecuador’s Mount Chimborazo.

Rather, he died on Oct. 11 in Riobamba of injuries caused when a bull “overpowered him and threw him to the ground” while he was herding cattle, the municipality of Guano in central Ecuador, where he lived, said in a statement. He was 80.</p><p>“He is a national treasure in Ecuador,” said Mr. Patch, who brought Mr. Ushca and his daughter Carmen to New York in 2012 for the premiere of his documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival, where they answered questions from the audience. “Everyone knows who he is. He’s been in the news and brought attention to Ecuador.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>As his renown spread through newspaper articles and a few films, Mr. Ushca occasionally earned extra money by taking tourists to watch him harvest ice, Mr. Patch said in an interview. But after a foot injury ended his mountain work about five years ago, Mr. Ushca spent time as a guide at the city museum in Guano.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Ushca, right, and a guide, Maria Ulcachi, in 2007.

His brother Juan died around 2017.
