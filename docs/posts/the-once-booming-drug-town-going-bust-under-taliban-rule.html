Tens — then hundreds — of thousands of people flocked here to escape the war and grow poppy, fleeing the American efforts to wipe out the crop.</p><p>The Taliban opened a trauma hospital to treat their wounded and earned a fortune, not just from opium, but also from methamphetamines and taxes on goods moving in and out of Afghanistan, bringing them millions upon millions of dollars every month.</p><p>During the war, this remote district became a laboratory for a future Taliban state, providing money for the war and a sanctuary for the men fighting it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>All that has changed. The Taliban boom town is rapidly going bust.</p><p>The same insurgents who embraced opium to help finance their war have put an end to it, ordering a ban that has all but cleared Afghanistan of poppy and other illicit drugs.</p><p>What the United States and its allies failed to do in two decades of war, the Taliban has managed in two years of peace. In an area where poppy once dominated the landscape, barely a stalk remains.</p></div></div><div data-testid="Optimistic-4"><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
