Tens — then hundreds — of thousands of people flocked here to escape the war and grow poppy, fleeing the American efforts to wipe out the crop.</p><p>The Taliban opened a trauma hospital to treat their wounded and earned a fortune, not just from opium, but also from methamphetamines and taxes on goods moving in and out of Afghanistan, bringing them millions upon millions of dollars every month.</p><p>During the war, this remote district became a laboratory for a future Taliban state, providing money for the war and a sanctuary for the men fighting it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>All that has changed. The Taliban boom town is rapidly going bust.</p><p>The same insurgents who embraced opium to help finance their war have put an end to it, ordering a ban that has all but cleared Afghanistan of poppy and other illicit drugs.</p><p>What the United States and its allies failed to do in two decades of war, the Taliban has managed in two years of peace. In an area where poppy once dominated the landscape, barely a stalk remains.</p><p>Hundreds of labs set up to process heroin and methamphetamines have been closed or destroyed. The drug bazaar that powered this part of southern Afghanistan has been all but emptied. And the nation, already reeling without international aid, has lost a sizable piece of its economy as a result.</p><p>On top of that, the Taliban government has stiffened its taxes, leaving residents bitter and angry.

He built an empire out of sand, selling the pumps and solar panels that provided water for the opium boom, helping turn Bakwa into a frontier outpost for smugglers, traders and farmers.</p><p>Now his story, like Bakwa’s, has come full circle: the foreigners gone, the Taliban back in power, the earth stripped of poppy and the land returning to dust.</p><p>“It’s a matter of time,” he said.</p><p>The war in Afghanistan was many things: a mission to eliminate Al Qaeda and oust the group that gave safe harbor to Osama bin Laden; an ambitious drive to build a new Afghanistan, where Western ideals ran headlong into local traditions; a seemingly endless entanglement, where winning sometimes mattered less than not losing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Solar panels laid out by a farmer preparing to leave Bakwa.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It was also a drug war.</p><p>The Americans and their allies tried again and again to sever the Taliban’s income and stop one of the world’s worst scourges: opium and heroin production.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The United States spent nearly $9 billion on heavy-handed eradication and interdiction, yet Afghanistan eclipsed its own records as the largest producer of illicit poppy in the world.</p><p>What did change was where that poppy was grown. Little by little, farmers flooded once empty deserts in southwestern Afghanistan, barren pockets of sand with almost no populations to speak of before.</p><p>Communities formed in starburst patterns along ancient irrigation lines, then moved farther into the desert to farm as they pleased. The Taliban followed, finding sanctuary in the utter remoteness of districts like Bakwa and their unnavigable roads.</p><p>At its height, the Taliban oversaw a narco-state here, a farm-to-table drug operation with hundreds of field labs processing opium into heroin and wild ephedra into methamphetamines for Europe, Asia and elsewhere. By the end of the war, Bakwa had become an entrepôt of the drug trade, home to the largest open-air drug market in the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-11"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="afghan-city-map-iaf5z" data-id="100000009883983" data-source-id="100000009883983"><div slug="afghan-city-map-iaf5z" data-sourceid="100000009883983" id="embed-id-100000009883983">

Despite banning poppy on religious grounds before the American invasion, the Taliban allowed farmers to grow as much of it as they wanted during the war.</p><p>And they taxed it loosely, often whatever farmers could afford, adopting a hearts-and-minds strategy. They also taxed smugglers, who were happy to help fund a Taliban war machine that didn’t interfere with business.</p><p>Bakwa soon became an incubator for governance. Taliban courts adjudicated all manner of disputes, while millions of dollars flowed monthly to help finance the Taliban mission beyond Bakwa and the southwest.</p><p>Western officials took aim at that money. They began with eradication, then tried persuading farmers to grow legal crops, and ended with fighter jets bombing makeshift labs made of mud.</p><p>“At least $200 million of this opium industry goes into the Taliban’s bank accounts,” Gen. John Nicholson, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan in 2017, a year of peak poppy production, <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/1377753/department-of-defense-press-briefing-by-general-nicholson-via-teleconference-fr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said at the time</a>. “And this fuels — really pays for the insurgency.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But the Taliban’s customs checkpoints were just as essential in Bakwa, or even more so, taxing goods to the tune of $10 million a month or more, according to Taliban officials.</p><p>“The money from agriculture, poppy included, funded the war” in these regions, said Haji Maulavi Asif, now the Taliban’s governor for Bakwa District. “But the money from the customs operation helped fund the entire movement.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Haji Maulavi Asif, the Taliban’s governor for the Bakwa District of Afghanistan.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Now that poppy has been banned, the farmers the Taliban once relied on feel betrayed, while the Taliban is trying to govern without the money it brings.</p><p>“While economically, the decision to ban poppy costs a lot, politically it makes sense,” said Mr. Asif. “We are silencing the countries of the world who say we are growing poppy and participating in the global drug trade.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-42ac61c3">‘Desert people’ to opium entrepreneurs</h2><p>When the war started in 2001, Mr. Khaliq barely noticed.</p><p>He had only recently bought land on a roadless expanse in Bakwa that cooked under the summer sun. But just beneath the surface, there was water, so bountiful that reeds grew in some areas. Mr. Khaliq, a mechanic, opened a tiny workshop to fix water pumps.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abdul Khaliq’s son, center, working to repair a water pump brought by a neighbor for maintenance, last year.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>There were no phones and few neighbors back then, so when the Americans invaded, he heard about it only weeks later.</p><p>“We were desert people,” he said. “We didn’t care about the war. That was the concern of city people.”</p><p>That changed quickly. Before the American invasion, the Taliban had banned poppy production, sending opium prices skyrocketing. Now that they were gone, Mr. Khaliq switched from growing wheat to poppy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Others soon joined, and the desert took on new hues. Bright flowers and verdant stems softened the landscape. The money was good — so good that the new Afghan government came knocking.</p><p>One day, Bakwa’s new police chief showed up to marvel at how productive Mr. Khaliq’s poppy fields were.</p><p>“I bet there’s over half a ton of opium here,” Mr. Khaliq recalled the chief saying.</p><p>“I told him it wasn’t that much, but he charged me for that amount anyway,” Mr. Khaliq said with a laugh. “And then he also asked for a bribe.”</p><p>With the Americans in control of Bakwa, eradication programs gained momentum. The district governor soon arrived with great fanfare, bringing a tractor, cameras and an entourage of police.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>American soldiers preparing to launch a search operation for Taliban in 2009 from their base in Bakwa.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Moore/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>He gathered the farmers and announced there would be no more poppy because the foreigners were serious about getting rid of Afghan opium.</p><p>Mr. Khaliq and others watched with quiet indignation as the tractor plowed through a neighbor’s field. But after a short exhibition, the tractor stopped and a photographer was summoned.</p><p>“They took pictures of the small destroyed area,” Mr. Khaliq recalled. “Then, they took bribes and left.”</p><p>So went the early American-backed eradication campaigns in Bakwa, and the farmers adapted right away. They began pooling their money to compensate whoever’s crops were destroyed for show.</p><p>As word spread, newcomers began arriving in droves. Unfamiliar faces turned up weekly to Mr. Khaliq’s garage, dragging motors for him to fix. He stocked spare parts and water pipes, and began selling gas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The lone functioning gas pump at Mr. Khaliq’s garage.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“Our business grew with the population, but we never expected it to grow so much,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-41f83137">The Taliban’s ‘pivot’</h2><p>Mr. Khaliq didn’t care much for the Taliban at first. He found them harsh and overbearing, propagandizing about their faith while turning on the people around them.</p><p>“They were killing people and denouncing them as spies, even visitors who came to see family,” said Haji Abdul Salam, one of Bakwa’s largest landowners.</p><p>But they learned from their mistakes as they notched military gains. By 2006, a resurgent Taliban was carrying out its first major offensive since being ousted, laying waste to nearby districts in Helmand Province.</p><p>A steady stream of refugees arrived in Bakwa, and more Taliban followed, from fighters to mullahs, seeking shelter and opportunity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>“I moved to this area because it was safe,” said Haji Naim, Mr. Khaliq’s cousin, a Taliban fighter.</p><p>Bakwa turned out to be a great place to hide. The terrain was flat, making it easy to spot incoming raids. The ground was silty, which made planting roadside bombs simple. The roads meandered with such arbitrary vigor that only locals knew how to navigate them.</p><p>“There is not a single straight road in Bakwa,” said Mr. Khaliq. “If you spot a Taliban, you can’t even chase him.”</p><p>As they claimed more territory, the Taliban “learned to pivot,” said Mr. Salam, who helps oversees the main tribal council in Bakwa. “They began to prosecute their own officials, and brought real justice and accountability.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Farmers drinking tea under a moonless sky in Bakwa.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>The Taliban eventually squeezed the Afghan government into a tiny corner of the district, forcing it to abandon any pretense of control over the area.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Hundreds of workers descended on Bakwa to collect opium sap each harvest, while an industry of buyers and smugglers coalesced around an open-air drug market known as the Abdul Wadood Bazaar.</p><p>The bazaar drew thousands at times, a vast collection of frontiersmen trading in illicit goods. An entire logistics network developed to serve the trade.</p><p>The Taliban ran neither the market nor the drug trade but taxed all of it.</p><p>The money added up — and caught the eye of the Americans.</p><h2 id="link-5d561e4">Solar panels and mobile courts</h2><p>Eradication wasn’t working. In 2007, the peak of the effort — with officials reporting 19,000 hectares of poppy destroyed — Afghanistan still broke a record for poppy cultivation.</p><p>Increasingly, the Americans and their allies began prosecuting a more conventional drug war in places like Bakwa, staging raids on smugglers and their networks. Violent interdiction became the norm, infuriating residents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>The Taliban, by contrast, endorsed the drug trade, at least while it was serving their interests. Though they had banned poppy before, they didn’t seem to worry much about the contradiction during the war. To the contrary, they appointed Islamic scholars who delivered sermons on the importance of supporting the jihad and expelling foreigners.</p><p>“The secret to their success was religious propaganda,” said Haji Abdullah Khan, a lifelong Bakwa resident. “People didn’t like the Taliban, but they didn’t want Christians or Jews here.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Water well piping lined up in the main, now mostly empty bazaar in Bakwa’s district center, last year.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>On more administrative matters, the Taliban also assigned a district governor. Such shadow governors, as they were called, were high-value targets for the Americans and Afghan forces. But Bakwa was so safe for the insurgents that it became a magnet for senior Taliban leaders.</p><p>The Taliban established mobile courts, with judges riding around the district, meting out justice on the road. Prisoners would be locked in cars while the officiants went about their business, including the execution of thieves and murderers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>Sometimes, the Taliban would ask locals to host the courts, including Mr. Khaliq. Too frightened to refuse, he said he held more than a few on his compound, just as he sold them gas and offered them tea whenever they came through. But he never warmed to the insurgents.</p><p>Which made it all the more frustrating to him when U.S. forces, who operated out of bases in nearby areas, raided his home on multiple occasions.</p><p>“I just did what I needed to do regardless of who was in power,” he said.</p><p>A constant stream of visitors came to Mr. Khaliq’s expanding compound, which by about 2014 included new storage units, a new garage and a small kiosk selling snacks and sodas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-42"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Young relatives of Mr. Khaliq manually rotating an array of solar panels to catch the afternoon sun.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><p>Lines of customers waited in his courtyard — sometimes for days — to purchase the most revolutionary piece of farming technology to emerge during the war: solar panels to run Bakwa’s ubiquitous water pumps.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>“We must have sold tens of thousands of units,” Mr. Khaliq said.</p><p>The desert was transformed once more, now with the black tiles of solar setups. Water reservoirs became the norm, an incredibly wasteful method of irrigation that uses open-air pools, which evaporate quickly in the desert heat.</p><p>Newcomers claimed even more pieces of desert. The growth was so rapid that international experts on poppy cultivation, like David Mansfield, tracked it via satellite imagery, monitoring the stamps of green invading a sea of brown.</p><p>“The Americans and their allies pushed the farmers and sharecroppers into the desert, where they were greeted by the Taliban and welcomed with open arms,” said Mr. Mansfield, an analyst on Afghanistan.</p><p>By 2016, he added, more than 300,000 acres of land were being cultivated in Bakwa, a sixfold increase from 2003.

Once in control of the $200,000 facility, the Taliban turned it into a hospital.</p><p>“The hospital would treat 200 to 250 patients a day,” said Abdul Wasi, a nurse there. “It was a trauma center for the Taliban. Fighters from all over the region would come here.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-49"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A young man standing near a private reservoir, fed by water pumped by solar power, with dry fields surrounding it, in the Shagai region of Bakwa District.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-23"><p>The local Afghan government, having abandoned the district altogether, moved to a few containers along the side of a highway.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-24"><div><h2 id="link-16c7dfb5">Heroin, meth and taxes</h2><p>Bakwa became a Taliban financial capital, collecting taxes like any other formal authority.</p><p>Though the American-backed government controlled the official customs checkpoints in and out of Afghanistan, the Taliban set up their own.</p><p>They placed them on highways leading to and from Iran, Turkmenistan and Pakistan, charging hundreds of dollars per commercial vehicle. The Taliban even issued receipts.</p><p>The money, estimated at around $10 million a month, overshadowed the taxes from poppy farmers and smugglers, local Taliban officials say — and it was all administered from Bakwa.</p><p>The district changed yet again. Poppy had been like an anchor tenant in a vast drug emporium. Next, labs began sprouting up to process heroin, a more lucrative venture. Those, in turn, gave way to new labs producing methamphetamines.</p><p>The labs proliferated along the edges of the open-air market. Some used cough medicine, draining amber bottles of pseudoephedrine and cooking it down. But ephedra, a shrub that blanketed the central highlands of Afghanistan, soon transformed the industry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-25"><div><p>Hundreds of people, if not thousands, worked in the burgeoning meth trade, transporting, milling and producing the drug from the wild ephedra crop.</p><p>Mr. Mansfield estimated that hundreds of tons of meth were produced in Bakwa alone, even as poppy continued breaking records. In 2017, Afghanistan cultivated more opium than in any year since the start of the war.</p><p>The United States, desperate for a forceful response, redoubled its efforts. Fighter jets and B-52 bombers launched a two-year campaign to destroy labs across southwestern Afghanistan, including in Bakwa.</p><p>An estimated 200 labs were destroyed, many of them mud huts and lean-tos leveled by munitions that cost many times what they had obliterated. Little changed. By 2020, hundreds of labs were still churning out heroin and meth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-55"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abandoned homes in Shagai, Bakwa District, gradually falling back into the earth.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-26"><div><h2 id="link-480abe9">A drug market turned ghost town</h2><p>The collapse came as quickly as the boom.

Poppy had a long shelf life once harvested. Its watering needs coincided with the spring snowmelt from the neighboring mountains. The trade could hold on, residents reasoned.</p><p>But then the war ended.</p><p>The Americans withdrew for good in 2021 and the Taliban took over. Months later, the supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, declared that poppy cultivation was “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/world/asia/taliban-opium-poppy-afghanistan.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAll%20compatriots%20are%20informed%20from,the%20Taliban&#39;s%20leader%2C%20Haibatullah%20Akhundzada." title="">absolutely prohibited</a> in the whole country.”</p><p>The Taliban claimed to have arrested numerous traffickers, seized nearly 2,000 tons of drugs and raided hundreds of heroin labs. In 2023, the Taliban destroyed dozens of labs in Bakwa, setting them ablaze.</p><p>Where the Americans had cherry-picked from the sky, killing or injuring innocents along the way, the Taliban removed nearly every laboratory in Bakwa. The Abdul Wadood Bazaar hollowed out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-29"><div><p>With ruthless efficiency, the Taliban did what the United States had hoped for. They got rid of poppy farming, and in doing so, severed one of their economic lifelines.</p><p>The remnants of the boom haunt the landscape: abandoned well derricks, stark against the acid sky; old food wrappers and animal droppings desiccated in vacant courtyards.</p><p>Farmers blame the Taliban for their misery. For nearly 15 years, their poppy — and the taxes the Taliban collected from it — supported the insurgents’ war to establish a government.</p><p>Now that the Taliban got what they wanted, they have forgotten the people of Bakwa who made it all possible, residents grumble. Farmers too poor to leave now send their sons to work on harvests elsewhere, renting them out as labor.</p><p>“We have no choice but to stick it out,” said Haji Hawaladar, who had moved his entire family to Bakwa, trading his herd of goats for land. Now, he added, “we could not even give this land away for free.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-65"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Haji Hawaladar, center, with fellow farmers, at his home in Bakwa District.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-30"><div><p>The Taliban seemed to have no reservations about leaving. Today, the district is largely empty of administrators and fighters.

The people who did well in Bakwa were top of that list.”</p><p>In Mr. Khaliq’s compound on a recent evening, as a honeyed light washed over the desert, nieces and nephews played in the courtyard, while a son stood idly by the gas pumps, waiting for customers who never came.</p><p>A few years earlier, his grounds would have been teeming with life.

They could have enforced water rights agreements, as exist all over Afghanistan. They could ease their ban on poppy to keep the farmers afloat.</p><p>“The Taliban did not solve the biggest issues, water and the economy,” he said.</p><p>Like others, he knows some people are still hoarding opium reserves to sell at a high price, given the ban.
