Instead of snapping back into its original place on the tower it lifted off from at a South Texas site, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/science/space-starship-launch-landing.html" title="">as it did in October</a>, the booster performed a smoky splashdown into the Gulf of Mexico minutes after launch.</p><p>President-elect <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/politics/trump-spacex-launch.html" title="">Donald J. Trump observed</a> the flight’s start from a nearby location.</p><p>It’s not unusual for a test launch to be unable to achieve all of its objectives. But after a successful test flight last month, SpaceX’s most recent attempt was a setback and suggests the company has some work left to do as it pursues rapid reusability of the vehicle. That is a prerequisite for the pipe dream of the company’s founder, Elon Musk, of sending people to Mars in the years ahead.</p><p>“Development testing, by definition, is unpredictable,” said Jessica Anderson, a manufacturing engineering manager at SpaceX and one host of the live broadcast. “But that is exactly why we test.”</p><p>While the booster did not make it back to the launch tower for a dramatic “chopsticks” catch, the rocket’s upper stage achieved at least one of the test flight’s objectives as it traveled through space toward the Indian Ocean. Around 35 minutes into the journey, SpaceX engineers reignited one of Starship’s engines in space for the first time, a crucial step for future orbital flights of the vehicle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=starship-flight-6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SpaceX is continuing to stream coverage of the test flight</a>, which you can watch in the video player above. The upper stage of the vehicle will attempt to softly splash down into the water. It has already started to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere, creating a colorful glow around the spacecraft’s surface as plasma built up beneath it.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/19/multimedia/19starship-launch-03-kqjf/19starship-launch-03-kqjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/19/multimedia/19starship-launch-03-kqjf/19starship-launch-03-kqjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/19/multimedia/19starship-launch-03-kqjf/19starship-launch-03-kqjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="The booster portion of the spacecraft emits flames and propellant from its bottom as it lands in the middle of the sea, viewed from a distance." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/19/multimedia/19starship-launch-03-kqjf/19starship-launch-03-kqjf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/19/multimedia/19starship-launch-03-kqjf/19starship-launch-03-kqjf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/19/multimedia/19starship-launch-03-kqjf/19starship-launch-03-kqjf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/19/multimedia/19starship-launch-03-kqjf/19starship-launch-03-kqjf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/254fb03f-329c-5140-9d5b-d042a3f5b08d" decoding="async" width="600" height="338"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Super Heavy booster splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico after nearly seven minutes of flight.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">SpaceX, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6284f793">What is Starship?</h2><p>The Starship rocket system is the largest ever built — 397 feet tall, or about 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty including the pedestal.</p><p>And it has the most engines ever in a rocket booster: The Super Heavy booster — the bottom part of the rocket — has 33 of SpaceX’s powerful Raptor engines sticking out of its bottom. As those engines lift Starship off the launchpad in South Texas, they will generate 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle.</p><p>The upper part, also called Starship or Ship for short, looks like a shiny rocket from science fiction movies of the 1950s, made of stainless steel with large fins. This is the upper stage that will head toward orbit, and ultimately could carry people to the moon or even Mars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-27b87102">How is the sixth flight different from the last launch?</h2><p>In most ways, the sixth flight had aimed to be a repeat of the fifth flight.</p><p>One difference was that SpaceX restarted one of the engines on the upper-stage Starship during its one-hour flight through space. That is a capability that will be needed to bring a future Starship back to the ground from orbit.</p><p>As with earlier test flights, the vehicle for Tuesday’s flight will not enter orbit but will instead travel on a suborbital path that, by design, takes it on a collision course with the middle of the Indian Ocean. That way, if anything goes wrong, the rocket will still splash down harmlessly in the water.</p><p>The ship will belly-flop into the atmosphere to slow down and then pivot to a vertical position as if it were landing.</p><p>There are other tweaks to the rocket and flight plans.</p><p>The company announced during the livestream that a plush banana was placed in the vehicle’s cargo hold.</p><p>Thermal tiles on the surface of Starship’s underside protect it from the heat of re-entry. On this flight, SpaceX has deliberately left off tiles on entire sections of Starship’s underside. That is to test secondary heat protection materials that aim to prevent heat from burning through the rocket skin if some tiles fall off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Tuesday, it will perform a stress test of the ship’s steering flaps by falling nose down during the final part of its descent, after it slows below the speed of sound.</p><p>Previous Starship launches occurred early in the morning. This flight will launch in the afternoon so that it will be daylight in the Indian Ocean, allowing better observations of Starship’s landing.</p><p>The entire flight should take a little more than one hour.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Super Heavy booster from SpaceX’s Starship vehicle returning to the launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, during its test flight on Oct. 13.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Gay/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-78a17fa8">How could the 2024 election result affect Starship and SpaceX?</h2><p>The pace of Starship flights could pick up, and Mr. Trump has promised to streamline regulatory procedures.</p><p>Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder, has complained that the pace of testing of the vehicle has been slowed through unnecessary environmental reviews by the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates private space launches, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The new administration could also speed up Mr. Musk’s dreams of using Starship to send people to Mars.</p><p>Currently, NASA is planning to use a version of Starship as a lander that would take astronauts back to the moon. But Mr. Trump could shift NASA’s focus to sending astronauts to the red planet instead.</p><p>Mr. Musk has said SpaceX planned to launch uncrewed Starships to Mars in 2026 to test its ability to land there, and if successful, people could be aboard for a future opportunity. Earth and Mars align every 26 months.</p><p>Mr. Musk has also suggested that the F.A.A. under Mr. Trump could allow Starship to conduct suborbital flights taking passengers halfway around the world in half an hour.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katrina Miller is a science reporter for The Times based in Chicago.
