The representative spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are being held in secrecy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The United States has long been pushing for a deal and is trying to facilitate one with the help of Qatar and Egypt, the two main countries mediating between Israel and Hamas.</p><p>The Reuters news agency reported on Sunday night that Hamas had approved the list presented by Israel. The report cited an unnamed Hamas official who added that any hostage deal was contingent upon Israel agreeing to a timetable for withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent cease-fire, in line with Hamas’s longstanding demands.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has refused to openly declare any willingness to end the war, vowing to eradicate Hamas as a military force and governing power in Gaza.</p><p>Roughly 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza out of some 250 people taken captive during the Hamas-led attacks in October 2023 that prompted the war. At least a third of the captives are presumed to be dead, according to Israel.</p><p>A weeklong truce in November 2023 allowed for the release of 105 hostages in exchange for some 240 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel. Only a few hostages have been rescued alive by Israeli forces, and the bodies of dozens of others have been recovered. Israeli soldiers accidentally killed three hostages whom they misidentified as fighters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Subsequent efforts to reach a cease-fire have faltered amid gaps in the two sides’ demands, with each side blaming the other for thwarting efforts to reach a deal.</p><h3 id="link-140c2203"><span>What Israel says</span></h3><p>Israel sent the original list of hostages to be released in the first phase of any deal to the mediators in July 2024, according to a statement released on Monday by Mr. Netanyahu’s office.</p><p>But the list has since been updated because three of those who originally appeared on it — Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli dual citizen, and two Israeli women, Carmel Gat and Eden Yerushalmi — were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/hostages-gaza-what-to-know.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">killed by their captors</a> in late August. The newer version of the list was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kv0y1vd6mo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published by the BBC</a> on Monday, and Mr. Netanyahu’s office appeared to confirm its authenticity.</p><p>In this latest round of talks, Israel has demanded information from Hamas about which hostages remain alive. Without that, Israeli officials say, there can be no agreement on how many Palestinian prisoners Israel would be willing to release in exchange for them.</p><p>“As yet, Israel has not received any confirmation or comment by Hamas regarding the status of the hostages appearing on the list,” Mr. Netanyahu’s office said in its statement, adding, “Israel will continue to act relentlessly for the return of all of our hostages.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Hamas representative who spoke to The Times said the group would not give Israel details on the status of the 34 hostages on the list without getting some things in return.</p><p>The list includes 10 women, five of them soldiers; 11 older male hostages aged between 50 and 85; two young children who Hamas previously said had been killed in an Israeli airstrike, but whose deaths have not been confirmed by the Israeli authorities; and other male hostages whose release Israel considers urgent.</p><p>In addition to Israel’s demand for information on the status of the hostages, other sticking points remain in the negotiations, according to Israeli and Hamas officials. An Israeli official familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations publicly, said on Monday that the talks were progressing and that the sides were closer than they have been in a while. But the official cautioned that they have also been at a similar point before.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner">More about Isabel Kershner</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>5</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Hamas Approves List of Israeli Hostages To Free, Inching Toward Cease-Fire Deal<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
