But he was known to the Sheriff’s Office.</p><p>“We’ve had more than 10 incidents since 2022 where the suspect was either the victim, witness or the suspect in an incident handled by the Harford County Sheriff’s Office,” Sheriff Gahler said. “This investigation is very active and very early on.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The high school enrolls about 985 students and is part of the Harford County Public Schools system.
