    <h1>One Student Kills Another in Dispute at Maryland High School, Authorities Say</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>School nurses attended to the victim, who was identified as Warren Grant, a resident of the Edgewood community in Harford County, before he was airlifted to a trauma center at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, where he later died.</p><p>“We’re all familiar with the horrible shooting that took four lives in Georgia just a couple days ago,” Sheriff Gahler said, “and here we stand in Harford County with a school shooting.”</p><p>Though the shooting appeared to have been the result of an isolated dispute, which the authorities did not describe, it prompted anxiety and set into motion protocols that have become familiar across the country, as parents waited to see their children outside a reunification center that had been set up at a nearby church.</p><p>Joppatowne High School was four days into the school year, but this was the shooter’s first day at the school, Sheriff Gahler said. But he was known to the Sheriff’s Office.</p><p>“We’ve had more than 10 incidents since 2022 where the suspect was either the victim, witness or the suspect in an incident handled by the Harford County Sheriff’s Office,” Sheriff Gahler said. “This investigation is very active and very early on.”</p></div></div>
