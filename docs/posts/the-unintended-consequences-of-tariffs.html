    <h1>The Unintended Consequences of Tariffs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/damien-cave"><img alt="Damien Cave" title="Damien Cave" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/08/multimedia/author-damien-cave/author-damien-cave-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p></div></div></div><p>Donald Trump promises to impose big tariffs on Chinese products. The last time he did that, in 2018, he made at least one country boom: Vietnam.</p><p>Since it suddenly cost more to export things from China, businesses moved across the border. Especially in northern Vietnam, factories have replaced rice fields, growth rates have stayed in double-digits and exports to the United States have surged. For the first time since the 1800s, the region — once poverty-stricken — is now the country’s main economic engine.</p><p>Northern Vietnam’s rise is an example of the unintended consequences of a trade war: The biggest benefits often emerge outside the countries engaged in the dispute. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain three aspects of our new and unpredictable economic age.</p><h2 id="link-c7344ba">Industrial dispersion</h2><p>Northern Vietnam’s boom shows that tariffs on one country tend to spread industrialization to others nearby.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>I recently visited Haiphong, the main port city in the north. I wrote a story that The Times published today about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/world/asia/north-vietnam-trump-tariffs.html" title="">how its export boom is hard to miss</a>, with cranes swinging overhead and trucks rattling down new highways. Companies like LG (of South Korea) and Pegatron (a Taiwanese supplier for Apple and Microsoft) have built factories that employ tens of thousands of workers earning about $500 a month.</p><p>Many exporters relocated quickly to Vietnam, one economist told me, because they preferred to be out of China but close to Chinese suppliers. This reduced U.S. dependence on China and roughly tripled America’s trade deficit with Vietnam. Only China and Mexico now have larger trade imbalances with the United States, selling far more to America than they buy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Vietnam’s rise in the rankings could make it another tariff target for Trump. He tends to see such trade disparities as a sign that America is losing power and jobs while other countries are winning. For supporters, tariffs help bring manufacturing back to America.</p><p>But punishing Vietnam would probably just create more movement, and not necessarily to the United States, where labor and supply networks — especially for electronics — are less robust than in many parts of Asia. With concerns rising about punitive measures from Washington, some companies in Vietnam are already exploring expansion plans in Cambodia, India and Malaysia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-ca3c593">Geopolitics also matter</h2><p>Vietnam’s boom looks far less threatening to Washington if the country is seen as a check on Chinese dominance. But if Trump sees it as a Chinese ally, sharing Communist Party values, he’ll likely treat it as a competitive threat.</p><p>It’s not clear which view Trump will favor, but President Biden visited Hanoi last year and designated the alliance as a “strategic partnership,” in part to recognize the country’s nuanced role. Vietnam counters China in the disputed waters of the South China Sea by building island outposts and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/asia/vietnam-south-china-sea.html" title="">challenging Chinese claims to vital trade routes</a>. Many countries signed on to receive loans from China’s global infrastructure program, but Vietnam — wary of Chinese influence and debt — did not. Hanoi is also purchasing more American military equipment, deepening the countries’ ties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Construction in Haiphong.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linh Pham for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Those developments show how commerce and security often collide and compete. Vietnam exports more to the United States than its new leaders want. At the same time, it helps counter an increasingly assertive China. Which of those two issues would you choose to prioritize?</p><h2 id="link-3121cfb">The law of surprise</h2><p>Trump and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, each seek to dominate the other through trade policy. </p><p>But Vietnam shows it will not always go according to plan. Economic nationalism does not reliably hurt a rival or help an ally. Trade wars scatter impacts across the globe in ways that leaders struggle to predict and manage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Especially in Asia, where free trade created supply chains that crisscross many countries, the era of Xi and Trump has made prosperity feel precarious. Northern Vietnam’s boom this year could be next year’s bust if Washington changes course. Meanwhile, Xi has subsidized exports — threatening local industry in several countries as they fill up with cheap Chinese goods.</p><p>“Power is shifting,” said Bruno Jaspaert, an executive in Haiphong with business experience in Europe, the United States, Asia and the Middle East. “Over time, the most important factors — to survive — are resilience and flexibility.”</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-8be180e">Trump’s Press Conference</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><ul><li><p>Trump, speaking from Mar-a-Lago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/us/politics/trump-drones-border-autism.html" title="">criticized vaccine mandates for schools</a> and said his administration would look into the debunked theory that vaccines cause autism.</p></li><li><p>He suggested that Republican senators who oppose his cabinet nominees for what he called unreasonable, political or stupid reasons should face primary challenges.</p></li><li><p>Trump said he would consider <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/nyregion/trump-pardon-eric-adams.html?smid=url-share" title="">pardoning Eric Adams</a>, the Democratic mayor of New York City who was indicted on corruption charges.</p></li><li><p>Trump threatened more lawsuits against media companies.
