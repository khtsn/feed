</span>. However, Shopify would go on a surprise run and sweep through the playoffs all the way to the Stage 1 <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/459082/shopify-rebellion-black-vs-m80-challengers-league-2025-north-america-ace-stage-1-playoffs-gf" target="_blank">victory</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this success was only a flash in the pan, as Shopify would be eliminated in the Swiss stage during the next two stages, both with 2-4 records. Their Stage 1 win kept them towards the top of the circuit points standings, but their lackluster performance in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2396/challengers-2025-north-america-ace-stage-2/swiss-stage" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2467/challengers-2025-north-america-ace-stage-3/swiss-stage" target="_blank">3</a> kept them out of the top two, and thus out of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2534/vct-2025-americas-ascension" target="_blank">Ascension</a>.</p>

<p>Although the roster is released, Shopify Rebellion Black will have a spot in Challengers next year should they choose to field a new team. Shopify also continues to field their Game Changers roster, <span data-ref-id="11">
