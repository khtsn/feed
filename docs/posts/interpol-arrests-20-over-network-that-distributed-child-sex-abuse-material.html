The policing organization said the network was also thought to extend to Asia and the Pacific region.</p><p>The arrests, which took place in 12 countries, were the result of a cross-border inquiry in which investigators tracked the illegal material online to people who viewed or downloaded it, according to Interpol.</p><p>The sweep made public by Interpol on Friday included arrests in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Italy, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain and the United States. It also led investigators to 68 other suspects in 28 countries, including the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania, according to Interpol and the Spanish police.</p><p>The investigation began last year in Spain, where officers from the national police force’s specialized cyberpatrols came across suspicious instant messaging groups, the Spanish police <a href="https://www.policia.es/_es/comunicacion_prensa_detalle.php?ID=16572" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> on Friday.
