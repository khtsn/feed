Others saw no contradiction in both supporting Mr. Trump’s administration and embracing vaccines — a perspective many doctors welcome as they stress that public health issues should not be political.</p><p>But voters’ ability to hold both views suggests that concerns about the Trump administration’s stewardship of public health are not guaranteed to prompt electoral backlash.</p><p>“Something that Democrats need to be doing a better job at is how we can elevate issues and highlight individual stories and make it real for people,” Ms. Pettersen said.</p><p>Some Democrats argue that their efforts to sound alarm bells on public health are beginning to work, with congressional Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/medicaid-spending-republicans.html" title="">agonizing over their push</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/medicaid-republicans-budget.html" title="">cut Medicaid spending</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><h2 id="link-56404554">‘Tell your billionaire friends they can only have one yacht’</h2><p>Mallory McMorrow, a Democratic state senator in Michigan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/michigan-senate-democrats-mallory-mcmorrow.html" title="">running for U.S. Senate</a>, was at her 4-year-old’s swim class recently, talking with a fellow mom who had one child.</p><p>“I asked if she was considering having another one, and she said, ‘Not if things keep up like this,’” Ms. McMorrow said in an interview, referring to rising child-related costs. “There’s a lot of anxiety for parents.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s allies hope that parents reach different conclusions.
