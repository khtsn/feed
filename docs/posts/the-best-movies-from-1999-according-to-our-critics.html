After reading their picks, let us know your choices.</p><p>Best Comedy</p><h2 id="link-1364c9d4">‘Being John Malkovich’</h2><p>Capping a decade of high-concept comedies, Spike Jonze’s “Being John Malkovich” (available on <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/being-john-malkovich" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most major platforms</a>) raised the stakes with the most outlandish premise yet: When a downtrodden puppeteer (John Cusack) takes an office job to make ends meet, he discovers a hidden portal there that allows him to enter the mind of medium-famous character actor John Malkovich. Jonze’s smartest instinct is to resist piling onto a concept that’s already perilously clever. Instead, the movie is underplayed, intimate and even a little scuzzy-looking. But that approach to Charlie Kaufman’s surprising screenplay leaves room for viewers to wonder as they watch: Why are we so certain that our lives would improve with even a modicum of fame? And are these bodies the wrong containers for what we feel inside? KYLE BUCHANAN</p><p><em>Buchanan’s other 1999 favorites: “eXistenZ,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/three-kings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Three Kings</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/election" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Election</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-talented-mr-ripley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em></a><em>”</em></p></div></div><div><div><p>Best Drama</p><h2 id="link-36c57848">‘Beau Travail’</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Claire Denis’s film focuses on the French Foreign Legion soldiers stationed in Djibouti.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pathé TV</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>A haunting exploration of desire and violence, Claire Denis’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh4HzACZOOQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beau Travail</a>” (available on <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/beau-travail" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">major platforms</a>) takes place in the East African country of Djibouti, a onetime French territory. There, French Foreign Legion soldiers practice drills, their bodies synced and individualities subordinated. At times, they dance with African women, their gazes uneasily summoning up the history shared by the formerly colonized and their colonizers.</p><p>Loosely inspired by Herman Melville’s novella “Billy Budd,” Denis’s beguiling tour de force takes shape after one soldier (Grégoire Colin) rescues another, an act that disturbs a sergeant (Denis Lavant). The soldier “seduced everyone,” the sergeant says in voice-over. “Deep down I felt a sort of rancor, a rage brimming.” With minimal dialogue, ravishing visuals and meticulous attention to sensuous detail, Claire Denis elliptically charts what binds these men — tracing lines between love and hate, past and present, nation and self, masculinity and militarism — in a film that remains as disturbing as it is seductive. MANOHLA DARGIS</p><p><em>Dargis’s other 1999 favorites: “</em><a href="https://play.max.com/movie/66067c3f-b44c-430c-9c9a-132e3c9a64d3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>All About My Mother</em></a><em>,” “Pola X,” “</em><a href="https://www.max.com/movies/rosetta/7bb872de-da22-4724-8618-8e4e6eed855d?utm_id=1011l5873&amp;utm_source=justwatchgmbh&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;clickref=1101lzygLVp9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Rosetta</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/time-regained" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Time Regained</em></a><em>”</em></p></div></div><div><div><p>Best OVERLOOKED Comedy</p><h2 id="link-2bce061b">‘Office Space’</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jennifer Aniston and Mike Judge, the writer-director, in a cameo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">20th Century Fox</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Like several Mike Judge comedies, “Office Space” (available on <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/office-space-1999" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">major platforms</a>) was not fully appreciated when it premiered, but it has emerged as a modern classic. Years before the sitcom “The Office,” this highly quotable satire captured the soul-crushing drudgery of white-collar office life.</p><p>But while its portrait of passive-aggressive bosses and meaningless corporate jargon is timeless, the movie benefits from the era in which it was made: the first internet boom, a more innocent, less lucrative disruption. The idiocies of tech companies then seem quaint compared with the behemoths to come. The targets of the movie, including chains that coerce employees to express themselves with pieces of “flair” and middle managers whose work seems to be creating the appearance of work, reflect the benign absurdity of the moment. The plight of the pointedly bland protagonist (Ron Livingston) doesn’t seem melodramatic so much as ridiculous.</p><p>Judge could attack the culture with a sledgehammer (see “Idiocracy,” 2006), but we can laugh at “Office Space” even after seeing it scores of times because he made it with a light touch. JASON ZINOMAN</p><p><em>Zinoman’s other 1999 favorites: “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/being-john-malkovich" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Being John Malkovich</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/audition" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Audition</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-insider" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Insider</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-blair-witch-project" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Blair Witch Project</em></a><em>”</em></p></div></div><div><div><p>Best Melodrama</p><h2 id="link-1c75ff84">‘All About My Mother’</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cecilia Roth, with Marisa Paredes on the building behind her, in the Pedro Almodóvar film.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sony Pictures Classics</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Red has never looked as alluring, as empowering and as passionate as it does in “All About My Mother” (streaming on <a href="https://play.max.com/movie/66067c3f-b44c-430c-9c9a-132e3c9a64d3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Max</a>), Pedro Almodóvar’s towering melodrama. The color is boldly worn by the maternal leads at different points in this unconventional story. An organ transplant coordinator who has lost her son in an accident goes searching for the boy’s other parent, a transgender woman who doesn’t know she had a child. On paper, the characters might seem most at home in a soap opera, but Almodóvar instills each with complexity and humanity, guiding us through their inner lives with a sensitive touch. And yet, the movie still leaves room for some Bette Davis-style sass and a little Blanche DuBois excess mixed in for good measure. A milestone in the director’s eclectic career, the film is anchored by fearless performances from Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Antonia San Juan and Penélope Cruz. MEKADO MURPHY</p><p><em>Murphy’s other 1999 favorites: “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/being-john-malkovich" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Being John Malkovich</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/fight-club" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Fight Club</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-blair-witch-project" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Blair Witch Project</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/mag-noli-a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Magnolia</em></a><em>”</em></p></div></div><div><div><p>Best Animation</p><h2 id="link-5e60ce60">‘The Iron Giant’</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vin Diesel voiced the title character and Eli Marienthal played his companion, Hogarth Hughes. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Warner Bros.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“The Iron Giant” (available on <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-iron-giant" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">major platforms</a>) felt old-fashioned the day it was released. That was partly because of its story — the director Brad Bird, loosely adapting a British children’s novel for his feature film debut, set it in America at the end of the 1950s, with all of that period’s social, technological and cultural upheavals. (Whatever you do, don’t “wig out,” man.) But it was also circumstance. In the summer of 1999 — a few months before “Toy Story 2” would define the next quarter-century of American animation — a non-franchise, theatrically distributed, 2-D-animated film already seemed like a transmission from a bygone era. I was a teenager when I first received it, via a special presentation on cable TV. My younger brother and I, purportedly aging out of “cartoons,” instantly fell for Hogarth and his pet giant from outer space, who cure each other’s loneliness amid the ruthless incursions of a changing world. REGGIE UGWU</p><p><em>Ugwu’s other 1999 favorites: “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-matrix" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Matrix</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-wood" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Wood</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/magnolia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Magnolia</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/austin-powers-the-spy-who-shagged-me" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</em></a><em>”</em></p></div></div><div><div><p>Best Documentary</p><h2 id="link-6200430d">‘Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr.’</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The inventor of what he describes as more humane versions of the electric chair is the focus of this film. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nubar Alexanian/Lions Gate Films</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The best documentaries of 1999 often coaxed viewers to learn from history, lest it repeat itself. But among them, Errol Morris’s “<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/122999death-film-review.html" title="">Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr.</a>” (streaming on <a href="https://www.amcplus.com/movies/mr-death--1053562" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AMC+</a>) stands as the most chillingly relevant 25 years later. Morris first introduces us to Leuchter as he sees himself: a humanitarian who believes in capital punishment but wants to make it painless, and has spent his career inventing more humane versions of devices like the electric chair. But the film takes a sharp left turn when Leuchter’s views as a Holocaust denier come into view. He’s certain he’s right, even in the face of reams of evidence and his own inexperience with the subject. It’s a portrait of self-delusion, of refusing to acknowledge facts as anything more than someone’s opinion — and Morris, in typical fashion, simply gives him enough rope to hang himself. ALISSA WILKINSON</p><p><em>Wilkinson’s other 1999 favorites: “</em><a href="https://www.max.com/movies/buena-vista-social-club/705dcc71-8ebb-4566-8f1b-d6c51747d8d2?utm_id=1011l5873&amp;utm_source=justwatchgmbh&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;clickref=1100lyLzDtJv" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Buena Vista Social Club</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/south-1999" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Sud</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/american-movie" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>American Movie</em></a><em>,” “On the Ropes”</em></p></div></div><div><div><p>Best Rom-Com</p><h2 id="link-5f1d9cec">‘Notting Hill’</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Julia Roberts is a Hollywood star who meets cute with Hugh Grant, a bookstore owner.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Universal Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>1999 was a terrific year for rom-coms (“10 Things I Hate About You,” “You’ve Got Mail,” “She’s All That”), but it was an even better year for Julia Roberts rom-coms. This was the tail end of her America’s sweetheart era, and you can see her smile (and chemistry with Richard Gere) light up “Runaway Bride.” In the superior “Notting Hill” (available on <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/notting-hill" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">major platforms</a>), in which she plays a version of her Hollywood-star self, that smile draws Hugh Grant’s bookstore owner and his kooky friends the way the sun draws sunflowers. But it can’t quite cover up her character’s sadness or concerns as work and a previous relationship intervene, and the sense that grown-ups are talking here is one of the strengths of the film. Thankfully, the director Roger Michell tamped down the too-cute excesses that the screenwriter Richard Curtis (“Love, Actually”) can be prone to. The result is an all-too-rare sighting: the intelligent rom-com. STEPHANIE GOODMAN</p><p><em>Goodman’s</em> <em>other 1999 favorites</em>: <em>“</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-limey" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Limey</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/being-john-malkovich" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Being John Malkovich</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/office-space-1999" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Office Space</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/bowfinger" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bowfinger</em></a><em>”</em></p></div></div><div><div><p>Best Horror</p><h2 id="link-22245632">‘Audition’</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eihi Shiina is a young woman who turns the tables on a lonely widower.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">American Cinematheque</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Takashi Miike’s films range from children’s movies to hyperviolent splatter films, musicals and niche videogame adaptations. His disparate topical and thematic interests are embodied in “Audition” (available on <a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/551307/audition" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tubi</a>, <a href="https://www.kanopy.com/en/product/audition-0?frontend=kui" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kanopy</a> or <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/audition/umc.cmc.3cnul5mvprj7bdg5epkumxixk?playableId=tvs.sbd.9001%3A1097351799" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AppleTV+</a>). The film begins as a solemn romantic drama, depicting a grieving widower who becomes infatuated with a young woman he’s met via the pretense that he’s auditioning her for a melodrama. Their tender courtship is undermined by glimpses of the woman’s alarming past: sexual abuse, decapitation and dismemberment, and the burlap sack in her apartment that seems to contain something alive. This culminates in a spectacularly demented conclusion, a stark, forceful inversion of the power imbalance that once characterized this ill-fated romance. The widower, seen in close-up and in agony, hopelessly gazes up at the young woman, now sitting astride his limp body. “Words create lies,” she says. “Pain can be trusted.” RUMSEY TAYLOR</p><p><em>Taylor’s other 1999 favorites: “American Hollow,” “</em><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/beau-travail" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Beau Travail</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://www.amcplus.com/movies/mr-death--1053562" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A.
