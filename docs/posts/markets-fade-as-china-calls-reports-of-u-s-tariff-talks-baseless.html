    <h1>Markets Fade as China Calls Reports of U.S. Tariff Talks ‘Baseless’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Markets slipped on Thursday, reversing some of the gains from a heady two-day rally, after officials in China said they were not holding talks with the United States about easing trade tensions between the superpowers.</p><p>Stocks in Asia were mixed, while benchmarks in Europe turned mostly lower in early trading. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 fell about half a percent, suggesting that stocks would open lower in New York. The index has seesawed this week as investors reacted to comments about trade from President Trump, with a sharp sell-off on Monday followed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/trump-tariff-stocks.html" title="">two days of sizable gains</a>.</p><p>“There are currently no economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States,” He Yadong, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce, said on Thursday. “Any claims about progress in China-U.S. economic and trade negotiations are baseless rumors without factual evidence.”</p><p>A spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Guo Jiakun, reiterated China’s stance, which is that the tariff war was started by the United States and that China would only engage in talks under certain conditions. “China’s attitude is consistent and clear: If you want to fight, we will fight to the end; if you want to talk, the door is open,” he said.</p></div></div>
