But Mr. Musk, through SpaceX, has long held a big lead in the pursuit closest to their hearts: colonizing space.</p><p>Now, their space race is entering a new era as Mr. Bezos approaches two milestones that, if successful, could chip away at Mr. Musk’s dominance.</p><p>Mr. Bezos’ rocket company, Blue Origin, is planning to soon launch New Glenn, a massive rocket that will compete directly with SpaceX’s reusable Falcon 9 rockets. Then Amazon — founded by Mr. Bezos, who serves as its board’s executive chair — is preparing to deploy Project Kuiper, the company’s network of satellites that will challenge SpaceX’s Starlink network in providing internet access from space in low Earth orbit.</p><p>Together, New Glenn and Project Kuiper are perhaps the most ambitious attempt in years to take on SpaceX’s tight grip on the commercial space market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The new rocket and satellites also represent a new chapter in the longtime rivalry between the billionaires behind Amazon and Tesla. Amazon has become one of the most recognizable retail brands in the world as Tesla has dominated the market for electric cars. But Mr. Musk has been far more successful in space.</p><p>SpaceX has reshaped how rockets are built and launched since Mr. Musk started it about two decades ago. Its reusable rocket boosters have reduced the cost and increased the frequency that payloads can be shot into orbit. For transporting things like satellites as well as cargo and crew headed to space stations, governments and other customers at times have few other options.</p><p>With launches every few days, SpaceX carried <a href="https://brycetech.com/briefing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 85 percent</a> of all orbital mass put into space in the most recent quarter — 12 times as much as the next-largest launcher, China’s primary government contractor. SpaceX has completed more than 130 launches this year and is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/science/spacex-launch-starship.html" title="">testing an even bigger rocket</a>, named Starship.</p><p>SpaceX’s Starlink network has more than <a href="https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/table.php?GROUP=starlink&amp;FORMAT=tle" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">6,000 satellites</a> positioned above the globe. It serves more than <a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1850224181910061348" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four million customers</a> and has become a critical provider of internet to off-the-grid places as varied as battlefields in Ukraine and recreational vehicles in rural Virginia.</p><p>Mr. Bezos also founded his space company around two decades ago, but it has not yet launched a single thing into orbit. Though it has ferried small groups of celebrities and wealthy passengers on brief trips to the edge of space, Blue Origin has had limited commercial effect so far.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The only reason we are taking Blue Origin more seriously is because Bezos is bankrolling it,” said Chad Anderson, a start-up investor at Space Capital. “They have spent a ridiculous amount of money.” By his estimate, that’s $14 billion.</p><p>Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket is enormous, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/science/bezos-blue-origin-rocket.html" title="">as tall as a 32-story building</a>, and designed to repeatedly haul satellites and other cargo into space. With a reusable booster, New Glenn is now standing at Blue Origin’s launch site at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and is <a href="https://x.com/Free_Space/status/1867222522690953240" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected</a> to fly in the next few weeks.</p><p>“It’s literally on the pad now waiting for regulatory approval,” Mr. Bezos said this month at the DealBook Summit, an annual gathering of leaders in business, politics and culture hosted by The New York Times.</p><p>Project Kuiper was supposed to begin launching its constellation of 3,232 satellites before the end of this year, but it was bumped from the schedule of its rocket provider, United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, in favor of government missions. The launch is now delayed to “early 2025,” according to Amazon. (Project Kuiper did successfully <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/06/science/amazon-project-kuiper-launch.html" title="">test two satellites in orbit</a> this year.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>United Launch Alliance, a rocket provider, is expected to begin launching Amazon’s Project Kuiper satellite network next year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">United Launch Alliance, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Amazon declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Bezos grew up inspired by NASA’s Apollo missions, and he has talked about moving humanity to space since at least high school.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I would love to see a trillion humans living in the solar system,” he said on a podcast last year. “The only way to get to that vision is with giant space stations.” People would visit Earth the “same way that you might go to Yellowstone National Park for vacation,” he said.</p><p>The “primary reason” he stepped down as chief executive at Amazon, he said, was to focus on Blue Origin and add urgency and speed to its operations.</p><p>Mr. Bezos put on a flight suit and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/science/blue-origin-bezos-space.html" title="">joined the crew</a> on Blue Origin’s first suborbital passenger flight in 2021. Last year, he moved to Miami, in part, he said, to be closer to Cape Canaveral.</p><p>“This is very personal,” said Margaret O’Mara, a tech industry historian at the University of Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The company has increasingly focused on building the ability to manufacture rockets at scale. At the DealBook event, Mr. Bezos said he thought that Blue Origin had the potential to be a larger business than Amazon.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People visited a Project Kuiper display at Amazon’s booth at the Consumer Electronics Show last year in Las Vegas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patrick T.

They began secretly working on what would become Project Kuiper. They designed it from the ground up and created a system that required fewer, but potentially more complicated, satellites.</p><p>When Amazon said the next year that it was pursuing a satellite network, Mr. Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1115764921482919937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1115764921482919937%7Ctwgr%5Efdea66b6547bfa96d496a5d711607998f7a39c6d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fscience%2Felon-musk-calls-jeff-bezos-a-copycat-on-twitter%2F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a>: “.@JeffBezos copy 🐈”</p><p>Analysts estimate that Amazon has spent more than $16 billion on Project Kuiper. This year, the company opened a facility to manufacture the satellites in Kirkland, Wash., a Seattle suburb about a 15-minute drive from Starlink’s manufacturing hub.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Though there are other smaller competitors to Starlink, Amazon has the potential to attract real business, said Carissa Christensen, chief executive of BryceTech, a space analytics and engineering firm. “It has enterprise and industrial relationships, and it also has consumer relationships at an extraordinary scale,” she said.</p><p>Amazon still needs thousands of satellites to provide the coverage it envisions, but it is dependent on outside rocket companies for launches, a challenge since SpaceX dominates the market.</p><p>For the sake of Project Kuiper, New Glenn needs to work. While the two are separate, their fates are intertwined. Last year, Mr. Bezos hired a former senior Amazon executive who oversaw Project Kuiper to run Blue Origin. And Project Kuiper is depending on New Glenn for <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-makes-historic-launch-investment-to-advance-project-kuiper" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many of its launches</a>. Another leading provider is a new United Launch Alliance rocket that uses Blue Origin engines.</p><p>But even Amazon couldn’t avoid asking SpaceX for help in getting the Project Kuiper satellites into space. Last December, it <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-project-kuiper-spacex-launch" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contracted</a> with SpaceX for three launches, which would start in “mid-2025,” Amazon said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk gave a tour of a control room to President-elect Donald J.

SpaceX <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/science/spacex-launch.html" title="">began launching</a> the Starlink satellites in 2018, eventually almost weekly, to blanket the skies. As part of SpaceX, Starlink didn’t need outside rocket companies to send the satellites into space and instead could rely on the company’s workhorse rockets.</p><p>“SpaceX just started churning and burning,” said Chris Quilty, an analyst who has covered the space industry for decades. “This is the single biggest advantage, not only in cost but just in volume.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Even some of Mr. Musk’s supporters hope Mr. Bezos will make headway. “SpaceX needs some competition,” said Mr. Anderson, the venture capitalist. He said Mr. Musk not only had the best, and often only, viable solutions to various space needs but, as a close adviser to President-elect Donald J. Trump, was also in an enviable position to influence Mr. Trump’s agenda.</p><p>As an investor in SpaceX, Mr. Anderson can profit from the company’s success, but, he said, “I don’t like to see any single point of failure, especially with infrastructure, that is that critical to economic stability and national security.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karen Weise writes about technology and is based in Seattle.
