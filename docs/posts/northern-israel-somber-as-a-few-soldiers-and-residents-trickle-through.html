    <h1>Northern Israel Somber as a Few Soldiers and Residents Trickle Through</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While Israeli troops remain in Lebanon, the military has begun withdrawing some forces. Along a road leading to the border, several mud-covered tanks returned from the battlefield, surrounded by soldiers in military jackets who said they were both exhausted and relieved.</p><p>In Kiryat Shmona, Israel’s northernmost city, shops were still shuttered and streets were mostly empty. Yet a few more civilian cars were<span>  </span>moving along its main road as a small trickle of residents seized the opportunity for visits considered too risky before Wednesday.</p><p>The clearest sign of the new reality was the quiet. There were no sirens warning of incoming rockets from Lebanon or the deafening blasts of Israeli artillery fire that had shaken the city day and night.</p><p>“I brought my 87-year-old mother to visit my father’s grave for the first time since the funeral,” said Lior Bez, 51, a member of Metula’s emergency squad. The town remained closed to visitors. Three soldiers manning the gate allowed entry only to residents, turning away others who braved the rain aiming to see the marks of war.</p><p>Residents were conflicted about the deal. While they said they looked forward to returning home, they remained skeptical that the agreement would ensure their safety. Some, however, were already preparing for more peaceful days.</p><p>Mr. Bez, who owns several getaway cabins damaged in a Hezbollah strike, was busy repairing them.</p><p>Some soldiers who fought in Lebanon took advantage of the calm to relax in a natural hot spring in the Golan Heights.</p><p>“Yesterday we were still engaged in intense military missions around the border,” said one, David Abokasis, “but now we can blow off some steam.”</p></div></div>
