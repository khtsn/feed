A Brooklyn sergeant arrested Mr. Forrester on Nov. 24, 2021, after he had found probable cause that he <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/04/08/maddrey-forrester-brownsville-gun-ebro-hot-97-interview/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had menaced the boys with a gun</a>.</p><p>In May 2023, Keechant Sewell, the police commissioner at the time, agreed with the board, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/nyregion/nypd-police-commissioner-sewell-maddrey.html" title="">the Civilian Complaint Review Board</a>, that Chief Maddrey had “improperly influenced an arrest.” At the time, she told the chief’s lawyer that she would impose the board’s recommendation to take away the vacation days.</p><p>But on Monday, Commissioner Caban stamped “approved” on the findings of the Police Department’s deputy commissioner of trials,<strong> </strong>Rosemarie Maldonado, who concluded in July that the board “lacks jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute the case,” according to a copy of the document.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Maldonado issued her recommendation two weeks before a public three-day disciplinary trial had been scheduled to start at Police Headquarters. The trial, which would have been overseen by the department, would have forced Chief Maddrey, an ally of Mayor Eric Adams, to take the stand to justify his actions. The department’s internal affairs unit has determined that he did not abuse his authority.</p><p>In a statement, the police confirmed that Commissioner Caban had approved the recommendation of the deputy commissioner of trials.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Cramer is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and crime in the city and surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-cramer">More about Maria Cramer</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Hidden Beneath the Surface: </strong>It’s hard to see through New York’s murky green waters, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/nyregion/diving-into-new-yorks-murky-green-waters-searching-for-treasure.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">but divers are plunging in</a> to search for shipwrecks and aquatic creatures.</p></li><li><p><strong>WCBS Radio to Go Quiet: </strong>The all-news radio station was the soundtrack of countless cab rides in New York City for nearly 60 years.
