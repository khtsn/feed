A Brooklyn sergeant arrested Mr. Forrester on Nov. 24, 2021, after he had found probable cause that Mr. Forrester <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/04/08/maddrey-forrester-brownsville-gun-ebro-hot-97-interview/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had menaced the boys with a gun</a>.</p><p>In May 2023, Keechant Sewell, the police commissioner at the time, agreed with the oversight panel, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/nyregion/nypd-police-commissioner-sewell-maddrey.html" title="">the Civilian Complaint Review Board</a>, that Chief Maddrey had “improperly influenced an arrest.” At the time, her office informed the chief that she had agreed to impose the board’s recommendation to take away the vacation days.</p><p>But on Monday, Commissioner Caban stamped “approved” on the findings of the Police Department’s deputy commissioner of trials,<strong> </strong>Rosemarie Maldonado, who concluded in July that the board “lacks jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute the case,” according to a copy of the document.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Maldonado issued her recommendation two weeks before a public three-day disciplinary trial had been scheduled to start at Police Headquarters. The trial, which would have been overseen by the department, would have forced Chief Maddrey, an ally of Mayor Eric Adams, to take the stand to justify his actions. The department’s internal affairs unit has determined that he did not abuse his authority.</p><p>In a statement, the police confirmed that Commissioner Caban had approved the recommendation of the deputy commissioner of trials.</p><p>Lambros Lambrou, Chief Maddrey’s lawyer, said they were both “very happy” that the commissioner had approved Ms. Maldonado’s “well-reasoned and well-thought-out” recommendation.</p><p>“We’re looking forward to putting all this behind us and letting Chief Maddrey do what he does best which is fight crime in New York, not frivolous allegations,” Mr. Lambrou said.</p><p>M.K. Kaishian, a lawyer for the boys who are suing Mr. Forrester, said Tuesday that Commissioner Caban’s decision showed that “the system works overtime to protect powerful people.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The boys have tried to move on despite the “constant fear” they have felt since November 2021, she said.</p><p>“Though these young people and their families would like to see Mr. Maddrey receive an institutional consequence, they are focused on putting their energy, hope and efforts into the people and systems that truly serve and protect everyone,” Ms. Kaishian said in a statement.</p><p>The reversal was another example of the Police Department stopping disciplinary charges before they could be aired before the public.</p><p>Since Mr. Adams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/nyregion/edward-caban-latino-police-commissioner-ny.html" title="">appointed him last July</a>, Commissioner Caban has stopped the cases of 54 officers from going to trial — far more than any other commissioner, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/nyregion/how-the-nypd-quietly-shuts-down-discipline-cases-against-officers.html" title="">according to an analysis of data from the oversight board by ProPublica that was published by The New York Times in June</a>.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Commissioner Edward Caban has stopped the cases of 54 officers from going to trial, more than any other commissioner. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>ProPublica’s findings <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/nypd-police-brutality-edward-caban-city-council-nyc-lawsuit" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">led several city officials to call for changes</a> to the commissioner’s ability to “retain” cases that had been headed for trial.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In the case of Chief Maddrey, Commissioner Caban did not use his power to retain the case, because Ms. Maldonado had already recommended that the charges should not proceed. But Mr. Caban <a href="https://x.com/NYPDnews/status/1808287484964421930/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has defended</a> his use of that tool, saying that “most of the time” he agrees with the oversight board’s recommendations, and that he has had to adjudicate many cases since he took over as commissioner.</p><p>“It is only logical that the number of cases I retain would increase as well,” he wrote in a statement posted on the department’s account on X.</p><p>This week, Commissioner Caban did not say why he approved Ms. Maldonado’s 14-page decision, which concurred with Chief Maddrey’s plea to have the charges dismissed.</p><p>Mr. Lambrou, Chief Maddrey’s lawyer, wrote in a June 26 motion that the board was authorized to decide on cases only where members of the public interact with police officers, not on internal matters.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The chief’s actions, Mr. Lambrou wrote, had not harmed the public.</p><p>In its response to the motion, the board said that the boys were members of the public and that the New York City Charter stated in “plain language” that the oversight panel had the authority to investigate abuse-of-authority complaints.</p><p>One boy’s mother had filed a complaint, asking for an investigation into the chief’s actions, wrote Theresa Freitas, a lawyer with the board’s Administrative Prosecution Unit.</p><p>When Chief Maddrey told the sergeant to vacate the arrest, he was acting “based solely on his prior personal and professional relationship with Mr. Forrester,” she wrote.</p><p>The chief used “his position and authority to prevent the boys’ complaints from moving forward in a just and impartial manner, something that every civilian has a right to expect,” Ms. Freitas wrote.</p><p>Ms. Maldonado did not comment on Chief Maddrey’s actions in her ruling. Instead, she focused on the board’s decision to pursue a case that she determined was beyond its scope, saying that the vacated arrest was for internal affairs or “another N.Y.P.D. oversight entity” to address.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Maldonado did say that she agreed with Ms. Freitas “that the public is entitled to a Police Department that provides an unbiased assessment of all criminal complaints.”</p><p>It’s not clear if that will ever happen in this case now.</p><p>About 9:30 p.m. on Nov. 24, 2021, the three boys were walking down the street in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn when one of them threw a basketball at the security camera of a building, according to the board’s findings.</p><p>They then ran away and Mr. Forrester, whose family owned the building, came out and began following the boys, who were 12, 13 and 14 at the time. During the chase, one of the boys called 911 to report that someone with a gun was coming after them. One of the boys said he thought he heard the gun go off.</p><p>Mr. Forrester acknowledged to the police that he had a gun but said he never took it out. The boys were able to describe the weapon accurately, and the sergeant concluded that there was probable cause to charge Mr. Forrester with menacing — putting another person in fear of immediate physical injury.</p><p>The Brooklyn district attorney’s office declined to prosecute Mr. Forrester and said it had found “no criminality” after reviewing video footage from police body cameras and surveillance cameras on the street that did not show Mr. Forrester brandishing a weapon while he was chasing the boys.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But the board investigated and found that Chief Maddrey had no reason to interfere in a case where a sergeant had found probable cause to make an arrest.</p><p>Mr. Lambrou argued that the board was trying to prosecute Chief Maddrey for “keeping an innocent man, Mr. Forrester, out of jail.”</p><p>He described the three boys as “prevaricating teenagers who lied to cover up their own criminal behavior in willfully destroying property.”</p><p>“Those lies were wholly believed by an inexperienced sergeant, who did a subpar investigation and rushed to arrest an innocent man, while an experienced supervisor like Maddrey saw right through the lies,” Mr. Lambrou wrote.</p><p>The boys were never charged with a crime.</p><p>Ms. Kaishian, their lawyer, said it was “unfortunate that the chief and his advocates have gratuitously chosen to vilify child victims of violence and denigrate honest N.Y.P.D. members.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Cramer is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and crime in the city and surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-cramer">More about Maria Cramer</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/civilian-complaint-review-board">Civilian Complaint Review Board</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/new-york-city-police-department">New York City Police Department [NYPD]</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Hidden Beneath the Surface: </strong>It’s hard to see through New York’s murky green waters, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/nyregion/diving-into-new-yorks-murky-green-waters-searching-for-treasure.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">but divers are plunging in</a> to search for shipwrecks and aquatic creatures.</p></li><li><p><strong>WCBS Radio to Go Quiet: </strong>The all-news radio station was the soundtrack of countless cab rides in New York City for nearly 60 years.
