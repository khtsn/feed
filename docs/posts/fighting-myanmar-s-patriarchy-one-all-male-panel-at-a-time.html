To her, this exclusion of women is evidence of the deeply ingrained sexism in the country, formerly known as Burma.

But she has faced a backlash for her public evisceration of manels and her demand that at least 30 percent of every panel be female. Some critics have implied that attacking opposition figures makes her complicit with the military.</p><p>A few manelists, or members of all-male panels, have vowed to change. Not all of them have made good on that promise.</p><p>With the exception of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s former civilian leader, the country’s politics have been dominated by men. She was the only female member of her administration, which came to power during a brief period of civilian rule before the generals again <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/myanmar-news-protests-coup.html" title="">seized power in February 2021</a>. The coup also brought back the patriarchal order the conservative military had imposed for decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>One aspect of that order is the tradition of hpoun, a belief that asserts that men possess greater spiritual power than women. It often keeps women from rising in society.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Wat Sai Moon, a Burmese-style Buddhist temple in Chiang Mai’s old town.

They have marched in peaceful protests. They strung up their sarongs over streets as shields because many men fear that walking under them will sap their virility. Women have rejected cultural norms by picking up weapons against the military. And they have suffered sexual violence perpetrated by the military for decades.</p><p>Not all segments of Burmese society see women as inferior to men. The shadow government, the pro-democracy movement’s alternative to the junta, has promised gender equality in its charter. But women make up only one-fifth of its cabinet. And on the panel circuit, they are still left out in favor of male politicians, journalists, activists and civil society leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Some of them would tell you they are feminists,” Ms. Ying Lao said.</p><p>She realized how manels proliferated during the pandemic, when people hopped online to discuss Myanmar’s 2020 election, the results of which were rejected by the generals.

He got upset about being among dozens of men featured on a Manels Watch poster. An angry Facebook post he wrote against the group then unleashed a flood of misogynist comments by his followers. He later said that he felt sorry about the incident.</p><p>As the country has sunk deeper into civil war, rights activists fear the militarization of society could further exclude women from public discourse.</p><p>Lin Htet Aung, a former military captain who defected after the coup, was identified as a manelist by Manels Watch and has threatened to sue the campaign.</p><p>“There are topics specifically related to men, and that’s why we sometimes see manels,” he said. Referring to Manels Watch, he added, “They tarnish our image in front of the world.”</p><p>For International Women’s Day in March 2023, Ms. Ying Lao arranged an exhibition in Chiang Mai. Its tagline declared: “A manel a day keeps democracy away.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Ying Lao and a handful of women displayed photos of manels at an exhibition in Chiang Mai.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren DeCicca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The detail of a poster that was displayed at an exhibition at the 4th Asia Pacific Feminist Forum in Chiang Mai.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren DeCicca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Visitors gazed at screenshots and pictures of hundreds of manelists staring at them from posters.
