It was originally called the OFWGKTA Carnival — named for the full name of Tyler, The Creator’s group at the time, Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All — and was held in the parking lot of the Novo (formerly Club Nokia) before evolving into the current spectacle of Camp Flog Gnaw.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A group of people walk up a road with a sign behind them that says &#34;Downtown Exit All Freeways.&#34;" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d298d75d-cc42-5497-950c-90e373559a3e" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The styles varied greatly among attendees at the event, which was held at Dodger Stadium.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-2"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Getting your look just right for an event in which fashion played nearly as large a role as music.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Tickets for this year’s event, which started at $372 for a two-day pass, sold out within hours. But securing admission was just the first hurdle, with the second being what the attendees should wear. Many went with selections from Tyler, The Creator’s Golf Wang-branded clothing, with plenty of people wearing oversized pants, fuzzy hats and business casual attire in a nod to “Chromakopia,” the artist’s new album, which was released last month.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-73d5b825">Lex Cuttino</h2><p>Dispensary Manager, 26</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-4"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>What inspired your look today?</strong></p><p>You know, everything about Tyler is just colorful. So I decided to do something in that nature.</p><p><strong>What made you want to pair a onesie underneath?</strong></p><p>It’s a lingerie set that has garnets on it and everything. I just wanted something comfortable because I wanted to wear my pants open. So I needed like a onesie or something underneath.</p><p><strong>What’s tied this entire look together for you?</strong></p><p>Probably my shoes. They’re a little dirty, but they’re Converse. Also my teeth gems. In Desert Hot Springs I have a girl that does them and I just asked her to slap them on because at night time they just glisten. They’re like a glow stick.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-61e00c18">Taji Flowers</h2><p>College Student, 19</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>What inspired your look today?</strong></p><p>So I got Skims on, which I’m addicted to and Sambas. I was just going for chill, comfy, cute.</p><p><strong>Tell me about your hat.</strong></p><p>This is actually my friend’s hat. He let me borrow it so I’m taking care of it and it has his initials on the side. I like the hat because this is actually my first time in L.A. I’m from Detroit so I was just searching up how people in L.A. dress before coming out here.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-ebe4702">Sin Hua and Myra Hua with their children</h2><p>Body Piercer, 40, and Tooth Gem Business Owner, 40</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>What inspired the mask today?</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Hua:</strong> I’m here to chew up rap snitches.</p><p><strong>Ms. Hua: </strong>They’re doing a tribute for MF Doom today.</p><p><strong>Tell me about your teeth.</strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Hua: </strong>I do tooth gems, the process is really quick and painless.

I try to shop for small businesses and promote them. I also just really love fashion. I majored in fashion in school, so I just threw all of this together because I thought it was cute.</p><p><strong>What’s the most prized possession of your look?</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Garrett: </strong>Honestly the shirt I have underneath this sweatshirt. There’s a lot going on with it.</p><p><strong>Ms. Eggleston: </strong>Mine is my bag because I forgot my purse and I had to innovate with a bag that matched my outfit. It’s Crown Royal.</p><p><strong>Mr. Garrett:</strong> She’s a little more creative than me.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-7cde4f95">Tiffany Reglos and Erika Palmares</h2><p>Owns Aesthetician Business, 23, and Medical Assistant, 23</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>How did your outfit come together?</strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Reglos: </strong>I was going for more street style. I thrifted most of my stuff. I got thrifted pants and a thrifted belt. The shirt was actually bought from a small business. I like to support small businesses and I just wanted to go more hip-hop.</p><p><strong>Ms. Palmares:</strong> I thrifted these boots and I got these fur leg warmers on Amazon. The weather is kind of everywhere today and I can just take off the puffer jacket and put it on later.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-12916565">Isaac Ramirez and Dailene Gonzalez</h2><p>In-N-Out Employee, 19, and Panera Bread Employee, 19</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-14"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>Tell me about your jewelry.</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Ramirez: </strong>So the jewelry we got going on right here is from Hard Jewelry.

And then the rings she got me one when we first got together, it’s silver.</p><p><strong>Tell me about your outfit.</strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Gonzalez: </strong>Well I also have some Hard Jewelry. The leather jacket was thrifted. Most of my outfit is thrifted, like the belt is from the Goodwill bins in L.A. and then I have fishnets from a random Walmart. And then Converse are, of course, for Tyler.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-9ac6f2c">Phoenix Hodges and Mikayla Hodges</h2><p>College Student/Musician, 22, and High School Student, 16</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>Where did you start when coming up with this outfit?</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Hodges:</strong> I was just trying to color coordinate. I started with the shoes, and I basically built off around that. I like preppy style especially being in college and all.</p><p><strong>Ms. Hodges: </strong>I love scrolling on Pinterest.

Yesterday I also came in kind of business casual. I feel like that’s the energy for the weekend. So I tried to do the best I could in a different style. Most of this is thrifted and a bit from Amazon. This business set is from Misguided and the shoes are Converse All-Stars.</p><p><strong>Ms. Gonzalez: </strong>Honestly, mostly the coloring of it, the brown with the blues. It gave off some of Tyler’s old albums. So I went off with that, and then the pants just matched.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-18f42329">Tristan Wolf</h2><p>High School Student, 15</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p><strong>Tell me about your look.</strong></p><p>Today, I went over to my friend’s house, and I had just some jeans and a sweatshirt, so I just took that off, and I just put a tank top under for the Playboi Cardi mosh pit today.</p><p><strong>You brought white shoes to a mosh pit?</strong></p><p>They’re just like beaters so it’s OK.
