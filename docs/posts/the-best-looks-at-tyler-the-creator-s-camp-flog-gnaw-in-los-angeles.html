It was originally called the OFWGKTA Carnival — named for the full name of Tyler, The Creator’s group at the time, Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All — and was held in the parking lot of the Novo (formerly Club Nokia) before evolving into the current spectacle of Camp Flog Gnaw.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A group of people walk up a road with a sign behind them that says &#34;Downtown Exit All Freeways.&#34;" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf/18FLOG-GNAW-STYLE-02-chvf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d298d75d-cc42-5497-950c-90e373559a3e" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The styles varied greatly among attendees at the event, which was held at Dodger Stadium.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-2"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Getting your look just right for an event in which fashion played nearly as large a role as music.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Tickets for this year’s event, which started at $372 for a two-day pass, sold out within hours. But securing admission was just the first hurdle, with the second being what the attendees should wear. Many went with selections from Tyler, The Creator’s Golf Wang-branded clothing, with plenty of people wearing oversized pants, fuzzy hats and business casual attire in a nod to “Chromakopia,” the artist’s new album, which was released last month.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-73d5b825">Lex Cuttino</h2><p>Dispensary Manager, 26</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>What inspired your look today?</strong></p><p>You know, everything about Tyler is just colorful. So I decided to do something in that nature.</p><p><strong>What made you want to pair a onesie underneath?</strong></p><p>It’s a lingerie set that has garnets on it and everything. I just wanted something comfortable because I wanted to wear my pants open. So I needed like a onesie or something underneath.</p><p><strong>What’s tied this entire look together for you?</strong></p><p>Probably my shoes. They’re a little dirty, but they’re Converse. Also my teeth gems. In Desert Hot Springs I have a girl that does them and I just asked her to slap them on because at night time they just glisten. They’re like a glow stick.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-61e00c18">Taji Flowers</h2><p>College Student, 19</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>What inspired your look today?</strong></p><p>So I got Skims on, which I’m addicted to and Sambas. I was just going for chill, comfy, cute.</p><p><strong>Tell me about your hat.</strong></p><p>This is actually my friend’s hat. He let me borrow it so I’m taking care of it and it has his initials on the side. I like the hat because this is actually my first time in L.A. I’m from Detroit so I was just searching up how people in L.A. dress before coming out here.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-ebe4702">Sin Hua and Myra Hua with their children</h2><p>Body Piercer, 40, and Tooth Gem Business Owner, 40</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>What inspired the mask today?</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Hua:</strong> I’m here to chew up rap snitches.</p><p><strong>Ms. Hua: </strong>They’re doing a tribute for MF Doom today.</p><p><strong>Tell me about your teeth.</strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Hua: </strong>I do tooth gems, the process is really quick and painless. It stays on, I think, better than grills.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-1fe4aea6">Isaiah Garrett and Destiny Eggleston</h2><p>Audio Engineer, 22, and Retail Analyst, 22</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Where did you get most of your pieces from?</strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Eggleston:</strong> Mostly online, like Instagram shops. I try to shop for small businesses and promote them. I also just really love fashion. I majored in fashion in school, so I just threw all of this together because I thought it was cute.</p><p><strong>What’s the most prized possession of your look?</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Garrett: </strong>Honestly the shirt I have underneath this sweatshirt. There’s a lot going on with it.</p><p><strong>Ms. Eggleston: </strong>Mine is my bag because I forgot my purse and I had to innovate with a bag that matched my outfit. It’s Crown Royal.</p><p><strong>Mr. Garrett:</strong> She’s a little more creative than me.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-7cde4f95">Tiffany Reglos and Erika Palmares</h2><p>Owns Aesthetician Business, 23, and Medical Assistant, 23</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>How did your outfit come together?</strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Reglos: </strong>I was going for more street style. I thrifted most of my stuff. I got thrifted pants and a thrifted belt. The shirt was actually bought from a small business. I like to support small businesses and I just wanted to go more hip-hop.</p><p><strong>Ms. Palmares:</strong> I thrifted these boots and I got these fur leg warmers on Amazon. The weather is kind of everywhere today and I can just take off the puffer jacket and put it on later.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-12916565">Isaac Ramirez and Dailene Gonzalez</h2><p>In-N-Out Employee, 19, and Panera Bread Employee, 19</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>Tell me about your jewelry.</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Ramirez: </strong>So the jewelry we got going on right here is from Hard Jewelry. And I got this chain from the pop up shop and then this leather piece is from my dad. And then the rings she got me one when we first got together, it’s silver.</p><p><strong>Tell me about your outfit.</strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Gonzalez: </strong>Well I also have some Hard Jewelry. The leather jacket was thrifted. Most of my outfit is thrifted, like the belt is from the Goodwill bins in L.A. and then I have fishnets from a random Walmart. And then Converse are, of course, for Tyler.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-9ac6f2c">Phoenix Hodges and Mikayla Hodges</h2><p>College Student/Musician, 22, and High School Student, 16</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>Where did you start when coming up with this outfit?</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Hodges:</strong> I was just trying to color coordinate. I started with the shoes, and I basically built off around that. I like preppy style especially being in college and all.</p><p><strong>Ms. Hodges: </strong>I love scrolling on Pinterest. So my whole outfit is mainly based off of that, with ballet flats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-4de03bbe">Leo Huerta and Annaahy Romero</h2><p>Caregiver, 23, and Assistant Manager at Dispensary, 23</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p><strong>Where did you get all these pieces from?</strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Romero: </strong>I got my Vans for some comfort with my fluffy socks. The skirt is from Shein and the top is from the Alameda swap meet. The hat I made from little cuffs and I cut it up to make it into a hat.</p><p><strong>Tell me about your nails.</strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Romero:</strong> I did them myself about four days ago. I really wanted to go with something that was close to my heritage, and next month is the Virgen De Guadalupe’s day and I want to be ready.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-2c35cc9">Camila Gallardo and Io Gonzalez</h2><p>Works at Nonprofit, 24, and Bartender, 24</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p><strong>What inspired your look?</strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Gallardo:</strong> I’m here to handle business — it’s “Chromakopia” time. Yesterday I also came in kind of business casual. I feel like that’s the energy for the weekend. So I tried to do the best I could in a different style. Most of this is thrifted and a bit from Amazon. This business set is from Misguided and the shoes are Converse All-Stars.</p><p><strong>Ms. Gonzalez: </strong>Honestly, mostly the coloring of it, the brown with the blues. It gave off some of Tyler’s old albums. So I went off with that, and then the pants just matched.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-18f42329">Tristan Wolf</h2><p>High School Student, 15</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p><strong>Tell me about your look.</strong></p><p>Today, I went over to my friend’s house, and I had just some jeans and a sweatshirt, so I just took that off, and I just put a tank top under for the Playboi Cardi mosh pit today.</p><p><strong>You brought white shoes to a mosh pit?</strong></p><p>They’re just like beaters so it’s OK. I’m also going to be in my white tank later because it’s going to get really sweaty in the crowd later.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-87745e3">Jacob Ricci</h2><p>Nordstrom Employee, 21</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p><strong>Tell me about your outfit.</strong></p><p>The shirt is from Nordstrom, the pants are from Nordstrom and the shoes are from Nordstrom. The jewelry though is from a bunch of places. The pins are from Amazon low key. The nails are from Four Seasons Nail Salon in Salt Lake City. I wanted a little bit of some metallic silver.</p><p><strong>What tied the outfit for you all together?</strong></p><p>This red vintage sweater.</p><p><strong>How tall are you?</strong> I’m 6-foot-2 but I’m wearing some platforms so I’m like 6-foot-4 with them, I think.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
