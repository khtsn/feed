So a specific location could see a huge variety in the potential forecast in the days and even hours leading up to an event. For this storm, that means a place south of the Golden Gate Bridge, like San Francisco, could end up seeing only an inch of rainfall or more than six inches by Friday.</p><p>Here’s a look at what’s happened so far, what the region may face next and why it’s so hard to be sure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hundreds of thousands of people lost power in Washington this week as strong winds brought trees down.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A bomb cyclone is a term used to define a storm system that rapidly drops in atmospheric pressure. One such system has been spinning in the Pacific northwest of Seattle for several days, and it was the interaction of that bomb cyclone with the atmospheric river that first brought pouring rain and howling winds to the northern regions of Washington starting Tuesday night. More than 600,000 customers lost power at some point overnight into Wednesday, and on Thursday morning more than 300,000 in Washington remained without power, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks utilities.</p><p>By Wednesday morning, rain had arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area, where residents faced uncertain forecasts that ranged from less than an inch to more than 10 in accumulation, depending on the storm’s movements. From Seattle to San Francisco, the storm flooded roads, brought down trees and forced Amtrak to cancel trains.</p><p>Santa Rosa in the North Bay, which typically receives just over three inches of rain in November, reached over seven inches on Wednesday, its second wettest day in the last 120 years. Just south, across the bay, San Francisco received less than a half-inch. The storm also brought blizzard conditions to places at higher elevations, and forced the authorities to close Interstate 5 just south of the Oregon-California border for a stretch of more than 50 miles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h2 id="link-472c13ff">What comes next: Thursday</h2></p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2024-11-19-atmos-river" data-id="100000009834637" data-source-id="100000009834637"><div slug="2024-11-19-atmos-river" data-sourceid="100000009834637" id="embed-id-100000009834637">

But as this second storm rapidly intensifies, the narrow band of rain will shift north, even back into Oregon, before quickly shifting south again. This storm is not expected to be nearly as intense as the one that arrived on Tuesday, but it will keep the atmospheric river going into Friday.</p><p>A rare high risk alert for excessive rain was issued for portions of coastal Northern California on Thursday, from Ukiah to just south of Fortuna, and forecasters warned that the compounding days of rainfall over the same area could lead to life-threatening flooding. Another three to six inches of rain is possible with some areas likely to receive closer to 10 inches, possibly pushing storm totals over 16 inches in a few locations. There will be significant flood risks through Thursday night and early Friday morning as the ground becomes saturated.</p><p>As the day goes on, the risk for landslides and debris flows also increases, especially over burn scars where fires have left soil less absorbent. Forecasters are especially concerned about a burn scar left from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/us/park-fire-california.html" title="">the Park fire</a>, which scorched hundreds of thousands of acres this summer between Redding and Sacramento. That wildfire was the fourth largest in California’s history.</p><h2 id="link-6b186c25">Friday: More rain for San Francisco</h2><p>The atmospheric river across California is expected to begin to weaken and drift south, bringing an end to the extreme wet weather over coastal Northern California. But that movement will center the storm over the Bay Area, and San Francisco is likely to see its heaviest rain of the week on Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Late in the day and into the night, as colder air pushes through the Bay Area, this three-day atmospheric river should finally come to an end — but the chance of rain doesn’t go away.</p><h2 id="link-73f7f5cd">Saturday: The atmospheric river is over, but the rain is not</h2><p>An unsettled weather pattern and waves of nuisance-level rainfall are likely to continue to surge through the coastal ranges of central and Northern California on Saturday and beyond.</p><p>Forecasters with the San Francisco National Weather Service said that moderate rain is also expected on Sunday and Monday, but uncertainty is much higher for how much and precisely when. It is likely that rain will remain in the forecast, without a dry day for at least another week, these forecasters warned.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
