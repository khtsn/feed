Farmland has been bought up by foreigners and well-connected locals. The only business besides farming is a German-owned convenience store.</p><p> Nearly every family has a father or mother working outside Romania. And most of those who stayed behind, according to the village’s mayor, were — at least until the cancellation of Romania’s presidential election on Sunday — “waiting for the messiah,” in the form of an ultranationalist candidate, Calin Georgescu, who promised jobs, good salaries and dignity for those feeling forgotten.</p><p>In Pestera, Mr. Georgescu won 46 percent of the vote last month in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/world/europe/romania-election-calin-georgescu.html" title="">the opening round of the presidential race.</a> The village, with few paved roads and far from Bucharest, the prosperous capital,<span>  </span>illustrates why the 62-year-old former soil expert without a political party has set off Romania’s most severe bout of political turbulence in decades. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Calin Georgescu, the independent, nationalist presidential candidate, speaking to reporters last week. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vadim Ghirda/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Located in rolling farmland between a communist-era nuclear power plant and a large and growing NATO air base near the Black Sea, Pestera is a microcosm of the parts of Romania that feel ignored by established parties.<span>  </span>There,<span>  </span>nationalism has become a powerful vehicle for expressing anger at an establishment seen as corrupt, neglectful of people’s needs and too beholden to the European Union and foreign business interests.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p> Mr. Georgescu won the first vote for the presidency on Nov. 24 (85 percent of Pestera’s vote went to him and two nationalist rivals). But on Friday, the result of that vote was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/europe/romania-election-court.html" title="">annulled by Romania’s constitutional court,</a> which also called off a final runoff election that had been scheduled for Sunday, between Mr. Georgescu and a pro-European centrist, Elena Lasconi. The court ordered a redo, saying it wanted to “to ensure the correctness and legality of the electoral process.” </p><p>The surprising decision came days after the Romanian government claimed that the country was under “hybrid attacks” from Russia involving influence operations on social media and elsewhere that were aimed at skewing the vote in Mr. Georgescu’s favor. It provided no solid evidence of a Russian role. </p><p>Mr. Georgescu, an Orthodox Christian who has voiced admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and claimed to have God on his side, had been expected to win handily in the village in Sunday’s aborted runoff. </p><p>“He penetrated into people’s minds by saying he was the chosen one,” said Pestera’s mayor from the Social Democrat Party,<span>  </span>Nicoleta Vrabie. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“I was very surprised and also scared,” Ms. Vrabie said. She was dismayed, she added, that so many of the same people who had voted for her in a mayoral election just a few weeks earlier could cast their ballots for a man she and many others had not even heard of until his face and message of salvation began flooding villagers’ mobile phones last month on TikTok.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nicoleta Vrabie, the mayor of Pestera, said she was “surprised and also scared” that so many of her fellow villagers voted for Mr. Georgescu.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Even pensioners, she said, became hooked on the TikTok posts, peering at their cellphones as they crowded into the village polling station for the first round of voting and talking excitedly about Mr. Georgescu’s latest diatribes against corrupt Romanian elites and exploitative foreigners.</p><p>In its decision to cancel the final round of voting on Sunday,<span>  </span>the constitutional court has taken a risky gamble that the TikTok-inflated balloon of support for Mr. Georgescu in places like Pestera will deflate.</p><p>That is certainly the hope of the mayor. “People will now have more time to understand reality, to get informed, and perhaps reconsider their decision to vote for him,” Ms. Vrabie said, noting that a Christmas fair in the village opened on Friday evening without incident and with no heated political discussion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Even Mr. Georgescu’s most fervent supporters have so far responded to Friday’s court ruling only with online anger, not street protests, though Mr. Georgescu denounced the court decision as an anti-democratic “pact with the devil” by Romania’s establishment. On Saturday he asked his fans to show up at shuttered polling stations on Sunday and “wait to exercise their right to vote.”</p><p>Their ardor, however, has been dampened by cold rain — and by the opening of a criminal investigation into supporters accused of providing illicit financing and violating other campaign regulations. On Saturday, police officers raided homes and offices in connection with an investigation into how Mr. Georgescu, who claims he spent “zero” on his campaign, managed to get so much exposure on social media.</p><p>Still, some in the village believe the political tumult over the election is a preface to<span>  </span>greater<span>  </span>upheaval.</p><p>“There is going to be a revolution,” predicted Lianu Marian, a 32-year-old driver who was talking and smoking with friends outside the village store when news of the court’s dramatic decision broke Friday afternoon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marian Liahu (center) with friends in Pestera on Sunday.

Ceausescu, he said, “was fighting for the people so that they did not need to go abroad to find work.”</p><p>The mayor, Ms. Vrabie, said it was “100 percent certain” that Ceausescu would win an election in Pestera and other left-behind places if he were still alive. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Romania’s reality, at least when judged by economic statistics, appears unusually good for a country that was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/world/bleak-romanian-economy-growing-ever-bleaker.html" title="">blighted by desperate poverty</a> when communism collapsed in 1989 and crippled by endemic corruption and soaring inflation during its chaotic transition to capitalism.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People in Bucharest walking by a newspaper stand on Friday, after the Constitutional Court canceled a runoff in the presidential election.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vadim Ghirda/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The country has enjoyed robust economic growth since joining the European Union in 2007, and closed the previously wide gap with its peers to become Eastern Europe’s second largest economy, after Poland.</p><p>But that growth, according to <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099134003102323181/pdf/BOSIB0480d508207e0805908b215a1d78b8.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a World Bank report</a> last year, “has not been inclusive,” with 40 percent of the population still dependent on subsistence agriculture.</p><p>Over the last 10 to 15 years, the World Bank said, more than 2 million Romanians, nearly 20 percent of the labor force, have emigrated, many on a permanent basis. “Romanian society has been aging and suffering one of the most severe brain drains globally,” the report said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The trauma of mass emigration for those left behind has provided fertile ground for Mr. Georgescu, who has vowed to generate jobs at home and reduce inequality by nationalizing certain businesses and forcing foreign companies to share more of their profits with locals.</p><p>In an interview with Reuters this past week, he said Romanians must own a majority stake in any ventures with foreign investors. “The decision-making must remain in Romania, not with foreigners,” he said.</p><p>He has also spoken frequently of stopping military assistance and other aid for Ukraine, saying that “Romania and the Romanian people come first.”</p><p>The message resonated with Denisa Geaga, 22, a new mother who, alone in Pestera with her one-month-old daughter since her husband left for Iceland to work in a warehouse, said she can’t understand why “our government says it has no money for Romanians but has money for Ukrainians.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Denisa Geaga, with her infant in Pestera, voted for Calin Georgescu.

TikTok amplified people’s anger — but, said Liviu Ornea, a writer and mathematics professor in Bucharest, Mr. Georgescu “is a bad answer to real and correct questions.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
