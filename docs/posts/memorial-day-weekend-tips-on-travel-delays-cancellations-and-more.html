The T.S.A. <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/05/07/tsa-begins-real-id-full-enforcement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said this month</a> that it planned to conduct additional screening for travelers without the federally compliant state-issued identification “until it is no longer considered a security vulnerability.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Rebecca Alesia, a travel adviser with <a href="https://smartflyer.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SmartFlyer</a> in New York City, said that while many airports are separating those without Real ID cards for extra screening, it is still most efficient to carry a passport if you don’t have a Real ID. Mr. Vlitas said he applied for <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/card.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a passport card</a> — an acceptable Real ID substitute that has no pages and can be used at land and sea crossings with Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and some Caribbean countries — so as to not have to carry his passport.</p><p>Travelers who anticipate having any issues with identification would be wise to budget for extra time in line.</p><h2 id="link-6ff61f06">Be nimble when it comes to Newark Airport</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Technology and staffing trouble at Newark Liberty International Airport could reverberate across the U.S. air travel industry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Federal regulators are responding to the combination of problems at Newark Liberty International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the country, by limiting the number of flights that can take off and land there. That means that passengers on United Airlines, which uses Newark as a hub, could face long delays across the network if their planes are routed through Newark. United is offering waivers to rebook Newark flights to Philadelphia International or LaGuardia Airport through May 23.</p><p>Ms. Alesia recommended booking direct flights with potential transfers to cars or trains instead of layovers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And while changing plans to fly out of a different airport may be enticing, Ms. Alesia cautioned travelers that problems can arise anywhere.</p><p>“The best thing to do is just keep calm,” she said. “Remember that part of travel is going outside your comfort zone.”</p><p>Ms. Alesia said that amid widespread cancellations at Newark, she recommends booking early-morning flights, so that even if your flight is delayed, it has a chance of taking off.</p><h2 id="link-e5c2686">A tried-and-true strategy: Get to the airport early</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Arriving at the airport with time to spare is a good way to prepare for any sudden disruptions to travel plans.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Social media has been abuzz with what is <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/airport-theory" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">known as “airport theory,”</a> which suggests that since travelers need to be at their gate only 15 minutes before takeoff, they don’t need to show up at security until their flights begin boarding.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@michael.dicostanzo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael DiCostanzo,</a> a content creator who believes he helped start this trend, said that his videos about zipping through security had been misunderstood — he was only trying to prove that security often takes less time than people think. He timed the journey through screening at four major airports and found that it often took only about 15 minutes.</p><p>“I think a lot of people became attached to this 15-minute number,” he said, adding that he likes to arrive at the airport two and a half hours before his flights. “I never take any chances.”</p><p>So while delays and cancellations are out of a passenger’s control, getting to the airport early is a good way to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/travel/airport-time-money-tips.html" title="">ensure you’re prepared</a> for potential delays. The rule of thumb is to arrive two hours before departure for domestic flights, and three hours for an international flight.</p><p>Peter Vlitas, a vice president for the <a href="https://internova.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Internova Travel Group</a>, one of the largest travel services companies in the world, said he takes no chances, telling his travelers to arrive three hours before even a domestic journey during the holiday weekend.</p><p>“Planes are full,” Mr. Vlitas said. “If you miss your flight, there’s no guarantee you’ll get on the next one.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Vlitas advised travelers to check in online before arriving at the airport. Additional prescreening services such as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/travel/precheck-global-entry-airport-security.html" title="">Transportation Security Administration’s PreCheck</a> program and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/travel/clear-airport-screening.html" title="">Clear</a> can help passengers move through security more quickly, he said, but cost extra.</p><h2 id="link-371a4863">Staffing shortages may affect some tourist hot spots</h2><p>Over 330 million people visit the nation’s 63 national parks and hundreds of historic sites and other attractions managed by the National Park Service, places where staffing shortages resulting from budget cuts could affect plans. Already this year, some of the most popular parks have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/travel/national-park-visits.html" title="">reported long traffic lines</a>.</p><p>As part of the Trump administration’s effort to reduce the federal work force, the Department of the Interior, which runs the park service, in February fired more than 1,000 National Park Service employees — and then more than 700 additional staff members <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/national-park-service-federal-workers-quit.html" title="">submitted their resignations</a>. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum then said the park service would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/21/us/trump-news/confusion-abounds-at-the-national-park-service-which-is-hiring-after-firing?smid=url-share" title="">hire thousands of workers</a> in temporary, summer positions. Conservationists, outdoor enthusiasts and park rangers warned at the time that hundreds of sites run by the park service could be left understaffed during the busy summer season.</p><p>Visitors planning trips can plan ahead by looking up the site on the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/findapark/index.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">park service’s online guide</a>, where they might be able to book passes.</p><p>The National Park Service didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p><h2 id="link-ce6e15b">Mind the new rules about batteries in checked luggage</h2><p>The T.S.A. announced recently that lithium batteries, included those found in phone chargers, power banks and portable chargers, can fly only in carry-on luggage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The new rule comes after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/portable-batteries-fires-planes.html" title="">many airlines in Asia</a> tightened rules concerning the batteries following a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/world/asia/busan-plane-fire-south-korea.html" title="">fire that destroyed an Air Busan plane</a> as it waited on the tarmac in South Korea in January.</p><p>Under the new T.S.A. guidelines, if a passenger’s bag is gate checked, meaning that a carry-on is put in the cargo hold because of space limitations, that passenger must remove all lithium batteries from the bag and bring them into the plane’s cabin.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Follow New York Times Travel </em></strong><em>on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/traveldispatch" title=""><em>sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter</em></a><em> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
