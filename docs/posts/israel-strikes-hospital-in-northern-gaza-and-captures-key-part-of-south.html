The World Health Organization <a href="https://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/Sitrep_57.pdf?ua=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> last month that 33 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals had been damaged during the war, and only 21 remained partly functional. The W.H.O. also <a href="https://x.com/WHOoPt/status/1911131665788739832\" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> on Saturday that hospitals in Gaza face a looming medicine shortage because Israel has blocked aid deliveries for six weeks.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Ahli Arab hospital compound was first hit less than two weeks into the war, when a missile <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/world/middleeast/gaza-hospital-explosion-israel.html" title="">hit</a> a parking lot on the site where dozens of displaced families were sheltering. Hamas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hospital-evidence.html" title="">blamed</a> the strike on Israel, before Israel said it was caused by an errant rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group allied with Hamas. U.S. intelligence officials later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/us/politics/intel-rocket-gaza-hospital-blast.html" title="">said</a> they had “high confidence” in the Israeli account.</p><p>The Israeli military acknowledged responsibility on Sunday for the latest strike on the hospital, saying without offering evidence that the site had housed a Hamas command center. Both the military and the Anglican Church said that Israeli soldiers had called the hospital to order its evacuation before the strike. Neither the hospital authorities nor Hamas responded to questions about whether the hospital had been used by Hamas fighters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Damage after the strike on Sunday at the Ahli Arab Hospital compound.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a separate development, the Israeli defense minister announced on Saturday the capture of a strategic east-west thoroughfare in southern Gaza.
