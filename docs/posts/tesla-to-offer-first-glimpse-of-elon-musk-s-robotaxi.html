And it will be shown at an invitation-only evening event at the Warner Bros. studio near Los Angeles. Mr. Musk has promised that the cab, which he calls the Robotaxi, will be able to ferry passengers to any destination without human intervention, a feat that other companies have achieved in just a few places, like Phoenix and San Francisco.</p><p>But many experts are doubtful that such Tesla taxis will hit the roads anytime soon. Mr. Musk has for several years claimed that the company was months away from starting a Robotaxi service. In addition, the autonomous driving technology Tesla offers today can make basic mistakes, requiring drivers to intervene to avoid accidents or violating traffic laws.</p><p>Still, Mr. Musk’s supporters and fans believe that the Robotaxi will open a lucrative line of business that will more than make up for Tesla’s recent struggles in the electric car market, where it has lost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/business/tesla-electric-vehicles-market-share.html" title="">market share</a> to more established carmakers. Mr. Musk has said people will be able to purchase Robotaxis for personal use and earn extra money by allowing the vehicles to ferry passengers, the automotive equivalent of listing a home on Airbnb.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“An autonomous taxi platform will unlock a multitrillion-dollar market,” Tasha Keeney, director of investment analysis at ARK Invest, an asset management firm that owns shares in Tesla, said in a statement.</p><p>But other analysts and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/business/elon-musk-tesla-robotaxi.html" title="">autonomous driving experts</a> said there was little evidence that Tesla was close to perfecting the technology and making a profit from it anytime soon.</p><p>A car capable of functioning as a self-driving taxi “is still several years away, and numerous technological hurdles, safety tests and regulatory approvals are still standing in the way,” Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in a note this week.</p><p>For Tesla investors, whose shares are trading for about the same price they were at the beginning of the year, much is riding on the event.</p><p>Tesla’s status as the most valuable car company in the world was once based on Mr. Musk’s claim that the company would sell 20 million cars a year by the end of the decade, twice as many as Toyota and more than 10 times as many as Tesla sold last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Lately, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/business/tesla-electric-vehicle-sales.html" title="">sales growth</a> at Tesla has slowed, Mr. Musk has stopped emphasizing that goal and instead staked the company’s future on self-driving technology. People who don’t believe in Tesla’s ability to conquer the obstacles to fully autonomous driving “should not be an investor in the company,” Mr. Musk said in April.</p><p>Tesla already sells a monthly subscription for a system it calls Supervised Full Self-Driving to owners of its electric vehicles. But the company says drivers using it must be ready to intervene at any moment if the software makes a mistake. Tesla will probably use a more advanced version of that technology in its taxi, though it has not offered many details and did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>A ride last week in a Tesla Model 3 equipped with the latest version of Full Self-Driving indicated that the company still has work to do.</p><p>The car’s performance during a drive through Manhattan and Queens was impressive at times. It was courteous to pedestrians, once stopping, in the Rockaway Beach neighborhood, for two children who were stepping off a sidewalk onto a four-lane street where there was no crosswalk or traffic signal.</p><p>But on numerous other occasions the car avoided accidents or illegal maneuvers only because the driver intervened. The car was being driven by Guy Mangiamele, director of vehicle testing for <a href="https://amcitesting.com/tesla-fsd/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AMCI Testing</a>, a Los Angeles-based research firm that assesses vehicle performance for car companies and other customers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>With full self-driving engaged, the car became confused in a tunnel between Manhattan and Queens, slowing dangerously in heavy traffic. In Manhattan’s financial district, the car ran a red light. It tried to make a left turn onto West 29th Street from a middle lane of the Avenue of the Americas, and would have cut off a police car had Mr. Mangiamele not intervened.</p><p>Mr. Mangiamele, who has tested the software over hundreds of miles in various locations, called it an “incredible accomplishment” that nonetheless has “glaring shortcomings.”</p><p>Mr. Musk has long said that Tesla vehicles would be able to operate without human intervention. His unfulfilled promises prompted a class-action lawsuit by the Oakland County, Mich., pension fund and other shareholders who claimed he misled them about the company’s technology in violation of securities laws.</p><p>But a federal judge in California ruled in favor of Tesla last month, citing laws that allow executives to make optimistic statements even if they later prove to be untrue. The ruling grants broad leeway to Mr. Musk.</p><p>Tesla is not the only company pursuing self-driving taxis. Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company, has been operating a driverless taxi service for years. It recently said its cars were providing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/technology/waymo-expansion-alphabet.html" title="">more than 100,000 rides a week</a> in San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. Cruise, a unit of General Motors, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/business/general-motors-cruise-driverless-taxi.html" title="">recently restarted testing driverless taxis</a> after one of its cars hit and dragged a pedestrian last year in San Francisco. And Zoox, owned by Amazon, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/03/technology/zoox-self-driving-cars-remote-control.html" title="">testing a driverless van</a> that has no steering wheel with plans to start a paying service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Analysts say it will probably be years before those companies or Tesla is running a profitable taxi service in many urban areas. And even then such services will need sizable teams of engineers, mechanics, cleaners and others to operate.</p><p>“Elon’s Robotaxi represents a potential paradigm shift in the transportation industry,” Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars, a used car shopping site, said in a statement this week, “but it’s not going to happen overnight.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Oct. 10, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified misidentified a county pension fund that was part of a class-action lawsuit against Tesla. It was a pension fund for Oakland County, Mich., not Oakland County, Calif.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Jack Ewing writes about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
