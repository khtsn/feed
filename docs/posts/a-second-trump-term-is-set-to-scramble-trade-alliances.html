2024</time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Even before stepping back into the Oval Office, President-elect Donald J. Trump is prompting governments across the globe to rethink their trading relationships as they prepare for a four-year period in which business with the United States could become much more volatile.</p><p>Foreign officials and analysts say that Mr. Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on much of the rest of the world are encouraging some countries to try to diversify their trading relationships and find other avenues for their products as they seek to get ahead of a potentially damaging trade war.</p><p>A tie-up between the European Union and South America announced on Friday demonstrates the kind of shifting trade alliances that Mr. Trump’s presidency could bring. The European Union finalized its biggest trade deal to date, signing an agreement with members of Mercosur, a South American trade bloc that includes Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.</p><p>If ratified, the deal will establish one of the largest trade zones in the world, lowering tariffs on cars, machinery and pharmaceuticals that move between the continents. That allegiance could put American exporters at a disadvantage, as many of the partner countries gain better trading terms with one another than they have with the United States. For instance, American farmers who want to sell beef, poultry and soybeans into Europe may find themselves boxed out by South American exports that will now gain access to the market with lower tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Trade relationships have been undergoing a seismic shift over the past eight years as the United States has backed away from its longstanding position as a champion of globalization and free-trade agreements. Mr. Trump’s first presidency included a sharp turn toward protectionism, as he negotiated deals globally but ended up leaving much higher tariffs in place against allies like Mexico and Europe, and competitors like China.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>BYD electric vehicles that will be exported from China to Brazil. President-elect Donald J.

But many other countries have still been pushing forward with new trade pacts.</p><p>Alan Wm. Wolff, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the former deputy director general of the World Trade Organization, said that the United States being absent from trade negotiations for much of the last eight years had meant that other countries’ tariffs had turned more discriminatory against the United States in many markets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Our goods are facing discrimination, and it’s increasing,” he said. “It’s not a plus for the United States, it’s a plus for our competitors.”</p><p>This month, Britain is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/the-uk-and-the-comprehensive-and-progressive-agreement-for-trans-pacific-partnershipcptpp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">set to become a member of a Pacific trade pact</a> that originated with the Obama administration, but that Mr. Trump pulled out of during his first term. In the last few months, China <a href="https://asean.org/joint-statement-on-the-substantial-conclusion-of-the-asean-china-free-trade-area-acfta-3-0-upgrade-negotiations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has finalized a free-trade agreement</a> with a group of Southeast Asian countries, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/peru-china-sign-strengthened-free-trade-agreement-xis-apec-visit-2024-11-08/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another with Peru</a>.</p><p>“Clearly our trading partners are not standing still, as the United States is taking a timeout on trade,” said Wendy Cutler, a former trade negotiator who is now a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.</p><p>Ms. Cutler said that many trade deals coming to fruition today were underway before Mr. Trump won, and that the pandemic and geopolitical tensions had also been encouraging countries to diversify their trading partners.</p><p>But, she added, “the Trump election has given strong impetus to accelerating these efforts, both to diversify trading partners and to reduce reliance on the U.S. market.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It remains to be seen how much the Trump administration will raise tariffs in the years to come, and how much it will negotiate new deals with other countries. Mr. Trump has embraced hefty tariffs not only as an economic measure that protects U.S. factories, but also as a source of leverage in negotiations that could ultimately persuade other countries to lower their tariff rates on American imports. In his first term, he negotiated new trade provisions with many countries, but also left in place significantly higher U.S. tariffs.</p><p>For his second term, Mr. Trump has proposed a 10 to 20 percent tariff on most products from around the world, as well as a 60 percent tariff on goods from China. But in recent weeks, he has made new threats: tariffs of 25 percent on Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10 percent tariff on China. He has also threatened to impose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/trump-dollar-trade-china-russia.html" title="">a 100 percent tariff on emerging economies</a> that have considered developing a common currency to counter the dollar.</p><p>It is not clear which countries will be the ultimate target of this trade policy, but Mr. Trump has been particularly skeptical of U.S. trade with Europe, traditionally a close ally. In his first term, he criticized the bloc for its low military spending and trade barriers to American cars. The Trump administration negotiated some new terms of trade with the European Union, but efforts to negotiate a broader free-trade agreement fizzled.</p><p>Dan Mullaney, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank, and a former U.S. trade official, said that European officials were not giving up on the possibility of negotiating an agreement with the Trump administration, but that they felt that “if the worst happens, we need to have other markets out there.”</p><p>While the E.U. had been negotiating the South American agreement for a long time, Mr. Trump’s election may have accelerated its completion, he said. “The idea of spreading the wealth and diversifying the portfolio is probably one of the factors,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.
