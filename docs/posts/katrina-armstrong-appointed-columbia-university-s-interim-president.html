Armstrong was out of sorts.</p><p>It was April 15, 2013, her first day as the physician in chief of Massachusetts General Hospital, and she was grappling with the enormity of her new job. She felt, she mused later, as if she had moved abroad.</p><p>Then two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Mass General prepared its emergency room as 127 of the wounded headed for the city’s top-level trauma centers, part of a response that ultimately earned Boston’s hospitals sweeping praise.</p><p>Dr. Armstrong, who was abruptly appointed as Columbia University’s interim president on Wednesday, has often talked about the aftermath of the terrorist attack on Boylston Street.</p></div></div><div><p>“We had had, and continue to have, this opportunity to be part of the healing that I think almost no other group got to do,” she said in <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/charged/episodes/katrina-armstrong" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Mass General podcast in 2018</a>. “And so to be able to heal both patients and a community that way, it was an incredible time to start.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Katrina A.

(She has said she often won county fair contests where people tried, and failed, to guess where she was from.)</p><p>She finished high school near Birmingham, Ala., in 1982 and went to Yale University, where she worked in the dining hall and majored not in biology or chemistry but in architecture.</p><p>Within five years of graduation, though, she had earned a medical degree from Johns Hopkins University, where she completed a residency in internal medicine. During her time in Baltimore, she met her future husband, Thomas C. Randall, a gynecologic oncologist.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Dr. Armstrong soon headed for Philadelphia, where she was a fellow and then a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania. She was the chief of the general internal medicine division and worked with Penn’s cancer center until her move to Boston in 2013, when she became physician in chief at Mass General, Harvard’s largest teaching hospital.</p><p>Columbia brought her to New York in 2022, when she became the chief executive of the university’s medical center, a sprawling empire that has long been an economic engine.</p><p>Although much of Dr. Armstrong’s research has been related to breast cancer, her record also shows longstanding interests in other parts of medicine. Her papers over the years have examined desegregation in academic medical centers and, long before the pandemic, distrust in the American health care system. More recently, she has been involved in projects in South Dakota related to palliative care and Covid-19 testing for Native Americans.</p><p>Until Wednesday, though, she had never been a university president. In the Ivy League, her interim status and medical background hardly make her an outlier.</p><p>Dr. J. Larry Jameson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/12/us/penn-university-interim-president-lawrence-jameson.html" title="">has been Penn’s interim leader</a> since December, after M. Elizabeth Magill resigned amid a firestorm over her legalistic answers to Congress about antisemitism. Dr. Jameson, who briefly overlapped with Dr. Armstrong in Philadelphia, is expected to stay in his role into 2026.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Dr. Michael Kotlikoff, a veterinarian, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/us/cornell-president-resigns-martha-pollack.html" title="">began a two-year term</a> as Cornell’s interim president on July 1.</p><p>And last month, Harvard announced that Alan M. Garber, a doctor who had been its interim president since January, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/harvard-president-alan-garber.html" title="">would be its permanent leader</a> through at least the 2026-27 academic year.</p><p>In a letter to the Columbia community on Wednesday, Dr. Armstrong <a href="https://president.columbia.edu/news/message-katrina-armstrong" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted that she was</a> “acutely aware of the trials the university has faced over the past year.” But, she argued, the university “should neither understate their significance, nor allow them to define who we are and what we will become.”</p><p>The university, as it wound down Dr. Shafik’s 13-month tenure, did not say how long Dr. Armstrong might have to lead Columbia.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Blinder is a national correspondent for The Times, covering education.<span> </span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Colleges and the War in Gaza</h2><hr/><p><strong>News and Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p>More than 3,100 people have been arrested or detained in connection with pro-Palestinian protests at U.S. colleges.
