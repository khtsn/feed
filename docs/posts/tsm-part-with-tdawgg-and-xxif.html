QoR placed in the top eight of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1971/challengers-league-2024-north-america-stage-1/mid-season-cup" target="_blank">Split 1</a>, but missed the playoffs of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2071/challengers-league-2024-north-america-stage-2/regular-season" target="_blank">Split 2</a>, ending the team&#39;s chance for Ascension. After their elimination, tdawgg and XXiF opted not to re-sign with the organization for 2025.</p>

<p>TSM, after a trip to Ascension, brought in the QoR duo as they <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/423153/tsm-rebuilds-ahead-of-split-3" target="_blank">rebuilt</a> their roster for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2150/challengers-league-2024-north-america-stage-3/playoffs" target="_blank">Split 3</a> of Challengers. This new roster played in two tournaments together.

<p>tdawgg has clarified that he was not dropped by TSM, but left in order to pursue an offer from a different team. No statement has been made thus far from XXiF.</p>

<p>TSM will need to re-complete their roster before <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2301/challengers-league-2025-north-america-ace-stage-1" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> of Challengers 2025, starting on Jan 29.</p>

		<p>crazy take. td0g was ass but xxif was their best player and was a top 5 player last year. he could definitely play for at least half of the franchised teams </p>

			<p>Definitely not top 5 idk where you pulled that out of. Best on QoR you can argue but then again that team just did bad so is that really a achievement?</p>
<p>Plus its not like hes just out shooting them he would just lurk around on attack and on defense never switch his site for some reason even if the enemies were clearly avoiding him. XXiF&#39;s HS% is that of a diamond, Hes not that adaptive, He relys on others actions for him to make impact, The only thing you can praise about him is he is good at clutching which you can say about most pros anyway.</p>		</div>

		<p>i mean those are both players too good for tier 2 if anything they both probably would accept an offer on cubert just bc its sen</p>

	<div data-post-id="4409796">
		
		
		<p>dapr is possible or maybe adder as well for the role? what they really need is a new igl cant think of any that arent retired but hopefully they find someone </p>

		<p>both deserve better and I&#39;m sure theyll find a new spot in T2, but if theyre dropping one of their best players its gotta be for someone big, Rossy or Victor maybe?</p>
