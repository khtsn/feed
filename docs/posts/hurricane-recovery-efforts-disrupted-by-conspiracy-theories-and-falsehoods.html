The storms were engineered to clear the way for lithium mining. They were sent to help the Democrats in next month’s election. They were formed by weather-controlling lasers.</p><p>The claims persist despite attempts by scientists and government officials to debunk them with evidence. They survive all calls to reason.</p><p>The falsehoods, which have been circulating on X, TikTok, YouTube and other platforms, can resemble the conspiracy theories that plague modern American politics. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/hurricane-helene-trump-harris.html" title="">Prominent</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/elon-musk-helene-aid-buttigieg.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">figures</a> are pushing them, citing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/11/us/politics/china-disinformation-ai.html" title="">unrelated, misleading or outdated evidence</a>.</p><p>But the risks are often more immediate. Online climate-related conspiracy theories can quickly cause damage offline, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-misinformation.html" title="">disrupting emergency communications and recovery efforts</a>. Officials have said this week that the disinformation about Hurricanes Helene and Milton was making relief workers a target, and the American Red Cross <a href="https://www.facebook.com/redcross/posts/931678405657079" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> that the outlandish claims could prevent survivors from seeking help.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“If they’re telling you that the government is responsible for the disaster, that doesn’t help you at all in getting ready for it,” said Jose E. Ramirez-Marquez, an associate professor of systems engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology and a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212420924006113" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">co-author of a journal article</a> this month on how hurricane-related information traveled through X.</p><p>The increasing frequency and devastating power of major storms, heat waves, wildfires and other weather-related catastrophes tend to elicit an especially strong emotional response, allowing climate denialists, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/technology/cop28-climate-disinformation.html" title="">lobbyists for the oil and gas industry</a> and rumormongers to exploit people’s concern and confusion.</p><p>“It helps them to regain some measure of control and sense of order at a time when everything feels quite bleak and hopeless,” said <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/isd_team/jennie-king/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jennie King</a>, who oversees climate disinformation research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that studies online platforms.</p><p>The intensity of Helene and Milton’s one-two punch has been difficult to fathom. For many, it has been easier to blame human villains.</p><p>On TikTok, millions of users were exposed to conspiracy theories about the storms, according to research from the liberal media watchdog group <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/hurricanes/hurricane-milton-grows-so-do-conspiracy-theories-falsely-attributing-hurricanes-weather" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Media Matters for America</a>. There were claims that Helene was the product of a man-made land grab to enable lithium mining in North Carolina, though the hurricane also plowed through several other states. Climate scientists have said there is no way for humans to manufacture hurricanes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Other false narratives spread in ad-supported YouTube videos with tens of thousands of views and in X posts with millions of views, voiced by public figures including a Christian nationalist podcaster, a former Trump administration official and a Republican congresswoman. They said the hurricanes were the result of government efforts to disrupt voting by steering the storm toward Republican districts; sound waves and microwave weapons; or greed-fueled plots benefiting investment firms like BlackRock. (Scientists debunked such claims, saying that humans cannot <a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.36JK9FW" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">modify the path of a storm</a> and that no technology exists that can create hurricanes.)</p><p>Many of the narratives contained strains of conspiracy theories floated during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/business/media/maui-idalia-disinformation-climate-change.html" title="">earlier natural disasters</a>. Peddlers of climate disinformation are opportunistic, experts said, often recycling claims and blasting them into the information ecosystem during times of crisis until they catch the public’s attention and take off. Since late September, when Helene made landfall, the number of articles and social media posts that mentioned both hurricanes alongside terms such as “geoengineered,” “manipulated” and “weather weapons” has ballooned, according to data cited by Newsguard, a group that tracks misinformation.</p><p>Pyrra Technologies, a company that monitors fringe social media, found that false story lines introduced during Helene about the Federal Emergency Management Agency were being repurposed for Milton on platforms associated with the far right. Common disinformation tactics, such as misrepresenting old footage, were also deployed: Some accounts shared a video of a woman being thrown out of a Texas bar in 2023 and falsely claimed that it showed a more recent assault against a FEMA official.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>FEMA workers looking through the wreckage in Swannanoa, N.C.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Loren Elliott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Matt Huggins, a 35-year-old police officer in Marion, N.C., spent several days with FEMA crews last week, touring the floodwaters in a tiny boat looking for anyone who needed help.

Rumors about natural disasters that start in digital forums can influence real-world choices about evacuation, financial aid and searches for missing loved ones.</p><p>An additional layer of risk pervades the most recent cycle of disinformation, experts said, as false narratives about the dual hurricanes dovetail with and fuel existing conspiracy theories about sinister plots to derail the upcoming election.</p><p>When conspiracies “erode people’s trust in institutions and the whole idea of government coordination, then suddenly people either ignore or actively refute the instructions that they’re being given,” said Ms. King of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. “There has just been this complete breakdown in those channels of communication.”</p><p>The disinformation around Helene and Milton has become so overwhelming that even public officials linked to other conspiracy theories — such as election denial — are trying to beat back rumors and underscore the severity of the storms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Tim Burchett, a Republican congressman from Tennessee who has supported former President Donald J.

On Wednesday, President Biden accused his predecessor of undermining confidence in rescue and rebuilding work, saying he contributed to the “reckless, irresponsible and relentless promotion of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/politics/biden-trump-hurricane-response.html" title="">disinformation and outright lies</a>.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tiffany Hsu reports on misinformation and disinformation and its origins, movement and consequences.
