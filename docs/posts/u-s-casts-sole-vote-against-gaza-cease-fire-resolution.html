Because as this council has previously called for, a durable end to the war must come with the release of the hostages. These two urgent goals are inextricably linked. This resolution abandoned that necessity, and for that reason, the United States could not support it. Simply put, this resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas. There’s no need to come back to the negotiating table. There are still seven American citizens in the hands of Hamas. We will not forget them. For our part, we will continue to pursue a diplomatic solution that brings peace, security and freedom to Palestinians in Gaza.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/20/multimedia/20un-resolution-hwgl/20un-resolution-hwgl-superJumbo-v3.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The United States said it vetoed the United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, because it did not make the cease-fire contingent on the release of the hostages held in Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farnaz-fassihi"><img alt="Farnaz Fassihi" title="Farnaz Fassihi" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward"><img alt="Euan Ward" title="Euan Ward" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/08/reader-center/author-euan-ward/author-euan-ward-thumbLarge.png"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-fuller"><img alt="Thomas Fuller" title="Thomas Fuller" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-thomas-fuller/author-thomas-fuller-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></a></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farnaz-fassihi" itemprop="name">Farnaz Fassihi</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward" itemprop="name">Euan Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-fuller" itemprop="name">Thomas Fuller</a></p><p>Farnaz Fassihi reported from the United Nations and Euan Ward reported from Beirut, Lebanon.</p></div></div></div><p><time datetime="2024-11-20T17:07:03-05:00"><span>Nov. 20, 2024</span><span>Updated <span>5:07 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The United States on Wednesday vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, where fighting has raged for more than 13 months and a humanitarian crisis is intensifying.</p><p>Underlining Washington’s diplomatic isolation on the issue, the United States cast the sole vote against the resolution, with the 14 other Council members voting in favor.</p><p>The United States said it vetoed the resolution, the fifth the Council has taken up, because it did not make the cease-fire contingent on the release of the hostages still being held in Gaza. The resolution does call for the release of all hostages, but the wording suggests that their release would come only after a cease-fire was implemented.</p><p>The impasse at the United Nations appeared in contrast to cease-fire talks in Lebanon, where a top U.S. envoy, Amos Hochstein, said on Wednesday that there had been “additional progress” in efforts to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group allied with Hamas. Mr. Hochstein, saying he hoped “to try to bring this to a close if we can,&#34; traveled to Israel on Wednesday evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The leader of Hezbollah said Wednesday that the war’s end was now in the hands of Israeli leaders.</p><p>The U.S. veto on Wednesday was the fourth time the United States has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/world/middleeast/us-cease-fire-resolution-vetoes.html" title="">blocked an effort by the</a> Council to demand a cease-fire in Gaza since last year, when Hamas led an attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and took more than 200 others hostage.

Ending the fighting, they said, was a necessary first step to release the hostages, about 100 of whom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/hostages-in-gaza-hamas.html" title="">remain</a> in Gaza, and to save civilians.</p><p>In the eyes of many nations, the Biden administration’s legacy will be colored by its staunch defense of Israel.</p><p>“This will sadly further weaken Biden’s reputation in the U.N. bubble,” said Richard Gowan, the U.N. director of the International Crisis Group. “He was once seen as a welcome replacement for Trump. But he leaves office with low marks among most U.N. diplomats who think he has been egregiously obstructive on Gaza.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Although Security Council resolutions are considered international law, the Council lacks enforcement powers. It could impose punitive measures, such as sanctions, but that would also require member states to agree.</p><p>Washington, while working with Qatar and Egypt for months for a cease-fire deal and the release of hostages, has backed Israel’s position that one cannot come before the other.</p><p>“We could not support an unconditional cease-fire that failed to release the hostages,” said Robert A. Wood, an American ambassador to the United Nations. “These two urgent goals are inextricably linked. This resolution abandoned that necessity.”</p><p>After the vote, Israel’s ambassador, Danny Danon, thanked the United States and blamed Hamas for the suffering of Palestinian civilians. “The resolution brought before this chamber was not a path to peace,” he said. “It was a road map to more terror, more suffering, and more bloodshed.”</p><p>The two-page resolution called for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire; the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza; increased and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid; and for all parties to enable the battered U.N. agency that helps Palestinians, known as UNRWA, to carry out its work in Gaza and the West Bank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“A cease-fire will allow to save lives, all lives,” said Majed Bamya, the deputy Palestinian ambassador to the Council. “A cease-fire doesn’t resolve everything, but it is the first step toward resolving anything.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A vigil in Tel Aviv last month for the hostages in Gaza. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The resolution was put forth by the 10 nonpermanent Council members: Algeria, Ecuador, Guyana, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia and Switzerland.</p><p>“It is a sad day for the Security Council, for the United Nations and for the international community,” Algeria’s ambassador, Amar Bendjama, said after the vote. </p><p>The draft resolution was negotiated for weeks, said Guyana’s ambassador, Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett. She said the Council needed to respond to concerns “over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Council, where the United States is rivaled by Russia and China, has struggled to speak in one voice and play an effective role in mediating the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Russia and China <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-security-council-veto.html" title="">vetoed an American resolution</a> in March that called for “an immediate and sustained cease-fire” in Gaza.</p><p>Aid groups condemned the U.S. veto on Wednesday.</p><p>“It is shameful that the United States has once again used the veto to block consensus on a lifesaving cease-fire, while they continue to approve deadly arms transfers to fuel the violence and humanitarian catastrophe,” said Brenda Moyfa, head of Oxfam’s New York office.</p><p>The United States’ support for Israel, and the resulting deadlock over Gaza in the Council, has also generated frustration from some of America’s closest allies, the permanent members Britain and France.</p><p>“We deplore today’s failure of the U.N. Security Council,” said France’s ambassador, Nicolas de Rivière. He said the resolution sent the right messages: the immediate cease-fire and the immediate release of hostages. “There is no credible justification to object to that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Speaking to reporters, Mr. de Rivière also said French and American officials were discussing the war in Lebanon, and specifically proposals to monitor southern Lebanon during a cease-fire.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lebanese security personnel at the site of a drone attack in central Beirut, Lebanon, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. de Rivière said the Lebanese army needed to move troops to southern Lebanon as part of a cease-fire, which would be based on<span>  </span>a 2006 Security Council resolution that ended Israel’s last war in Lebanon.</p><p>On Wednesday in Beirut, Mr. Hochstein, the U.S. envoy, met for a second straight day with Nabih Berri, the Hezbollah-allied speaker of Lebanon’s Parliament, who has emerged as an important figure in negotiations. During many rounds of diplomacy over the past year, Mr. Hochstein has seldom stayed overnight in Lebanon, so his extended visit raised hopes for progress in talks.</p><p>Mr. Hochstein was set to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Thursday, said a spokesman, Omer Dostri.</p><p>In a televised address during Mr. Hochstein’s visit, Hezbollah’s new leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/hezbollah-new-leader-naim-qassem.html" title="">Naim</a> Qassem, said Hezbollah had responded to the U.S. cease-fire proposal.

It is now the bloodiest conflict there since Lebanon’s civil war, which lasted from 1975 to 1990.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Amos Hochstein, a Biden Administration envoy, before meeting with Nabih Berri, the Hezbollah-allied speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, in Beirut on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bilal Hussein/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> in Jerusalem, <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> in Tel Aviv, <!-- -->Dayana Iwaza<!-- --> in Beirut, and <!-- -->Matthew Mpoke Bigg<!-- --> in London.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Farnaz Fassihi is the United Nations bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the organization, and also covers Iran and the shadow war between Iran and Israel.
