They pledged to assemble a European “coalition of the willing” to develop a plan for ending Ukraine’s war with Russia, which they hope could win the backing of a skeptical Mr. Trump.</p><p>Gathering in London at the invitation of Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, the leaders vowed to bolster support for Ukraine. But they also expressed hope that Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump could repair their breach, underscoring Europe’s reluctance to cast off a trans-Atlantic alliance that has kept the peace for 80 years.</p><p>“We have to bridge this,” Mr. Starmer said on Sunday to the BBC before the leaders began arriving at Lancaster House, near Buckingham Palace. “We have to find a way where we can all work together.”</p><p>Mr. Starmer said he believed that despite Mr. Trump’s anger toward Mr. Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday, the president was committed to a lasting peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. He said Britain and France, working with other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/europe/ukraine-trump.html?searchResultPosition=23" title="">European countries</a>, would develop their own plan with Mr. Zelensky.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Details of the plan were sketchy, but Mr. Starmer suggested that the Europeans could use it as a basis to persuade Mr. Trump to commit to American security guarantees. Britain and France have already pledged to contribute troops to a peacekeeping force and are trying to enlist other countries across Europe.</p><p>“I think we’ve got a step in the right direction,” Mr. Starmer said, though he added that “this is a moment of real fragility in Europe.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Starmer said he believed that despite President Trump’s anger toward Mr. Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday, he was committed to a lasting peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His comments captured the dilemma confronting Europe two weeks after Mr. Trump’s surprise overture to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Neither Europe nor Ukraine currently have seats at the table in a potential Trump-brokered peace deal. Nor has Mr. Trump agreed to give security assurances to prevent Russia from launching another invasion of its neighbor.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s acrimonious exchange with Mr. Zelensky deepened the trans-Atlantic divide. “Nobody wants to see that,” said Mr. Starmer, who had his own, much smoother meeting with Mr. Trump a day earlier.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The prime minister has tried to mediate between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump. Speaking to both men by phone after their clash, he floated the idea of Mr. Zelensky returning to the White House on Friday evening to mend fences with the president, according to a senior British official.</p><p>Both leaders demurred, saying it would be better to let tempers cool and the air to clear, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Still, Mr. Zelensky himself has also expressed a belief that his rift with Mr. Trump was not irreparable.</p><p>On Sunday in London, Europe wrapped Mr. Zelensky in a warm embrace. He won expressions of support from the 18 assembled leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy. After meeting them, he was scheduled to visit King Charles III at his country estate, Sandringham, northeast of London.</p><p>Yet behind the carefully choreographed show of solidarity, there was a recognition that keeping the United States on board remains critical.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“Starmer has two goals,” said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. “Build an offer with the Ukrainians and Europeans that keeps the U.S. positively engaged in Ukraine’s security, while simultaneously preparing for a worst-case scenario where that may not prove possible.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ukrainian soldier on the front line in the Dnipro region of eastern Ukraine last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That will require European countries to shoulder a much heavier burden in defending the continent’s defense. Mr. Starmer is expected to push fellow European leaders to follow Britain in bolstering its military spending.</p><p>Last week, the British government announced that its defense budget would reach 2.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2027 and 3 percent within a decade. On Saturday, after meeting Mr. Zelensky at 10 Downing Street, Mr. Starmer gave Ukraine a loan of 2.26 billion pounds (about $2.8 billion) to buy additional military hardware.</p><p>The summit meeting has thrust Mr. Starmer into an unaccustomed place for a British prime minister: at the heart of Europe during a crisis. More than eight years after the country voted to leave the European Union, the rapidly changing security landscape is driving Britain closer to the continent.</p><p>Catherine Ashton, a Briton who served as the E.U.’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said Mr. Starmer’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/world/europe/trump-starmer-king-charles.html" title="">successful meeting</a> with Mr. Trump had reinforced his credentials as a leader for Europe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It is unsurprising that allies in Europe are gathering in London this weekend and equally unsurprising that the U.K. is being taken much more seriously in Brussels and capitals,” Ms. Ashton said.</p><p>And yet there are limits to Mr. Starmer’s diplomacy. He was unable to extract any security guarantees from Mr. Trump for Ukraine, despite an exaggerated show of deference to the president. That included Mr. Starmer hand-delivering an invitation for a state visit from the king, a rare second time Mr. Trump has been accorded that honor.</p><p>For Mr. Trump, the king’s invitation to Mr. Zelensky to visit him at Sandringham might take some of the shine off that gesture.</p><p>For Mr. Starmer, the crisis opens an opportunity to draw closer to Europe. He has long wanted to do that on the trade front, but has approached it gingerly because of the political sensitivities at home. The Labour Party does not want to lose its core working-class voters, many of whom favored Brexit, to the anti-immigration party, Reform U.K., which is led by Nigel Farage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nigel Farage, the leader of the Reform U.K. party.

Standing behind Ukraine and against Russian aggression also puts Mr. Farage, with his history of sympathy for Mr. Putin, in a tricky position.</p><p>Whether that will allow Mr. Starmer to reintegrate Britain’s economy and trade with that of the European Union is another question. Some analysts noted that the E.U. was in no rush to overhaul its existing trade agreement with Britain, which it views as beneficial to the Continent. Mr. Starmer’s political fortunes still depend on his government turning around Britain’s ailing economy.</p><p>“The country is in such a dire state that I don’t think Starmer will be rewarded for being an international statesman,” said Mr. Rahman, the analyst. “It’s an arguably dangerous thing for a prime minister to try to build political capital abroad when the domestic agenda isn’t moving in the direction he wants.”</p><p>Britain and the E.U. are currently negotiating a defense and security agreement, which analysts view as low-hanging fruit, compared with a revised trade deal. But even that risks becoming ensnared in horse-trading over other issues. Some European countries are seeking concessions from Britain on fishing rights and allowing young people from the E.U. to live and work in Britain.</p><p>“People realize they can no longer count on a nice Russia and a generous America, and that they have to get their act together on a number of issues, including defense and security,” said João Vale de Almeida, a former E.U. ambassador to the United States and Britain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The shock of Mr. Trump’s recent comments about Russia and Ukraine could remove roadblocks. The British, Mr. Vale de Almeida said, are being reminded that “they are more European than American in terms of what unites them to Europe and what unites them to America.”</p><p>Yet several hectic days of diplomacy have laid bare the challenge Europe faces in achieving unity. Britain struggled even to compile a manageable guest list for this meeting. After three Baltic nations, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, expressed frustration at being left off the list, given their proximity to Russia, Mr. Starmer held a call with their leaders on Sunday morning, before the other leaders arrived.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
