(That’s why many professional chefs spatchcock, deep-fry or, for more control, roast the bird in pieces.) Maybe it’s time to stop striving for that decades-old ideal. After all, <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/thanksgiving" title="">Thanksgiving</a> should be whatever you want it to be.</p><p>My challenge this year was a familiar one — as timeless as that Rockwell bird — but the solution (aside from starting with a smaller bird) had the potential to feel new, even exciting. How do you make something ordinarily boring and dry, for so many, taste suddenly juicy?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-6bdb4b00">Recipe: <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026240-dry-brined-thanksgiving-turkey-with-chiles" title="">Dry-Brined Thanksgiving Turkey With Chiles</a></h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The spice rub gives the turkey a deeply savory complex flavor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Malosh for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On a hot July day in the <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/" title="">New York Times Cooking</a> studio kitchen, my colleagues and I set out to find out, testing three different <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/278066-thanksgiving-turkey-recipes" title="">turkey</a> techniques: salting simply (the control), <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021473-turkey-brine" title="">wet brining</a> (in a saltwater solution) and <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012869-dry-brined-turkey" title="">dry brining</a> (salting a few days ahead). Then, we tasted eight breast portions, each prepared according to reader suggestions, to arrive at an effortlessly tender bird with immense flavor and unabashed wow factor.</p><p>What emerged was this deeply savory, chile-imbued bird roasted over a bed of fresh peppers. But in my research, I also uncovered a newfound respect for the beauty of a <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015474-simple-roast-turkey" title="">perfectly roasted bird</a>, carved and laid out on a table with all its lush, savory trimmings. That such a bounty could come from one offering — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/dining/turkey-hunting-minnesota.html" title="">a distinctly American game bird</a> — is a gift. You might as well put your all into it. Here’s how:</p><h3 id="link-4b1d1a12"><span>1. Dry-brine the bird, then relax.</span></h3><p>In 2006, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-nov-15-fo-calcook15-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russ Parsons of The Los Angeles Times</a> wrote that the best way to roast a turkey whole was to first dry-brine it, which is just a fancy way of saying it should be salted in advance — ideally two or three days before cooking.</p><p>This gives the salt time to draw out the bird’s moisture, which then dissolves the salt on the skin’s surface and gets pulled back into the meat through a process called <a href="https://bio.libretexts.org/Learning_Objects/Worksheets/Biology_Tutorials/Diffusion_and_Osmosis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diffusion</a>.</p><p>When such a bird is roasted, its muscle fibers are better able to hold onto moisture, meaning the cooked turkey will be beyond juicy and well seasoned, with an aged, concentrated flavor and a tempered gaminess.</p><p>After all my tests, I am beyond confident that the longer you salt your bird (up to three days maximum), the juicier the meat, the crisper the skin, the more perfect the turkey. I noticed a huge difference between a three-day dry-brined turkey and a two-day dry-brined turkey. But similarly, there’s a notable contrast between a turkey that’s been salted, then immediately roasted, and one salted just a day in advance. (The longer-brined bird tastes way better.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h3 id="link-938bdb"><span>2. Make the spice rub (and relish its scent).</span></h3></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Toasting spices and chiles brings out their aroma.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Malosh for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The story of this turkey begins in 1990s Bahrain, where a young Niya Bajaj read about Thanksgiving at school — and persuaded her parents to cook an all-American feast (with local and imported ingredients cobbled together from the grocery store).</p><p>Since then, Ms. Bajaj, a 38-year-old holistic yoga therapist who lives in Toronto, has roasted many turkeys rubbed with a spice mixture of dried red chiles and mint, black peppercorns and cumin seeds, inspired by her family’s South Asian pantry. In the head-to-head taste tests of reader submissions back in July, her flavorings were the clear winner. No competition.</p><p>This recipe calls for dried bird’s-eye chiles, known particularly among Thai cooks who use them for their umami-accentuated pepperiness and, more important, their fruitiness. A subtle sweetness lingers with the heat, as well. But any small, potent dried pepper, such as chiles de árbol, Kashmiri chiles or even red-pepper flakes, would also work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As you toast the dried chiles and spices in a pan, be sure to breathe it all in (the smell alone is worth this extra step). Then, blitz everything to a nubbly, multicolored rubble and generously slather the turkey with it.</p><h3 id="link-10e425b8"><span>3. Roast the bird over peppers. Get a zero-effort side dish.</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The spice rub that coats the turkey also lends its fragrance to the vegetables under the bird.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Malosh for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Roasting the turkey over a mix of fresh peppers not only fortifies the dried chiles in the rub, it also produces a no-muss, no-fuss side dish and irresistibly fragrant pan juices, dynamite in a gravy.</p><p>Use whatever fresh peppers you can find and like to eat, such as Cubanelles, shishitos, poblanos, bells and jalapeños. Just be sure to warn your guests before they dive into the plate of turkey fat-confited chiles. Some blaze.</p><h3 id="link-1dd365f2"><span>4. Carve the bird on your terms.</span></h3><p>Don’t be a hero on Thanksgiving, attempting to publicly slice a hot bird after the mental, physical and culinary gymnastics of getting the whole dinner on the table. Instead, carve it in the shadows of your kitchen (and cover up any mistakes with fresh mint leaves, which taste cooling against the warmly spiced meat).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Or, roast the turkey to perfection well before your guests arrive, letting it rest for an hour for easier carving and juicier meat. After <a href="https://youtu.be/eUv1tq91NMY?si=45UNkFOXiqcutVup" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">carving</a> it, transfer the pieces to an oven-safe dish or platter. Ladle some of the pan drippings over the meat, cover and set aside at room temperature for up to two hours or in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours. When you’re ready to serve, reheat the pan in a low oven until warm, and look forward to some of the softest white meat you’ve ever had.</p><h3 id="link-61565c3f"><span>5. If you have 10 more minutes to spare, make a gravy.</span></h3><p>Most turkey <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/487038-thanksgiving-gravy-recipes" title="">gravies</a> exist to compensate for the meat’s dryness, but this one serves to extend this bird’s pepper-imbued flavor. Turns out, that bed of vegetables results in the most flavorful fat, which just needs a little flour and stock to become a stellar gravy.</p><h3 id="link-7bec19c4"><span>Bonus tip: Enjoy the moment.</span></h3><p>Each time I cooked through this recipe, calibrating the measurements and temperatures and techniques, I’d come to the end with a big sigh. Not just because I was getting ever closer to a delicious recipe, but because a whole turkey was a good reason to gather with friends, to eat and talk until the candle that lit our meal burned down to its holder.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-16"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Kim has been a food and cooking columnist for The Times since 2021.
