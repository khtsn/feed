A bull’s-eye centered over parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana and Kentucky is at risk for some of the most severe weather.</p><p>These storms will be capable of unleashing large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes, possibly some strong ones.</p><p>“I’d be surprised if we didn’t see some tornadoes in that corridor,” said Aaron Gleason, a meteorologist with the Storm Prediction Center.</p><h2 id="link-12b77b55">Here are the key things to know:</h2><ul><li><p>The risk on Friday generally stretches from eastern Texas into the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast.</p></li><li><p>By early afternoon, an area of the East Coast that includes southern New Jersey, Central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and Delaware had been under a rolling series of flash flood and tornado warnings.</p></li><li><p>Across parts of the middle Mississippi Valley and the Ohio Valley, the potential for severe weather will be greatest in the afternoon and the evening, with the storms expected to persist overnight.</p></li><li><p>On Thursday, at least 11 tornadoes spun up across the Upper Midwest, including one that was reported in Mayville, Wis., that damaged businesses and homes, forcing road closures and downing power lines, the authorities said. More than 300,000 customers in the region are still without power.</p></li></ul><p>“It’s a fairly broad area for severe potential, and it looks like all hazards could be possible,” Mr. Gleason said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-6068a6dc">Indiana, Kentucky and Missouri are expected to see major storms.</h2><p>The area of highest concerns includes Bloomington, Ind.; Evansville, Ind.; Louisville, Ky.; and St. Louis.</p><p>Those areas are at particular risk of supercells, highly organized, longer-lasting storms that produce even stronger winds and larger hail — in the case of Friday, bigger than baseballs — than typical thunderstorms.</p><p>“The same storms that produce very large hail are also the ones that we tend to be most concerned about from a tornado perspective,” Mr. Gleason said. “There are probably going to be a lot of storms and a lot of severe reports if things work out as forecast, unfortunately.”</p><p>The National Weather Service office in St. Louis warned of hail of nearly three inches in diameter, damaging winds and a “low chance of a strong tornado.” On Friday afternoon, St. Louis was under a tornado warning until just after 3 local time. (Warnings are issued after a tornado is spotted on a radar or a trained spotter sees a tornado, while watches mean the conditions to form a tornado are in place.)</p><p>“Parts of Kentucky particularly and southern Ohio will have the potential for multiple rounds of thunderstorms and each producing heavy rain,” said Richard Bann, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The threat of thunderstorms comes to the Midwest in a week marked by unseasonably warm weather. The heat is expected to continue on Friday, with many locations across the region forecast to record afternoon highs in the 80s and 90s. Lower temperatures are predicted to arrive this weekend as cooler, drier air sweeps in from the northwest.</p><h2 id="link-395c03fa">The Northeast had a taste of severe weather early in the day.</h2><p>On Friday afternoon, thunderstorms moved through an area that includes southern New Jersey, northern Delaware, northern Maryland and southeastern Pennsylvania. The area was put under a severe thunderstorm watch with the storms capable of delivering hail as big as limes and winds up to 70 miles per hour. Flash-flood warnings were issued across several areas, including Philadelphia and Trenton, N.J., and a few tornado warnings were in effect in southern New Jersey.</p><p>“It’ll be offshore in a matter of hours,” Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, said just before 1 p.m. Friday.</p><p>Another round was possible in the region in the later afternoon to early evening.</p><p>To the north in New York, rain was falling across much of the state with a few scattered thunderstorms. In New York City, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/weather/new-york-city-rain-may.html" title="">which has had an especially rainy May</a>, the chance for thunderstorms and showers is highest in the afternoon and evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="power-outages-2025-05-16-midwestthurs" data-id="100000010174826" data-source-id="100000010174826"><div slug="power-outages-2025-05-16-midwestthurs" data-sourceid="100000010174826" id="embed-id-100000010174826">

The number could increase as local Weather Service offices continue to investigate reports of tornadoes.</p><p>“It’s an active period and nothing unusual for May,” Mr. Gleason said. “This is typically when a lot of severe weather tends to occur across the country.”</p><p>Aimee Ortiz<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amy Graff is a Times reporter covering weather, wildfires and earthquakes.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
