But if you don’t want to follow the crowd, it’s also a good time to catch up on some terrific films you may have missed earlier in the year. I asked our chief film critic, Manohla Dargis, and our movie critic, Alissa Wilkinson, to recommend releases worth your time. All are in theaters or available online.</p><h2 id="link-46918323">‘Sinners’</h2><p><a href="https://www.sinnersmovie.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In theaters.</a></p><p><strong>The story:</strong> The twins Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan) return from Al Capone’s Chicago to open a juke joint in Clarksdale, Miss. That’s when the devil, or rather, an Irish vampire, shows up in this talker of a film.</p><p><strong>Manohla Dargis’s take:</strong> Directed by Ryan Coogler, this “is a big-screen exultation — a passionate, effusive praise song about life and love, including the love of movies. Set in Jim Crow Mississippi, it is a genre-defying, mind-bending fantasia overflowing with great performances, dancing vampires and a lot of ideas about love and history.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fernanda Torres in “I’m Still Here.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alile Onawale/Sony Pictures Classics</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>The story:</strong> Set in Brazil beginning in 1970, when a military dictatorship ruled the country, this drama follows the efforts of Eunice Paiva (Fernanda Torres) to keep her family together and still work as an activist after her congressman husband, Rubens Paiva, is arrested and disappeared by the authorities. Based on a true story, the film, directed by Walter Salles, won the Oscar for best international feature.</p><p><strong>Alissa Wilkinson’s take: </strong>“In her performance — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/movies/golden-globes-winners-2025.html" title="">won a Golden Globe</a> and [earned] an Oscar nomination — Torres stuns. Protecting her children means leaning into joy within the fear, hope in the midst of pain. Torres double-layers her performance with all of those emotions, and her searching eyes are magnetic.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Their love language is espionage: Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender in “Black Bag.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Claudette Barius/Focus Features</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>The story:</strong> Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender play married British intelligence agents who are each tasked with ferreting out a mole, who may possibly be their spouse in this Steven Soderbergh thriller.</p><p><strong>Dargis’s take:</strong> The film is “sleek, witty and lean to the bone, a fizzy, engaging puzzler about beautiful spies doing the sort of extraordinary things that the rest of us only read about in novels and — if we’re lucky — watch onscreen. It’s nonsense, but the kind of glorious grown-up nonsense that critics like to say <em>they</em> (as in Hollywood) no longer make.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/movies/black-bag-review-fassbender-blanchett.html" title=""><em>Read the review.</em></a></p><h2 id="link-42165380">‘Friendship’</h2><p><a href="https://tickets.friendship.movie/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In theaters</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tim Robinson, left, and Paul Rudd in “Friendship.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Spencer Pazer/A24</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><strong>The story:</strong> Tim Robinson plays Craig, a nice-enough guy with a wife and a house in the suburbs but no friends, until the cool new neighbor (Paul Rudd) moves in.
