Wiley, saying: “We the jury request instructions from Judge Wiley. At this time, we are unable to come to a unanimous vote on count one, manslaughter in the second degree.”</p><p>Justice Wiley responded by reading the jury a so-called Allen charge, official instructions for the jurors to resume their deliberations, with the goal of reaching an agreement through the reconsideration of differing opinions.</p><p>“It’s not uncommon for juries to believe they will never be able to reach a unanimous decision,” he said, adding: “I’ll ask you to continue deliberations on that count.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Justice Wiley said he had to decide if a unanimous agreement was impossible on the manslaughter charge before considering if the jury could move onto deliberating the second charge: criminally negligent homicide.</p><p>Prosecutors said Mr. Penny fatally choked the subway passenger, Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old former Michael Jackson impersonator who struggled with his mental health, when he held him in a chokehold for about six minutes on the floor of an F train in May of 2023.</p><p>In the instructions the jurors were given, they were told that they had to first consider the charge of manslaughter and come to an agreement. If they believed that Mr. Penny, a 26-year-old former Marine, was guilty, they would not need to consider the second charge.</p><p>It was unclear if jurors would be able to consider the second charge if they failed to reach an agreement on the first, and they were asking for instructions on Friday about what to do.</p><p>Upon receiving the jury’s note on Friday, Mr. Penny’s lawyer, Thomas A. Kenniff, argued that it would be “coercive” to ask the jurors to continue to deliberate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The defense position at this time is we are moving for mistrial,” Mr. Kenniff said. “The jury has been deliberating for roughly 20 hours, over four days, on what is in many ways a factually uncomplicated case.”</p><p>Dafna Yoran, an assistant district attorney, pushed back, calling it “crazy” to have a hung jury simply because jurors aren’t able to consider a second count.</p><p>“Jury deliberations are not intended to be easy, they’re difficult in every single case no matter how strong the evidence,” Justice Wiley told the jurors before sending them back out of the courtroom.</p><p>After the jury left, Justice Wiley told the parties that he was still trying to find the relevant case law to help him in making a decision about whether the jurors can deliberate on the second charge Mr. Penny faces if they fail to reach an agreement on the first.</p><p>The jurors have sent roughly 10 notes to Justice Wiley asking for readings of the relevant law, to see video and to have testimony read to them. On Wednesday, for example, jurors asked to hear earlier testimony from Dr. Cynthia Harris, a New York City medical examiner, in which they remembered her saying, “I don’t need all the facts.” She never actually said that, according to court transcripts, but the jurors’ question provided a small window into the elements of the case they were focusing on and had possibly come to an impasse over.</p><p>Soon after the jurors were sent back to continue deliberating on Friday, they sent Justice Wiley another note, this one asking for “further clarification in the determination of whether a person reasonably believes physical force to be necessary.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko">More about Hurubie Meko</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
