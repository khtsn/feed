All but Mr. Munder were already known to have died in captivity.</p><p>They were among about 250 people taken hostage last Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants crossed into Israel from Gaza and carried out attacks that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.</p><p>Israeli forces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/16/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-rescue-nuseirat.html" title="">have so far rescued only seven hostages alive</a>. Scores more, mostly women and children, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/08/14/admin/israel-hostages-released" title="">were returned to Israel</a> during a weeklong cease-fire last November. More than 100 captives still remain in Gaza, at least 30 of whom are believed to be dead.</p></div></div><div><div><figcaption><span>Photographs released by the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters show, clockwise from top left, Yagev Buchshtab, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Haim Peri, Nadav Popplewell and Yoram Metzger.</span></figcaption></div></div><div><div><p>Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, <a href="https://x.com/yoavgallant/status/1825803233001885968" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that the six bodies had been retrieved from Hamas tunnels beneath the city of Khan Younis in a “complex operation.”</p><p>The circumstances of the deaths of the six hostages were not immediately clear. A spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, Abu Ubaida, said in March that Mr. Metzger and Mr. Peri were among seven hostages who had been killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Hamas then said in May that Mr. Popplewell had died from injuries sustained in an Israeli airstrike more than a month before.</p><p>Weeks later, the Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-dead-hamas-gaza.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">said</a> that it was examining the possibility that the three hostages had been killed while Israeli forces were operating in the Khan Younis area.</p><p>The retrieval of the bodies came as Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken continued a diplomatic push in the region for a cease-fire deal that would see hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Frustration has grown in Israel over the months of halting negotiations, and family members of the hostages still in Gaza have led regular protests demanding a deal to secure their freedom.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has blamed Hamas for obstructing a deal. Mr. Netanyahu’s critics in Israel, as well as Hamas officials, say that Mr. Netanyahu recently added new conditions to a proposal outlined by President Biden in late May, adding to the difficulty of finalizing a deal.</p><p>“Our hearts grieve over the terrible loss,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday following the military’s announcement about the retrieval of the bodies. “The State of Israel will continue to make every effort to return all of our hostages — the living and the deceased.”</p><p>Mr. Munder, 79, Mr. Peri, 80, Mr. Metzger, 80, and Mr. Dancyg, 75, were all abducted alive on Oct. 7 from Nir Oz, a kibbutz, or communal village, near the Gaza border. Mr. Popplewell, 51, and Mr. Buchshtab, 35, were taken from another border community, Nirim.</p><p>Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner">More about Isabel Kershner</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Gaza Cease-Fire Talks:</strong> Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Israel had accepted a Biden administration proposal to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/middleeast/israel-cease-fire-proposal-hamas-blinken.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-middle-east-crisis&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">bridge some remaining differences with Hamas</a> on a cease-fire deal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israel-Lebanon Tensions:</strong> An Israeli airstrike hit a factory in a small town in southern Lebanon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/world/middleeast/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-strike-cease-fire.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-middle-east-crisis&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">killing at least 10 civilians</a>, Lebanese officials said.
