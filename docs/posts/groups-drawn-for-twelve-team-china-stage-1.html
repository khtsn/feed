		<p>The groups for Stage 1 of league play in VCT China have been <a href="https://x.com/valesports_cn/status/1883146389439606997?t=-_SJDRN5kDXHkTz8vc-fuQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank">drawn</a>, splitting the 12 teams of the region in half by their placement at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2275/champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">China Kickoff</a>. </p>

<p>The groups are:</p>

<p>Group Alpha:</p>



<p>Group Omega:</p>



<p>The top four teams of each group will qualify for the Stage 1 playoffs. The top three teams from the playoffs will qualify for Masters Toronto. Groups will be re-drawn before Stage 2.</p>

<p>In 2024, VCT regions had just 11 teams, resulting in groups having six and five teams respectively. With the addition of their respective Ascension champions, regions have expanded to 12 teams, meaning groups now have six teams each. Dragon Ranger Gaming and Xi Lai Gaming, the 2023 and 2024 Ascension champions, respectively, will be looking to build toward qualification for Champions 2025 as they look to retain their spot in VCT.</p>

<p>Before Stage 1 kicks off, EDG and Trace will compete at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>. While they prepare for the year&#39;s first international tournament, the rest of the region will prepare for and compete in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2339/china-evolution-series-act-1/main-event" target="_blank">China Evolution Series: Act 1</a>, a twelve-team single-elimination tournament. EDG and Trace will field non-starting rosters at this event.</p>
