Bogotá, according to his party.</p><p>The shooting of the senator, Miguel Uribe Turbay, by unknown perpetrators comes amid escalating political tension in the country as the country’s leftist president, Gustavo Petro, tries to pass a labor reform opposed by Mr. Uribe and other conservatives.</p><p>Conflict between armed groups also continues to plague the country, though it has taken place mostly in the countryside.</p><p>Mr. Uribe’s condition and a motive for the shooting were not immediately clear.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/CeDemocratico/status/1931495640686887301/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a statement</a>, his party, the Democratic Center, called the event “an unacceptable act of violence.”</p></div></div><div

added.</p><p>President Petro also <a href="https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1931500641194479719" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed his concern</a> on social

Videos recorded in the same location shortly afterward show Mr. Uribe bleeding from the head while bystanders compress the wound and then carry him away.</p><p>Mr. Uribe had declared his intention to seek his party’s nomination in next year’s presidential election. He was not considered a leading candidate.</p><p>One suspect had been detained as of Saturday at 8 p.m. local time, according to Pedro Sánchez, the defense minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We are checking to see if there are any other people involved,” <a href="https://x.com/pedrosanchezcol/status/1931513808243118157?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Sánchez said on X</a>, offering a reward of up to 3 billion Colombian pesos, or $730,000, for any information leading to the capture of the perpetrators.</p><p>He said that he had ordered the military, the national police and intelligence agencies “to deploy all their capabilities to urgently clarify the facts,” and that he would soon hold a meeting to determine a strategy moving forward.</p><p>“This attack pains us,” he added. “It mobilizes us to redouble our efforts to protect life, guarantee free political participation, and deliver justice.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p><p>Simón Posada<!-- --> and <!-- -->Devon Lum<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Genevieve Glatsky is a reporter for The Times, based in Bogotá, Colombia.</p></div><div><p>Julie Turkewitz is the Andes Bureau Chief for The Times, based in Bogotá, Colombia, covering Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
