Americans heard and were, like, ‘You can do whatever you want with wine; just don’t mess with our gummies.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“That’s a lot — almost enough to make you feel bad for people who buy champagne and wine.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“People buying champagne and wine were, like, ‘What’s next, caviar and truffles?’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“The E.U. said, ‘Oh, yeah? We’re going to put a 50 percent tariff on boats, bourbon and motorbikes from the United States,’ which is interesting because boats, bourbon and motorbikes — they’re specifically targeting Kid Rock for some reason.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“That is going to make it so much harder for European men to have a midlife crisis. You can’t outrun your mortality on a Vespa!” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Trump’s playing a dangerous game. Nobody wants to attend a Mike’s Hard Lemonade and cheese party, you know what I’m saying?” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“So get ready to toast the next New Year’s with America’s finest sparkling beverage, Champagne Code Red.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-4833f6ba">The Punchiest Punchlines (Wheels Off Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“Tesla owners are facing backlash everywhere they go. Recently, somebody stole the wheels from every single Tesla in a Texas parking lot. Whoever did it, I do not condone this, but I do appreciate your ‘tire-less’ efforts.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Now, I want to be clear: I do not condone violence or vandalism of any kind. That is a deeply held belief of mine that comes from the bottom of my CBS legal department.&#34; <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“With that in mind, I find it interesting that there’s a growing trend of Cybertrucks being vandalized and used as skate ramps or covered in garbage. To be fair, that might not be vandalism; that might just be a simple mistake, because they do look a lot like a dumpster.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“Only 35 percent of Americans have a positive view of Elon Musk. Fifty-three percent view him negatively, and 12 percent felt it would be inappropriate to respond because they are currently pregnant with one of his children.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Driving a Tesla used to mean you were a big-city, green juice-drinking, yoga liberal. Now, nobody knows what it means.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Maybe this is all a ruse. Elon somehow tricked MAGA into driving electric cars. Maybe he really is a genius.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Stephen Colbert gave the actor Gary Oldman a list of forbidden words for network television before their interview on Thursday&#39;s “Late Show.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ayo Edebiri plays a magazine journalist on an unusual assignment in “Opus.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Kooris/A24</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Mark Anthony Green, a former GQ style columnist, has written and directed his first feature: “Opus,” a horror film <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/movies/opus-review.html" title="">starring Ayo Edebiri and John Malkovich</a>.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
