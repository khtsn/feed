When I looked at that — I said, that’s the way it was meant to be.” “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale.” “That’s true.” “We’re sitting in one right now. Buckingham Palace that you visited as well.” “That’s true.” “And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign, last several months, it’s not for sale. It won’t be for sale, ever. But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.” “It’s only time. But I say, never say never. I’ve had many, many things that were not doable, and they ended up being doable and only doable in a very friendly way. But if it’s to everybody’s benefit, Canada loves us and we love Canada. That’s I think the No. 1 thing that’s important. But we’ll see. I mean over time, we’ll see what happens.” “Respectfully, Canadians’ view on this is not going to change on the 51st state. Secondly, we are the largest client of the United States in the totality of all the goods. So we are the largest client of the United States. We have a tremendous auto sector between the two of us, and the changes that made have been helpful. You know, 50 percent of a car that comes from Canada is American. That’s not like anywhere else in the world. And to your question about is there one thing? No, this is a bigger discussion. There are much bigger forces involved. And this will take some time and some discussions. And that’s why we’re here.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/06vid-trump-carney-pkg-cov-hqtk/06vid-trump-carney-pkg-cov-hqtk-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">President Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney, Canada’s newly elected leader, went back and forth on the prospect of the U.S. making Canada the 51st state.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p><time datetime="2025-05-06T16:36:16-04:00"><span>May 6, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>4:36 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada had one key goal in his high-stakes meeting with President Trump on Tuesday. He needed to say, in no uncertain terms, that Canada is not going to become the 51st U.S. state, while avoiding a public fight.</p><p>And he succeeded.</p><p>“As you know from real estate, there are some places that are not for sale,” Mr. Carney said solemnly. “It’s not for sale. It won’t be for sale, ever,” he added.</p><p>“Never say never,” Mr. Trump replied. But the moment’s potency had been defused, and Mr. Trump clearly was not interested in having a fight with Mr. Carney, whom he praised for his stunning electoral victory just a few days ago.</p><p>The relationship between the neighbors, allies and top trading partners has been at a historic low since Mr. Trump’s re-election because of his decision to impose tariffs on Canadian goods and his constant refrain that he wants to make Canada part of the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Less than an hour before Mr. Carney arrived at the White House, Mr. Trump unloaded on Canada in a bellicose post on Truth Social, repeating his frequent criticisms that the country was too dependent on the United States.</p><p>“We don’t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship, which hopefully we will always maintain,” Mr. Trump wrote. “They, on the other hand, need EVERYTHING from us!”</p><p>But Mr. Trump struck a much more conciliatory tone once the two leaders sat down in the Oval Office. Mr. Trump congratulated Mr. Carney on his election, praising his campaign as “one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics.” (He did not mention that Mr. Carney had won on an anti-Trump platform).</p><p>“We have some tough points to go over, and that’ll be fine,” Mr. Trump said.</p><h2 id="link-29f1f7b5">Not Getting Zelensky-ed</h2><p>As the public portion came to a close, Mr. Trump contrasted this meeting with the disastrous one that Mr. Carney took pains not to replicate: the Oval Office meeting in February between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p><p>“We had another little blow up with somebody else,” Mr. Trump said. “That was a much different. This is, this is a very friendly conversation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Over the course of a half-hour meeting in front of the cameras, Mr. Carney spoke just three times after delivering his opening remarks. Mr. Trump dominated the airtime, mostly with comments that veered off topic. For example, he criticized former President Barack Obama over the delays in constructing his presidential library, baselessly blaming it on Mr. Obama’s preference for diversity in hiring. He also assailed Gov. Gavin Newsom of California over the state’s high-speed rail project, calling it “the worst cost overrun I have ever seen.”</p><p>He also teased a “very, very big announcement,” though he declined to provide any details beyond saying he would make it in the coming days. Mr. Carney took an opportunity to use humor to improve the mood, something he does often: “Mr. President, I’m at the edge of my seat,” he said with a smile.</p><p>Mr. Trump also announced the United States would stop bombing the Houthi militia in Yemen because the group said it did not want to fight anymore. (Oman’s foreign minister later posted on social media that the country had mediated a cease-fire between the Houthis and the United States.)</p><h2 id="link-24d5e549">Flattery and Preparation</h2><p>Mr. Carney’s ability to survive his first public interaction Mr. Trump relatively unscathed came down to intense preparation — something Mr. Carney is known for from his central banking days — and learning lessons from Mr. Trump’s previous meetings with foreign leaders.</p><p>He started off by flattering Mr. Trump.</p><p>“You are a transformational president, focused on the economy, with a relentless focus on the American worker, security, borders, ending the scourge of fentanyl and other opioids, and securing the world,” Mr. Carney said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He then took care to choose the moment to deliver his rebuke of Mr. Trump’s 51st-state talk, and he spoke firmly but not aggressively when he did so.</p><p>Mr. Carney was also spared interventions from Mr. Trump’s top officials.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance and the other top American officials stayed largely quiet during the meeting, unlike the contentious encounter with Mr. Zelensky, during which Mr. Vance berated the Ukrainian leader.</p><p>And the Canadian prime minister clearly benefited from Mr. Trump’s thinking more highly of him than he does of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau. Mr. Trump and Mr. Trudeau had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/10/world/canada/g-7-justin-trudeau-trump.html" title="">a public falling out in 2018</a>, and the relationship never recovered. Mr. Trump’s lasting animus toward Mr. Trudeau was again on display on Tuesday, with Mr. Trump referring to him as “Governor Trudeau.”</p><h2 id="link-4983243e">No Breakthroughs</h2><p>After their public remarks in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump and Mr. Carney went on to a private working lunch, flanked by some of their top advisers and ministers. That is most likely where the substantive conversation about the future of the relationship between the two countries would happen, although there were no expectations that a breakthrough would be reached in Tuesday’s meeting.</p><p>Canada and the United States share, together with Mexico, a free-trade agreement that now lies in tatters; Mr. Trump has said that trade with Canada overly favors Canada and hurts the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Carney said that the discussions between the two of them would take time, and would extend well beyond trade issues to encompass other areas, such as security and defense.</p><p>Despite the more harmonious tone, and Mr. Carney’s intention to open substantive talks during the luncheon, Mr. Trump made clear he was not changing his mind on tariffs with Canada.</p><p>The U.S. has applied a 25 percent tariff on Canadian goods that are not covered by the trilateral free-trade agreement between the two countries and Mexico, as well as steel and aluminum exports, and a 10 percent tariff on energy and potash exports. While many important goods, such as auto parts, have been exempted, the tariffs are still having a significant effect on the Canadian economy.</p><p>Canada has retaliated by imposing tariffs of its own on American goods, standing as the only country besides China to do so.</p><p>Mr. Trump told reporters he did not think Tuesday’s talks would lead to policy changes.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matina Stevis-Gridneff is the Canada bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the country.</p></div><div><p>Tyler Pager is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>States Sue Administration Over H.H.S.</strong><strong>:</strong> The lawsuit, led by New York, argues that the slashing of grants and staff at the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/states-lawsuit-trump-administration-hhs-cutbacks.html">amounts to the “illegal dismantling” of the agency.</a></p></li><li><p>‘<strong>Canada Is Not for Sale’</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>President Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada, in the first meeting between the two leaders, sparred over the president’s talk of making Canada the 51st state.
