Its second spacecraft, named Resilience, launched in January and has been taking a roundabout path to the moon, entering orbit last month.</p><p>Resilience is now ready to descend to the lunar surface, and Ispace hopes that it will arrive there intact.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-6d6162d8">When is the moon landing, and how can I watch it?</h2><p>Resilience, also known as the Hakuto-R Mission 2 lander, is scheduled to land at 3:17 p.m. Eastern time Thursday. (It will be Friday at the company’s mission control in Tokyo.)</p><p>Ispace is providing <a href="http://www.ispace-inc.com/landing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live coverage of the landing</a> with English simultaneous translation, which you can watch in the video player embedded above.</p><h2 id="link-6140d2f8">What is Ispace, and what happened during its last moon mission?</h2><p>Ispace emerged from a Japanese team that had aimed to win the Google Lunar X Prize, which offered $20 million for the first privately financed venture to land on the moon. None of the X Prize teams got off the ground before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/science/google-lunar-x-prize-moon.html" title="">the competition expired in 2018</a>. Takeshi Hakamada, the leader of the Japanese X Prize team, raised private financing to push forward and is the chief executive of Ispace.</p><p>The first Ispace mission aimed to land in the middle of Atlas Crater, a 54-mile-wide depression in the northeast quadrant on the near side of the moon. But Ispace lost contact with the lander during its final descent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The packed-up lander ready for encapsulation in a white clean room." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b93156ce-c731-5ed3-be39-f14f08f426d0" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Resilience lunar lander before its Jan. 15 launch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">ispace, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>That spacecraft was originally supposed to land at Lacus Somniorum, a flat plain. It turned out that Ispace had embarrassingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/science/moon-crash-japan-ispace.html" title="">not adequately updated the spacecraft’s navigation software</a> when it changed the landing site to Atlas Crater. The software was confused as the lander passed over the two-mile-high crater rim and erroneously concluded that it was closer to the ground than it actually was.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The spacecraft was still about three miles above the surface when it thought it should be touching down. It then exhausted its propellant and plunged to its destruction, slamming into Atlas Crater at more than 200 miles per hour.</p><h2 id="link-15dfb782">Where will Resilience land?</h2><p>Resilience is not heading back to Atlas Crater, although the landing site is in roughly the same neighborhood — on the near side of the moon in the northern hemisphere.

Instead, they are meant to help strengthen the United States government’s position that while no nation on Earth can claim sovereignty of the moon or other parts of the solar system under the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, nations and companies can own and profit from what they extract from the moon.</p><p>Resilience and Tenacious are also designed to operate for about two weeks, until the sun sets at the end of the lunar day.</p><h2 id="link-7ae4dd28">Why is there a little red house bolted to the back of the rover?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A little red model house created by the artist Mikael Genberg attached to Resilience.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ispace Mission 2, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Tenacious rover is carrying a project called Moonhouse by a Swedish artist, Mikael Genberg — a miniature model of a small red Swedish house.</p><p>“It is nothing really on Earth,” Mr. Genberg said Wednesday during a news conference. “It is small, and it is really insignificant. But on the moon, it will be a monument. It will be the only colorful thing on the moon.”</p><p>(The colors of spacecraft are typically limited to a palette of white, black, gold and silver. The engineering team for Moonhouse had to develop a special space-certified red paint.)</p><p>Mr. Genberg worked for 25 years on the notion of putting something familiar in a most unfamiliar environment. “I had the idea that the thing that really would create perspective would be a red house on the surface of the moon,” he said.</p><p>The rover is to be deployed from the lander a couple of days after landing. It will drop the house — which measures about 4.7 inches long, 3.1 inches wide and 3.9 inches high — onto the surface, and then drive around to take some pictures of it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-d092ffe">What else has landed on the moon this year?</h2><p>Resilience <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/science/nasa-spacex-launch-lunar-landers.html" title="">shared a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket</a> with another lunar lander, Blue Ghost from Firefly Aerospace of Cedar Park, Texas.</p><p>The Blue Ghost spacecraft, financed by NASA, took a quicker path to the moon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/science/blue-ghost-firefly-mission-1-moon-landing.html" title="">landing on March 2</a>, and completed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/21/science/blue-ghost-moon-landing.html" title="">an almost flawless two-week mission</a>.</p><p>Another NASA-financed lander, by Intuitive Machines of Houston, landed on the moon a few days later, but toppled over.
