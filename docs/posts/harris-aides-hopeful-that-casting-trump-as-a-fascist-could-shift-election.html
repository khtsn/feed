Trump as a fascist</a> — paired with an expansive battleground-state operation and strength among female voters still energized by the end of federal abortion rights — will carry Ms. Harris to a narrow triumph. Even some close to Mr. Trump worry that the push to label him a budding dictator who has praised Hitler could move small but potentially meaningful numbers of persuadable voters.</p><p>Officials within the Harris campaign and people with whom they have shared candid assessments believe she remains in a solid position in the Northern “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, saying internal polling shows her slightly ahead in all three — though by as little as half a percentage point.</p><p>They think she remains competitive across the four Sun Belt battleground states. Arizona and North Carolina appear to be the toughest swing states for Ms. Harris, these Democrats said, and they feel better about Georgia and Nevada.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s aides, for their part, believe that he can win at least one of the blue wall states, and that he remains competitive in all three. They are particularly hopeful about Pennsylvania, where members of his team say internal data shows him ahead, albeit within the margin of error. Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers are far more openly bullish, telling allies that he could sweep the seven battleground states. </p><p>This article is based on interviews with more than two dozen political strategists, campaign aides, pollsters and others close to the two campaigns and candidates, many of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.</p><p>Few Democrats dispute that the race appears extraordinarily competitive: Never in modern presidential campaigns have so many states been so tight this close to Election Day. Polling averages show that all seven battleground states are within the margin of error, meaning the difference between a half-point up and a half-point down — essentially a rounding error — could win or lose the White House.</p><p>The tempered sense of Democratic confidence follows a period of high anxiety in the party as polls tightened in recent weeks. But now Ms. Harris and other party leaders have begun to discard their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/us/politics/harris-democrats-trump.html" title="">winking warnings</a> that she is the underdog.</p><p>“Make no mistake: We will win,” she said at a rally on Sunday in Philadelphia. “We will win because if you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump, too, is broadcasting that he is marching toward victory. He has planned rallies over the final weekend before Election Day in New Mexico and Virginia, two comfortably Democratic states where polling averages show him trailing by at least six points.</p><p>A packed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/27/us/harris-trump-election" title="">nearly six-hour Trump rally</a> at Madison Square Garden in New York City on Sunday night provided a vivid illustration of how he is leaning into his base as Ms. Harris courts moderate Republicans. Speaker after speaker promised that Mr. Trump would take back the White House, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/politics/trump-hinchcliffe-msg.html?smid=url-share" title="">mixing in racist and misogynistic remarks</a>, vulgar insults and profanity-laden comments to appeal to his most faithful supporters.</p><p>“The United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer,” Mr. Trump told tens of thousands of cheering fans gathered in the deeply Democratic city. “Nine days from now will be liberation day in America.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Donald J. Trump has held a series of events in blue states, including his rally on Sunday night at Madison Square Garden in New York. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The former president is ending the race much as he has all his campaigns, with promises to stop what he falsely says is a flood of undocumented migrants who are taking American jobs, raising housing prices and causing a crime wave. Even as Democrats call him fascist, he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-democracy-threats.html" title="">escalated threats</a> to prosecute and jail his political opponents, whom he calls “the enemy within.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Harris’s aides believe the argument tying Mr. Trump to fascism is helping her sway moderate Republicans, even though the leading super PAC supporting her bid has raised worries that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/politics/harris-trump-campaign-fascism.html" title="">it is not Democrats’ most effective message</a>. Democratic officials emphasize that they have won — or overperformed — in a wide range of contests since 2016 by painting the former president as divisive.</p><p>And some of Mr. Trump’s advisers are concerned that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html" title="">the warnings from John F. Kelly</a>, his former White House chief of staff, that the former president made admiring statements about Hitler while in office could break through with undecided Jewish voters, potentially hurting him in Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p><p>Both campaigns also see reasons for trepidation within <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/harris-trump-election-gender.html" title="">the election’s significant gender gap</a>. While Ms. Harris leads with female voters, largely because of abortion rights, some Democrats fear she will not win over enough women to compensate for an expected deficit with men. And some of Mr. Trump’s advisers worry that abortion rights will remain a mobilizing force for Democrats even two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.</p><p>For all his bravado in public, Mr. Trump is privately cranky and stressed, according to three people in contact with him, with a schedule marked by chronic lateness. Ms. Harris, aides say, is energized by her crowds, particularly the 30,000 supporters who watched her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/harris-beyonce-rally-houston.html" title="">discuss abortion rights at a rally featuring Beyoncé</a> on Friday in Houston.</p><p>And Ms. Harris’s running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who predicted Democratic defeat in 2016, has told people privately that he would rather be in their position than in Mr. Trump’s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“In 10 days, we beat him at the ballot box,” Mr. Walz said at an event on Saturday night in Phoenix. He added, “I’m a super optimistic person.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A volunteer with Ms. Harris’s campaign knocking on doors this month in Milwaukee.

But she has largely refused to separate herself from the Biden administration, which remains broadly unpopular.</p><p>On Tuesday in Washington, she will deliver what aides are billing as a closing argument at the Ellipse, where Mr. Trump rallied the crowd that eventually stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>“The most powerful force in our politics since 2018 has been fear and opposition to MAGA, and it sure looks like it will be again,” said Simon Rosenberg, a strategist who was one of a handful of Democrats who correctly predicted the party’s overperformance in the 2022 midterms. “What is likely to happen in this election is that Trump will end up underperforming his polls.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Some of Democrats’ assurance stems from their campaign’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/us/elections/harris-trump-campaign-finance.html" title="">sizable financial advantage</a> and what they believe is their superior field operation. In the final weeks, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/us/politics/trump-harris-campaign-ground-game.html" title="">the campaign has dispatched an army of 2,500 staff members</a> across the battleground states, while the Trump campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/trump-voter-outreach-super-pacs.html" title="">has an untested strategy</a> that relies heavily on inexperienced super PACs and outside groups.</p><p>“We will win,” Gov. Tony Evers, Democrat of Wisconsin, said in an interview on Saturday from aboard a campaign bus. “We have a good ground game that’s going to carry us.”</p><p>In Michigan, union organizers have found a sunnier outlook for Ms. Harris than they expected when surveying their members. An internal United Auto Workers poll of the union’s members in battleground states found Ms. Harris with a five-point lead among white voters without a college degree, and a 13-point advantage among men without a college degree — striking results among types of voters she is not expected to win broadly.</p><p>While some party strategists are worried about the early-voting numbers in Nevada and Georgia, top officials in the Harris campaign say those figures are not as significant as they might seem. Their vote models suggest that Mr. Trump has successfully <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/trump-republicans-early-voting.html" title="">pushed many of his supporters to vote earlier</a>, effectively cannibalizing the strong turnout he has usually garnered on Election Day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“We feel very, very good about what we’re seeing for early vote,” Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, the Harris campaign chair, said in an interview on Sunday on MSNBC. “Those lower-propensity voters that don’t always vote, they’re tuning in, and they’re showing up at a higher level in support of the vice president.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Harris at her rally on Saturday in Kalamazoo, Mich. Union organizers in the state have found a sunnier outlook for her than they expected when surveying their members. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s aides dispute this analysis, saying they are pleased with their improvement in early voting. Their campaign is focusing its final efforts on what aides believe is a small fraction of undecided voters — largely younger men — who could be persuaded to support the former president.</p><p>Democrats are somewhat resigned about their weakness among Michigan’s Arab American voters, who remain furious about U.S. support for Israel’s war in Gaza.</p><p>Another area of concern for Democrats is the fate of their senators in several battleground states. Senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin were both polling well ahead of Ms. Harris until recent weeks. Now they are also locked in tossup races for their political survival.</p><p>And Democrats, even at the top levels of the Harris campaign, worry that the party is not correctly modeling the electorate in its polling, repeating a misstep that led Mr. Biden’s campaign aides to overestimate his strength in the final days of the 2020 race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Any minor endorsement or shift in movement has Democrats jittery. When Terrelle Pryor, a well-known former professional football player from Jeannette, Pa., posted an Instagram story last week of his ballot filled out for Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates, Pennsylvania Democrats privately passed around a screenshot and anxiously wondered if they were losing ground with Black men.</p><p>“The smallest thing could alter the outcome,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior aide to President Barack Obama. “It could be the weather in Waukesha County, a voting machine screw-up in Fulton County, Ga., or the vibes the last few days.”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Kellen Browning<!-- --> from Phoenix, <!-- -->Jonathan Swan<!-- --> from Washington, <!-- -->Shane Goldmacher<!-- --> from New York, and <!-- -->Erica L.
