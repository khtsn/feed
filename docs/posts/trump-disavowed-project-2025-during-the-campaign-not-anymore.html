Trump swore he had “nothing to do with” a <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">right-wing policy blueprint</a> known as Project 2025 that would overhaul the federal government, even though many of those involved in developing the plans were his allies.</p><p>Mr. Trump even described many of the policy goals as “absolutely ridiculous.” And during his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he said he was “not going to read it.”</p><p>Now, as he plans his agenda for his return to the White House, Mr. Trump has recruited at least a half dozen architects and supporters of the plan to oversee key issues, including the federal budget, intelligence gathering and his promised plans for mass deportations.</p><p>The shift, his critics say, is not exactly a surprise. Mr. Trump disavowed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/us/politics/trump-plans-2025.html" title="">900-page</a> manifesto when polls showed it was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-project-2025-broadly-known-severely-unpopular-voters-rcna172660" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extremely unpopular</a> with voters. Now that he has won a second term, they say, he appears to be brushing those concerns aside.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“President-elect Trump has dropped all pretense and is charging ahead hand in hand with the right-wing industry players shaping an agenda he denied for the whole campaign,” said Tony Carrk, the executive director of Accountable.US, a watchdog group that has been tracking Mr. Trump’s cabinet picks with ties to the project.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/10/autossell/Jonathan-Swan-Thumb/Jonathan-Swan-Thumb-verticalTwoByThree735.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A set of conservative policy proposals called Project 2025 has put into words what a second term for Donald J.

Vought, one of the authors of Project 2025</a>, to lead the powerful Office of Management and Budget. In choosing Mr. Vought, Mr. Trump will have someone who views the position as far more expansive than just overseeing the budget.</p><p>Mr. Vought wrote in Project 2025 that the person picked for the job should view themselves as an “approximation of the president’s mind,” while establishing a reputation of the keeper of “commander’s intent.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the report, Mr. Vought wrote that the incoming administration should overhaul executive branch institutions, such as the National Security Council and National Economic Council to align with Mr. Trump’s agenda, while abolishing White House offices for domestic climate policy and gender policy.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/trump-project-2025.html" title="">Mr. Trump tried to distance</a> himself from his former staffers like Mr. Vought, who also served as budget chief during his first term. Democrats were ramping up attacks that tied Mr. Trump to Project 2025 as voters grew unsettled by its promises to amass power in the executive branch.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Democrats made defeating Project 2025 a large part of their message at their convention in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I have no idea who is behind it,” Mr. Trump said on social media in July, despite his ties to former staffers like Mr. Vought.</p><p>In a statement this week, Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, argued Mr. Trump “never had anything to do” with Project 2025.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“All of President Trump’s cabinet nominees and appointments are wholeheartedly committed to President Trump’s agenda, not the agenda of outside groups,” Ms. Leavitt said.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html" title="">tapped Stephen Miller to be his deputy chief of staff for policy and Thomas Homan</a> to be a “border czar,” positions that do not require Senate confirmation.
