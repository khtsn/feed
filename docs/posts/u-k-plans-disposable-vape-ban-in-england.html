Even when sent to recycling facilities, the government said, the products usually needed to be disassembled by hand, and the batteries posed a fire risk to workers in the waste industry.</p><p>“Single-use vapes are extremely wasteful and blight our towns and cities,” Mary Creagh, an environment minister, said in the statement, adding that the initiative was part of an effort to combat Britain’s “throwaway culture.”</p><p>Similar prohibitions are being planned in Scotland and Wales, and the government said it was working to align the dates in 2025 at which the measures will come into force. The idea of banning disposable vapes in England was first announced in January by the previous government but was not put into action before the general election in July.</p><p>John Dunne, the director general of the U.K. Vaping Industry Association, criticized the decision to proceed with the ban, arguing that it would lead to an increase in illegal sales. He called instead for a licensing initiative for retailers and distributors to ensure that vapes were not sold to minors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“Bans are not the answer, as we’ve seen in other parts of the world, such as Australia, as they will only boost the black market, which will pose significant risks to young people and the environment,” he said in a statement. “What’s needed is greater enforcement of current laws in place which make it a legal requirement for vape traders not to sell to children under the age of 18 and to comply with environmental legislation.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vaping products for sale at a store in London in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tolga Akmen/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It is already illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone under 18 in Britain.

But government ministers in Britain have long been concerned by the appeal to children of single-use vapes, partly because of the products’ packaging and the way they are marketed.</p><p>The number of young people who vape without having previously smoked cigarettes has increased markedly, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20jeey047xo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to researchers</a>.</p><p>If Parliament approves the ban, businesses in England will have until June 1 to sell any remaining stock they hold.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephen-castle">More about Stephen Castle</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Alone in the Dark: </strong>In Bangladesh’s secret underground prison, political captives were pushed to the brink of insanity and death. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/asia/bangladesh-disappeared.html">Some are telling their stories</a> now that the woman who put them there, Sheikh Hasina, is gone.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Panda Factories: </strong>In the 1990s, China began sending pandas to foreign zoos to be bred, in the hope that future generations could be released into nature. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/15/world/asia/pandas-zoo-breeding-death-captivity.html">It hasn’t gone as planned</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving Democracy or Hurting It?: </strong>Brazil’s Supreme Court expanded its power to protect democracy in the country.
