href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/politics/trump-shooting-golf-course.html" title="">apparently plotting to assassinate</a> former President Donald J. Trump at one of his Florida golf courses on Sunday appeared to tell Iran in a rambling self-published book last year that it was “free to assassinate Trump.”</p><p>The self-aggrandizing book, titled “Ukraine’s Unwinnable War,” along with social media posts and other public statements from the suspect, Ryan W. Routh, reflected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/politics/trump-shooting-suspect-routh.html" title="">his intense desire</a> to fight for Ukraine. He also took a dim view of Mr. Trump, referring to him as a “fool,” “idiot” and “buffoon.”</p><p>“Democracy has dissolved quickly under our watch,” Mr. Routh wrote, describing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as a catastrophe “perpetrated by Donald Trump and his undemocratic posse.”</p><p>How Mr. Routh, a peripatetic activist and building contractor with an extensive criminal record, came to possess a semiautomatic rifle, learn of Mr. Trump’s weekend whereabouts and wait for him on the edge of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., remains unknown.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But a review of public records and Mr. Routh’s writings, as well as interviews with people who knew him, suggest that he saw himself as an active and influential participant in momentous world events, while becoming estranged from at least some of his family and nearly destitute in the process.</p><p>Mr. Routh has been a serial crusader for causes large and small dating back to at least 1996, when he campaigned against graffiti in Greensboro, N.C., where he lived for decades. In July, he urged President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on the social media platform X to visit the victims of the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in Butler, Pa., writing that “Trump will never do anything for them.”</p><p>“Show the world what compassion and humanity is all about,” Mr. Routh wrote on July 16.</p><p>In other social media posts, he tagged world leaders and celebrities like Elton John and Elon Musk, often providing his phone number and email as if expecting a response.</p><p>Mr. Routh appears to have spent much of his life in Greensboro, a city of about 300,000, though in recent years he had lived in Hawaii.</p><p>In December 2002, he was convicted of a felony for “possessing a weapon of mass death and destruction,” according to the criminal complaint. That year, he was arrested in Greensboro after barricading himself inside a building with a fully automatic weapon, according to a local newspaper and Tracy Fulk, a former Greensboro police officer who said she had pulled him over and spotted a gun in his truck before he fled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“He acted like he had some sort of mental health issues,” she recalled.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tracy Fulk, a retired Greensboro police officer, helped arrest Ryan Routh in 2002.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cornell Watson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Routh’s other criminal charges in North Carolina include possession of a stolen motor vehicle, possession of stolen goods and several driving violations.</p><p>Yet records show that he was a concerned citizen interested in local causes.</p><p>In the 1990s, he appeared in the pages of a local newspaper as a family man decorating his 1840s log cabin home for Halloween, and as a good Samaritan who won a “Law Enforcement Oscar” for chasing a suspected rapist in his neighborhood.</p><p>In 1996, a Greensboro newspaper published a letter from Mr. Routh decrying “the ever increasing amount of graffiti” in the city as a “constant reminder of the moral disintegration of our America.”</p><p>And two decades ago, he supported his teenage son’s efforts to establish a skate park in Guilford County, N.C., which includes Greensboro. Mr. Routh helped the teenagers get permission to use a piece of property owned by an oil company. One of the skaters, Will Milsun, now 36, recalled in an interview on Monday that Mr. Routh had shown the boys how to bend plywood to construct quarter pipes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Milsun said Mr. Routh was an active father who wanted his three children to be self-reliant and productive. Mr. Routh’s daughter ran a small business printing T-shirts. He wanted his skateboarding son to be “more involved in doing stuff for yourself, and to be productive,” Mr. Milsun said.</p><p>Mr. Milsun also worked alongside Mr. Routh’s son at Mr. Routh’s roofing company. He recalled about 70 employees and three project managers.</p><p>“I didn’t think he was really political,” Mr. Milsun said after learning of Mr. Routh’s arrest.</p><p>Mr. Routh’s social media posts suggest that he was a Trump supporter in 2016 but had turned against him by 2020. He voted in North Carolina’s Democratic primary this year, records show.</p><p>Relatives of Mr. Routh in North Carolina and Hawaii did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>This year, Mr. Routh and his daughter sold their “dilapidated” home in Greensboro for about $175,000, said David Hagaman, a real estate agent who helped his business associate buy the property.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>In Hawaii, Mr. Routh built storage units and tiny houses. Tomas Baggio, 32, credited Mr. Routh with quickly building him and his wife a 120-square-foot home in 2021 for $14,000, just a fraction of what other contractors had quoted them.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Routh was living in Kaaawa, Hawaii, in recent years.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marco Garcia for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“If it wasn’t for him, my wife and I wouldn’t have a place to live right now,” Mr. Baggio said.</p><p>Saili Levi, the owner of a vanilla farm, hired Mr. Routh to build what Mr. Levi called a small “shop on wheels” so he could more easily haul his products to farmer’s markets. Mr. Levi found Mr. Routh to be a “scattered” man who seemed unable to accept responsibility.</p><p>Mr. Levi said that Mr. Routh’s work was shoddy, and that after the two had verbally sparred about it Mr. Levi received an email full of cutting insults and references to Mr. Routh’s involvement in international conflicts.</p><p>“I spent 5 months in Ukraine last year,” Mr. Routh wrote, “and 3 months there this year, and 2 weeks in DC and 2 weeks in Taiwan this year volunteering and trying to supply thousands of Afghan soldiers to help win the war.”</p><p>“Perhaps I would be happier dead on the front lines than dealing with rich people in fancy cars as I drive old broken down vehicles and hoping to keep my account out of the negative and hoping for food to eat,” he added. “China and Russia will certainly win at this rate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Many of the 291 pages of Mr. Routh’s book are filled with graphically violent and bloody images of soldiers and civilians from a range of conflicts. In one convoluted passage, Mr. Routh apologized to Iran for Mr. Trump’s dismantling of the Obama administration’s nuclear deal, and then wrote “you are free to assassinate Trump.”</p><p>The Associated Press was the first to report on the book.</p><p>Weeks after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Mr. Routh posted on social media that he was willing to die for the cause and headed to Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, shortly after.</p><p>Not long after his arrival, Mr. Routh was told that he would be of no use on the frontline because of his age and lack of military experience, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/politics/trump-routh-ukraine-interview.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> last year. So he pivoted, hoping to recruit foreign fighters and set up tributes to those killed in battle.</p><p>Mr. Routh had set up a website called “Fight for Ukraine,” in which he explained how to travel there and join the Ukrainian army as a foreign fighter. For the better part of a year, his main focus was getting hundreds of Afghan soldiers, who had fled after their country’s government collapsed, to fight for Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Routh had lofty ideas, some of them illegal, when it came to accomplishing his plans, such as paying officials, forging documents and using U.S. military aircraft to fly Afghans into Poland.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>But he was dogged in his approach, according to one soldier who fought with Ukraine and helped officially recruit foreign fighters for Ukraine’s foreign legion.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of Palm Beach County, Fla., showed a photo of items belonging to the suspect during a news conference on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saul Martinez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The soldier, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive information, said that Mr. Routh often offered to provide recruits from the Middle East in exchange for a commission. He added that he was not aware of Mr. Routh getting any foreign fighters into Ukraine.</p><p>By the summer of 2023, Mr. Routh had become frustrated with Ukrainian demands and red tape, and his zeal turned into disillusionment and contempt.</p><p>“He started getting a bad taste in his mouth for Ukraine,” said David M. Edwards Jr., a retired U.S. Army ranger and founder of Project Exodus Relief, a group advocating the evacuation of U.S.-trained Afghan military members.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mr. Edwards connected Mr. Routh with several Afghan fighters who were trying to leave Kabul but noticed that “something was off,” he said. Ultimately, Mr. Routh left the Afghan fighters stranded halfway on their journey to Ukraine, with no support or money to return to Afghanistan, Mr. Edwards said.</p><p>But one former Afghan soldier, who was one of the first refugees that Mr. Routh had tried to help, stayed in touch until just days before Mr. Routh’s arrest in Florida on Sunday. The soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was afraid of reprisals, said that Mr. Routh was living out of the back of his car. In a WhatsApp message to the soldier, Mr. Routh sent a picture of his trunk filled with clothes and sleeping items, with the caption “my house.”</p><p>He also sent the soldier a picture of his bank account: It only had $68 left.</p><p>Still, the soldier said that just days before he was arrested, Mr. Routh was still sending money to a friend, an Afghan commando, who was stuck in Kenya and trying to get to Ukraine.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Adam Goldman<!-- --> in Washington, D.C.; <!-- -->Najim Rahim<!-- --> in Alexandria, Va.; <!-- -->Kurt Streeter<!-- --> in Seattle; <!-- -->Audra D.
