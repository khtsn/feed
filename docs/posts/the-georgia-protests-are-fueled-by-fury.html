For more than a week, Rustaveli Avenue, the city’s central street, has been a nightly battleground of tear gas and pyrotechnics. Anti-government protesters hurl fireworks that explode over the heads of the special forces and the lights of laser pointers swarm like insects. People pry off anything that will come loose — benches, plant pots, construction hoarding — and feed it into makeshift fires or onto barricades.</p><p>The state responds with water cannons and tear gas, which seeps down the avenue, stinging our eyes and throats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Each day authorities move in to clear the detritus of rage from the streets. The walls of Parliament are covered with several layers of black paint as the ruling party hastily conceals the words of anger and blame that were written there the night before and will probably be written again the next night. Some protesters carry their messages on signs, like the ones pictured above. The sign on the left reads, “Tbilisi State Academy of Art students with all our souls toward Europe.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/opinion/oakImage-1733437182877/oakImage-1733437182877-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/opinion/oakImage-1733437182877/oakImage-1733437182877-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/opinion/oakImage-1733437182877/oakImage-1733437182877-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Protesters’ legs, seen in silhouette standing around a small fire." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/opinion/oakImage-1733437182877/oakImage-1733437182877-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/opinion/oakImage-1733437182877/oakImage-1733437182877-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/opinion/oakImage-1733437182877/oakImage-1733437182877-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/opinion/oakImage-1733437182877/oakImage-1733437182877-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/9ec8197e-58d9-5027-98ef-5160ce8d7f75" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>I was a child during the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/world/europe/georgia-uproar-2008-war-russia.html" title="">brief war</a> between Georgia and Russia in 2008. I remember seeing charred buildings in the eastern town of Gori and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/world/europe/08iht-georgia.3.15119155.html" title="">tanks</a> on the Military Highway, a road that enters Georgia from Russia. People of my generation have grown up under the fear of another war, and Georgian Dream, the political party that has been in power since 2012, has capitalized on that fear, running on a platform of peace while seeming to follow the Kremlin playbook with laws against what is described as L.G.B.T.Q. propaganda, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/world/europe/georgia-parliament-foreign-agents-bill.html" title="">foreign agents</a>” laws and a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/arts/25georgia-artists-crackdowns-drag.html" title="">reorganization</a>” of arts institutions. When the elections in October ended in Georgian Dream’s favor amid allegations of vote rigging and after months of failed protests, nihilism and fatigue set in. It felt like we were sleepwalking into becoming a Russian vassal state.</p><p>Then, on Nov. 28, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia’s E.U. integration talks would be suspended until 2028, in a country where public support for joining the bloc has polled around <a href="https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/NDI%20Georgia%20October%202023%20poll%20-%20press%20release%20-%20Eng%20-%20FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">80 percent</a>.</p><p>The mood suddenly shifted: People were no longer defeated; they were furious.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Within hours of the announcement, the streets outside Parliament were full. Gone were the expensive sound systems that had blared protest songs and bland speeches from the opposition party leaders at many of this year’s protests. Instead, independent hives of resistance and solidarity sprang up: Sympathetic cafes and bars opened their doors to shelter the damp and wounded; water bottles and gloves, to extinguish tear gas canisters, were left at intervals along the road; and volunteer medics raised their hands in the middle of the smoke.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Other protests have ignited across Georgia, too, outside of Tbilisi. There have been several public resignations, including Georgia’s ambassador to the U.S. But each day the fear of losing momentum increases, as does the fear of the state’s increasing fury. Hundreds of protesters have been detained and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/europe/georgia-russia-protests-gvaramia.html" title="">dozens</a> have been violently beaten. The homes and offices of opposition politicians and activists have been raided, and several of them arrested. The true face of Georgian Dream is becoming evident.</p><p>Our country is lurching toward authoritarianism. This may be our last chance to pull it back.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
