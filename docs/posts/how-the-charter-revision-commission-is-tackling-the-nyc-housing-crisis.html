But this year, a panel of civic leaders will suggest revisions that could help relieve the housing crisis.</p><p>The panel, known as a Charter Revision Commission, is holding <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/charter/meetings/public-meetings-hearings.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a series of public hearings</a>, including on Monday in Queens, to come up with proposals to put before voters in November.</p><p>Rents across the city <a href="https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2025/02/13/nyc-rents-rise-in-january-set-to-stay-high-in-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">continue to rise</a>, and few affordable apartments are available to rent. That is fueling homelessness and putting the city out of reach for anyone but the rich.</p><p>The commission hopes to find a remedy.</p><p>The process is unfolding against a tumultuous backdrop. The administration of Mayor Eric Adams, who created the commission, is in disarray as he deals with the fallout of a federal corruption case, and the 2025 mayoral race is heating up. The City Council is also locked in a power struggle with Mr. Adams and <a href="https://www.thecommission.nyc/meetings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has formed its own commission</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the members of the mayor-created commission said in a statement that they are still moving forward, providing New Yorkers with a unique opportunity to influence how the city deals with an urgent problem.</p><p>“We remind everyone that this is an independent commission, with its own staff, budget and mission,” the statement reads. “We will continue to act independently as we pursue this important work.”</p><h2 id="link-6459b8c">What is the City Charter?</h2><p>The charter “defines the organization, powers, functions and essential procedures of the city government,” <a href="https://dos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2024/09/revising-city-charters.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a state paper on revising charters</a>.</p><p>The document describes the structure and functions of most of the public offices that are responsible for housing in New York City, including the Planning Commission, the Housing Department, the City Council and the mayor’s office.</p><p>It also describes the process for changing the rules and limits on development.</p><h2 id="link-160c512b">What is a Charter Revision Commission?</h2><p>A dozen or so volunteers examine the entire charter and propose just about any changes. A 2019 commission, for example, led to the adoption of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/nyregion/ny-nj-election-results.html" title="">ranked-choice voting in certain elections</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It can be created by the mayor, the City Council or a voter referendum. There are few legal constraints on who can serve on it. When Mr. Adams created a commission in December, he asked it to look at the housing crisis.</p><p>“Housing proposals and land use measures, and the negotiations that come with them, are complex and critical to ensuring our city remains affordable,” Mr. Adams said then.</p><p>Richard R. Buery Jr., a former deputy mayor who chairs the commission, said that might include ways to “unleash housing supply.”</p><p>“These are not problems that can be solved through the charter, but the charter can certainly make it easier,” said Mr. Buery, who is also the chief executive of the Robin Hood Foundation, an anti-poverty group.</p><p>The commission will probably publish a preliminary report in the spring, then send final proposals to the city clerk in the summer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The City Council, for its part, has <a href="https://www.thecommission.nyc/meetings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">created its own commission</a> to restore “public confidence” in government. Under state law, if the mayor’s commission puts something on the ballot, it effectively blocks anything the Council’s commission might suggest.</p><p>“It’s unfortunate that anyone would be enabling this or propping it up when we should all be working together to protect N.Y.C.,” a Council spokeswoman said in a statement.</p><h2 id="link-22fc8cc5">Who is on it?</h2><p>There are <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/charter/about/charter-commission-members.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13 people</a> on the mayor’s commission.</p><ul><li><p>Most have some experience in government. Carl Weisbrod and Anita Laremont, for example, once ran the Planning Department. Lisette Nieves once worked in the Department of Youth and Community Development. Leila Bozorg and Diane Savino both work in City Hall.</p></li><li><p>Many of the commissioners run nonprofit groups. Sharon Greenberger leads the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York. Grace C. Bonilla is the president and chief executive of the United Way of New York City. Kathryn Wylde helms the Partnership for New York City, a business group. Valerie White is the senior executive director of L.I.S.C. New York, a group focused on the racial wealth gap. Julie Samuels is the president and chief executive of Tech:NYC, which represents the tech industry.</p></li><li><p>At least one member, Shams DaBaron, used to be homeless. He <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/what-da-homeless-hero-makes-of-eric-adamss-policies" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has advised Mr. Adams</a> on other housing issues. Anthony Richardson is managing director for New York Syndications at CREA, LLC an affordable housing investment firm.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-7812217d">What can the commission do about housing, and why now?</h2><p>The housing crisis has grown worse. A 2023 city survey found that only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/nyregion/apartment-vacancy-rate-housing-crisis.html" title="">1.4 percent</a> of the city’s apartments were available to rent. Lower- and middle-income earners are leaving. The median New York City renter household, which earns around $70,000 a year, cannot afford the rent in many neighborhoods.</p><p>The commission’s first public hearing, on Feb. 11 in Brooklyn, offered hints of how some people are thinking about the problem.</p><p>Vicki Been, a deputy mayor under Mayor Bill de Blasio, talked about the long and costly process to approve new housing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Howard Slatkin, the executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a nonprofit group, said “the system is skewed to make it too difficult to say yes, and too easy to say no” to housing. Others discussed ways to reduce the sway individual council members have over the fate of housing projects in their districts.</p><h2 id="link-b18e1d0">How do I get my voice heard?</h2><p>People <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/charter/contact/contact-charter.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">can testify online</a>, in person at hearings or by email. The hearings are streamed online.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpfOasrhmgg&amp;ab_channel=NYCCharterRevisionCommission2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Feb. 11 hearing</a>, people talked about making sure neighborhood voices remain influential and limiting the ability of politicians to block new housing when the vacancy rate is less than 5 percent, which is the threshold for a housing emergency according to state law. Some said the city’s rules preserving landmark areas should be relaxed to allow for more housing.</p><p>Mr. Buery said he promised the commission would review all testimony.</p><p>“Have some trust that your time and energy is worth it,” he said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
