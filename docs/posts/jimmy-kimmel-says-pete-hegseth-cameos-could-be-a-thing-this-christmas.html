OK, finally! ‘Someone at Fox News who’s responsible,’ is what I would say if that sentence did not end with ‘So he could make it to the set by 6 a.m.’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><h2 id="link-16194656">The Punchiest Punchlines (Biden’s Last Stand Edition)</h2></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“Earlier tonight, they had the national Christmas tree lighting at the White House.
