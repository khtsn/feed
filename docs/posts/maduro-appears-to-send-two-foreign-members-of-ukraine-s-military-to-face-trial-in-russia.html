As a frontline soldier, Mr. Ante earned in Ukraine more than double what he had made as a bodyguard in a provincial capital of southern Colombia, his brother said.</p><p>Mr. Ante and Mr. Medina had served in the Carpathian Sich 49th Infantry Battalion, one of the two main destinations for Latin American recruits in Ukraine’s Armed Forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Russia and Ukraine have sought to punish foreign nationals who had joined the opposing side, to raise morale among their own citizens and deter others from joining the enemy.</p><p>Early in the war, a court in Russian-occupied Ukraine issued death sentences against two British nationals and a Moroccan who were taken prisoner while fighting for Ukraine. The sentences were never carried out, and the men were later repatriated in a prisoner exchange.</p><p>Since then, Russia has tried Ukraine’s foreign fighters mostly in absentia.</p><p>Ukraine has conducted similar trials against captured foreigners fighting for Russia. Most famously, a Ukrainian court convicted a Brazilian man on terrorism charges before eventually returning him to Brazil.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Foreign volunteer fighters with the Carpathian Sich battalion searched houses used by Russian soldiers in the recaptured village of Stavky in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>International law is ambiguous about the legality of foreigners such as Mr. Medina and Mr. Ante joining a faraway war, legal experts have said. Such men partly meet the definition of mercenaries, who are banned under the Geneva Convention because they are motivated primarily by money and have no ties to combatant nations.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But because foreign fighters in Ukraine are members of the regular armed forces and receive similar payments and benefits as Ukrainian citizens, the Ukrainian government has claimed that they are legal combatants.</p><p>In addition to the Geneva Convention, Russian law explicitly bans mercenaries. The Kremlin, however, has relied significantly on private military companies to recover from the setbacks of its invasion two years ago, and since last year has recruited heavily from nations such as Cuba, Nepal and Syria.</p><p>The risk to Russia of its reliance on mercenaries became apparent last year, when the leader of the Wagner paramilitaries, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, staged a mutiny and marched his forces on Moscow. He died in a plane crash months later.</p><p>In Colombia, relatives of Mr. Medina and Mr. Ante said they were still waiting to learn what happened to their loved ones. Mr. Medina was scheduled to arrive home on his birthday, July 19. One of the last messages he read on his phone was a photo taken by his wife, Ms. Paz, of a festive table decorated with balloons and a hanging “Happy Birthday” sign.</p><p>An official at the Colombian Embassy in Moscow said on Friday that the embassy had learned about the former soldiers’ detention from news reports and that they had yet to receive a reply from Russia’s foreign ministry about the men&#39;s status.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The lack of response from the Venezuelan and Russian governments presents a diplomatic challenge for Mr. Petro’s government, said Mr. Rouvinski, the political science professor.</p><p>After assuming the presidency in 2022, Mr. Petro has sought to preserve Colombia’s status as a main ally of the United States in South America.
