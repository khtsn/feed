Mr. Medina later shared his geolocation in Caracas’s international airport, Ms. Paz’s phone records show, before breaking off contact.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>José Medina in a photo sent to his wife as he boarded a plane bound for Venezuela in Madrid, Spain.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">José Medina</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Venezuela’s government has not commented on the apparent detention and extradition of the Colombian soldiers.

But many others — particularly from poorer countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa — went to Ukraine primarily to earn a living for their families.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Medina in a photo released by Russian state media showing him in detention.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Colombian fighters have proven to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/americas/colombia-soldiers-ukraine-war.html" title="">particularly useful recruits for the Ukrainian military</a> because of their experience fighting Marxist guerrillas and training with U.S. weapons and officers. </p><p>Hundreds of retired Colombian soldiers have traveled to Ukraine since the start of the war to fight for Kyiv for about $3,000 a month, more than they could make at home based on their skills, about a dozen Colombian recruits and their relatives said in interviews.</p><p>“The money simply did not add up,” Mr. Ante’s brother, River Arbey Ante, said in a brief phone interview on Friday, describing his motivation to enlist.<span>  </span>As frontline soldier, Mr. Ante earned in Ukraine more than double what he had made as a bodyguard in a provincial capital of southern Colombia, his brother said.<span>  </span></p><p>Mr. Ante and Mr. Medina had served in the Carpathian Sich 49th Infantry Battalion, one of the two main destinations for Latin American recruits in Ukraine’s Armed Forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Russia and Ukraine have sought to punish foreign nationals who had joined the opposing side, to raise morale among their own citizens and deter others from joining the enemy. </p><p>Early in the war, a court in Russian-occupied Ukraine issued death sentences against two British nationals and a Moroccan who were taken prisoner while fighting for Ukraine. The sentences were never carried out, and the men were later repatriated in a prisoner exchange. </p><p>Since then, Russia has tried Ukraine’s foreign fighters mostly in absentia. </p><p>Ukraine has conducted similar trials against captured foreigners fighting for Russia. Most famously, a Ukrainian court convicted a Brazilian man on terrorism charges before eventually returning him to Brazil. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Foreign volunteers fighters with the Carpathian Sich battalion searched houses used by Russian soldiers in the recaptured village of Stavky in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>International law is ambiguous about the legality of foreigners such as Mr. Medina and Mr. Ante joining a faraway war, legal experts have said. Such men partly meet the definition of mercenaries, who are banned under the Geneva Convention because they are motivated primarily by money<span>  </span>and have no<span>  </span>ties to combatant nations. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But because foreign fighters in Ukraine are members of the regular armed forces and receive similar payments and benefits as Ukrainian citizens, the Ukrainian government has claimed that they are legal combatants. </p><p>In addition to the Geneva Convention, Russian law explicitly bans mercenaries. The Kremlin, however, has relied significantly on private military companies to recover from the setbacks of its invasion two years ago, and since last year has recruited heavily from nations such as Cuba, Nepal and Syria. </p><p>The risk to Russia’s of its reliance on mercenaries became apparent last year, when the leader of the Wagner paramilitaries, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, staged a mutiny and marched his forces on Moscow. He died in a plane crash months later.</p><p>In Colombia, relatives of Mr. Medina and Mr. Ante said they were still waiting to learn what happened to their loved ones. Mr. Medina was scheduled to arrive home on his birthday, July 19. One of the last messages he read on his phone was a photo taken by his wife, Ms. Paz, of a festive table decorated with balloons and a hanging “Happy Birthday” sign.</p><p>An official at the Colombian embassy in Moscow said on Friday that the embassy had learned about the former soldiers’s detention from news reports and that they had yet to receive a reply from Russia’s foreign ministry about the men&#39;s status.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The lack of response from the Venezuelan and Russian governments presents a diplomatic challenge for Mr. Petro’s government, said Mr. Rouvinski, the political science professor. </p><p>After assuming the presidency in 2022, Mr. Petro has sought to preserve Colombia’s status as a main ally of the United States in South America. But he has also assumed a neutral position on Russia’s invasion, even after a Russian strike <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/business/colombia-ukraine-russia-war.html" title="">injured several prominent Colombian intellectuals</a> visiting Ukraine. </p><p>In late 2022, Mr. Petro’s ambassador to Russia, Hector Arenas, <a href="https://ria.ru/20221112/kolumbiya-1831011878.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offered a tip to Russian tourists</a> who wanted to visit Colombia despite the various wartime travel restrictions: fly via Venezuela.</p><p>Genevieve Glatsky<!-- --> contributed reporting from Bogotá, and <!-- -->Stanislav Kozliuk<!-- --> from Kyiv.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
