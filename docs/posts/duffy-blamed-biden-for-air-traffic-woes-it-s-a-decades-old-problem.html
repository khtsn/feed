But Mr. Poole said the claim that Biden officials did “nothing” was overly broad.</p><p>Moreover, the Biden administration’s approach was not unique. The federal government across multiple administrations and Congresses has taken a reactive approach to aviation policy, often leading to delays in modernization efforts and inadequate staffing and funding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The current state of air travel, too, could signal the “beginning of a reactionary cycle that has defined the development of the nation’s system of air travel for the past century,” said Sean Seyer, an associate professor at the University of Kansas and author of a book on American civil aviation history.</p><p>The F.A.A. <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-newark-liberty-international-airport" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acknowledged this month</a> that an “antiquated air traffic control system,” a nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers and persistent staffing shortages were affecting air travel. Those issues have existed long before the Trump and Biden administrations.</p><p>For decades, watchdog organizations have warned of staffing challenges and equipment dysfunction to little avail. A multiyear effort to replace the air traffic system began in 2003, but has run into numerous challenges and remains underway. And proposals from both the Trump and Biden administrations to address issues have gained little traction.</p><h2 id="link-2c6ab401">Longstanding concerns about staffing and equipment</h2><p>Since 1981, when President Ronald Reagan fired and then barred from re-employment thousands of air traffic controllers who participated in a nationwide strike, staffing has remained a persistent issue at air traffic control facilities.</p><p>Though the re-employment ban was lifted in 1993, the F.A.A. estimated in 1996 that about a third of air traffic control facilities were inadequately staffed, <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/rced-97-84.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a 1997 report from the Government Accountability Office</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A decade later, the F.A.A. had hired a significant number of controllers to prepare for projected retirements, but still had a dearth of fully certified controllers, <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-08-908t.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a 2008 report from the accountability office</a>. And the Transportation Department’s Office of the Inspector General in 2016 <a href="https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FAA%20Controller%20Staffing%20at%20Critical%20Facilities%5E1-11-16.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that 13 of 23 facilities deemed critical did not have enough certified professional controllers.</p><p>Under the first Trump administration, the number of controllers declined and the F.A.A. failed to meet hiring targets.</p><p>A union representing air traffic controllers noted in 2018 that the number of certified controllers had fallen to <a href="https://www.natca.org/2018/12/28/dec-28-2018-government-shutdown-means-hiring-training-delays-worsening-current-air-traffic-controller-staffing-crisis/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 30-year low</a>. A 35-day government shutdown from December 2018 to January 2019 led the agency to revise its fiscal year 2019 hiring target of <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/controller_staffing/media/2018-ABA-200-CWP_2019_Report_508.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1,431 new controllers down to 907</a> (it ultimately hired 1,010) and the coronavirus pandemic further disrupted recruitment. As a result, by the end of the 2021 fiscal year, the F.A.A. had a head count of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712214914/https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-06/2022-afn-cwp.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13,850</a>, a decline of about 600 controllers since the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2021-11/2017-Controller-Workforce-Plan-8.1.-2017.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">end of 2016</a>.</p><p>Under the Biden administration, the number of controllers held steady with a head count of <a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/afn-aba-20240509-cwp-congress.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13,853</a> at the end of the 2023 fiscal year, the latest data available. Though the F.A.A. tried to increase hiring, it still faced staffing shortages.</p><p><a href="https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FAA%20Controller%20Staffing%20and%20Training%20at%20Critical%20Facilities%20Final%20Report-06-21-23.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A 2023 report</a> from the Transportation Department’s Office of the Inspector General said the F.A.A. made “limited effort” to address controller shortages and failed to ensure adequate staffing levels at critical facilities for eight years, a period that included the administrations under President Barack Obama, President Trump and President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The report also said the coronavirus pandemic aggravated issues as the agency paused training and delayed certification, the effect of which will be borne out for several more years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Similarly, the watchdog agencies have raised concerns about the F.A.A.’s aging infrastructure and noted challenges in the agency’s modernization efforts across multiple administrations.</p><p>The Transportation Department’s inspector general has issued <a href="https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/library-items/FAA%20NextGen%20Status%20Report_4.30.24.pdf#page=28" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">47 audit reports</a> and made over 200 recommendations on NextGen, the F.A.A.’s modernization program that began in 2003, between 2005 and 2022, including warnings during the Trump administration about <a href="https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FAA%20Actions%20to%20Address%20ERAM%20Outages%20Final%20Report%5E11-07-18.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insufficient navigation backups</a> and <a href="https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FAA%20SENSR%20Program%20Final%20Report%5E04-23-19.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lack of funding in developing and deploying new radar systems</a>.</p><p>The Government Accountability Office <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-105254.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> in 2023 that the F.A.A. had made “mixed progress” since 2018 in meeting NextGen milestones on time, noting that the pandemic significantly contributed to delays.</p><p>In 2024, the Government Accountability Office reported that most F.A.A. systems, including many critical safety systems, were unsustainable or potentially unsustainable and recommended the agency take <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107917" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“urgent” action.</a></p><h2 id="link-4b26d5de">Unsuccessful attempts to overhaul the F.A.A.</h2><p>Mr. Trump, in 2017, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/05/us/politics/trump-privatize-air-traffic-control.html" title="">endorsed a proposal to privatize air traffic control</a>, a move that he claimed would improve safety and reduce delays and costs. But in 2018, he signed legislation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/business/faa-congress-reauthorization.html" title="">reauthorizing the F.A.A. for five years</a> that did not contain the proposal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Under that <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R42781.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legislation</a>, the agency’s annual funding ranged from around $17 billion in the 2018 fiscal year to more than $19 billion in 2023, a slight increase from annual funding levels of between $15 billion to $17 billion in the <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20180227_R42781_b0fef8f4c57ac94e865cde300d190accc7af94d4.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous five years</a>.</p><p>Mr. Poole praised Mr. Trump’s 2018 <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/briefing-room/304441/legoutline.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">infrastructure plan</a> as “excellent” but noted that it contained nothing about air traffic control.</p><p>Little changed during the Biden administration.</p><p>Mr. Biden, in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/budget_fy2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">March 2024</a>, released a budget that included a $8 billion proposal to modernize the agency’s facilities and radars. But two months later, he signed legislation reauthorizing the F.A.A. that did not contain that proposal. Annual funding again increased slightly, ranging from <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2024-10-23_IF12791_a12adc149d1b456b5e2a4162996b236d48dd17eb.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$20 billion to $22 billion</a> over the 2024 to 2028 fiscal years.</p><p>“There is a lot of sense in this proposal, except for the timing,” said Jeff Davis, a senior fellow and editor of Eno Transportation Weekly. “If this $8 billion proposal had come out a year before and had some political juice behind it, maybe it could have made it into law. As it was, Congress ignored it.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Linda Qiu is a reporter who specializes in fact-checking statements made by politicians and public figures.
