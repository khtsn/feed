In the witness box, she listed instances in which she said Mr. Combs was violent with her during her eight years working for him.</p><p>“He’s thrown things at me,” she testified. “He’s thrown me against the wall. He’s thrown me into a pool. He’s thrown an ice bucket on my head. He slammed my arm into a door.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Looking down, her voice quieting to a whisper, she said that Mr. Combs had also sexually assaulted her multiple times. Prosecutors previewed her testimony for jurors by saying that Mia would “tell you about the times that the defendant forced himself on her sexually,” including forcing her to perform oral sex and “sneaking into her bed to penetrate her against her will.”</p><p>Mia said she was in her mid-20s, living in New York and working to ascend in the entertainment industry — she had already been a personal assistant for Mike Myers — when she applied to work for Mr. Combs. After several interviews for a personal assistant job, she recalled, she was brought to Mr. Combs’s apartment to meet him, and he opened the door in his underwear. The human resources employee who accompanied her then left, she said, and Mr. Combs eventually got dressed.</p><p>She described a work environment that was both exciting but “toxic,” testifying that she was often sleep deprived. Once, Mia said, she worked for five days without sleep, until her vision began to blur and she burst into tears, prompting Mr. Combs to let her off the clock. (She said her base salary was $50,000.)</p><p>Jurors were shown a document that listed her marching orders as a personal assistant, which included protecting Mr. Combs “at all times” and staying attached to her Blackberry at all hours. Mr. Combs, the document read, could “ask you to do 17,000 things at one time that range from cracking his knuckles to writing his next movie to doing his taxes.”</p><p>Previous witnesses have described Mia as part of Mr. Combs’s entourage and a friend of Casandra Ventura, the music mogul’s on-and-off girlfriend of 11 years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/arts/sean-combs-diddy-trial-cassie" title="">whose testimony about violence and marathon sexual encounters</a> with male prostitutes, known as “freak-offs,” are at the heart of the government’s case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Combs is not accused of sex trafficking Mia but of subjecting her to forced labor — including sexual activity — through violence and threats of serious harm. The forced labor allegation is part of a broader racketeering conspiracy charge that accuses Mr. Combs of directing a criminal enterprise that helped him commit crimes and cover them up over two decades.</p><p>Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him. His lawyers have acknowledged that he was responsible for domestic violence, but they vehemently denied the existence of a criminal conspiracy, asserting that he was the head of entirely lawful businesses that were disconnected from his private sex life. They have argued that the sex at issue in the case was entirely consensual.</p><p>In the defense’s opening statement, Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, said the upcoming cross-examination of Mia will surface messages she wrote to Mr. Combs throughout her employment expressing her “unbelievable love” for him.</p><p>Before Mia took the stand, the defense finished its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-trial-victim-4.html" title="">cross-examination of Deonte Nash</a>, a stylist who worked with Mr. Combs and Ms. Ventura for years, and maintains a close friendship with Ms. Ventura.</p><p>Mr. Nash is a critical witness for the prosecution because he said he saw Mr. Combs repeatedly beat Ms. Ventura, and that Ms. Ventura confided in him several times that she did not want to participate in the “freak-offs” that prosecutors say Mr. Combs demanded and directed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Deonte Nash, a former stylist to Casandra Ventura, testified over two days, beginning on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eduardo Munoz/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Xavier Donaldson, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, focused questioning on an instance when Mr. Nash said he left a hotel room at Ms. Ventura’s request because Mr. Combs “wanted to invite a guy over,” suggesting that he must not have had concern for Ms. Ventura’s safety at the time.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I always did,” Mr. Nash replied.</p><p>The cross-examination became animated as Mr. Donaldson inquired about a flirtation Ms. Ventura had with the actor Michael B. Jordan in 2015 that is said to have spurred Mr. Combs’s jealousy. Mr. Nash cut in: “Yes, I did hook her up with Michael B. Jordan — I know where you’re going with this.”</p><p>The defense has argued that Mr. Combs’s violence toward Ms. Ventura was motivated by jealousy and drug use, not issues related to sexual coercion.</p><p>Mr. Nash detailed several instances in which he said he witnessed Mr. Combs physically abuse Ms. Ventura, including a 2013 incident in which he said Mr. Combs grabbed Ms. Ventura by the hair, pulled her off a couch and started hitting her after she had failed to answer her phone.</p><p>“He was in a rage,” Mr. Nash said, testifying that he jumped on the music mogul’s back to try to subdue him but was thrown off, and then Mia did the same. Mr. Nash said Mr. Combs continued to strike Ms. Ventura, stopping only after her head hit the edge of a bed frame and she began to bleed. As everyone in the room realized the severity of Ms. Ventura’s injury, Mr. Nash recalled, Mr. Combs told them “look what y’all made me do.”</p><p>Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Joe Coscarelli is a culture reporter for The Times who focuses on popular music and a co-host of the Times podcast <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/popcast-pop-music-podcast">“Popcast (Deluxe).”</a></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
