In the witness box, she described a fast-paced, often exciting job that could quickly descend into chaos based on the fluctuation of Mr. Combs’s moods.</p><p>“The highs were really high and the lows were really, really low,” she testified.</p><p>Listing instances in which she said Mr. Combs was violent with her during her eight years working for him, Mia testified, “He’s thrown things at me. He’s thrown me against the wall. He’s thrown me into a pool. He’s thrown an ice bucket on my head. He slammed my arm into a door.”</p><p>Looking down, her voice quieting to a whisper, she said that Mr. Combs had also sexually assaulted her multiple times. Prosecutors said they would return to the subject in detail later, but they had previewed her account for jurors by saying that Mia would testify that Mr. Combs forced her to perform oral sex and sneaked “into her bed to penetrate her against her will.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mia said she was in her mid-20s, living in New York and working to ascend in the entertainment industry — she had already been a personal assistant for Mike Myers — when she began working for Mr. Combs in 2009. After several interviews for a personal assistant job, she recalled, she was brought to Mr. Combs’s apartment to meet him, and he opened the door in his underwear. The human resources employee who accompanied her then left, she said, and Mr. Combs got dressed.</p><p>Mia said she had little privacy as the music producer’s assistant. When she stayed at Mr. Combs’s houses, she testified, he directed her to never lock her bedroom door.</p><p>Jurors were shown a document that listed Mia’s marching orders, which included staying attached to her Blackberry at all hours and staying within Mr. Combs’s eyesight. Mr. Combs, the document read, could “ask you to do 17,000 things at one time that range from cracking his knuckles to writing his next movie to doing his taxes.”</p><p>Once, Mia said, she worked for five days without sleep, until her vision began to blur and she burst into tears, prompting Mr. Combs to let her off the clock. (She said her initial base salary was $50,000.)</p><p>Mr. Combs is not accused of sex trafficking Mia but of subjecting her to forced labor — including sexual activity — through violence and threats of serious harm. The forced labor allegation is part of a broader racketeering conspiracy charge that accuses Mr. Combs of directing a criminal enterprise that helped him commit crimes and cover them up over two decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him. His lawyers have acknowledged that he was responsible for domestic violence, but they vehemently denied the existence of a criminal conspiracy, asserting that he was the head of entirely lawful businesses that were disconnected from his private sex life. They have argued that the sex at issue in the case was entirely consensual.</p><p>For prosecutors, Mia’s testimony helps establish a pattern of how Mr. Combs treated women, and corroborates the account of Casandra Ventura, the music mogul’s on-and-off girlfriend of 11 years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/arts/sean-combs-diddy-trial-cassie" title="">whose recounting of brutal violence, meticulous control and marathon sexual encounters</a> with male prostitutes, known as “freak-offs,” are at the heart of the government’s case.</p><p>Mia, who described her relationship with Ms. Ventura as “like sisters,” testified that Mr. Combs directed her to “keep tabs” on Ms. Ventura. One night, Mia testified, she was told by Mr. Combs to keep Ms. Ventura company in a hotel room and to make sure she didn’t return to his house while he spent time with his children.</p><p>When Ms. Ventura and Mia were told by a friend that Prince was having a house party nearby, “Cass and I debated like little kids if we should sneak out of the house,” she said. The women attended the party, Mia testified, dancing and having fun until Mia saw Mr. Combs arrive.</p><p>“Oh, crap,” she remembered thinking. “Me and Cass just booked it.”</p><p>When Mr. Combs caught up to Ms. Ventura in the front yard, he began attacking her, Mia testified, until Prince’s security intervened. The next day, Mia was suspended without pay for insubordination, she said.</p><p>As Mia left the witness stand during a break, Mr. Combs, who is wearing a gray crew-neck sweater and a collared shirt, shook his head in apparent disapproval.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the defense’s opening statement, Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, said the upcoming cross-examination of Mia will surface messages she wrote to Mr. Combs throughout her employment expressing her “unbelievable love” for him.</p><p>Before Mia took the stand on Thursday, the defense finished its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-trial-victim-4.html" title="">cross-examination of Deonte Nash</a>, a stylist who worked with Mr. Combs and Ms. Ventura for years, and maintains a close friendship with Ms. Ventura.</p><p>Mr. Nash was a critical witness for the prosecution because he said that Ms. Ventura confided in him several times that she did not want to participate in the “freak-offs” that prosecutors say Mr. Combs demanded and directed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Deonte Nash, a former stylist to Casandra Ventura, testified over two days, beginning on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eduardo Munoz/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Xavier Donaldson, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, focused questioning on an instance when Mr. Nash said he left a hotel room at Ms. Ventura’s request because Mr. Combs “wanted to invite a guy over,” suggesting that he must not have had concern for Ms. Ventura’s safety at the time.</p><p>“I always did,” Mr. Nash replied.</p><p>The cross-examination became animated as Mr. Donaldson inquired about a flirtation Ms. Ventura had with the actor Michael B. Jordan in 2015 that is said to have spurred Mr. Combs’s jealousy. Mr. Nash cut in: “Yes, I did hook her up with Michael B. Jordan — I know where you’re going with this.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The defense has argued that Mr. Combs’s violence toward Ms. Ventura was motivated by jealousy and drug use, not issues related to sexual coercion.</p><p>Mr. Nash detailed several instances in which he said he witnessed Mr. Combs physically abuse Ms. Ventura, including a 2013 incident in which he said Mr. Combs grabbed Ms. Ventura by the hair, pulled her off a couch and started hitting her after she had failed to answer her phone.</p><p>Mia corroborated the attack during her testimony. She said that she and Mr. Nash moved to try to stop Mr. Combs, but when she jumped on his back, Mr. Combs easily threw her against the wall.</p><p>“It was the first time I realized the severe danger that we were actually in,” Mia testified.</p><p>Both witnesses said Mr. Combs continued to strike Ms. Ventura, stopping only after her head hit the edge of a bed frame and she began to bleed. As everyone in the room realized the severity of Ms. Ventura’s injury, Mr. Nash recalled, Mr. Combs told them “look what y’all made me do.”</p><p>Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Joe Coscarelli is a culture reporter for The Times who focuses on popular music and a co-host of the Times podcast <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/popcast-pop-music-podcast">“Popcast (Deluxe).”</a></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
