</span>. </p>

<p>This match was the sixth encounter between the two teams, with Team Heretics having won four times in the past thanks to their strong 2024 season. In terms of overall performance this stage, Team Heretics had been undefeated in Stage 1, while FNATIC&#39;s only loss in the split was a 2-0 match against Heretics. </p>

<p>In the map veto, FNATIC chose to remove <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/2593/fnatic/?event_id=all&amp;date_start=2025-03-10&amp;date_end=2025-05-16" target="_blank">their permaban</a>, Pearl, while Heretics <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/1001/team-heretics/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2025-03-10&amp;date_end=2025-05-16" target="_blank">let their most banned map</a>, Fracture, through in order to take away FNATIC&#39;s strong Split. FNATIC accepted the invitation, picking Fracture as the opening map. Heretics opted for Icebox as the second map, and Lotus remained as the decider should the series have gone the distance. </p>

<p>The series began on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/482515/team-heretics-vs-fnatic-champions-tour-2025-emea-stage-1-playoffs-ubf/?game=215416&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Fracture</a>, where Team Heretics took off with a 4-2 lead after losing the pistol round but winning the eco. It took a hero round from <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span> for FNATIC to regain their footing, setting the team on a path to recovery. The Turkish player was important to FNATIC&#39;s 7-5 half, as he ended the defense with 13 eliminations and two first kills. <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9554/kaajak">

</span> joined him at the top of the scoreboard, with 12 kills of his own and a 3-1 record in opening engagements. </p>

</span> secures the lead with a 3K.</em></p>

<p>Overall, FNATIC seemed more comfortable on Fracture, and the second pistol round going their way sealed the deal. The team&#39;s understanding of the map, as well as their better use of the post-plant composition, led to them winning six rounds on attack while only losing one, a round that Heretics won off the back of a timeout. In the end, FNATIC won their map pick 13-6, needing only one more map win to make it to their fourth VCT EMEA grand final since 2023.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/482515/team-heretics-vs-fnatic-champions-tour-2025-emea-stage-1-playoffs-ubf/?game=217080&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">The second map</a> featured unique compositions, with FNATIC bringing back their Sage variant of the no-Duelist Icebox. Heretics debuted a Tejo-less lineup, replacing the Colombian initiator with Sova, an idea which other regions have shown with different agent combinations, but <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/agents/2380/champions-tour-2025-emea-stage-1" target="_blank">EMEA has yet to embrace fully</a>. </p>

<p>Heretics was able to win the pistol and first rifle round, but FNATIC quickly adapted, ever confident in their retakes. This proved successful, particularly on B, as FNATIC won five rounds in a row by defusing the spike. The teams traded rounds after Heretics broke the streak, but FNATIC remained in the lead, sending the map to halftime with a 7-5 scoreline.</p>

</span> steal a round.</em></p>

<p>As with Fracture, FNATIC extended their lead with a pistol round win in the second half. Heretics won an eco out of nowhere, but the attackers quickly recovered after winning a round using hero rifles. Heretics seemed to stabilize, but FNATIC correctly punished their opponent&#39;s poor ultimate economy management to secure the final two rounds, ending the map 13-8 and winning the series 2-0. </p>

<p>Now in the grand final, FNATIC has secured a two-map veto for the best-of-five match, as well as a minimum of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/vct-2025/standings" target="_blank">three Championship points</a> for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions: Paris</a> qualification. Team Heretics, guaranteed at least a top-three placement, will need to defeat Team Liquid if they wish to make the grand final and potentially secure a bye into the Masters: Toronto playoffs.</p>
