The problem was, no one believed him.</p><p>It was the second song the pair had written together, a stirring origin story of Roan’s self-awakening from the Missouri-born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz to the burgeoning queer artist Chappell Roan, spurred by her home away from home, a Los Angeles gay bar where “boys and girls can all be queens every single day.”</p><p>At the time, Roan was signed to Atlantic Records, which had released her downcast debut EP to little notice. Nigro was scuffling, too; he’d left his middling Long Island emo band to try his hand at songwriting in L.A., where he had some success with credits on songs by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWo7SC-tG4U" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sky Ferreira</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_Lw-p0WHZA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carly Rae Jepsen</a>, among others. But in his mid-30s, he was still paying the bills in part with money he’d earned writing commercial jingles.</p><p>When Atlantic executives heard “Pink Pony Club,” they were not impressed. “I was convinced the song was incredible,” Nigro recalled, “and then they told me it wasn’t.” The label suggested excising the song’s ebullient guitar solos, played by Dave Stewart’s son Sam, that Roan had pushed for and Nigro helped compose, “and I was like, nope,” he said. Atlantic dropped Roan, and in 2021 Nigro started his own label, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/business/record-labels/dan-nigro-record-label-amusement-records-interview-1235350230/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amusement Records</a>, just to release her music. In August, her debut album, “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,” hit No. 2 on the Billboard 200.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Dan always believed in me,” Roan said in an email. “He has been there from the beginning, and brought me into realizing what makes me feel good to perform, what makes me feel good to sing, to write about. Because he believed in bringing that part of myself to life, I started to believe in it, too.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nigro performing in 2010 with As Tall as Lions, the emo band he formed with high school friends on Long Island.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joey Foley/FilmMagic, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In early August, Nigro joined a crowd of 100,000-plus Lollapalooza attendees in Chicago, where Roan performed “Pink Pony Club” amid a sea of pink cowboy hats, a remarkable scene that’s played out in various fields across the country this past festival season. “That is how you’re supposed to perform ‘Pink Pony Club,’” Nigro said. “In front of thousands of people singing it at the top of their lungs. It feels right. Which is crazy,” he acknowledged, thinking back to where the two started. “But that is what it was made for.”</p><p>Nigro, 42, was seated in the living room of his home studio in East L.A., where he co-wrote and produced three of the epochal pop albums of the decade: Olivia Rodrigo’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/arts/music/olivia-rodrigo-sour-review.html" title="">“Sour”</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/arts/music/olivia-rodrigo-guts.html" title="">“Guts,”</a> and Roan’s “Midwest Princess.” He had lived in this modest two-bedroom ranch house with his wife until he struck it big with Rodrigo. The couple and their young daughter now reside a few miles away, but Nigro still works out of the old place, where one small bedroom has become the “live room,” cluttered with a drum set, piano and an array of guitars; the garage is the “writing room,” dominated by a studio console and adorned with dozens of Polaroids of the artists who have recorded here, including one signed in gold Sharpie: “Kayleigh, Sept. 2020.”</p><p>Nigro doesn’t exactly look or act the part of a main-pop-girl whisperer, but alongside Taylor Swift’s longtime writer-producer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/arts/music/jack-antonoff-bleachers-lorde-interview.html" title="">Jack Antonoff</a> and Billie Eilish’s brother, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/arts/music/finneas-optimist.html" title="">Finneas</a>, he is one of the principal architects of today’s female-driven Top 40. Cherubic, with an easy laugh and a nervous habit of tugging at his T-shirt while he speaks, he gives off strong normie vibes. He proudly showed off his new haircut, a mildly mullet-ish ’do which, he noted, marks his first tonsorial change in decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“People post photos of me from my emo band days, 20 years ago, and my hair has always been the same,” he said. “This is the most risqué haircut I’ve ever had.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nigro, with Roan at the ASCAP Awards in May, is expected to compete for several trophies at the Grammys in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Tran/AFP, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Nigro was born and raised in Massapequa Park, on Long Island’s south shore. His mother was a homemaker, his father the owner of an office supply company. “My dad really wanted me to be his paper salesman,” he said. “It was very much like ‘The Office.’”</p><p>After discovering emo acts such as Saves the Day and the Get Up Kids in his late teens, he and some high school friends formed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdI5g2rx_a6aQhifu3HNMw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As Tall as Lions</a>, with Nigro as frontman and guitarist. His bandmate Saen Fitzgerald mostly handled the lyrics, while Nigro honed his talent in crafting melodies and hooks. Today, he said, “I tend to work with artists like Olivia and Chappell who are lyric driven, because my strongest suit is chords and melody. It’s like finding puzzle pieces that fit together.”</p><p>In an email, Rodrigo said, “Dan always knows exactly what a song is lacking, even when it’s something as little as changing a chord voicing or as big as making the chorus the bridge instead.” Asked how his emo-band past prepared him for working with young female singer-songwriters, Rodrigo, 21, replied, “Dan definitely understands what it’s like to have big angsty feelings.”</p><p>As Tall as Lions put out a handful of independently released EPs and albums, and toured the country on the alt-rock circuit, opening for bands like Cage the Elephant and Mutemath. “I liked making music,” said Nigro, “but we were, like, 25, and still living with our parents.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A childhood friend, Justin Raisen, had moved to Los Angeles and was working as a writer with another onetime band member turned producer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/arts/music/musings-of-ariel-rechtshaid-grammy-nominee.html" title="">Ariel Rechtshaid</a>, and Nigro quit his group and moved into Rechtshaid’s guesthouse in Echo Park. “That sounds so glamorous now, but it wasn’t,” Rechtshaid quipped. Soon, under Rechtshaid’s tutelage, the three were collaborating on a variety of projects, including Ferreira’s acclaimed debut LP.</p><p>“Dan just has a knack for songwriting,” said Rechtshaid, a three-time Grammy winner who’s helmed projects for Haim and Vampire Weekend and collaborated with Adele and Charli XCX. “He’s always been interested in what makes a great song, but also in songs that don’t necessarily sound like anything else that’s working in pop music.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I can always tell when I’m making something that feels like a big thing, because I start to get really nervous,” Nigro said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Peyton Fulford for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Nevertheless, it took time for Nigro to find his place. Contemporary pop music often employs an assembly-line, songwriting-by-committee approach. “I didn’t like the whole speed-dating aspect of making music,” Nigro said, referring in part to songwriter camps, wherein songs are hastily generated and then shopped en masse to various artists in need of material. “You have no control over your song, or your career, really. It’s very taxing on the soul.”</p><p>While he enjoyed writing for other people, Nigro wanted more of a connection to the finished material, something that resembled the feeling he had writing and recording with bandmates. He found that as co-writer and producer on little-heard albums by Alex Winston, Miynt and Lo Moon, and then through his work with the vlogger-turned-singer-songwriter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/arts/music/conan-gray-superache.html" title="">Conan Gray</a>, whose 2020 LP, “Kid Krow,” debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Gray was friends with Rodrigo, then a Disney star who followed Nigro on Instagram because of his work with Gray. “Someone said to me, ‘Are you working with Olivia Rodrigo?’ and I was like, ‘Who is she?’” Nigro recounted. He listened to her song “Happier,” which she’d posted online, and was “blown away.” He sent her a direct message, they clicked, and not long thereafter, they’d written her breakthrough, “Drivers License.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I can always tell when I’m making something that feels like a big thing, because I start to get really nervous,” Nigro said of recording “Drivers License.” “Excitement turns into anxiety, because I don’t want to be hurt if the label doesn’t like it. When I texted the demo to the Interscope A&amp;R, he wrote back ‘whoa.’ Whoa? Is that good?” It was: The breakup ballad debuted at No. 1, turned Rodrigo into a star overnight and catapulted Nigro into the upper echelon of producers.</p><p>One of the reasons Rodrigo wanted to work with Nigro was because of his early recordings with Roan. “I remember hearing ‘Pink Pony Club’ even before I met Dan and thinking it was incredible,” Rodrigo said. Through Nigro, the two musicians became friends, with a pre-stardom Roan singing backup on a few Rodrigo tunes, and then, following the release of “Midwest Princess,” opening shows on Rodrigo’s arena tour supporting “Guts.”</p><p>Nigro is no Svengali; he is quick to assert that he works both with and for Rodrigo and Roan, young women with big ideas and a strong sense of self. “I’ll help them if they want my opinion on how to word something, but it’s their story to tell,” he said. “Sometimes it’s not my place to say anything. Both Olivia and Chappell, they’re in charge.”</p><p>Roan noted, “I think the age gap and generation gap work to our advantage because Dan and I come from different perspectives on music and culture. It only strengthens the world that we build.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Both Olivia and Chappell, they’re in charge,” Nigro is quick to note. He and Roan are working on her follow-up to “Midwest Princess.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Peyton Fulford for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In July, Roan and Nigro started work on the follow-up to “Midwest Princess.” “I can talk about it because she’s talked about it,” he said, ever mindful of his behind-the-curtains role. He referenced one “fun, up-tempo country song” that includes “a fiddle. I’ll say that much. It’s a new version of Chappell.” Nigro said they have five new tracks, including “The Subway,” a song Roan has been performing in concert, plus “a couple of ballads and a mid-tempo rock song.”</p><p>Making the follow-up to a breakthrough album “is not easy,” he admitted. Often, artists fall into the trap of writing about the dark side of their newly gilded life, which can leave audiences cold. So far, Nigro said, “that hasn’t come up in any songs. We’re still writing from a really fun place. We’ll see what happens.”</p><p>In February, Nigro will likely compete for a multitude of Grammy Awards, including producer of the year, non-classical (alongside the three-time winner Antonoff), and album and song prizes for Roan’s “Midwest Princess” and her post-LP hit single, “Good Luck, Babe!,” written with Roan and Justin Tranter. Given his stature, Nigro can surely cherry-pick among music’s A-plus-list for his next projects.</p><p>“I have the artists I like, and I work with them,” he said. “But I’m on the lookout for a new artist, someone undiscovered. I think my forte is helping an artist find their sound and creating a safe environment for them to be the best version of themselves.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Find the Right Soundtrack for You</h2><h3>Trying to expand your musical horizons?
