But Mr. Kavelashvili was backed by the conservative Georgian Dream party, which has held a majority in Parliament for over a decade and steered the small Caucasus nation away from the European Union and closer to Russia and China.</p><p>The vote sets up a standoff between Mr. Kavelashvili, who is to assume office in 15 days, and the outgoing president, Salome Zourabichvili, who has sided with the opposition and vowed to stay in office until new elections are held. In a <a href="https://x.com/Zourabichvili_S/status/1867844422152728648" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a>, she called the result a “mockery of democracy,” comparing it to the way Georgia’s leaders were chosen when the country was part of the Soviet Union. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is unclear what she could do to prevent Mr. Kavelashvili from taking his seat. On Nov. 30, she insisted that “there will be no inauguration and my mandate continues.” But on Dec. 3, Georgia’s constitutional court rejected a challenge to the elections filed by Ms. Zourabichvili and opposition groups.</p><p>Ms. Zourabichvili, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/world/europe/georgia-president-salome-zurabishvili.html" title="">elected by Georgia’s final popular vote</a> for president, is pro-Western, while Mr. Kavelashvili espouses strongly anti-Western views. He claimed several times this year that Western intelligence agencies were conspiring to push Georgia into conflict with Moscow, which ruled Georgia as part of the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union, until 1991.</p><p>Russia, which fought <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/world/europe/georgia-uproar-2008-war-russia.html" title="">a five-day war with Georgia in 2008</a>, still seeks influence over the strategically located Black Sea country.</p><p>Georgia has been racked by political crisis since May, when Georgian Dream lawmakers passed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/world/europe/georgia-foreign-agents-law-passes.html" title="">law on “foreign influence”</a> co-written by Mr. Kavelashvili.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The law requires nongovernmental groups and media organizations that receive at least 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as organizations “pursuing the interests of a foreign power.” Its opponents argue it was modeled on a 2012 Russian law on “foreign agents,” which the Kremlin has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/world/europe/russia-foreign-agents-law.html" title="">used as part of a broad crackdown</a> on rights groups, news outlets and others.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters clashed with police outside the parliament in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daro Sulakauri for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The crisis in Georgia further deepened after the elections in October, which were followed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/europe/georgia-tbilisi-protest.html" title="">weeks of street protests</a>. Last month, the prime minister, who occupies a more powerful position than the president and is a member of the Georgian Dream party, said that Georgia would be suspending its work toward membership in the European Union, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/europe/protests-georgia-tbilisi.html" title="">sparking another round</a> of protests. </p><p>On Friday, following repeated clashes between protesters and the police, Parliament <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/georgian-parliament-bans-face-masks-fireworks-protests-2024-12-13/#:~:text=TBILISI%2C%20Dec%2013%20(Reuters),civilians%20at%20pro%2DEU%20protests." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed a law</a> that bans face coverings and the use of fireworks at public demonstrations.</p><p>Ahead of the vote to install Mr. Kavelashvili, hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the parliament, according to videos on social media. Some kicked soccer balls, while others reportedly brought their college diplomas, an allusion to the criticism that the former soccer player lacks a university degree.</p><p>Mr. Kavelashvili entered parliament with Georgian Dream in 2016 but left in 2022 to co-found People’s Power, an anti-Western party. He was nominated for the presidency by Georgian Dream’s honorary chairman, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/business/georgia-oligarch-bidzina-ivanishvili.html" title="">wealthy businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili</a>, who made his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/bidzina-ivanishvili/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$7.7 billion fortune</a> largely in banking, metals and Russian real estate. His ties there are often cited by protesters as a reason for the party’s pro-Russian policies.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Valerie Hopkins covers the war in Ukraine and how the conflict is changing Russia, Ukraine, Europe and the United States.
