The presidential limousine was accompanied to the Royal Court in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, by riders on Arabian horses. Musical horns blasted. An honor guard stood at attention as Prince Mohammed guided Mr. Trump into the court along a long, lavender carpet.</p><p>The president couldn’t stop smiling, and understandably so. The Saudi royals are his friends and allies. They are his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/eric-donald-jr-trump-family-deals.html" title="">family’s business partners</a>. More than most, they understand his tastes and desires.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I really believe we like each other a lot,” Mr. Trump said, as he sat beside the crown prince inside the king’s executive office.</p><p>As he strolled with Prince Mohammed through the Royal Court, the president appeared impressed by his surroundings. Gold leaf was everywhere: the moldings and the tables and the legs of the blue velvet armchairs were all gilded.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who has likened the United States to a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rWF4Bpp2e34" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">super luxury store</a>,” has been installing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/16/politics/oval-office-gold-decor-trump" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar gold</a> décor throughout the Oval Office.

Truman. Saudi officials invoked the 1945 meeting between the king and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which was described as a defining encounter “that laid the foundation for a lasting diplomatic relationship between the two nations.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Masked staff waiting for President Trump and Prince Mohammed before lunch in the dining room at the Royal Court in Riyadh.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Trump and Prince Mohammed were then escorted to the stage while dramatic music played. After the crown prince spoke, Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the U.S.A.” played for several minutes, while Mr. Trump listened with approval, singing along with the last line.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The long day of royal treatment for Mr. Trump began from the moment he stepped off Air Force One at the Royal Terminal, a special section for V.I.P.s at King Khalid International Airport.</p><p>Prince Mohammed greeted the president at the airport, signifying the special status Mr. Trump enjoys with Saudi Arabia. When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/world/middleeast/biden-mbs-saudi-visit.html" title="">President Biden visited in 2022</a> — after saying he would make the kingdom a “pariah,” and then realizing he needed its help to lower oil prices — the crown prince sent the governor of Mecca to greet him at the airport.</p><p>After sunset, Prince Mohammed appealed to the president’s passion for real estate by taking him on a tour of a major development on the land where his ancestors once lived.</p><p>Diriyah, a historic town above Wadi Hanifah, a river valley on the outskirts of Riyadh, was the original seat of power of the Saudi royal family, 300 years ago. Today a UNESCO site, the town, with its mud-brick walls, is being restored. Prince Mohammed wants to turn it into a magnet for tourism by building a $60 billion commercial and residential project connected to Riyadh by underground transport.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump and Prince Mohammed touring Diriyah, the ancestral home of the Saudi royal family.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>After showing Mr. Trump his scale model for the site, Prince Mohammed took the steering wheel of a golf cart and drove the president to the state dinner.</p><p>Mr. Trump is staying the first night of his four-day trip at the Ritz-Carlton Riyadh, an imposing hotel set on 52 acres of landscaped gardens. The Riyadh Ritz is the same hotel where Mr. Trump stayed during his first presidential visit eight years ago, and where President Barack Obama stayed in 2014.</p><p>But the hotel is better known as Prince Mohammed’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/middleeast/ritz-carlton-riyadh-saudi-princes.html" title="">five-star prison</a>. In 2017, he used the Ritz-Carlton to detain opponents, including government ministers, businessmen and members of his own royal family.</p><p>The crown prince was carrying out what he described as a corruption crackdown. Others viewed it as a consolidation of power and an omen for his future reign.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jonathan Swan is a White House reporter for The Times, covering the administration of Donald J.
