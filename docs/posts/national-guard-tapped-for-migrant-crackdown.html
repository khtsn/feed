If the request is approved, it will be the first time National Guard troops are used to help enforce an immigration crackdown in the U.S.</p><p>The troops would add to a broader effort that, in the past four months, has sent thousands of active-duty combat troops and armored Stryker combat vehicles to the southwestern border — as well as U-2 spy planes, surveillance drones and two Navy warships. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/trump-border-military.html" title="">The Pentagon said that the mission had cost $525 million so far</a>.</p><p>The military buildup appears to have deterred cartels. Intelligence officials said that human traffickers were now charging migrants about $20,000 per person, up from $7,000 a year ago. The leader of the U.S. Northern Command recently told Congress that the border mission would probably be “measured in years, not months.”</p><p>But the government’s wider crackdown on immigration faced a challenge in the courts today. The Supreme Court held arguments in a case related to Trump’s move to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented migrants. While the case focused on the power of judges to block policies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/15/us/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship" title="">several justices seemed troubled</a> by the legality and the consequences of Trump’s executive order.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Samuel Granados/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-49e7ee34">Israel is razing Rafah</h2><p>Last year, a million Palestinians fled to Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, to escape the brunt of Israel’s bombardment in the war against Hamas.
