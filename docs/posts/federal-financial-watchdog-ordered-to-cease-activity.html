In his email to staff on Saturday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/scott-bessent-consumer-bureau-trump.html" title="">he reaffirmed earlier instructions</a> from the previous acting director, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who ordered last week that staff should not issue any new rules or guidance and cease all investigations.</p><p>“As acting director, I am committed to implementing the president’s policies, consistent with the law, and acting as a faithful steward of the bureau’s resources,” Mr. Vought wrote in the email, which was obtained by The New York Times.</p><p> The agency, created by Congress in 2011 as a financial industry watchdog, cannot be closed without congressional action, but its director can freeze most of its actions by halting enforcement, weakening or repealing regulations and softening its supervision of banks and other lenders. The agency did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The agency has issued a number of high-profile regulations and enforcement actions over the years, seeking to strengthen safeguards on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/business/berkshire-hathaway-buffett-mortgages.html" title="">mortgages</a>, credit cards, loans and other consumer finance. Most recently, the bureau <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/business/capital-one-cfpb-lawsuit.html" title="">sued Capital One in mid-January</a>, arguing that the bank misled customers in promoting a high-yield savings account that it then kept at a near-zero interest rate.</p><p>In a Saturday evening post on X, Mr. Vought, an author of Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for radically remaking the federal government, wrote that he had notified the Federal Reserve that the finance bureau “will not be taking its next draw of unappropriated funding because it is not ‘reasonably necessary’ to carry out its duties.” (The agency is directly funded by the Federal Reserve, outside the usual congressional appropriations process.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the union representing the consumer protection bureau’s employees protested outside the agency’s Washington headquarters on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathan Howard/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The Bureau’s current balance of $711.6 million is in fact excessive in the current fiscal environment,” he added in <a href="https://x.com/russvought/status/1888418946455589013" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his post</a>. “This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off,” he said, using the agency’s initials.</p><p>On Saturday, some members of the union representing the consumer protection bureau’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hamiltonnolan.bsky.social/post/3lholnyskis2i" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">employees protested</a> outside the agency’s Washington building with signs mocking Elon Musk, whose government efficiency effort has wreaked havoc across various federal agencies. Several members of Mr. Musk’s team arrived at the agency on Friday morning and gained access to its headquarters and computer systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Later that day, Mr. Musk posted “CFPB RIP,” with an emoji of a gravestone, on X.
