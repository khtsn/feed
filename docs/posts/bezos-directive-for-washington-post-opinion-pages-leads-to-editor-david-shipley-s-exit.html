And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical; it drives creativity, invention and prosperity.”</p><p>In his note, Mr. Bezos said that he had asked Mr. Shipley whether he wanted to stay at The Post, and Mr. Shipley declined.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t ‘hell yes,’ then it had to be ‘no,’” Mr. Bezos wrote.</p><p>In a note to opinion staff members, Mr. Shipley said that he decided to step down “after reflection on how I can best move forward in the profession I love.”</p><p>“I will always be thankful for the opportunity I was given to work alongside a team of opinion journalists whose commitment to strong, innovative, reported commentary inspired me every day,” Mr. Shipley wrote.</p><p>Mr. Bezos’ decision to curtail the scope of views on The Post’s opinion pages is a major departure from the newspaper’s decades-long approach to commentary and criticism. Under Mr. Shipley and his predecessor, Fred Hiatt, The Post has published a wide variety of views from the left and the right, including liberal stalwarts like David Ignatius and Ruth Marcus and conservative voices like George Will and Charles Krauthammer.</p><p>The new direction envisioned for The Post’s opinion section appears to be a rightward shift for the paper. Mr. Bezos’ new focus echoes what has long been the informal tagline of The Wall Street Journal’s conservative opinion pages: “Free markets, free people.”</p><p>Will Lewis, The Post’s chief executive, said in a memo to staff that changes to the opinion section were “not about siding with any political party.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper,” Mr. Lewis wrote. “Doing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans.”</p><p>In his note, Mr. Lewis said that The Post would be naming a replacement for Mr. Shipley and that he would make arrangements for an interim editor. </p><p>The change was announced after a weekslong dialogue between Mr. Bezos, Mr. Lewis and Mr. Shipley. In January, Mr. Lewis sent a memo to Mr. Shipley summarizing Mr. Bezos’ new vision for the opinion section, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.</p><p>In response, Mr. Shipley expressed reservations about Mr. Bezos’ new approach for a variety of reasons, the people said. Among his misgivings: The Post’s ecumenical approach to commentary made the coverage unique and valuable, and putting out a daily section with quality writing on a narrower set of views could be challenging.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to his exit, Mr. Shipley had suggested compromises to incorporate Mr. Bezos’ approach but also ensure The Post’s opinion section could still publish a variety of viewpoints. In the end, Mr. Shipley told the owner of the newspaper that he didn’t think Mr. Bezos’ decision was the right one for The Post, or for him, according to the two people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Wednesday’s announcement led to immediate and public pushback from members of The Post’s opinion and news staff. Jeff Stein, The Post’s chief economics reporter, called it a “massive encroachment” on The Post’s opinion staff that made clear “dissenting views will not be published or tolerated there.”</p><p>“I still have not felt encroachment on my journalism on the news side of coverage, but if Bezos tries interfering with the news side I will be quitting immediately and letting you know,” Mr. Stein wrote on X.</p><p>The discontent at The Post became clear during an emotional meeting held by Mr. Shipley with the opinion staff Wednesday morning. Over the course of an hour, Mr. Shipley fielded questions from his employees, who were shocked and stunned at the sudden turn of events, according to two people with knowledge of the talks.</p><p>During the meeting, Mr. Shipley said that he couldn’t tell employees what the future of The Post’s opinion section would be for sure, adding that he was grateful to Mr. Bezos for “being forthright.”</p><p>“A focused report is the one that he thinks is the road to differentiation,” Mr. Shipley said, according to the two people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Shipley’s departure is the latest in a series of destabilizing moves to rock The Post in the past year. In October, after Mr. Bezos ended The Post’s tradition of endorsing presidential candidates, several Post opinions staff members decried the decision. Thousands of people canceled their subscriptions, forcing The Post to adopt a “win-back” strategy to bring them back as paying customers.</p><p>It was not immediately clear how the abrupt changes would affect the current staff of the opinion section, some of whom are known for espousing progressive views. Some well-known liberal opinion journalists, including Jennifer Rubin, have already left the newspaper in recent months. Ann Telnaes, The Post’s opinion cartoonist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/business/media/washington-post-cartoonist-quits-after-jeff-bezos-cartoon-is-killed.html" title="">said she was quitting</a> the newspaper in January after one of her cartoons critical of Mr. Bezos was killed.</p><p>Mr. Shipley is a veteran opinion editor with experience at organizations including The New York Times and Bloomberg Opinion. Since he joined The Washington Post in 2022, the newspaper has won two Pulitzer Prizes and two Loeb Awards.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
