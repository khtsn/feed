		<p>The groups for VCT Americas have been rearranged ahead of Stage 2. Three pairs of teams from Group Alpha and Group Omega switched sides, mixing up the outlook for league play to end the regional season. Unlike in 2024, group stage results for each stage are now independent from one another, meaning teams get a clean slate in their hopes of qualifying for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions 2025</a> through Stage 2.</p>









<p>For the draw, teams were placed into three different pools, with the first and second seed teams in the first pool, the third and fourth seed teams in the second pool, and the fifth and sixth seed teams in the third pool. One pairing was selected from each pool, which designated which pair switched groups. The first seed was picked from the first pool, meaning G2 Esports and KRÜ Esports switch groups. The third seed was picked from the second pool, meaning Cloud9 and 100 Thieves switch groups. Finally, the sixth seed was picked from the final pool, meaning LOUD and FURIA switch.</p>

<p>Seedings for the draw were based purely on group stage results, the newly mixed groups make for some eye-catching matchups. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2347/champions-tour-2025-americas-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> grand finalists G2 Esports and Sentinels will go head to head in Group Alpha, which has three of the highest-finishing teams from the United States, with Evil Geniuses also in the mix. Meanwhile, Group Omega looks to be a South American brawl, as KRÜ lead the pack against <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/champions-tour-2025-masters-toronto" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>-bound MIBR, and a rebuilding pair of teams in LEVIATÁN and LOUD.</p>

<p>Stage 2 is set to begin on July 18. The top two teams from the playoffs qualify directly to Champions 2025, while the rest of the region must keep a close eye on championship points.</p>
