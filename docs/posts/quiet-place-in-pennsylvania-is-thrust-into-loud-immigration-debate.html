The people were welcoming, the rent was cheap, and he soon moved up the job ranks at a food processing plant, allowing him to send money to his wife and children back in Liberia.</p><p>Three years later, things now feel drastically different.</p><p>A rapid influx of immigrants like Mr. Vougar into Charleroi over the past two years, many of them fleeing violence in Haiti, has led to the kind of discord now being seen in towns across the country that for years were relatively untouched by immigration. Former President Donald J. Trump fanned the flames this month, claiming that immigrants had brought “massive crime” to Charleroi and asking: “Has your beautiful town changed?”</p><p>To Mr. Vougar, the sudden flood of gripes, fears and rumors from longtime residents has threatened the serene life he thought he had found in the green hills of Charleroi, which lies along a winding river an hour south of Pittsburgh.</p><p>“Things changed greatly,” Mr. Vougar said this week. “All the immigrants in the Charleroi community right now are living in fear.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He found himself growing upset recently when a cashier at a store dismissively assumed that he did not know English.</p><p>Once a glass manufacturing hub, Charleroi had been shrinking for years, as residents watched one employer after another pack up and leave, so Mr. Vougar thought the arrival of immigrants like him would be seen as a boon to the town. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Trump merchandise in the window of a business in downtown Charleroi, Pa.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Many immigrants have opened businesses along the borough’s main avenue, where a store selling Trump apparel stands not far from another selling Pittsburgh Steelers gear. At some of the remaining factories in town that were struggling to find workers, immigrants fill the assembly lines.</p><p>Plenty of longtime residents agreed, applauding what they saw as new lifeblood for the town. But not everyone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A musician said his bandmates were now afraid to venture downtown for jam sessions, fearing that migrants were causing a rise in crime, which local officials said was not true. A woman spoke with contempt about a local grocery store that she said was refusing entry to white people — also not true. And a rumor made its way to the borough manager that a tent city was forming in a pharmacy parking lot, but the only people in the lot on Thursday night were two parents watching their son do loops on a lime-green scooter.</p><p>To be sure, Mr. Vougar said, the arrival of so many new immigrants had changed things in the town. Rents have gone up, he said, and with so many new shoppers, a nearby Walmart store often runs out of things he needs.</p><p>The latest census count, in 2020, put the borough’s population at about 4,200 people. Borough officials estimate that about 2,000 immigrants are now living in Charleroi, many of whom arrived after the last census. That figure includes roughly 700 people from Haiti.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many of the workers who assemble sandwiches at the Fourth Street Foods manufacturing plant are recent immigrants.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Many of the new arrivals moved here to work at a food packing plant, Fourth Street Foods, where a diverse group of migrants assembled breakfast sandwiches and bowls on a recent workday, packing the products into boxes and moving large pallets through fluorescent-lit corridors.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Dave Barbe, the president of the company, said immigrants were working at jobs that he had been unable to fill with American-born workers. Entry-level jobs at the plant could be difficult, he said: monotonous work on a factory floor that must be kept cold — 40 degrees or under, to keep the food safe — and that fewer Americans were willing to do.</p><p>“They just don’t grow on trees anymore,” he said. “I can’t blame a lot of the younger people, because it isn’t a glorious position, starting out, to be on an assembly line. You might put the lids on 60,000 sandwiches a day.”</p><p>Tightening the economic squeeze in town is the <a href="https://www.monvalleyindependent.com/2024/09/06/former-employees-shocked-by-closing-of-charleroi-glass-plant/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected closure</a> of a glass plant that makes Pyrex products. It has been a source of community pride, hearkening back to the borough’s more bountiful industrial days, and its demise would mean a loss of more than 300 jobs in Charleroi.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joe Manning, the borough manager of Charleroi, said people in town were upset about the expected closure of a major local employer. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“It’s been a real gut punch to the community, because it’s going to sap away the last fragments of this town’s identity,” said Joe Manning, the borough manager. “People are sort of disaffected that their lifestyles have changed, that their industry is gone, and so they look for someone to blame.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Manning said he believed that most Charleroi natives had been welcoming to the recent migrants, but he worried that Mr. Trump had given a “license” to residents who are most opposed to immigration.</p><p>Still, he and others said they were baffled by the attention that their town has received since Charleroi (pronounced SHAR-luh-roy) first came to Mr. Trump’s attention. (“What a beautiful name,” Mr. Trump said, pausing before he read it from a teleprompter the first time he mentioned it at a rally. “But it’s not so beautiful now.”)</p><p>“Charleroi’s been a quiet place, and it is still a quiet place,” said Getro Bernabe, a former member of the Haitian Coast Guard who became Charleroi’s first immigrant community liaison last year. Mr. Bernabe said many immigrants had come to town after hearing from others about job opportunities and a low cost of living.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Charleroi’s been a quiet place, and it is still a quiet place,” said Getro Bernabe, the borough’s immigrant liaison.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Now, as the town has been thrust into the national spotlight, he said he has increasingly been hearing from immigrants who are anxious, and who ask him whether it is safe to send their children to the local schools.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The Charleroi schools sit far up on a hill north of town, on a campus surrounded by thick trees, and in many ways are an oasis from the political strife below. When classes let out at the elementary school on a recent day, the biggest challenge seemed to be getting the children to stop running as they raced to the buses. A Haitian child implored another in Haitian Creole to share his spicy Doritos chips.</p><p>Administrators have struggled to handle the surge of new students. They have had to expand English learning programs, restructure classrooms and find new ways to communicate with parents.</p><p>A few years ago, the percentage of elementary school students enrolled in English-learning classes in the district was in the low single digits. Now, in kindergarten — the grade with the highest figure — the share is about 35 percent, according to Mark Killinger, who serves as principal for kindergarten through second grade and coordinates the district’s English-learning program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Charleroi public schools have seen an influx of students from immigrant families. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“We’re just like, ‘Oh my gosh, what are we going to do?’” he said. “It was just kind of a shock to the system.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Space is so tight that one English language teacher is working with students in a closet at the back of a classroom.</p><p>At a time when many rural schools are losing students and shutting down, an increase in population is a good problem to have, Mr. Killinger said. But it has taken long hours of extra work to ensure that students are getting everything they need.</p><p>He acknowledged that some local parents had pulled their children out of the public schools over concerns about the arrival of immigrant students, opting for online classes or charter schools instead.</p><p>Joeby Charlecin, a high school senior who grew up in Haiti and arrived in Charleroi a year and a half ago, vividly recalls the frightening conditions in his homeland that made his family feel that staying there was untenable. Men in gangs once arrived outside his younger sister’s school and sent students into a panic, he said. On another day, Mr. Charlecin, 18, learned that a friend of his late father had been killed and mutilated by a gang.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joeby Charlecin, 18, often helps bridge cultures at Charleroi High School, where he is a senior.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Mr. Charlecin said he had felt a sense of gratitude and determination when he arrived in Charleroi.</p><p>“I was like, I’ve got a chance that a lot of people will never have,” he said. “Probably, right now, there’s someone dying back in my country who will never have this chance that I’ve got.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>He taught himself English, first by watching YouTube videos and then moving on to Netflix. Eventually he put his knowledge to the test by trying to flirt with girls — and asking, at the end of each conversation, “Do you think my English is good?”</p><p>As his skills improved, teachers began turning to him at times to help translate for other Haitian students. Some people at the school have come to call him “the mayor” for his willingness to help bridge cultures. He took jobs at K.F.C. and then a bowling alley to save up for a car.</p><p>He said he was well aware of what Mr. Trump had said about Charleroi, and was concerned about the idea that politicians might want to send Haitian immigrants back to their home country. “I’ve already invested a lot here,” he said.</p><p>But for the most part, he said, he is trying to keep his head down and focus on his own future.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Workers unloaded boxes of produce at the Queen’s Market in Charleroi, which caters to immigrants. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Among those in town who have welcomed the change with open arms is Amy Nelson, an assistant principal for sixth through 12th grades, who took in a 6-year-old Haitian girl whose mother died of cancer shortly after they immigrated.</p><p>Ms. Nelson said the girl quickly became part of her family, even though she struggles with the trauma of the journey to America and her mother’s death.</p><p>The girl has had to learn not to gorge herself after years of going without enough food, she said, and Ms. Nelson has had to learn how to braid her hair.</p><p>Charleroi has always been a close-knit town, almost to a fault, she said. The recent talk about the immigrants — nationally and locally — has made her nervous, especially since one is now a member of her family.</p><p>Sometimes, she said, after a day of seeing the children at school managing to get along, she thinks, “I wish the parents acted more like the kids.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs reports on national stories across the United States with a focus on criminal justice.
