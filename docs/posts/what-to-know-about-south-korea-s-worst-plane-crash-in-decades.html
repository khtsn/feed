The plane issued a mayday alert shortly after, he said, then crash-landed.</p><p>The muddy tidal flats near Muan International Airport and much of the west coast of the Korean Peninsula are favorite resting places for migrant birds. <a href="https://www.newsis.com/view/NISI20241229_0020644043" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Photographs in local media</a> showed flocks of birds flying near the airport​ on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People waiting for news about victims of the crash at Muan International Airport.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

That meant the plane was most likely “flying faster than it would normally be in a landing situation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Crashes are often caused by multiple factors, which can take years to uncover through in-depth investigations.</p><h2 id="link-5c1efbb">This was South Korea’s worst passenger plane crash in decades.</h2><p>Sunday’s crash was the worst aviation accident involving a South Korean airline since a Korean Air jet slammed into a hill in Guam, a U.S. territory in the western Pacific, in 1997. That crash killed 229 of the 254 people onboard.</p><p>It also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/asia/south-korea-plane-crash-jeju-air-safety.html" title="">appeared to have been the first fatal crash for Jeju Air</a>, a low-cost South Korean carrier that was established in 2005 and flies to dozens of countries in Asia.</p><p>Two days earlier, the plane involved in the crash had been flying to Beijing from Jeju, a Korean island south of the mainland, when it had to divert to Seoul, according to the flight tracking site Flightradar24. The diversion was caused by a medical, not technical, emergency onboard, according to the Incheon International Airport Police Corps.</p><p>After that, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/28/world/south-korea-plane-crash?searchResultPosition=1#south-korea-plane-crash-jeju-air-safety" title="">plane flew 10 flights</a> between South Korea, Malaysia, Japan, China, Taiwan and Thailand without incident, according to Flightradar24, before Sunday morning’s crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The chief executive of Jeju Air, Kim E-bae, center right, and other company officials, bowing in apology ahead of a news conference on Sunday in Seoul.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yonhap, via EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In 2021, the South Korean authorities investigated Jeju Air after one of its planes flew despite having a defect, according to reports in the domestic news media. A tip of one of its wings was damaged during a landing, but the crew failed to notice the damage and the plane took off again, The Korea Herald reported.</p><p>Last year, the airline received a safety grade of A, or “very good,” from the South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport’s annual review of domestic airlines. The score is based on the number of accidents or near accidents. The highest grade any airline got that year was A++, and the lowest was B+.</p><h2 id="link-2456915b">The Boeing 737-800 has a strong safety record.</h2><p>The Jeju Air plane that crashed was a Boeing 737-800, a model that is used widely around the world and is a staple of low-cost airlines. There are about 4,400 Boeing 737-800s in service globally, according to Cirium, an aviation data provider. That’s about 15 percent of the passenger planes operating globally.</p><p>“The plane in question is very safe and has a good safety record,” said Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of engineering at the University of Southern California who has studied the safety history of the Boeing 737 line.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>It was possible that the plane’s landing gear did not deploy because of a “maintenance” problem, he said, though he said he would not rule out a bird strike as a cause.</p><p>Mr. Meshkati said that the Boeing 737-800’s landing gear was well designed and had a history of reliability.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
