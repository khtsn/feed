The suit, which identifies the women only as Jane Does 1 through 4, says Mr. Robinson raped them repeatedly while his wife, Frances, who is a co-defendant, turned a blind eye.</p><p>In a statement provided to The New York Times, Mr. Robinson’s lawyer,<strong> </strong>Christopher Frost, called the suit “an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.”</p><p>“We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold,” Mr. Frost said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The lawsuit, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/smokey-robinson-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html" title="">which was filed on Tuesday</a> in Superior Court in Los Angeles, says that three of the women feared reporting Mr. Robinson to the authorities because of their immigration status. “As low-wage workers in vulnerable positions, they lacked the resources and options necessary to protect themselves from sexual assaults throughout their tenure as employees for the Robinsons,” their lawyer, John Harris, said on Tuesday.</p><p>The lawsuit goes into graphic detail about the abuse claims.</p><p>Mr. Robinson, it alleges, would drop off his wife at a nail salon and rush home to assault one of the women while she was alone in the Robinsons’ house in Chatsworth, a Los Angeles neighborhood.</p><p>A second woman, the suit says, was sexually assaulted at least 23 times during the six years she worked for the Robinsons, from 2014 to 2020.</p><p>The suit says that a third woman, who worked for the Robinsons from 2012 to 2024, was sexually assaulted at least 20 times. The fourth plaintiff, who says she worked for the couple from 2006 until April 2024, said she was sexually assaulted by Mr. Robinson at the Chatsworth house and at several of his other homes.</p><p>The women’s lawyers have not said whether their clients intend to pursue criminal charges. A spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, which covers the area where the lawsuit notes that the assaults occurred, said it had not opened an investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In his statement, Mr. Frost said that he and his legal team would soon ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit and would “have more to say on this matter.”</p><p>Mr. Robinson and the musical group he led, the Miracles, were Motown royalty, writing and performing some of the biggest hits in the record company’s catalog. Either alone or with others, he wrote a slew of classic songs: “Shop Around,” “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me,” “The Tracks of My Tears,” “Going to a Go-Go,” “I Second That Emotion” and “The Tears of a Clown.”</p><p>He also wrote or co-wrote songs for other artists, including “My Girl,” which was a hit for the Temptations, and “My Guy,” for Mary Wells.</p><p>Mr. Robinson has been honored by the Recording Academy, the Kennedy Center and the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. </p><p>He recently released a new album titled “What the World Needs Now” and has been on a media blitz to promote it. He is next scheduled to perform on Friday in Biloxi, Miss., at a 1,600-seat casino theater. </p><p>Orlando Mayorquín<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matt Stevens writes about arts and culture news for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
