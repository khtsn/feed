Last month, his family business began selling “Trump 2028” merchandise — some with the phrase “Rewrite the Rules” — that added to the speculation.</p><p>On Sunday, the interviewer, Kristen Welker, asked Mr. Trump about that merchandise, and the president insisted that many people wanted him to seek another term before he played down the idea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you’re not allowed to do,” he said before adding that he did not know if the prohibition — which is part of the Constitution — was constitutional.</p><p>“There are many people selling the 2028 hat, but this is not something I’m looking to do,” he said. “I’m looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican.”</p><p>Four years, Mr. Trump added, was enough time to do something “really spectacular.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Arts and Humanities:</strong> President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/arts/nea.html">proposed eliminating</a> the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities in the budget he released, taking aim once again at two agencies that he had tried and failed to get rid of during his first term.</p></li><li><p><strong>C.I.A.
