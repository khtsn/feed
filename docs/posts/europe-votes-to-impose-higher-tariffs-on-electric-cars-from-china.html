    <h1>Europe Votes to Impose Higher Tariffs on Electric Cars From China</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The European Union voted on Friday to impose higher tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, risking tensions with an important trading partner in an effort to protect an industry crucial to Europe’s economy.</p><p>The decision, which puts billions of dollars of trade at stake, is the bloc’s biggest response yet to concerns that European automakers are being undercut by Chinese competitors, whose electric vehicles, batteries and other goods are heavily subsidized by the government.</p><p>The tariffs, which go into effect on Oct. 31 and last for five years, range from 9 to 35.3 percent and come on top of an existing 10 percent duty on all automotive imports. But both European and Chinese officials have said they remain in negotiations to reach an agreement on the issue.</p><p>“The E.U. and China continue to work hard to explore an alternative solution,” the commission said in a statement on Friday, adding that any deal would have to be enforceable and within the rules set by the World Trade Organization.</p></div></div>
