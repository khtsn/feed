I just wish it were easier to get around.”</p><p>Sally Neal, a Long Islander, said she’s seen crowds grow since the 1970s, when she attended the tournament as a child when it was held in Forest Hills. (On average, about 10,900 people would attend a session at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills between 1968 and 1977.)</p><p>But this year, Ms. Neal said, has been especially crowded, particularly at the gift shops around the grounds.</p><p>“It’s like Black Friday at Walmart,” she said.</p><h2 id="link-7adaec70">Fans Who Show Up</h2><p>Fans have four ticket options to attend the U.S. Open. They can pay for a seat at one of the three stadiums — Arthur Ashe, Louis Armstrong and the Grandstand. Or they can purchase a grounds pass, a general admission ticket that allows fans to bounce around the outer courts and offers first-come-first-served admission to matches in Louis Armstrong Stadium.</p><p>Some fans, like Nicole Karagheuzoff, a New Yorker who attended the tournament on Tuesday with Ms. Neal, suspect that the tournament has sold too many grounds passes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Karagheuzoff, who by her estimate has attended the U.S. Open about 30 times, said she had noticed crowding around the outer courts, where she likes to watch doubles matches.</p><p>“It’s so hard to get a seat,” she said.</p><p>John Chen, 25, of Boston, who attended the tournament on Wednesday with his friends, also said that he thought the tournament had sold too many grounds passes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The U.S. Open used to be held in Forest Hills, Queens, in a much smaller stadium.

Someone with a ticket to sit in Arthur Ashe might also spend time outside the stadium to see a lower-ranked player, Mr. Zausner said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>More fans now watch matches in the outer courts, where lower-ranked players compete.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adrienne Grunwald for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Those without a ticket to the finals can buy a grounds pass for $28 this year for the first time.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“To be able to watch a lot of great tennis is a joy,” one attendee said. “I just wish it were easier to get around.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">José A. Alvarado Jr. for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“They’re gravitating — whether it’s Court 5 or it’s Court 16 — to go watch a player because they know something about them,” Mr. Zausner said. “As opposed to saying, ‘I’m going into Ashe because I know that Carlos Alcaraz is playing.’”</p><p>The grounds become especially crammed when matches end around the same time.</p><p>On Thursday, a match between Caroline Dolehide and Sara Errani on Court 7, with seating for 1,494, ended almost at the same time as a match between Mirra Andreeva and Ashlyn Krueger in the adjacent Grandstand Stadium, which has a capacity of 8,125. As fans left both courts, they created a bottleneck of bodies looking for bathrooms, refills on drinks or another match to watch.</p><p>“That’s just inertia. You can’t do anything about that,” Mr. Zausner said. “There’s no question that you create a crowd in that area, but that’s like when you go to Madison Square Garden and then the game ends, or at halftime and everyone rushes to the bathroom.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-3961b995">Quieter at the Finals</h2><p>As the draws dwindle, the second half of the U.S. Open is typically less busy than Week 1. The grounds outside Arthur Ashe are particularly quiet on the last two days of the tournament for the men’s and women’s finals.</p><p>But this year will be different, with the introduction of what has been called the Finals Fan Fest. Those without a ticket to the finals can still buy a grounds pass for $28 that will allow them to walk around and attend a watch party in Louis Armstrong Stadium.</p><p>Before the finals, fans will have more action to follow with the men’s and women’s quarterfinal matches on Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by semifinal matches on Thursday and Friday.</p><p>Gerard Santi, 64, of New York, went to the tournament on Thursday with a ticket to Arthur Ashe, where he watched Jannik Sinner of Italy win a straight-sets match over Alex Michelsen, an American. Mr. Santi said he had tickets to return on Wednesday, but he wasn’t sure if he would make it.</p><p>“They’re squeezing the most out of this thing,” Mr. Santi said. “It’s a business; I get it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The second half of the Open is typically less crowded than the first week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jesus Jiménez covers breaking news, online trends and other subjects.
