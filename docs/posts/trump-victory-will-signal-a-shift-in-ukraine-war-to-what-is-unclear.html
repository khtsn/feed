Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/06/us/trump-election-harris-news" title="">victory in the United States presidential election</a>, Ukrainians now face an all-but-certain American policy shift in the midst of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">a war</a> that is turning against them. Russia has made some of the swiftest territorial advances in recent months, and diplomatic efforts are underway by multiple countries to find a negotiated settlement.</p><p>Mr. Trump will enter office with a record of skepticism, if not outright hostility, to continued U.S. aid to Ukraine, and he has promised that he could end the war in one day — without saying how. It is unclear how any initiative by Mr. Trump would dovetail with existing cease-fire discussions, but his pledge to bring the war to a rapid end has stirred concern in Kyiv that he will pressure Ukraine into an agreement on unfavorable terms.</p><p>“His desire for a deal — and probably a quick one — does not bode well for sustained U.S. support,” the Royal United Services Institute, an analytical group based in London, wrote on Wednesday, referring to Mr. Trump.</p><p>Russia will most likely respond to Trump’s win by pressing its advantage of numbers on the battlefield in anticipation of reduced Western support, the group said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, wrote in a commentary on the American election that the war in Ukraine was less central to U.S. politics than the wars in Vietnam or Korea had been. There, “American boys fought and died,” the site noted.</p><p>Ukraine has said all year that it is prepared to work with either a Republican or Democratic administration, and in September President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine met with Mr. Trump while on a visit to the United States.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky wasted no time in offering his congratulations, <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1854073411904938032" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writing on Wednesday</a> that he appreciated “President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs.”</p><p>“This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer,” he wrote. “I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky, left, with Donald J.

The United States is Ukraine’s single most important <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/us/politics/biden-ukraine-aid.html" title="">benefactor for military and financial support</a>, though taken together, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/business/ukraine-aid-russian-assets.html" title="">the countries of the European Union</a> provide more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump has not only questioned the need to continue to support Ukraine; he has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-bloomberg-putin.html" title="">spoken admiringly</a> of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, while castigating Mr. Zelensky. And Mr. Trump’s pledge to end the war in a day has raised concerns in Kyiv that he would press a peace settlement on unfavorable terms to Ukraine.</p><p>“We’ll see, but I am very skeptical that the war will end quickly, in 24 hours, as Trump promised,” a former economy minister, Tymofiy Mylovanov, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1DPpYTrxBR/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on Facebook</a>. Mr. Mylovanov noted, however, that Ukrainian government bonds were expected to rise in anticipation of a negotiated settlement.</p><p>As Mr. Trump racked up the electoral votes needed to win, the war was still raging in Ukraine. Air alarms sounded in Kyiv, and Ukraine’s general staff headquarters reported that Russia had launched 71 airstrikes by 10 p.m. on Tuesday.</p><p>Ukrainian soldiers viewed the election result as yet another challenge in an increasingly difficult situation.

Pavlo Velychko, reached by phone after returning from an overnight patrol, said that the result could prompt Europe to take a larger role in defending its eastern borders and Ukraine.</p><p>“We should not hope for a miracle from across the ocean,” he said, referring to the United States. “Europe is awakening. That will be a necessary prerequisite for successfully resisting the imperial encroachment of the Russians.”</p><p>Trends on the battlefield have been bleak for months and have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">grown more worrying</a> for Ukraine in recent days.</p><p>Russian advances in the eastern Donbas region, creeping at first, began to accelerate in August and have picked up since. Ukraine, short of soldiers, has resorted to shifting troops between hot spots on the front to hold the line. Early signs of an unraveling are emerging in an army that, despite the odds, had largely held off a much bigger and better-armed adversary for more than two years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The shuffle of soldiers has opened other sectors to attack.

Desertion is a mounting problem. From January to September, Ukrainian prosecutors recorded about 51,000 cases of soldiers being away without leave, more than double the number who deserted the previous year.</p><p>Some of the army’s best troops were committed in August to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion-war.html" title="">attack into the Kursk region</a> of Russia in the hopes of diverting Moscow’s soldiers. But Ukraine has since lost about 40 percent of the territory it occupied there, and Moscow did not redeploy troops from the Donbas.</p><p>Russia has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/31/world/europe/russia-gains-ukraine-maps.html" title="">honed its tactics</a> for a grinding, methodical advance pushing through Ukrainian lines with infantry attacks.

Those soldiers have now joined the fight, according to U.S. and Ukrainian intelligence agencies, raising the specter of a surge in soldiers on the Russian side, though the numbers now deployed are not considered decisive.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said on Monday that 11,000 North Koreans were already in the Kursk region of Russia.</p><p>The wobbly military picture for Ukraine clouds the prospects for a negotiated settlement. Mr. Trump has not said on what terms he would negotiate a halt in hostilities.</p><p>Delicate, multiparty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/europe/ukraine-war-blinken-us-lammy.html" title="">talks are already underway</a> and have gained some traction in recent months. It is unclear how a role for Mr. Trump in mediating would combine with those efforts, according to diplomats involved in the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the efforts.</p><p>Short of an overall cease-fire, Mr. Zelensky has nodded in recent comments to the prospect of side deals to tackle specific issues, like a moratorium by both militaries on strikes on energy infrastructure and an agreement to safeguard commercial shipping in the Black Sea. Russia has been bombarding Ukrainian electrical infrastructure, and Ukraine has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/world/europe/ukraine-russia-oil-depots.html" title="">striking at Russian oil refineries</a> with a fleet of domestically produced, long-range drones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents in Siversk last month.

The current policies have led only to a losing situation on the front, according to Ukrainian officials, military analysts and diplomats. </p><p>Given all of the turns in the war, some Ukrainians took the news of Mr. Trump’s win in stride. “I am sure that it is overblown how important the elections are for Ukraine,” said Natalia Chepeliuk, 43, the director of a restaurant in Kyiv. “We still need to fight for our country no matter who is the U.S. president.”</p><p>Maria Varenikova<!-- -->, <!-- -->Liubov Sholudko<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nataliia Novosolova<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew E.
