A highly credentialed surgeon. A seven-term Florida congressman. A Fox News contributor with her own line of vitamins.</p><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump’s eclectic roster of figures to lead federal health agencies is almost complete — and with it, his vision for a sweeping overhaul is coming into focus.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s choices have varying backgrounds and public health views. But they have all pushed back against Covid policies or supported ideas that are outside the medical mainstream, including an opposition to vaccines. Together, they are a clear repudiation of business as usual.</p><p>“What they’re saying when they make these appointments is that we don’t trust the people who are there,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and an adviser to the Food and Drug Administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Some doctors and scientists are bracing themselves for the gutting of public health agencies, a loss of scientific expertise and the injection of politics into realms once reserved for academics. The result, they fear, could be worse health outcomes, more preventable deaths and a reduced ability to respond to looming health threats, like the next pandemic. “I’m very, very worried about the way that this all plays out,” Dr. Offit said.</p><p>But other experts who expressed concerns about anti-vaccine views at the helms of the nation’s health agencies said that some elements of the picks’ unorthodox approaches were welcomed. After a pandemic that closed schools across the country and killed more than one million Americans, many people have lost faith in science and medicine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/health/trust-science-americans.html" title="">surveys show</a>. And even some prominent public health experts were critical of the agencies’ Covid missteps and muddled messaging on masks and testing.</p><p>“We are playing with fire with the shake-ups and choices, but at this point change is needed,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and former Harvard professor. He said the agencies were often too slow and bureaucratic, and their leaders too unwilling to engage with the public’s concerns. “At least there’s a better chance of positive change compared to complacency and more of the same,” he said.</p><p>One thing seems certain: It will not be more of the same.</p><p>In the final months of Mr. Trump’s campaign, he brought Robert F. Kennedy Jr. aboard with the message that a total remake of the nation’s public health system was the only way, as Mr. Kennedy’s own presidential campaign slogan put it, to “Make America Healthy Again.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Less than two weeks after the election, Mr. Kennedy was tapped to lead the Health and Human Services Department, a sprawling federal agency that includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the F.D.A. and the National Institutes of Health, and also oversees Medicare and Medicaid.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, has a long track record of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/rfk-conspiracy-theories-fact-check.html" title="">spreading falsehoods</a> about vaccines and using his nonprofit, Children’s Health Defense, to promote a database of misleading interpretations of research data. He once <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/11/scicheck-rfk-jr-incorrectly-denies-past-remarks-on-vaccine-safety-and-effectiveness/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asserted</a> publicly that “there’s no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective.”</p><p>He was Mr. Trump’s first public health pick, and, experts said, he remains his most dangerous one.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy “is just in a category by himself,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, the director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “R.F.K. Jr. just willfully disregards existing evidence, relies on talking points that have been consistently debunked.”</p><p>If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Kennedy would oversee the agencies that regulate vaccines and set national vaccine policy — and the heads of those agencies would report to him. “He will have enormous influence,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who oversaw the Biden administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative David Weldon, Republican of Florida, in 2007.

An internist by training, Dr. Weldon served seven terms in Congress, representing a district on Florida’s central east coast, before returning to his medical practice.</p><p>While in Congress, Dr. Weldon was known for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/20/us/health/no-vaccineautism-link-parents-are-told.html" title="">pushing the false notion</a> that thimerosal, a preservative compound in some vaccines, had caused an explosion of autism cases.</p><p>“The notion that this man who held a series of false beliefs about science and medicine could rise to the position where he would head the C.D.C. is in some sense frightening,” Dr. Offit said.</p><p>Dr. Weldon also introduced a “<a href="https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/254572/weldon-maloney-introduce-vaccine-safety-bill" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vaccine safety bill</a>” in 2007 that aimed to relocate most vaccine safety research from the C.D.C. to a separate agency within the Health and Human Services Department. The bill did not advance out of committee. The question is whether Dr. Weldon will bring similar aspirations with him back to Washington, persuading Congress to narrow the reach of his own agency.</p><p>Some of the most extreme anti-vaccine policies, such as an outright ban on certain shots, would be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/health/rfk-jr-vaccines-hhs.html" title="">difficult, if not impossible</a>, to put in place, experts said. And pharmaceutical companies are poised to push back — hard — on any policies that would threaten their vaccine business.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s choice for F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Martin Makary — a pancreatic surgeon at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine — has been broadly supportive of childhood vaccines. But he has questioned the benefits of certain shots, including the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns and a third Covid booster shot for healthy children. “I think there are questions that we can ask that have been taboo to ask,” he <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-will-nominate-three-doctors-to-steer-health-policy-0939a7e9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>If confirmed, he would direct the agency that approves new flu and Covid vaccines each year and monitors reports about vaccine side effects.</p><p>Dr. Makary has become known — in opinion articles and on <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/lose-the-mask-eat-the-turkey-and" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">podcasts</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6321448163112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spots on Fox News</a> — for critiquing <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?512225-3/dr-marty-makary-the-price-pay" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vaccine mandates</a> and many other parts of U.S. Covid policies, and for arguing that doctors have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/well-have-herd-immunity-by-april-11613669731" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">underestimated natural immunity</a>.</p><p>Dr. Nuzzo, who was once a colleague of Dr. Makary’s at Johns Hopkins, said that while she disagreed with some of his views, she believed that he was qualified for the position.</p><p>“I believe Marty is a man of science,” she said. “I think he will look at the scientific evidence carefully and interpret it using the training and skills that he has.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Martin Makary testifying before a House subcommittee last year.

Dr. Nesheiwat, who is also a Fox News contributor, provided on-the-ground medical treatment after Hurricane Katrina and a 2011 tornado that struck Joplin, Mo., according to a statement from Mr. Trump.</p><p>She was generally supportive of the Covid vaccines, calling them “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/covid-vaccines-future-pandemic-janette-neshweiat" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a gift from God</a>” in a 2021 opinion article for Fox News.

She’s open-minded, thoughtful and is evidence-based.”</p><p>Although high-level staffing picks set the tone, what happens to the nation’s public health system will also depend on Trump administration decisions that are still to come.</p><p>Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that he would be keeping a close eye on lower-level appointees — those who carry out the day-to-day work of these agencies.
