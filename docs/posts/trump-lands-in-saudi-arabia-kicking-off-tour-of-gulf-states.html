Prince Mohammed greeted him on a lavender carpet unfurled across the tarmac.</p><div><p>The two men then sat down in navy-and-gold armchairs in an opulent, sunlit building with marble columns. Mr. Trump was accompanied by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, among others.</p><p>Prince Mohammed’s presence signified the special status that Mr. Trump enjoys with Saudi Arabia.

Va. last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>House Republicans on Monday proposed a series of sharp restrictions on the federal anti-hunger program known as food stamps, seeking to limit its funding and benefits as part of a sprawling package to advance President Trump’s tax cuts.</p><p>The proposal, included in a draft measure to be considered by the House Agriculture Committee this week, would require states to supply some of the funding for food stamps while forcing more of its beneficiaries to obtain employment in exchange for federal aid. </p><div><p>The moves could result in potentially millions of low-income families losing access to the safety net program. But G.O.P. leaders insist that their approach would improve the provision of food stamp benefits while helping to defray the cost of Mr. Trump’s expensive legislative ambitions.</p><p>House Republicans said in a statement on Monday that their proposal emphasized “reinforcing work, rooting out waste, and instituting long-overdue accountability incentives to control costs and end executive and state overreach.”</p><p>The Republican overhaul specifically targets the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP With a roughly $110 billion annual budget, it is the federal government’s largest nutrition assistance initiative, providing monthly allotments to an average of 42 million people in the 2025 fiscal year, <a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/snap-4fymonthly-5.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the most recent data</a> from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which manages the program.</p><p>Proponents of the food stamp program say that it has long served as a critical lifeline for low-income families by ensuring that they do not experience hunger in a nation where about one in seven reported food insecurity at some point during 2023, <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details?pubid=109895" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to federal data</a> released in September.</p><p>Republicans long have decried elements of SNAP, arguing that states have mishandled federal money in ways that have allowed people who should not qualify for the benefits to receive aid. Those concerns prompted Republicans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/29/us/politics/debt-limit-deal-food-stamps.html" title="">tighten eligibility for food stamps in 2023</a>, primarily by requiring more adults to obtain employment in order to collect federal assistance.</p><p>Unsatisfied with the early results of those strictures, House Republicans on Monday took the first steps toward tightening them further.</p><p>As part of their forthcoming package to cut taxes and reduce federal spending, Republicans proposed expanding the existing work requirements to cover food stamp recipients up to age 64, including those with children who are at least age seven.</p><p>That amounts to a significant expansion of existing law, which currently only requires beneficiaries up to age 54 to work in exchange for SNAP, and excludes those with dependents. Studying similar Republican proposals in recent years, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-09/hr1581_letter.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has estimated</a> that work requirements and other rules could result in millions of enrollees losing access to the program. (The budget watchdog has not yet released an analysis on the party’s newest proposal.)</p><p>Republicans also proposed limiting nutrition aid to only U.S. citizens and green card holders. States would be required for the first time to contribute funding to the federal food stamp program beginning in 2028. And the Republican proposal would try to limit future administrations from boosting the benefits that low-income Americans receive in nutrition aid. </p><p>The Republican proposals are likely to anger congressional Democrats and anti-poverty groups, many of whom have pushed for more generous federal nutrition aid. Some states have also signaled in recent days that they may struggle to cover a share of the program’s costs, potentially further cutting into the availability of benefits.</p><p>“Slashing billions from SNAP would deepen hunger, increase poverty, and weaken communities,” said Crystal FitzSimons, interim president of the Food Research &amp; Action Center, an advocacy group. “Instead of shifting costs to states — knowing that states cannot take these added costs on — and cutting SNAP, we must ensure access to the nutrition that everyone needs to thrive.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzVkM2RjMDk4LTA3ZjEtNWRkZi04MmNjLThmNWNlMWNjZmJlZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/13/us/trump-news-saudi-arabia#trump-memecoin-winners" data-source-id="100000010164622"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-12T23:32:24.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 12, 2025, 7:32 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An auction to dine with President Trump ended Monday, when he was readying to fly to the Middle East.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>President Trump and his business partners promoted it as the world’s most “EXCLUSIVE INVITATION” — a dinner with the president of the United States for the cryptocurrency investors who bought the most of his family’s memecoin, called $TRUMP.</p><p>But as the unusual contest came to a close on Monday, at least 17 of the 220 winning bidders had figured out a way to effectively outsmart the sponsors of the contest.</p><div><p>These crypto investors had secured an invitation to the dinner even though their online wallets showed that they held zero of the memecoins, a type of novelty digital currency often based on a joke or mascot.</p><p>That is because of a quirk in the rules: The winners were selected based on the average number of coins they held during the three weeks the contest was underway rather than their total at the end of bidding.</p><p>Participants expected the price of the coin to crash as soon as the contest ended. And it did just that on Monday afternoon, plunging by 6.5 percent once the winners were announced.

Mr. Trump and his partners, who control 800 million of the coins, stood to benefit if the price stayed high. So Mr. Trump had been urging people to buy the coins throughout the auction period, and his partners encouraged investors to keep holding them even after it ended.</p><p>The trading frenzy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/technology/trump-private-dinner-crypto-memecoin.html" title="">started on April 23</a>, when a <a href="https://gettrumpmemes.com/dinner" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> associated with Mr. Trump’s coin announced the contest.

Last week, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said the president acts with only the interests of the American public in mind and that he did not have a conflict of interest.</p><p>Overall, the winners of the contest held $182 million worth of the $TRUMP coins at the time the contest closed. They had spent $191 million to buy those coins, meaning that, in aggregate, the winners had lost more money on the purchases than they had gained,<span>  </span>according to an analysis of public transaction data by The Times.</p><p>This is consistent with trading data that shows that most buyers of the coin since it was first introduced in January have lost money — a total of $3.9 billion, according to an analysis by Inca Digital, a crypto data firm.</p><p>Whether traders make or lose money, the Trump family and its partners get a transaction fee each time the coins change hands, earning at least $320 million since $TRUMP went on sale in January, according to an estimate by Chainalysis, an industry data analyst.</p><p>On Monday, the contest’s organizers seemed eager to stop the sell-off, presumably aware of the possibility that even more of the dinner guests might dump their coins now that the competition has ended.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GetTrumpMemes/status/1922004163980100077" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a>, the official account promoting the memecoin said that anyone who held onto their $TRUMP stash between now and the dinner would be rewarded with a “TRUMP DIAMOND HAND” nonfungible token — a type of digital collectible known as an NFT.</p><p>The account also announced that the coin’s holders would soon start earning “rewards points,” without explaining how points would be distributed or what they would be used for.
