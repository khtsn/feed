Winter is adding to the misery. A doctor at a hospital in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, said that four infants in tent encampments had died from the cold in the past week.</p><p>Israel says that its target is Hamas and that it does everything possible to limit the loss of civilian life. But the increasingly dire humanitarian situation has prompted a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/middleeast/israel-amnesty-international-genocide-gaza.html" title="">particularly scathing</a> chorus of condemnation from the United Nations and international human rights organizations.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
