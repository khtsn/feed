    <h1>Nepal’s New Government Calls Elections. Its Critics Cry Foul.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The office of Nepal’s president announced late Friday that the country would hold elections early next year to replace legislators halfway through their term, a move that critics say could further undermine Nepal’s democratic institutions after protests this past week led to the government’s collapse.</p><p>The announcement, which said elections would be on March 5, came hours after Sushila Karki, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/world/asia/nepal-gen-z-protests.html" title="">used to serve as the chief justice</a> of Nepal’s Supreme Court, was sworn in as the caretaker prime minister. The statement from the president, Ramchandra Paudel, said Ms. Karki had picked the date.</p><p>Ms. Karki, 73, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/world/asia/nepal-protests-leader-karki-gen-z.html" title="">was appointed as an official substitute</a> for K.P. Sharma Oli, the elected prime minister who fled his office during the explosive protests. Since Monday, more than 50 people have been killed in a wave of violence marked by police abuses and enormous property destruction <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/world/asia/nepal-protests-gen-z-social-media.html" title="">after the government banned social media</a>.</p><p>Announcing new elections was the finishing stroke on a series of swift actions that included the dissolution of Parliament and the naming of an interim prime minister within hours.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Everything about this process is unconstitutional,” said Neel Kantha Uprety, a former chief election commissioner of Nepal who did similar work for the United Nations in Afghanistan. But, he argued, there was no constitutional way forward.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/13/multimedia/13int-nepal-elections-qftc/13int-nepal-elections-qftc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/13/multimedia/13int-nepal-elections-qftc/13int-nepal-elections-qftc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/13/multimedia/13int-nepal-elections-qftc/13int-nepal-elections-qftc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A crowd stands around two women lighting candles on the ground in a courtyard." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/13/multimedia/13int-nepal-elections-qftc/13int-nepal-elections-qftc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/13/multimedia/13int-nepal-elections-qftc/13int-nepal-elections-qftc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/13/multimedia/13int-nepal-elections-qftc/13int-nepal-elections-qftc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/13/multimedia/13int-nepal-elections-qftc/13int-nepal-elections-qftc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/fac2d31f-bede-5469-994f-1095f3487fa0" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lawyers protesting on Friday in Kathmandu to save the Constitution.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atul Loke for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Karki, with her experience as a jurist, would be aware of all of this, Mr. Uprety said. “She has to know it,” he said, “and she should be able to interpret it better than I can.”</p><p>In her first public act as interim prime minister, Ms. Karki visited the Civil Service Hospital in Kathmandu on Saturday to meet injured students. One of the vehicles in her motorcade was a military S.U.V. with a sticker on its rear window that read, “Live young, live free.”</p><p>Ms. Karki got out of her car, slightly unsteady on her feet and adjusting her white sari, to meet the protesters who had pushed for her to become Nepal’s caretaker leader. But she declined to comment on why she was at the hospital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I am still not in service,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Paudel, whose role as president is to formalize decisions made by elected politicians, said in his announcement that he endorsed Ms. Karki’s date for the elections.</p><p>The military evacuated Mr. Paudel from his office this past week as protesters overran it. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/world/asia/nepal-army-gen-z-protesters.html" title="">The Nepali Army</a> took many of the country’s leaders to its barracks near Kathmandu, the capital, on Tuesday. Since then, it has maintained a nationwide curfew and patrols around the city.</p><p>Holding elections in less than six months poses towering logistical and political challenges. The March date was announced when the leaders of Nepal’s major political parties, some of whom were hunted down and attacked by mobs, were still stuck in army barracks. Cabinet ministers have complained that they have been kept off their phones for the past three days.</p><p>An adviser to Mr. Paudel said the major political parties supported Ms. Karki’s appointment. But it was not clear whether the parties were actually on board. Leaders of the largest three were absent from Ms. Karki’s swearing-in ceremony. Under tight security, the ambassadors of India, China and the United States were present, but few of Nepal’s most important elected officials were there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sushila Karki, right, a former Supreme Court chief justice, was sworn in as the caretaker prime minister on Friday.

Together, they held 199 of the legislature’s 275 seats. Now, no one has any.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>There was a strange silence on Saturday morning. Spokesmen for the three main parties were unavailable: Two had their phones switched off and the third declined to comment. Normally, the parties’ officials leap to respond on social media about any significant development. Instead, their public accounts were dormant.</p><p>The Maoist party, once a group of revolutionary fighters in the country’s civil war and more recently the winner of democratic elections, held a virtual meeting led by its leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who served three terms as Nepal’s prime minister. The party issued a statement saying it was in “serious disagreement with the way the Parliament was dissolved.”</p><p>The Nepali Congress, the largest party in Parliament until Friday, held a virtual meeting of its own and issued a statement concluding that the body’s dissolution “goes against the framework of our Constitution.” It added that the current process also goes against the spirit of the anticorruption protests that toppled the government.</p><p>The Nepal Bar Association took issue with the entire legal basis for the change in government. “The move significantly weakens hard-earned achievements: toward democracy, a republic and federalism with inclusion,” it said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>For those reasons, it said, the association “demands the immediate restoration of Parliament, to ensure constitutional supremacy.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Relatives and friends performing rituals at a cremation ground on Friday in Kathmandu.

Re-establishing even the government’s day-to-day functions looks like a distant dream. Officials are struggling to find working vehicles for ministers. Procuring poll materials and security will incur huge additional expenses.</p><p>“It’s not free from challenge,” Mr. Uprety said, but “not impossible, as well.” Still, he thinks March is ambitious.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Uprety said preparations for the polls should be started as quickly as possible, noting that first a new election commissioner would have to be appointed. But that needs parliamentary approval, and there is no Parliament to approve a candidate.</p><p>Nevertheless, Mr. Uprety said, “Work should begin right away.”</p><p>“Bringing all political forces to make the poll possible should be the first priority,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Damaged vehicles in front of the Singha Durbar government complex, which was set on fire during protests.
