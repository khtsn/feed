He joined FNATIC ahead of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2380/vct-2025-emea-stage-1/group-stage" target="_blank">EMEA Stage 1</a> in a restructuring that looked to help the org bounce back from a disappointing Kickoff, and had a near-immediate impact. With Scuttt in the coaching booth, FNATIC won <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2380/vct-2025-emea-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a>, finished second at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>, and were runner-ups at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025/playoffs" target="_blank">Champions Paris</a>.</p>

<p>PAL <a href="https://x.com/PAL_TTV/status/1992963658989617587?s=20" target="_blank">spoke on</a> the forthcoming coaching dynamic between him and Scuttt, describing that of a co-coaching relationship.</p>

<p>&#34;It was our goal from the start to build a support team for the players where we can all do what we specialise in without worry of leaving gaps,&#34; he said. &#34;Each letting the others just focus on doing what they do best.&#34;</p>

<p>With Vitality&#39;s rebuild now finalized both in on-stage talent and in the coaching booth, the team&#39;s full roster is now:</p>

		<p>I mean.... Yes that&#39;s what happened last year, but this team is the opposite of what you&#39;re saying.</p>
<p>The team is pretty much half of BBL (including a coach &amp; IGL duo) and half of FNC, and then one very unproven up-and-comer in Sayonara.</p>
<p>Obviously there is no guarantee the team will work, but cohesion was clearly a top priority.</p>
<p>Profek and Jamppi are not superstars in the same way Less and Derke were before being signed last year. Jamppi has IGLed on two different teams and the calling was never bad or anything. PAL is not a fraud who&#39;s had one semi-decent run in tier 2 and nothing else to show for it, and he&#39;s worked with Jamppi and Profek for an entire year, and while the team had their issues, I don&#39;t think the coaching/IGLing was their biggest problem. <del>I mean, if LewN hadn&#39;t lost that Iso ult to a classic, they probably would have made champs.</del></p>
<p>This roster construction is in every way the opposite of last year&#39;s.</p>	</div>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="5854672" id="38">

	
	
	<p>Poaching 3 star players from top 4 teams in the region and a coach (no, TH was not top 4 despite EW cup) to go with your star duelist and T2 star init is anything but throwing money at your problems? Really?</p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="5854695" id="39">

	
	
	<div>
		
		<p>I feel like you&#39;re intentionally misunderstanding literally every single word I wrote.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t see the difference between 2025 Vitality roster planning and 2026 Vitality roster planning, I don&#39;t know what to tell you. Your point about cohesion was obvious nonsense, because signing an entire core from another team (and getting Chron who has established chemistry with Derke) is literally the most cohesion you could possibly ever get on a rebuilt team without going the BBL Pcific route.</p>
<p>I interpret &#34;throwing money at problems&#34; as meaning &#34;just buying whatever looks shiny and expensive and hoping it works with no actual idea of what to do with it&#34;, which is what they did last year (no IGL, no team cohesion, a coach that didn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing). Clearly, all of those issues have been very thoroughly addressed here.</p>	</div>

		<p>no im asking you, what did he even do.</p>
<p>Because according to meteor he had to literally demand the AC did timeouts because autumn would be vauge directionless and downright unhelpful compared to Solo on GenG.</p>
<p>And according to the T1 video, even mistranslation aside, he clearly couldn&#39;t foster a comfortable team environment for multiple of his players.</p>
<p>And most of their prep was either lifted and repurposed from other teams or improvised on the fly during the events.</p>
<p>So I&#39;ll ask again.</p>
<p>Did autumn even coach?</p>	</div>

		<p>So what do you think he actually does, then? lol</p>
<p>If you watch their Masters Bangkok voice comms, you can clearly see Autumn giving them precise instructions and calling the strategy.</p>
<p>And he even spent time studying line-ups and tactics every day with Meteor and Izu.</p>
<p>Instead of asking pointless questions like ‘Did he even coach?’, maybe try watching more of their videos first. you know, the ones before Sylvan ruined the team with his awful mechanics and terrible people skills.</p>	</div>
