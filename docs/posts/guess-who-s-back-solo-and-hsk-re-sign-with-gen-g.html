</span> in 2022, but would play for just one year, becoming a coach for the squad the following year. After staying with DFM through the end of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1191/champions-tour-2023-pacific-league/league-play" target="_blank">Pacific League</a>, HSK departed and joined Gen.G in the following offseason.</p>

<p>The 2024 season marked the first year of solo and HSK&#39;s partnership, and a historic one for Gen.G. The year started with the squad lifting the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1924/champions-tour-2024-pacific-kickoff/playoffs" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> trophy to become the first Korean squad to win a Pacific event, and then a runner-up finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1921/champions-tour-2024-masters-madrid" target="_blank">Masters Madrid</a>. Dominance continued in the regional circuit with a runner-up finish in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2002/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-1/regular-season" target="_blank">Stage 1</a>, followed by an undefeated run to lift the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Shanghai</a> trophy and become the first Pacific squad to win an international VCT event. Gen.G followed up the event by winning <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2005/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 2</a>, but fell short of expectations at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024/group-stage" target="_blank">Champions Seoul</a>, being eliminated in the group stage.</p>

<p>A hectic 2025 for Gen.G saw the organization struggle to replace two core pieces of its 2024 squad, with the full starting roster not seeing its final form until midway through <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/vct-2025-pacific-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a>. The high point of a disappointing year, at least in comparison to 2024, was the team finishing 5th-6th at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>. A weak group stage showing meant that Gen.G entered the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2500/vct-2025-pacific-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> playoffs in the lower bracket, and a loss to rivals <span data-ref-id="12">
