The allegations could not be independently verified.</p><p>Another monitoring group, the Syrian Network for Human Rights, reported that government security forces had killed some 125 civilians. It said that men of all ages were among the casualties and that the forces did not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>Information Ministry officials, responding to the allegations of killing civilians, said they rejected “undocumented allegations accusing government forces of committing violations.” But they also said the government was committed to conducting comprehensive investigations and would hold to account those found to have harmed civilians.</p><p>“The Syrian government confirms that its forces operate according to strict standards that respect international humanitarian law and are keen to protect civilians during their operations,” a ministry statement said.</p><p>The Observatory said scores of combatants on both sides of the conflict had also been killed. The Syrian Network for Human Rights said the Assad loyalists had killed more than 100 security forces for the new government.</p><p>The Defense Ministry told Syrian state media on Saturday afternoon that forces had regained control over most areas that had been taken by the former regime remnants and that roads leading to the coastal area had been closed “to regulate violations, prevent transgressions and gradually restore stability to the area.”</p><p>The unrest has been the bloodiest outbreak of violence since the Assad regime was ousted in early December by rebels who became the country’s new leaders. It presents a major test of the new government’s authority and has raised the specter of a larger sectarian conflict in Syria, where tensions were already high as a result of the civil war.</p><p>By Saturday afternoon, the Syrian Red Crescent said it had been given permission to enter one of the towns where many have been wounded to evacuate the injured.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrian army forces headed along a road toward villages in the Latakia countryside on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Moawia Atrash/Picture Alliance, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The clashes began on Thursday after Assad loyalists killed 16 government security personnel in Latakia province, in the deadliest attack yet on Syria’s new security forces, according to government officials and the Observatory.</p><p>Violence quickly spread across Latakia and Tartus provinces, longtime strongholds of Mr. al-Assad along the Mediterranean coast and home to most of the country’s minority Alawite population, to which the ousted president belongs. Armed remnants of the ousted regime are believed to be scattered across the two provinces and have presented a challenge to the country’s new leaders as they try to exert their authority and unite a fractured country after more than 13 years of civil war.</p><p>The government responded to the initial attack on Thursday by deploying thousands of security forces and soldiers from other parts of the country to the restive coast. The government has sought to present the clashes as a legitimate authority fighting the remnants of a brutal regime.</p><p>For the first time, the new government forces deployed helicopters outfitted with machine guns on Thursday around the mountainside of the coastal region, according to a government official on the coast, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. The helicopters were deployed to areas where armed Assad loyalists were stationed, the official added.</p><p>A video verified by The New York Times and filmed along the coast west of Latakia airport appears to show government fighters dropping crudely made bombs from the rear of a helicopter. A spokesman for the government in Latakia did not respond to a request for comment about the video. A journalist with Syrian state media, Muhammad al-Othman, said that the munitions were dropped over mountainous areas where old regime remnants remain.</p><p>The Assad regime drew international condemnation for its frequent use of helicopters for indiscriminate bombings, dropping destructive barrel bombs onto civilian populations for years.</p><p>Christina Goldbaum<!-- -->, <!-- -->Muhammad Haj Kadour<span>  </span>and <!-- -->Reham Mourshed<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
