Rives, which is northeast of Memphis, has a population of about 300.</p><p>Kentucky was hit particularly hard and at least eight people died there because of the storms, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky said at a news conference on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He said there had been more than 1,000 rescues and there were more than 300 road closures.</p><p>“Avoid driving through covered roadways,” he said. “That’s where we’re losing the most people.”</p><p>At one point early on Sunday, flood warnings were in place for all 120 counties in Kentucky. Parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia were also under flood warnings on Sunday morning, according to the Weather Service.</p><p>Mr. Beshear said that President Trump had approved his request for an emergency disaster declaration, which makes federal funding available to help the state recover.</p><p>In Kentucky, a woman and her 7-year-old child died in Bonnieville, an unincorporated area in Hart County about 66 miles south of Louisville. The mother’s vehicle was swept away during flash flooding, said Anthony Roberts, the Hart County coroner.</p><p>A man was found dead floating in floodwaters in an unincorporated area outside Manchester, Ky., according to Clifton Jones, the chief deputy in the Clay County sheriff’s office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Jason Abner, the Clay County coroner, identified the man as Donald K.

As a result, wind advisories were issued along the East Coast for Sunday, from northern Florida to the Northeast.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The storms are going to continue to advance east,” said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the Weather Service. “And with that there will be the potential for additional heavy rains and severe weather, including severe thunderstorms and perhaps a tornado or two.”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Judson Jones<!-- -->, <!-- -->Isabella Kwai<!-- -->, <!-- -->Adeel Hassan<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nazaneen Ghaffar<!-- --> , <!-- -->Amanda Holpuch<!-- -->, <!-- -->Austyn Gaffney<!-- --> and <!-- -->Johnny Diaz<!-- -->.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div></section><div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
