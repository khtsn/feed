They are also a rare respite in a domestic economy that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/26/israel-economy-business-reservists-war/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has struggled</a> during the war.</p><p>Some of the weapons were delivered in 2024, and others are part of arms deals that will take longer to complete. But the overall increase in sales came while Israeli forces were launching offensives in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, and bombarding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/25/world/israel-lebanon-gaza-iran" title="">Iran</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/world/middleeast/israel-yemen-sana-airport-houthis.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Yemen</a>, in what Defense Minister Israel Katz called on Wednesday “a difficult and complex year of war.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Even as it was shipping weapons abroad, Israel also received at least <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2023/2024/Costs%20of%20War_US%20Support%20Since%20Oct%207%20FINAL%20v2.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$17.9 billion</a> in military aid, including weapons, from the United States in the 12 months after Hamas led a deadly invasion on Oct. 7, 2023. <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2023/2024/Costs%20of%20War_US%20Support%20Since%20Oct%207%20FINAL%20v2.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Researchers</a> have called that a conservative estimate.</p><p>Compared with American arms sales abroad — which accounted for <a href="https://www.state.gov/fiscal-year-2024-u-s-arms-transfers-and-defense-trade/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least $200 billion</a> in the fiscal year that ended in September — Israel’s exports are small.</p><p>But more than half of its sales last year — 54 percent — went to Europe, which is looking to boost its defense spending and quickly refill military stockpiles diminished by the war in Ukraine amid concern that the United States is no longer a reliable security partner.</p><p>“There is a real need in the world — this conflict in Israel is not the only conflict,” Boaz Levy, chief executive of the government-owned Israel Aerospace Industries, said in a recent interview.</p><p>European leaders have become increasingly agitated with the war in Gaza, which could threaten Israel’s sales.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Tuesday, Spain’s Defense Ministry said it had canceled a $325 million deal for anti-tank missiles built by a subsidiary of Israel’s government-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems as part of a “gradual disconnection of Israeli technology.”</p><p>A spokesman for Rafael did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An Israeli missile heading toward a building in Beirut last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>President Trump has also questioned Israel’s strategy in Gaza, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2025/05/netanyahu-calls-to-wean-israel-off-u-s-aid-amid-growing-tensions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declare last month</a> that “we will have to wean ourselves off of American security aid.”</p><p>Experts predict it would be years, if ever, before Israel could end its reliance on U.S. arms.</p><p>In the months after <a href="https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/03/14/how-to-ensure-israel-has-the-weapons-it-needs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hamas’s attacks</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/world/middleeast/us-israel-weapons.html" title="">United States sent</a> Israel air-defense systems, precision-guided munitions, artillery shells, tank rounds, small arms, Hellfire missiles used by drones and disposable shoulder-fired rockets.</p><p>In February, Mr. Trump bypassed congressional approval to speed sales of more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/us/politics/trump-israel-arms-weapons.html" title="">$12 billion</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/us/politics/rubio-arms-israel.html" title="">in arms</a> to Israel over the coming decade, including 2,000-pound bombs that the Biden administration had withheld over concerns they would indiscriminately kill civilians in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Throughout last year, 48 percent of Israel’s foreign sales were made up of missiles, rockets and air-defense systems, the country’s Defense Ministry said. Israel’s data did not detail specific deals, and it was not clear why it would sell some of the same types of weapons it needs now to fight Hamas.</p><p>Zain Hussain, who researches arms transfers at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said Israel had relied “quite considerably” on American military aid. “That has helped to take away a lot of the burden from Israel’s arms industry,” he added.</p><p>But other experts noted that some arms that take years to produce wouldn’t be immediately available for Israel, anyway, and that it would be unwise in the long term to renege on foreign sales, which could risk economic and diplomatic ties. Additionally, at least some of the weapons that Israel sold potentially have different features from what its own military uses, said Bradley Bowman, a military expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.</p><p>In interviews, Israeli officials said they decided after the 50-day war with Hamas in 2014 to keep weapons assembly lines in slow but constant motion so that they could ramp up quickly when necessary — as they did immediately after the October 2023 attacks. That is how Israel has largely avoided production shortfalls that Western defense manufacturers have faced since Russia invaded Ukraine.</p><p>Still, Israel’s constant combat since 2023 appears to have drained its stockpiles of some of its most needed defenses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140058/satellite-images-dozens-iranian-missiles-struck-near-israeli-air-base" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Analysts</a> at the California-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey concluded that Israel ran short of missile interceptors last October, when at least 30 Iranian ballistic missiles landed unhindered in the southern part of the country.
