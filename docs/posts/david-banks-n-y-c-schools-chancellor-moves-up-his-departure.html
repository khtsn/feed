    <h1>David Banks, N.Y.C. Schools Chancellor, Moves Up His Departure</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“From day one, this administration has continued to prioritize the needs of our students,” Amaris Cockfield, a City Hall spokeswoman, said in a statement on Wednesday. “In advancing this mission, it became clear that our students will be best served by having the same leadership through as much of the school year as possible, rather than changing chancellors halfway through.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/nyregion/adams-david-banks-sheena-wright-marriage.html" title="">Mr. Banks and Ms. Wright were married last weekend</a> in Martha’s Vineyard. The marriage — the culmination of a yearslong relationship — could allow the couple to claim spousal privilege, which would grant them the right to decline to testify against each other in court, legal experts said.</p><p>Mr. Banks had long said that the schools chancellor position was the one job that he always wanted. He assumed the post soon after Mayor Adams took office and saw the schools system through an overhaul of the reading curriculum, the signature effort of his tenure.</p><p>At the annual State of Our Schools Address in late September, Mr. Banks appeared at turns defiant and introspective. He requested that a school choir perform his favorite song — “Saturn” by Stevie Wonder — and asked those gathered to join him in reciting his favorite poem, “Invictus.”</p><p>He had the crowd recite the last line twice: “I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.”</p><p>Troy Closson<!-- --> and <!-- -->Eliza Shapiro<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
