The unemployment rate is nearly 40 percent, compared with about 7 percent for the rest of France. About 30 percent of residents do not have access to running water at home, a problem made worse by a drought last year.</p><p>Some aid workers and analysts have said the government has failed to keep up with a rapidly growing population and provide necessary services. Others suggest that the government has largely overlooked the island, which sits some 5,000 miles away from mainland France and a 12-hour flight from Paris.</p><p>In the aftermath of the cyclone, Mr. Macron has vowed to support the devastated population.</p><p>At the airport and then at the hospital on Thursday, Mr. Macron was greeted by scores of worried residents and exhausted doctors who told him about destroyed homes, power blackouts, low food and medicine stocks, empty gas stations — and worries of a terrible toll.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Macron, who wore a white shirt and a traditional local scarf, was also taken on a helicopter flyover of the devastation.

Although the law requires the government to provide suitable alternative accommodation, that often does not happen, according to aid groups.</p><p>The shantytowns that have been the focus of the local government’s demolition efforts have taken the hardest hit from the storm, with many wiped away. Many residents of the shantytowns are believed to be undocumented migrants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In Passamanty, a shantytown that covered a hill, not a single tree remained intact. The only remnants of the homes that once stood there are a few wooden poles poking up from the ground; the tin sheets that formed the roofs and walls of shacks are lying on meter-high piles of rubble.</p><p>Because of a lack of classroom space in Mayotte, some children go to school either for a morning or an afternoon session, not the entire day, according to UNICEF.</p><p>There is a growing sense in Mayotte and other French territories “that they are not treated as the rest of the French population,” said Lucile Grosjean, the director of advocacy for the United Nations Children’s Fund in France. “That’s definitely something that the authorities have to deal with to build trust and to ensure that all French citizens have the same level of services.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Collecting rain water on a street of Mamoudzou.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The disparities that Mayotte faces are in some ways a legacy of the French colonial era.</p><p>Colonized in 1843, Mayotte only became a French department — which establishes a local authority to administer social services and infrastructure — in 2011. It’s the youngest department in the country, and some civil society activists say government officials are still struggling to catch the island up on services and infrastructure amid rapid population growth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mayotte belongs to an archipelago that held a referendum on becoming independent from France in the mid-1970s. Thanks in part to pro-French female activists who <a href="https://shs.cairn.info/journal-le-mouvement-social1-2016-2-page-57?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used what is known as tickl</a>e torture as a way to scare off pro-independence politicians, Mayotte was the only territory in the island chain that voted to remain a part of France. That led to its separation from what is today the independent nation of Comoros.</p><p>Today, many Mayotte residents continue to hold a strong allegiance to France, even when they feel the government has failed them, said Ms. Moilimo, the teacher in Mamoudzou.</p><p>“It’s like the people of Mayotte have the syndrome of the colonized,” she said. “They’re so happy to be considered French that they’ll settle for anything you give them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The damaged patio of a hotel.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>For all of Mayotte’s problems, French support has helped it to fare better economically than Comoros. Tens of thousands of migrants from Comoros have sought refuge and economic opportunities in Mayotte, where about a third of the population is undocumented, officials say. This has fueled major tensions and even violence in Mayotte, and made the island <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/02/20/how-mayotte-became-the-ideological-laboratory-of-the-french-far-right_6542553_7.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a focal point for France’s broader debates around immigration</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Part of the reason that Mayotte may have lost so many lives is that cyclones are so rare there that residents often are not aware of the proper precautions to take, said Eric Sam-Vah, the deputy head of the Piroi Center, a disaster management agency of the French Red Cross.</p><p>Mr. Sam-Vah said that his organization had received reports as late as Saturday morning of people attending mosque, after the highest-level warning for the fast-moving storm already had been issued, and just hours before it made landfall.</p><p>Bruno Retailleau, France’s departing interior minister, said on Monday that some undocumented residents had not gone to officially designated shelters in time. That has raised questions about whether fears of arrest or deportation hampered the territory’s preparedness efforts.</p><p>The center plans to deploy as many as 50 people to Mayotte to help with a response that Mr. Sam-Vah expects to last at least 12 months. The center has already sent 10,000 tarpaulins to help make temporary accommodations. It is also dispatching essentials like solar lamps, buckets and soap to aid the roughly 100,000 people enduring difficult conditions in emergency shelters, he said.</p><p>In the Piroi Center’s 25 years in operation, Mr. Sam-Vah said, “This one is probably one of the most complex situations we have faced.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The shantytowns have taken the hardest hit from the storm, with many wiped away.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Aurelien Breeden<!-- --> reported from Paris and Julie Bourdin contributed reporting from Mamoudzou.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Eligon is the Johannesburg bureau chief for The Times, covering a wide range of events and trends that influence and shape the lives of ordinary people across southern Africa.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-eligon">More about John Eligon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Aurelien Breeden is a reporter for The Times in Paris, covering news from France.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aurelien-breeden">More about Aurelien Breeden</a></span></p></div><div><div><p>Sergey Ponomarev is a freelance photographer for The Times.
