Still, warning sirens blared across central Israel, sending people running for cover.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Magen David Adom, the Israeli emergency rescue service, said it had treated a person who was hit by a car while hurrying to a shelter.</p><p>While the Israeli military referred to a single missile fired from Yemen, Yahya Sarea, a military spokesman for the Houthis, said they had launched two missiles that hit their targets: the international airport near Tel Aviv and a power station in the Jerusalem area.</p><p>Israeli authorities did not report any damage to the airport or a power station. The mayor of Beit Shemesh, a town west of Jerusalem, <a href="https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/sy11iwqblkx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the Israeli news media that part of a missile had fallen there after it was intercepted.</p><p>Mr. Sarea vowed that the attacks would continue until “the stopping of the aggression on Gaza and the lifting of the siege on it.”</p><p>While indirect talks between Israel and Hamas appear to have made some progress in recent weeks, a breakthrough to achieve a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages held there has remained elusive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Israel has responded to some of the Houthi attacks by striking infrastructure in Yemen that Israeli officials claim serves the group’s interests, including power stations, seaports and the international airport in Sana, Yemen’s capital. Human rights groups have warned that the Israeli military’s strikes in Yemen could exacerbate an already dire humanitarian situation in the country.</p><p>At a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Monday, Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, vowed that the Houthis would pay a heavy price for their attacks, as Hamas and Hezbollah have.</p><p>“Let this be your final warning,” he said. “This is a not a threat. It is a promise. You will share the same miserable fate.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
