		<p>Following the conclusion of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2684/vct-2026-emea-kickoff" target="_blank">VCT EMEA Kickoff</a> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594769/fnatic-vs-team-liquid-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-lbf" target="_blank">Lower Final</a>, an on-stage draw was conducted to decide the groups for EMEA Stage 1.</p>

<p>Like the draws in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/624080/vct-americas-stage-1-groups-drawn" target="_blank">Americas</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/624379/vct-pacific-stage-1-groups-unveiled-following-kickoff" target="_blank">Pacific</a>, the region&#39;s 12 teams were split into six seeding tiers sorted by their Kickoff placement. One team from each tier is drawn into Group Alpha, and the other into Group Omega.</p>

<p>The draw was as follows:</p>









<p>The draw brings forward a few heated matchups, which are set to make the Stage 1 group stage interesting. In Group Alpha, the second rendition of the battle between brothers <span data-ref-id="12">

</span> will take place when Team Heretics and Team Liquid clash. In Group Omega, three of the region&#39;s four Turkish squads will go up against each other. Additionally, <span data-ref-id="14">

		Derke	</a>
</span> will go up against FNATIC once again.</p>

<p>Action in EMEA will resume soon, with the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2833/vct-2026-emea-clash" target="_blank">EMEA Clash</a>, which looks to stage a proving grounds between the region&#39;s VCT teams with its top Challengers teams.</p>
