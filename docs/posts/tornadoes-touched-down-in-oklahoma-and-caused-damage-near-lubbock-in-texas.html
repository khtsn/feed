</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Scores of homes were damaged by hale and wind in Hockley County, Mr. Kirkland said, and most of the county’s roads were flooded.</p><p> A severe thunderstorm warning remained in place in several counties as the storm moved eastward with winds of up to 80 miles per hour and hail as large as softballs, according to the Weather Service.</p><h2 id="link-b4695fc">The severe weather will continue for days.</h2><p>The continuous severe weather outbreak is being driven by a large and strong storm system moving eastward and interacting with a slow-moving weather front, stretching from the southern Plains through the Ohio Valley. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Tate said that over the coming days, the front is expected to remain nearly stationary. As warm, moist air flows northward into the front, conditions will be favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms.<span>  </span></p><p>“That flow coming in from the Gulf, that can bring moisture and instability that are needed to produce those storms,” she said. </p><p>The threat of severe weather is expected to continue on Friday, affecting many of the same regions, while also expanding into the Southeast.<span>  </span></p><p>“The front is a little more progressive in moving southeastward by Friday, so that’s why the severe weather threat extends farther east,” Ms. Tate said. “But on the western side, like in Texas, it just kind of stalls there, and so that leads to additional rounds of storms.” </p><p>In addition to severe thunderstorms, the setup brings a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas already saturated from recent rainfall, where repeated rounds of storms are expected.<span>  </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“With the storms being slow moving, then there can be multiple rounds of storms affecting the same areas,” Ms. Tate said. “It makes the soils pretty wet and then you get another round and that can lead to more flooding.” </p><p>The risk for severe storms will continue into the weekend across much of the Southeast, as well as eastern Oklahoma and northeast Texas. The Storm Prediction Center again issued level 2 out of 5 risk for these areas, including parts of the Carolina’s and southwestern Virginia. Damaging wind gusts remain the main concern, especially during Saturday afternoon and evening. </p><p>Flash flood risks will also linger, especially across southeastern Oklahoma,<span>  </span>Arkansas,<span>  </span>northern Mississippi and western Tennessee. </p><p>A gradual improvement in conditions is expected early next week, although some storm activity may still continue in the region. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Francesca Regalado is a Times reporter covering breaking news.</p></div><div><p>Nazaneen Ghaffar is a Times reporter on the Weather team.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
