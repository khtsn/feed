One of the law enforcement officials said that the man had a gun, a silencer and false identification cards similar to those they believe the killer used in New York.</p><div><p>New York police investigators were on their way to Altoona, about 280 miles from the city, according to one of the other law enforcement officials.</p><p>The police had been seeking a suspect since the Wednesday morning attack on Brian Thompson outside a hotel in Midtown. They believe the killer left New York by bus shortly after.</p><p>Though the killing set off a manhunt that stretched well beyond New York City and commanded days of national attention, police were still searching for information about the suspect’s identity and what had motivated him to shoot Mr. Thompson.</p><p>Over the weekend, photographs of the suspect in a taxi emerged as the police <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/nyregion/ceo-brian-thompson-gunman-video.html" title="">scoured thousands of hours of footage</a> from surveillance cameras to glean information about the man’s movements over the course of what they believe were his 11 days in New York City, starting with his arrival on a bus that originated in Atlanta on Nov. 24. They also recovered bullet casings at the scene with the words “depose,” “deny” and “delay” written on them — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/nyregion/delay-deny-defend-united-health-care-insurance-claims.html" title="">a possible reference to terms used by insurers</a> to avoid paying claims.</p><p>Officers also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-gunman-backpack.html" title="">recovered a backpack</a> in Central Park on Friday that they believe the man may have discarded as he cycled away from the scene of the shooting toward the Upper West Side, before he caught the cab. They had yet to publicly confirm if the backpack belonged to the man or contained any items of value to the investigation.</p><p>The police did find Monopoly money in the backpack, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></div></div>
