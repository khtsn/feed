Karaoke. The use of simple lyrics. The easy melodies. Many wanted to share what the band meant to them. An Indonesian man told me that one smash hit, “That’s Why You Go Away,” had been the soundtrack for all his class reunions.</p><p>“The true story is really that Asia picked us,” Mr. Richter said.</p><p>The band started out in 1988 as a group of high-school buddies in Aarhus, the second-largest city in Denmark. They came up with their name — a tongue-in-cheek reference to Michael Jackson — when they were entering a rock competition.</p><p>Initially, they set their sights on England and the United States. But in England, they were quickly rebuffed. Recording companies thought their lyrics were too simple, recalled Mikkel Lentz, the guitarist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Consider the chorus of “The Actor,” a track from their self-titled debut album that was a hit in Scandinavia:</p><blockquote><p>I’m not an actor,</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-12"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“That is not a song that Blur or Oasis would sing,” Mr. Lentz, 55, said.</p><p>The band’s three members — originally there were four — describe their success in Asia as a series of lucky twists. They landed a record deal in Los Angeles, but the record company went bankrupt. Their second album tanked in Denmark because grunge was in and pop and soft rock were out.</p><p>Then, they received a fax telling them that “The Actor” was a No. 1 hit in Indonesia.</p><p>“We had to find a map and see: ‘Where is Indonesia?’” recalled Kare Wanscher, the 55-year-old drummer. “You know, none of us had ever been to Asia before. We were young kids and it was just a very big surprise.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Mr. Wanscher’s home in Copenhagen.

By the time the band started their first Asia tour in 1994, they were stars.</p><p>In Bangkok, their concert was stopped midway through because so many fans, about 12,000, had turned up that the authorities feared the venue’s floor would give way. In Hanoi, the riot police were deployed because fans duped by fake tickets had climbed in through the windows and the roof.</p><p>At a time when few Western acts, with the exception of superstars like Michael Jackson, traveled to the continent to perform, the band was a revelation — and they returned year after year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Wanscher with memorabilia sent by fans over the years.
