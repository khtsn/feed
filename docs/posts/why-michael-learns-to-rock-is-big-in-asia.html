    <h1>Why Michael Learns to Rock Is Big in Asia</h1>

They sang in English about love, longing and loss — think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHsx5kis-e0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chicago</a>, but the ballad years — and created a soundtrack for a generation of Asian youth.</p><p>Thirty years on, their songs remain karaoke staples in this part of the world. They also have a younger audience — one of their biggest hits, “Take Me To Your Heart,” became <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/take-me-to-your-heart-tiktok?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a dance challenge on TikTok</a>. They have toured regularly in the region, playing a sold-out concert hall in Medan, the third-largest city in Indonesia, last week as part of an eight-stop Asia tour. A few days earlier, they were in Manila, making concertgoers misty-eyed with their greatest hits.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>There, Jascha Richter, the 61-year-old lead singer, spoke to the crowd of 7,500 fans about the band’s journey.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/14/multimedia/00ASIA-SOFTROCK-02-wqvj/00ASIA-SOFTROCK-02-wqvj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/14/multimedia/00ASIA-SOFTROCK-02-wqvj/00ASIA-SOFTROCK-02-wqvj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/14/multimedia/00ASIA-SOFTROCK-02-wqvj/00ASIA-SOFTROCK-02-wqvj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Four people on a stage illuminated with neon lights.

I was reminded of their staying power last year in Indonesia, when I heard a taxi driver listening to their music. The following week, I was on a farm in Bangkok where “Take Me To Your Heart” was blaring. I conducted an informal poll on X: Why do so many people in Southeast Asia love Michael Learns to Rock?</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Taking selfies in Manila with the band in the background. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ezra Acayan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Richel Rose Dupit, the president of Michael Learns to Rock’s Philippine fan club, met the band after the concert in Manila.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ezra Acayan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>I received an outpouring of explanations. Karaoke. The use of simple lyrics. The easy melodies. Many wanted to share what the band meant to them. An Indonesian man told me that one smash hit, “That’s Why You Go Away,” had been the soundtrack for all his class reunions.</p><p>“The true story is really that Asia picked us,” Mr. Richter said.</p><p>The band started out in 1988 as a group of high-school buddies in Aarhus, the second-largest city in Denmark. They came up with their name — a tongue-in-cheek reference to Michael Jackson — when they were entering a rock competition.</p><p>Initially, they set their sights on England and the United States. But in England, they were quickly rebuffed. Recording companies thought their lyrics were too simple, recalled Mikkel Lentz, the guitarist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Consider the chorus of “The Actor,” a track from their self-titled debut album that was a hit in Scandinavia:</p><blockquote><p>I’m not an actor,</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“That is not a song that Blur or Oasis would sing,” Mr. Lentz, 55, said.</p><p>The band’s three members — originally there were four — describe their success in Asia as a series of lucky twists. They landed a record deal in Los Angeles, but the record company went bankrupt. Their second album tanked in Denmark because grunge was in and pop and soft rock were out.</p><p>Then, they received a fax telling them that “The Actor” was a No. 1 hit in Indonesia.</p><p>“We had to find a map and see: ‘Where is Indonesia?’” recalled Kare Wanscher, the 55-year-old drummer. “You know, none of us had ever been to Asia before. We were young kids and it was just a very big surprise.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Mr. Wanscher’s home in Copenhagen.

Short of new material while competitors were releasing music from the likes of Madonna and Bon Jovi, he turned to Michael Learns to Rock.</p><p>“When I heard ‘The Actor,’ the lyrics really got me,” he said. “I was a bachelor at that time, so I could relate — my salary was still minimal, I didn’t have a car and I couldn’t treat my girlfriend to an expensive restaurant.”</p><p>Soon, word spread to Singapore and Malaysia. By the time the band started their first Asia tour in 1994, they were stars.</p><p>In Bangkok, their concert was stopped midway through because so many fans, about 12,000, had turned up that the authorities feared the venue’s floor would give way. In Hanoi, the riot police were deployed because fans duped by fake tickets had climbed in through the windows and the roof.</p><p>At a time when few Western acts, with the exception of superstars like Michael Jackson, traveled to the continent to perform, the band was a revelation — and they returned year after year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Wanscher with memorabilia sent by fans over the years.

Listening to their music, Mr. Aton said, is “like my father and me ‘fanboying’ together.”</p><p>In Medan, Maria Juli also gave credit to her parents. She cried as she sang along with the band while thinking of her late mother.</p><p>“Tonight, it truly brought back old memories,” said Ms. Maria, 32, a kindergarten teacher who came with her two aunts to the concert. “Our voices are hoarse.”</p><p>Camille Elemia<!-- --> contributed reporting from Manila, <!-- -->Rin Hindryati<!-- --> from Medan and <!-- -->Hasya Nindita<!-- --> from Yogyakarta, Indonesia.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sui-Lee Wee is the Southeast Asia bureau chief for The Times, overseeing coverage of 11 countries in the region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sui-lee-wee">More about Sui-Lee Wee</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
