According to current Weather Service forecasts, these areas are likely to receive at least an inch of snow, with some locations in Tennessee potentially accumulating more than three inches.</p><p>While some snow amounts remained uncertain, forecasters at the Weather Service said snow totals were likely to be greatest from portions of North Texas into southeastern Oklahoma and central Arkansas.</p><p>“With the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex averaging just 1.8 inches of snow per season, this storm could be a rare and disruptive event,” Mr. Mullinax said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>It is likely that other places recently hit by this weekend’s snowstorm could face the potential for another highly impactful winter weather event in the Mid-Atlantic.
