The true impact is set to unfold Thursday into Friday, as a more potent system strengthens along the Gulf Coast and combines with arctic air spilling southward.</p><p>The exact path the storm takes out of the Gulf of Mexico will have a direct impact on what type of winter precipitation falls and where.</p><p>Heavy snow is anticipated in north-central and northeast Texas, including the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=FWD&amp;issuedby=FWD&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fort Worth office</a> of the Weather Service predicted snow accumulations of three to six inches, with ice potentially adding an additional layer of danger. Similar totals are expected in southeastern <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=OUN&amp;issuedby=OUN&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oklahoma</a>, where some areas could see up to six inches of snow by Friday.</p><p>Arkansas is also in the storm’s path, with the west-central and central parts of the state likely to receive at least four inches of snow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Freezing rain and sleet are also forecast to stretch from central Texas, the north of Louisiana and central parts of Mississippi and Alabama, creating a patchwork of wintry conditions, though specific amounts are hard to pinpoint this far in advance, Peter Mullinax, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, said on Tuesday.</p><p>“There’s still some uncertainty once you get east of Mississippi,” he said.</p><p>In Georgia, where the precise precipitation type is still uncertain, freezing rain is becoming an increasing concern among forecasters. The Weather Service office in Peachtree City <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ffc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> that Friday into Saturday could bring accumulating ice, particularly along and north of Interstate 20. The mountains of northern Georgia may see up to an inch or more of snow.</p><p>From Friday, the storm is forecast to bring light to moderate snowfall to areas of Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina and possibly South Carolina. According to current Weather Service forecasts, these areas are likely to receive at least an inch of snow, with some locations in Tennessee potentially accumulating more than three inches.</p><p>While some snow amounts remained uncertain, forecasters at the Weather Service said snow totals were likely to be greatest from portions of North Texas into southeastern Oklahoma and central Arkansas.</p><p>“With the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex averaging just 1.8 inches of snow per season, this storm could be a rare and disruptive event,” Mr. Mullinax said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>It is likely that other places recently hit by this weekend’s snowstorm could face the potential for another highly impactful winter weather event in the Mid-Atlantic.
