    <h1>The 25 Most Influential Shoes and Bags</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>After debating the most impactful <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/t-magazine/fashion-influential-womens-collections.html" title="">women’s</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/t-magazine/most-influential-mens-wear-collections-postwar.html" title="">men’s</a> fashion since World War II as part of our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/t25" title="">T 25 series</a>, we decided to ask five members of the American fashion community to each nominate 10 accessories they felt were worthy of being on a list of the 25 most influential shoes and handbags of the past 100 years. Our group of panelists spanned over four decades of experience in the industry and included the stylist and T contributing editor Ian Bradley; the author and former creative director of Barneys New York Simon Doonan; the creative director and founder of the accessories label Brother Vellies, Aurora James; the senior vice president for creative merchandising of Nordstrom, Olivia Kim; and the founder and designer of the fashion brand Luar, Raul Lopez.</p><p>On a cold evening last December, the jury convened on a video call — which ended up lasting two-and-a-half hours — to wrangle over the 50 shoes and handbags they’d put forth. Some nominations were rejected, either because the group felt a piece hadn’t substantially informed what came after it or because it didn’t meet the list’s two criteria: the accessory must have been designed after 1925 and sold in stores. That latter rule disqualified Alexander McQueen’s nearly 12-inch-high <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/828415" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Armadillo platform heels</a>; although they challenged the standards of shoe shape and height at the time (some models reportedly refused to wear them on the runway in 2009, for fear of injury), they were never available to the public. Other propositions were met with unanimous approval, such as Fendi’s 1997 Baguette bag. The 2001 Le City bag and a pair of 2007 “Lego” heels from Nicolas Ghesquière’s 15-year tenure at Balenciaga took two spots, making him the only designer with multiple items on the list.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/t-magazine/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/t-magazine/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/t-magazine/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A screenshot of six people in a Google meeting." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/t-magazine/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/t-magazine/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/t-magazine/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/t-magazine/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F/13tmag-accessories-slide-QR2F-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1817w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/56f1989b-6ecd-548b-8bbd-cda394620559" decoding="async" width="600" height="516"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The T contributing editor and the conversation’s moderator, Alexa Brazilian (bottom right), with the panelists (clockwise from top left) Simon Doonan, Aurora James, Olivia Kim, Raul Lopez and Ian Bradley.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The 25 selected pieces, which appear not ranked by their importance but in the rough order they were discussed, come from almost every decade since the 1930s (excepting the 1940s and 2020s). Discussed with particular enthusiasm were the picks from the 1990s and early aughts, which made sense, the group concluded: the ’90s were when the idea of the It bag was born, ushering in an era in which status-symbol accessories would permeate pop culture, with Real Housewives and Kardashians wearing Louboutins and carrying Hermès Birkins on TV.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But though we still live in that age, the hysteria around shoes and handbags may have peaked in a 2000 episode of the HBO series “Sex and the City,” in which Sarah Jessica Parker’s character, Carrie Bradshaw, wearing a pair of towering heels and a purple sequin-encrusted Fendi purse, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-fBm2hY-Sw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is mugged at gunpoint</a>.

So when he staged his first ready-to-wear runway show in Paris, in 1988, at age 31, he paired the deconstructed garments for which he would become known — like jackets and vests made inside out so their seams became graphic design details — with equally conceptual footwear. Inspired by the image of a bare foot resting atop a high heel, he looked to the Japanese tabi (“foot bag”). The style, which separates the wearer’s big toe from the other four — the division is thought to improve balance — evolved from traditional socks often worn with thong sandals. To achieve his desired “naked” look, Margiela crafted booties, some flesh-colored, in slightly crinkled leather and suede, and affixed them to rounded, stacked-wood heels. To economize, he reused the same samples for several seasons, until they eventually became a signature — and a best seller. For the next two decades, Margiela regularly reinterpreted the style, presenting split-toed ballet flats, sneakers and pumps. In 2023, 35 years after its introduction, the tabi was at the center of a social media scandal when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/style/tiktok-missing-tabi-shoes.html" title="">a woman accused her Tinder date of stealing her pair</a> and giving them to his girlfriend. Commenters were outraged. — <em>Jameson Montgomery</em></p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-10"><div><figcaption><span>The tabi has become a street-style favorite, as seen on (from left) the musicians Aya and Ami Suzuki in Paris, 2020; a pair of Copenhagen Fashion Week attendees, 2023; and the dancer Patricia Zhou in Paris, 2024.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>From left: Kirstin Sinclair/Getty Images; Edward Berthelot/Getty Images; Christian Vierig/Getty Images</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Aurora James: </strong>It might be among the 25 most <em>beloved</em> shoes, but I don’t know that it’s been that influential.

Bean</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Considered by many to be the prototypical canvas carryall, the L.L. Bean Boat and Tote was introduced by the Maine-based outfitter in 1965 as a relaunch of a 1944 design. The Ice Carrier, as the bag was originally known, was designed with a double-layer bottom for transporting block ice before the rise of home freezers. Still made from the same undyed, oatmeal-hued canvas, the slimmer Boat and Tote retains its two-tone design (straps and bottom panels were originally available in either red or blue) and handles that can be slung over a shoulder. Though modestly priced (it sold for $4.75 in 1965 and costs less than $50 today), it became associated with wealthy East Coast summer destinations like Nantucket and the Hamptons. Endless iterations — some zipper-topped, others with longer straps or interior pouches — have since come out in a range of colors and sizes. Monogramming was once as far as preppier clients would go to personalize their totes, but tongue-in-cheek embroidery (“Birkin,” “Oy Vey,” “Full of It”) has now become a trend with its own Instagram account (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ironicboatandtote/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@ironicboatandtote</a>). The core design, however, is unchanged, and the bags are still, according to the company, “handcrafted, one tote at a time, by a small team of stitchers in Maine.” — <em>J.M.</em></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-17"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A page from a spring 1978 L.L.

But it wasn’t until 1925 that his great-grandson Konrad had the then-radical idea of contouring insoles to the shape of feet — an innovation he patented under the name <em>fußbett</em> (“footbed”). Almost immediately, Birkenstocks were embraced by podiatrists, and in the 1960s the company started mass-producing the styles we know today. First released in 1973, the Arizona, Birkenstock’s most enduring model, is a genderless sandal with two adjustable, buckled straps attached to a jute, cork and latex sole. Although they were initially seen as an anti-fashion accessory, associated with hippies and retirees, two decades later they became a style statement: Marc Jacobs incorporated them into his spring 1993 Perry Ellis show, and actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow were often photographed wearing them. The Arizona has resurfaced lately, in collaborations with brands such as Manolo Blahnik and Valentino and in the 2023 film “Barbie,” in which the sandal is posited as the antidote to the pink high heel. — <em>J.M.</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An ad from Birkenstock’s 1984 “Funny Looking” campaign.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Birkenstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p><strong>James: </strong>I’d just die if these shoes didn’t make the list.

This is the shoe of people who’ve never had a pedicure. And the fact that nearly everyone has made their own version of this — <em>myself included</em>? I was literally wearing a version this morning that I did.

You can find them on Zappos or at Nordstrom. There are all these designers who’ve done their own versions and those who’ve done partnerships with [Birkenstock], whether it’s Manolo [Blahnik] or Rick Owens. I also appreciate their democratic-ness — people wear them lots of different ways. There are really crunchy people with crusty heels wearing these shoes who’ve actually climbed Mount Everest. Birkenstock celebrated its 250th anniversary last year — there aren’t many companies with that type of heritage that have created something accessible and influential.</p><p><strong>Doonan: </strong>It’s interesting that the epitome of anti-fashion counterculture can be re-embraced in a postmodern way and done in a thousand iterations, including pink fur. That’s what’s so magical about fashion: things go round and round.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p><h2 id="link-2a62536">4.

But the label attracted a broader fan base as a result of the 2014 introduction of its now-ubiquitous Shopping Bag. As the name suggests, the all-purpose, affordable, unisex tote was influenced by the silhouette of Bloomingdale’s paper carryalls, which made their debut in the 1970s and include sans-serif text indicating their sizes: “little,” “medium” or “big.” Telfar’s totes are also rectangular, but with a longer, cross-body strap and two top handles. Like their inspiration, they originally came in three sizes; there’s now a fourth option: “shmedium.” Made from a twill-lined polyurethane blend (a more expensive leather version also exists), the bag has been referred to as the “Bushwick Birkin” because of its popularity among Brooklyn creative types. But Clemens has made it clear that he’s not interested in catering to any one group: “It’s not for you,” says the Telfar slogan. “It’s for everyone.” — <em>J.M.</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Telfar Clemens at home in Queens, New York, 2020.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sue Kwon</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p><strong>James: </strong>As someone who’s done a ton of development on plant-based substitutes and spent most of my life being vegan, I applaud Telfar for making the first mainstream vegan [leather] bag.</p><p><strong>Lopez: </strong>A fun fact: When Telfar received his first sample back in the day, I was the first person to see this bag.

This was particularly true in the late aughts, when prevailing silhouettes were unforgivingly tight. Likely because most shoppers couldn’t wear those clothes, designers increasingly turned their attention to footwear, striving to invent the next hit shoe. No style captures that phenomenon as clearly as Balenciaga’s closed-toe cage sandal, which debuted in the fall 2007 runway show. Conceived by Nicolas Ghesquière, the brand’s creative director at the time, in collaboration with the shoe and accessories designer Pierre Hardy, the so-called Lego heels were made of vividly hued plastic components that formed a detachable cage around their wearer’s foot. Belted pads at the toe and ankle were inspired by adjustable snowboard bindings. The sandals helped popularize flashy, high-concept heels and drew their share of imitators: In 2009, Balenciaga filed a lawsuit against the New York-based retailer Steve Madden for alleged copyright infringement, eventually arriving at an undisclosed settlement. — <em>J.M.</em></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-34"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A look from Balenciaga’s fall 2007 women’s show.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">firstVIEW</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Another look from that collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">firstVIEW</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p><strong>Lopez: </strong>This reminded me of what Balenciaga tried to do with those <a href="https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/fall-21" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[fall 2021] silver boots</a> put together with screws.

(And after eluding any sanctions for her secret <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/sleeping-with-the-enemy-coco-chanels-secret-war-by-hal-vaughan-book-review.html" title="">collaboration</a> with the Nazis.) Before the war, her little black dresses and jersey sportswear had already changed the way women dressed; afterward, she introduced the hallmarks most associated with the brand today: quilted handbags, tweed suits and the two-toned slingback pump. The shoe, which debuted in 1957, was creamy beige and had a black toe cap to protect the paler leather from scuffs. After Karl Lagerfeld joined the maison as creative director in 1983, he made the cap toe, which had been embraced by everyone from Park Avenue socialites to actresses like Catherine Deneuve and Jane Fonda, a Chanel signature, reinterpreting the look with ballet flats, boots, sandals and even sneakers over the course of his 36-year tenure. But for his fall 2015 Chanel show, Lagerfeld went back to basics, putting each model in a block-heeled version of the buff-and-black original. — <em>Megan O’Sullivan</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A model wears the pumps with a Chanel suit in Paris, 1961.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bridgeman Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p><strong>James: </strong>Although it’s not necessarily something I’d wear, for a whole set of women, if they’re going to spend money on something, this is the first expensive shoe they get.</p><p><strong>Brazilian: </strong>It was the first real It slingback.

While abroad, Aldo noticed the popularity of the penny loafer among American men and decided that Gucci should make its own version. Rather than having a coin slot, Gucci’s leather slip-ons — which were cut, sewn and hammered by hand — featured a horse bit, a motif introduced a few years earlier by Guccio, who had an interest in equestrian style. Francis Ford Coppola wore them while directing the first two “Godfather” movies in the 1970s, New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art added them to its permanent collection in the ’80s, and by the ’90s they were so ubiquitous on Wall Street that they were known as “deal sleds.” When Tom Ford took artistic control of the brand in 1994, the loafer underwent a series of makeovers, emerging with a square toe one season and a logo print the next. Future creative directors followed his lead, with Alessandro Michele reinterpreting the shoe for fall 2015 as a shearling-lined slide and Sabato De Sarno, who stepped down earlier this month, adding platform heels to his spring 2024 version. — <em>M.O.</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-43"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The director Francis Ford Coppola at his American Zoetrope studio in San Francisco, 1970.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettmann/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p><strong>Bradley: </strong>I’d say that Alessandro’s greatest achievement at Gucci was doing the horse-bit loafer slide.

In his 20s, he studied to be a set designer, but a 1969 meeting with the fashion editor Diana Vreeland put him on a different path; three years later, he was presenting his first shoe collection in London as part of an Ossie Clark fashion show. For the half-century since, “Manolos” have been a red-carpet mainstay. The best-selling BB style, created in 2008, is a pointed-toe court pump with a low-cut top line and a wrapped stiletto heel inspired by, Blahnik has said, the 1950s and ’60s style of Brigitte Bardot.

At age 9, he’d created his first pair of shoes — for his sister’s first communion — and by 12, he began selling shoes out of his parents’ home in the small southern Italian town of Bonito. After moving to California with some of his 12 brothers in 1915, he befriended actresses like Mary Pickford, and in 1938, he designed the shoe that solidified his own stardom: a wedge sandal with a three-and-a-half-inch cork platform covered in rainbow-hued suede stripes, for Judy Garland. As one of the first Western designers to popularize the towering silhouette, Ferragamo inspired countless iterations including the platform go-go boots of the 1960s, the flamboyant disco shoes of the ’70s and ’80s and Vivienne Westwood’s 1993 Ghillie lace-ups. The original, complete with multicolored stitching and gold straps, remains in production. — <em>M.O.</em></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-54"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Salvatore Ferragamo in his atelier in Florence, Italy, 1956.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Archivio Fotografico Giuseppe Palmas</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Workers at Ferragamo’s Florentine studio, 1937.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bridgeman Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-25"><div><p><strong>James: </strong>The Ferragamo platform was a fun, sexy, feminine shoe — and I feel like so many shoe designers are constantly referencing it.</p><p><strong>Bradley: </strong>It shows what’s possible in an extreme way.</p><p><strong>Doonan: </strong>And it’s an exquisite piece of design, especially the way the edges bevel.

Having come up short, she built a maquette from construction paper and Scotch tape and named her creation Sam, then produced it in black nylon and introduced it to the industry at a trade show in 1993. Barneys New York placed the first order, and, before long, seemingly every fashionable young Manhattanite owned one. Box-shaped with simple shoulder straps, the bag captured the era’s minimalist aesthetic: Its most identifiable feature was its rectangular, white-on-black Kate Spade label, which the designer stitched on the front rather than the inside. Early adopters included Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, but the tote’s legacy has less to do with celebrities than with women like Spade herself, who’d left her native Missouri in her youth with dreams of making it in New York. For many ambitious Generation Xers, buying a Sam was an important token of adulthood, a sign that they’d arrived. — <em>M.O.</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-59"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The designers and actresses Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen at the Hollywood premiere of “Anna and the King,” 1999.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ron Gallela/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-27"><div><p><strong>Bradley: </strong>When I was 10, it was the bag every girl carried.

Among those offerings was Comme des Garçons Wallet, a small collection of leather goods. In 1994, as part of that line, Kawakubo released a simple, rectangular pouch, which — at just over eight inches wide and six inches tall, with a zippered top — was possibly the most functional item she’d ever designed. The perfect size for a comb and a tube of lipstick or a passport and cash, it slid easily into a tote and could double as a clutch. The style caught on in Kawakubo’s corner of the fashion world, and a smaller version was later added to the collection. Both have been reimagined in various patterns, colors and materials, including polka dots, plaid, fluorescents and holographic silver leather.

At the peak of the label’s popularity in the mid-80s, the company went so far as to assert that 1 in 4 American women owned a pair. In 1993, Candie’s was acquired by the brand management company Iconix International, which would bring in a succession of Y2K stars as spokespeople, including Destiny’s Child, Hilary Duff and Britney Spears.

With a degree in political science, Prada was more of a thinker than a designer, and her feminist politics influenced her aesthetics, too. “Any bourgeois subject that I approached, I always wanted to destroy it,” she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/19/t-magazine/miuccia-prada-fashion.html" title="">told</a> T in 2023. And so her backpack, which became available in 1984, wasn’t made of leather or exotic skins but of military-grade black nylon, a material best known for its use in parachutes. Often called the “Vela,” or “sail” in Italian, it had a single silver buckle attached to its front flap, where the brand’s triangular logo was prominently displayed. A minimalist statement, the pack, which now sells for about $2,300, became as covetable as any leather handbag, proving that the jolie-laide, or “pretty-ugly,” a term often applied to Prada’s style, could draw customers. The Vela has enjoyed remarkable staying power; today, there’s also a more sustainable recycled nylon version. — <em>E.P.</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-79"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A look from Prada’s fall 2024 men’s show.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">firstVIEW</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-36"><div><p><strong>Bradley: </strong>The idea of a designer backpack was very foreign then.

Earlier that year Jean-Louis Dumas, the French luxury house’s executive chairman, was seated next to the actress and singer Jane Birkin on a flight from Paris to London and witnessed her straw basket bag tumble to the floor, its contents scattering everywhere. Birkin complained about how hard it was to find a good, practical weekend bag; the two began exchanging ideas, and her namesake was born. Its briefcase-like design looks simple enough, but it can take Hermès artisans from 15 to 20 hours to hand-stitch each one. And although it was originally priced at $2,000, current styles — which vary in size (from about 8 to just under 16 inches), color (from classic saddle brown to bright orange) and material (from ostrich to alligator) — can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and, famously, there have been waiting lists just for the opportunity to buy one. Last year, a similar bag showed up on the Walmart website for less than $100. Dubbed the “Wirkin,” it sold out in no time. — <em>E.P.</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-85"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A 2009 goatskin Hermès Birkin.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bridgeman Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-39"><div><p><strong>Doonan: </strong>The Birkin was an exclusive item that not many people knew about until the ’90s, when it became <em>the</em> signifier of glamour.

And then it was everywhere.</p><p><strong>Doonan: </strong>It’s interesting to note that prior to this bag’s existence, Jane Birkin carried everything in a rudimentary, rustic basket, which is what girls used to do. Before the handbag revolution, which happened in the ’90s and into the aughts, hip girls used to carry their stuff in a paper bag or shopping bag. A designer bag was [seen as too] conventional.</p><p><strong>Kim: </strong>Its evolution is interesting, too. Jane wore it with all those charms and ribbons on it; that’s how that trend came about.

In 1997, after noticing Parisian women carrying bread under their arms, she created the Baguette, a slender purse with a short handle and Fendi’s signature double-F logo on the clasp. The bag has now been produced in over a thousand iterations: covered with sequins, embroidery, animal prints and logos. If Hermès’s Birkin became known for being hard to get, ample production of the Baguette allowed it to become one of the first true It bags. In 2022, 25 years after the bag’s release, Venturini Fendi said she considered the Baguette to be “a manifesto of identity and individuality, because it is always the same but always different.” — <em>E.P.</em></p><p><strong>Lopez: </strong>I have so many of these — with shells and crystals, the whole thing.</p><p><strong>Brazilian: </strong>How many do you have?</p><p><strong>Lopez: </strong>Twelve.</p><p><strong>Doonan: </strong>Fendi found a groove with this bag shape. And then came the embroidered ones, beaded ones and artists’ collaborations. It was a whole thing. As a guy, I’m fascinated by how something like this can take off — women are coughing up thousands and thousands of dollars for these things. I always think about Sigmund Freud, who said something like “If you dream about handbags, those are vaginal symbols.” And if you think about it, it’s true — you don’t get to see inside your mother’s handbag, because it’s private and always held close to the body. When I see the Baguette, it’s always carried under the arm, almost like a secret.</p><p><strong>Kim: </strong>Growing up in New York in the ’90s— it’s impossible to not think of the Fendi Baguette and hip-hop. You think about Lil’ Kim or Foxy Brown, who’d wear Fendi out at the clubs. I remember the first time I bought this bag, when I was in college. I’d saved all my money.

Around 2000, after other labels started launching their best-selling bags, Balenciaga’s then-creative director, Nicolas Ghesquière, says he was instructed by the French conglomerate Groupe Jacques Bogart, which owned the brand at the time, to design one, too. What he came up with was a soft, patinated lambskin handbag with no logo, a slouchy structure and vintage-looking hardware — the opposite of the instantly recognizable, straightforwardly luxurious styles that were popular at the time. Convinced that the purse wouldn’t sell, the company decided not to produce it. But things changed after Kate Moss was seen with a rare prototype, and Le Dix Motorcycle Lariat, eventually known as Le City bag, came out in 2001. “It was a new, fresh thing, but it looked like an old, good, friendly thing,” Ghesquière said in 2011. — <em>Tahirah Hairston</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-94"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The model Kate Moss with her Balenciaga Le City bag in London, 2003.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-43"><div><p><strong>Bradley: </strong>It’s my number one.

Nineteen years later, the American designer Norma Kamali alluded to the song with a round-toe sneaker with prominent laces, a rubber toe cap and a tapered three-inch heel, somewhere between a stiletto and a Converse Chuck Taylor. Available in canvas or suede and in shades of red, yellow, green, blue, black and white, the shoes were released to go with Kamali’s 1980 Sweats collection, which also included sporty tops, dresses and pants. Looking back, Kamali seems to have anticipated the athleisure trend. “For the first time, casual clothing was worn to work, travel and on dates. The sneaker, to me, was a natural fit,” says Kamali, who patented the design in 1986. Other elevated athletic shoes followed — Isabel Marant’s Bekett wedges in 2011; Rihanna’s spike-heeled Fenty x Puma collaboration in 2017 — and in 2024, Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx, debuted stiletto sneakers called Sneex. —<em> T.H.</em></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-101"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A 1983 patent request for Kamali’s “high heeled calf length sneaker.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Norma Kamali</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A 1983 issue of Sport Style magazine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Norma Kamali</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-46"><div><p><strong>Lopez: </strong>Damn, I didn’t think about this one.

She started her own brand in 1963, after working on the assembly line for several handbag manufacturers. Determined to sell an affordable version of the small, gem-studded evening bags carried by royalty and aristocrats, in 1967 she designed a brass clutch, plated in gold or silver. But “when the samples came in,” she said, “it looked awful.” Her solution was to add Swarovski crystals to hide the bag’s flaws. She named the small, kiss-lock clutch the Chatelaine, and it became Leiber’s most popular creation. The success of that bag led her to create other whimsical, Swarovski-crystal-studded minaudières — small, formal clutches for holding makeup — shaped like animals, fruits or bunches of asparagus. “What she did was groundbreaking,” Harold Koda, the former head curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said in 2017, a year before Leiber’s death. “She gave bags and purses a narrative.” —<em> T.H.</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-106"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judith Leiber in her Midtown Manhattan studio in the 1960s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of the Leiber Collection</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-48"><div><p><strong>James: </strong>I don’t have a strong emotional connection to this bag, but I think its influence runs deep.

The Buffalo, which would come in a variety of exotic animal skins over the years and which, according to Women’s Wear Daily, was among the most imitated of the era, was inspired by Falchi’s time as an art student in Japan.

Created as part of a five-year, $2.5 million endorsement deal with Michael Jordan, then a 21-year-old Chicago Bulls rookie, the shoe was designed by the Nike creative director Peter Moore, with innovative details including a padded ankle collar and fixed straps on the forefoot for extra stability. Its name alluded to both Jordan’s dunking skills and the high-tech pocket of compressed air added to the sole to cushion impact. Its bold black-and-red colorway violated the NBA’s dress code, which at the time required footwear to be 51 percent white, and the league fined the Bulls $1,000 the first time Jordan wore them on the court — threatening the team with greater fines and additional penalties should he wear them again — which only made them more covetable. Nike expected to sell 100,000 pairs in the shoe’s first year; instead, it shipped 1.5 million in the first six weeks. Although the Air Jordan 1 wasn’t the first sneaker created for a basketball player — Walt Frazier-branded Pumas and Adidas shoes with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s likeness on the tongue both came out in the ’70s — the deal between Nike and Jordan, in which Jordan received royalties on every sale, was revolutionary. — <em>K.W.</em></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-119"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jordan on the court in Chicago during the 1984-85 NBA season.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Focus on Sport/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Anthony Kiedis (second from left) with the other members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, 1985.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ebet Roberts/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-54"><div><p><strong>Kim:</strong> He was sponsored by not only fashion brands but also Gatorade [and Coke].

(The Italian brand reportedly agreed to pay him a settlement.) “I think they empower women,” de Havilland, who died in 2019, told T<em> </em>about his shoes. “They give you your own little stage to stand on.” — <em>K.W.</em></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-125"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>De Havilland in his shop in London, 1974.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reveille/Mirrorpix/Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The actor Tim Curry on a poster for “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” (1975).</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alamy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-57"><div><p><strong>Doonan: </strong>I’m going to demand that these Terry de Havillands get a spot, and I’ll tell you why. The Woodstock generation with its hippie style — a lot of it’s very influential now, but it was very earnest. What’s funny about Birkenstocks is how serious they are. Cut to 1972: [David Bowie’s] Ziggy Stardust album is released. It’s the birth of glam rock. Everything suddenly took on a shimmering, theatrical feel that was playful and camp. And what were girls going to wear with their satin hot pants? Not only are these platform shoes, which is a nod to the 1940s, but they’re snakeskin, which is so decadent and glamorous. To today’s eyes, they probably don’t seem like that big a deal, but oh my God, it was so brash and tarty and <em>fun</em>.</p><p><strong>Bradley:</strong> When I see this shape, I picture Diana Ross boogieing. And then it was replicated by Miu Miu, Fendi and even [Christian] Louboutin. I feel like this is what women still wear with their bridesmaid dresses.</p><h2 id="link-7e20ae0b">24. Launer’s Jubilee Bag, 1972</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-127"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A 2022 version of Launer’s 1972 Jubilee bag.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Launer</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-58"><p>Over the course of her seven-decade reign, Queen Elizabeth II of Britain was known for her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/style/queen-elizabeth-style.html" title="">strict uniform</a>: brightly colored dresses and coats accessorized with a three-strand pearl necklace, a jeweled brooch, block-heeled shoes and a variety of custom box-shaped bags with top handles from the British leather-goods maker Launer. Founded in 1941 by Sam Launer and owned since 1981 by Gerald Bodmer, the West Midlands-based brand was awarded a royal warrant in 1968 — which meant having permission to display the royal arms on its products — but its history with the House of Windsor dates to the 1950s, when, legend has it, the Queen Mother first acquired a Launer purse and gave one to her daughter. From the ’60s on, whether it was the Eleanor bag, made specially for the royal wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, or the Jubilee, a popular 1972 style reintroduced in 2022 to celebrate the queen’s Platinum Jubilee, Queen Elizabeth II was rarely seen without one tucked under her arm — much to the reported dismay of Sir Hardy Amies, one of her longtime dressmakers, who felt it ruined the flow of his garments. Formal and structured, with a gold clasp in the shape of the brand’s emblem, a twisted rope, the bag epitomized the queen’s practical approach to fashion: She occasionally commissioned bespoke touches like a coin purse and longer handles for easier handshaking. She’s also rumored to have used the bag as a secret signaling device; according to the royal historian Hugo Vickers, she’d switch it from her left arm to her right to indicate that she’d grown tired of a conversation. — K.W.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-130"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Queen Elizabeth II carrying a Launer bag to the royal wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey, London, in 2011.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-59"><div><p><strong>Doonan: </strong>Respectable women wanted to look like this.

So perhaps it was no accident that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/t-magazine/louboutin-house-design-portugal.html" title="">Christian Louboutin’s</a> Daffodiles became the celebrity shoe of choice: The six-and-a-half-inch platform heels, which came out in 2011, lengthened the legs and lifted the backside. Like a luxury version of the stripper’s Pleaser, they were a sexy rebuttal to the more ladylike single-sole stiletto. Daffodiles came in many styles and colors, including bright pinks and greens, leopard and graffiti motifs and Mary Janes and boots. Beyoncé sat courtside at the 2011 NBA All-Star Game in skinny jeans and a bedazzled version; Kim Kardashian said<em> </em>in 2017 that she had been “obsessed with them.” In 2011<em>, </em>Louboutin noted that he considers the entire body when designing a shoe. “When a woman buys a pair of shoes, she never looks at the shoe,” he said. “She stands up and looks in the mirror, she looks at the breast, the ass, from the front, from the side, blah blah blah. If she likes herself, <em>then</em> she considers the shoe.” —<em> T.H.</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-134"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Christian Louboutin photographed at home in Lisbon, Portugal, for the April 2019 issue of British Vogue.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">François Halard / Trunk Archive</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-61"><div><p><strong>Bradley: </strong>This was a game changer for a lot of women.
