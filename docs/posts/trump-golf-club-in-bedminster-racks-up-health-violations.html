On the same day the inspection took place, a different inspector gave a restaurant elsewhere in the county a nearly identical grade, a 33, after uncovering similar violations.</p><p>The Somerset County Health Department declined to discuss the inspections. The initial inspection of the club was previously reported by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2025/06/04/trump-health-inspection-violations-golf-club-bedminster/?utm_source=THREADS&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=17217838064&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesMainTh" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Forbes</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On 520 acres of rolling hills in Bedminster, the property was bought by Mr. Trump in 2002 and opened two years later.

After tallying 18 violations in all, nine of them critical, Ms. Khurram determined that the chef in charge during her review had failed to “demonstrate knowledge of food safety.”</p><p>Ms. Khurram also conducted the follow-up review on Wednesday, but there was a different person in charge of the club kitchen — Trump National’s executive chef. Most of the initial concerns had been addressed.</p><p>But she recorded new violations, too. Two were considered critical, including coffee creamer that had registered 50 degrees instead of the required 41 degrees.
