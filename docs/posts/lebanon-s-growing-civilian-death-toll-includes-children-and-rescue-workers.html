The toll includes 50 children and 94 women.</p><p>Among them was Dina Darwiche, an employee of the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR. Her body was found along with that of her youngest son after an Israeli missile hit the building where they lived in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Friends wrote tributes to Ms. Darwiche on social media, many of them posting a selfie of her smiling and posing with the son who was killed with her. Others shared a video of a U.N. campaign she ran in previous years against gender-based violence.</p><p>“She had been dedicated to her humanitarian work with UNHCR for as long as I can remember,” her friend, Jasmin Diab, posted on the social media platform X. “I am broken. I am absolutely destroyed. I cannot breathe. When will the world let us breathe?!”</p><p>Israel and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political party with powerful sway over Lebanon, have been locked in near daily cross-border skirmishes since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks. Hezbollah began launching rockets in a bid to push Israel toward a cease-fire in Hamas-controlled Gaza, where more than 40,000 have been killed.</p><p>But the tempo of those sporadic clashes, which forced tens of thousands of Lebanese and Israelis on either side of the border to flee their homes, reached a new level with Israel’s strikes in recent days.</p><p>Military experts have called Israel’s latest campaign one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-deaths.html?smid=url-share" title="">most intense air raids</a> in modern warfare.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Israeli officials argue that the strikes are not targeting civilians, and they point to evacuation orders for targeted areas as proof. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/23/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah?smid=url-share#israeli-evacuation-warnings-prompt-fear-and-confusion-in-lebanon" title="">rights groups counter that Israel</a> doesn’t specify regions to evacuate but warns people to stay away from places where Hezbollah is hiding weapons, an assessment that is difficult to impossible for civilians to assess.</p><p>Lebanon’s health ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its casualty counts, making it difficult to gauge how many of those killed have been civilians. On Tuesday, Firass Abiad, the health minister, said that the “vast majority were unarmed people who were safely in their homes.”</p><p>“Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon are now relentlessly claiming hundreds of civilian lives,” Filippo Grandi, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, <a href="https://x.com/FilippoGrandi/status/1838563937983369370" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X, in a statement mourning the loss of the agency’s two employees.</p><p>In addition to Ms. Darwiche, the UNHCR <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/lb/18817-unhcr-mourns-killing-of-beloved-staff-member-and-contractor-staff-in-lebanon.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> one of its janitors, Ali Basma, had been killed in southern Lebanon.</p><p>Lebanon’s electricity company said Israeli strikes in the south killed one of its engineers in her home, along with her husband, children, parents and sister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Wednesday, employees at Electricity of Lebanon paid tribute to Farah Kajak. “She left an unforgettable mark among all her colleagues and those who worked with her,” they wrote.</p><p>Waleed Fayyad, the energy minister, said the strike on her family “reflects the extent of the brutality of the enemy, which does not respect international or humanitarian law.”</p><p>The Risala scouts, an Islamic organization that includes youth activities as well as emergency aid services, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RisalaScout" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> three of its members, Ilan Basheer, Nour Touba and Hussein Moussa, were killed in their homes in southern Lebanon.</p><p>Four of Risala’s first aid responders were killed as they were working to rescue people this week, the group said.</p><p>Mr. Abiad, the minister of health, said 14 ambulances and fire engines had been targeted in Israeli strikes, killing the Risala emergency responders and wounding 16 other medics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Lebanese media networks have also claimed losses in their ranks. On Monday, Hadi al-Sayed, a journalist with the pro-Hezbollah Mayadeen News network, was killed.</p><p>The International Federation of Journalists said Mr. al-Sayed was the fourth journalist killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since Oct. 7.</p><p>“Whether killed deliberately, or as collateral damage, it represents a shocking disregard for human life and the journalistic community in particular,” said Anthony Bellanger, the group’s secretary general.</p><p>Since Monday, the number has again risen: On Wednesday, the Hezbollah-affiliated Manar Television said its journalist Kamel Karaki was also killed.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">Israel-Hamas War News</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/united-nations">United Nations</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israeli Strikes in Lebanon</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>As world leaders gathered for the U.N.
