In Europe, stocks were gaining ground.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Wall Street, S&amp;P 500 futures were signaling a 0.5 percent gain when trading begins. Through Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 4 percent on the week, although the index remains sharply lower since Mr. Trump took office.</p><p>News from China suggested the tit-for-tat escalation of trade barriers between Beijing and Washington could be easing. Bloomberg News <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/china-weighs-exempting-some-us-goods-from-tariffs-as-costs-rise?sref=rWJsyGwt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that China was considering exempting tariffs on some critical items it imports from the United States, including medical equipment and the chemical ethane used for making some plastics.</p><p>There have also been indications that China may be relenting on tariffs on semiconductors made in the United States. China depends on foreign companies for advanced computer chips, and many in the country’s tech industry have hoped semiconductors will escape the tariffs.</p><p>Earlier this month, a state-backed trade association in China said that a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/china-taiwan-tariffs-chips.html" title="">significant portion of advanced chips</a> from American companies would be exempt from China’s tariffs if they were made outside the United States.</p><p>Reports have circulated in Chinese media outlets and on Chinese social media this week that Beijing had decided not to subject some semiconductor-related products that were made in the United States to retaliatory tariffs. The Chinese government has not announced any such policy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Friday, China’s governing Politburo said it was ready to support the economy during the turmoil caused by the trade war. An official summary of the meeting, which was presided over by China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, was thin on specifics but said the government was ready to “stabilize employment” and increase unemployment insurance funding at companies “severely affected by tariffs.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the markets:</p><ul><li><p>The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell by 8 basis points, to 4.3 percent.</p></li><li><p>Oil futures gained 0.7 percent, with Brent crude at $66.03 a barrel.</p></li><li><p>Gold continued its slide after briefly reaching a record $3,500 an ounce on Monday; it was down to $3,317.</p></li></ul><p>Claire Fu<!-- --> and <!-- -->Siyi Zhao<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Meaghan Tobin covers business and tech stories in Asia with a focus on China and is based in Taipei.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on U.S.-China Relations</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Pursuing Activists Abroad: </strong>The U.S. fired a new round of sanctions at China, targeting Chinese and Hong Kong officials over what it described as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/asia/china-hong-kong-sanctions.html">acts of transnational repression</a> for their crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and on U.S. soil.</p></li><li><p><strong>Export Restrictions</strong><strong>: </strong>The Trump administration added 80 primarily Chinese companies and organizations to a list of companies that are barred from buying American technology and other exports because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/business/economy/trump-chinese-tech-firms-chips-security.html">national security concerns</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Consulting Firm Employees Freed: </strong>China has released five employees of an American corporate investigations firm, the Mintz Group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/china-mintz-release-us.html">two years after they were detained</a> as part of a crackdown by Beijing on foreign business consultancies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Panama Canal Deal: </strong>Beijing’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/business/trump-panama-canal-china-hong-kong.html">threat to stop a tycoon’s sale</a> of his ports business has dealmakers wondering if they can still operate without political interference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Voice in Beijing:</strong> Senator Steve Daines of Montana, one of President Trump’s top allies in Congress, has cast himself as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/world/asia/trump-china-xi-daines.html">an intermediary between the Trump administration and Beijing</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>China Says It Offers Stability: </strong>China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, cast his country as a bulwark for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/asia/china-tariffs-us-trump.html">peace and stability in a world thrown into chaos by the Trump administration</a>, even as Beijing provokes its neighbors and fuels trade tensions.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
