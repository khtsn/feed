The Trump administration’s statement on Monday was its first extensive response to Columbia’s announcement about concessions three days earlier.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/nyregion/columbia-trump-concessions-watershed.html" title="">changes are being made</a> in response to Trump administration claims that antisemitism, particularly as a part of pro-Palestinian demonstrations, has been insufficiently checked on campus.</p><p>“Columbia is demonstrating appropriate cooperation with the Trump administration’s requirements, and we look forward to a lasting resolution,” Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement. She added that she had been communicating with Columbia’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, during the last few weeks and that she appreciated “her leadership and commitment to advance truly meaningful reforms on campus.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Still, the road to restoring funding is long. The Trump administration regards the actions Columbia has announced as a “precondition” to formal talks to restore canceled federal grants and contracts, which largely affect scientific and medical research.</p><p>“Columbia’s early steps are a positive sign, but they must continue to show that they are serious in their resolve to end antisemitism and protect all students and faculty on their campus through permanent and structural reform,” said Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service, which is part of the General Services Administration, one of the agencies calling for changes at Columbia.</p><p>Earlier on Monday, at least 50 professors turned out in a steady drizzle outside the campus gates to protest the funding cuts and what they criticized as Columbia’s conciliatory response. The professors said they hoped to be the vanguard of a resistance movement among academics that remains, for now, at an early stage.</p><p>“We need to stand up, all of us,” said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia and vice president of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors, speaking to the crowd. “We need to organize, from the grass roots to the national level. If we lead, our leaders will follow.”</p><p>The protesting professors included a biomedical researcher who spoke on behalf of colleagues who had been laid off because of the funding cuts and a professor who studies autocratic regimes and protest movements. They held up signs with slogans including “Protect Academic Freedom” and “Columbia Fight Back.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“What is happening to Columbia now is what the erosion of democracy looks like,” said Virginia Page Fortna, a political science professor.</p><p>Calling on their knowledge of history and university governance, the professors said that the attacks against Columbia resembled steps commonly taken by authoritarian leaders. They said that Columbia’s concessions had weakened academic independence by consolidating power in the office of the university president.</p><p>“We’ve studied what’s happened to universities in authoritarianism,” said Anya Schiffrin, a senior lecturer at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. “We’ve seen what happened in Spain under Franco, in Turkey, in India and in Hungary. It’s a mistake to think it won’t happen here.”</p><p>The professors said they were particularly upset at the concessions that reduced faculty power, a concept that academics call “shared governance.” They said those changes would make it easier for the university to bend to political will.</p><p>The Columbia University Judicial Board, which federal officials have said was too slow and lenient in its punishment of pro-Palestinian demonstrators, will now be overseen by the school’s administration, not by its <a href="https://senate.columbia.edu/content/111-university-senators-20-schools" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University Senate</a>, a 111-member deliberative body that includes faculty and staff members and students. The Columbia president will decide all appeals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A new vice provost will review curriculum and hiring processes for several university departments, including a Middle East Studies department that the Trump administration demanded be put into “academic receivership.”</p><p>Samantha Slater, a Columbia spokeswoman, said in a statement that the university “is fully committed to the steps we announced last week to continue to combat antisemitism and all forms of discrimination and harassment. Our focus will always be on our core mission to teach, create, and advance knowledge while protecting free expression.”</p><p>The professors demonstrating on Monday, who said they were working on recruiting more people to the ranks of academic freedom activism, acknowledged that they could not operate at the speed of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency and other Trump White House “shock and awe” tactics. But they said they wanted to try.</p><p>“Institutions respond more slowly, and that’s just the reality,” Professor Thaddeus said. “We are going to respond vigorously, just on a time frame of weeks or months, not days.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon Otterman is a Times reporter covering higher education, public health and other issues facing New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sharon-otterman">More about Sharon Otterman</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>In the Ring, His Parents’ Money Doesn’t Matter:</strong> Sean O’Bradaigh grew up in a world of Manhattan privilege, but private schools and ski vacations have nothing on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/nyregion/in-the-ring-it-doesnt-matter-how-much-money-his-parents-have.html">dream of being a professional boxer</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Subway Ninja’:</strong> In the lowest moment of Selwyn Bernardez’s life, he attacked a stranger with a sword.
