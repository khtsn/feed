href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/25/us/trump-administration-updates" title=""><em>Follow live updates on the Trump administration here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The Trump administration on Monday welcomed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html" title="">concessions by Columbia University</a> to tighten disciplinary procedures and assert more control over academic departments in response to charges of antisemitism, saying the actions represent a “positive first step in the university maintaining a financial relationship with the United States government.”</p><p>Facing the loss of about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/nyregion/trump-administration-columbia-grants-cancelled-antisemitism.html" title="">$400 million in federal research funding</a>, Columbia has pledged that masked demonstrators must show identification when asked, that protests will generally not be allowed in academic buildings and that several dozen public security officers will be empowered to make arrests. The Trump administration’s statement on Monday was its first extensive response to Columbia’s announcement about concessions three days earlier.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/nyregion/columbia-trump-concessions-watershed.html" title="">changes are being made</a> in response to Trump administration claims that antisemitism, particularly as a part of pro-Palestinian demonstrations, has been insufficiently checked on campus.</p><p>“Columbia is demonstrating appropriate cooperation with the Trump administration’s requirements, and we look forward to a lasting resolution,” Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement. She added that she had been communicating with Columbia’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, during the last few weeks and that she appreciated “her leadership and commitment to advance truly meaningful reforms on campus.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Still, the road to restoring funding is long. The Trump administration regards the actions Columbia has announced as a “precondition” to formal talks to restore canceled federal grants and contracts, which largely affect scientific and medical research.</p><p>“Columbia’s early steps are a positive sign, but they must continue to show that they are serious in their resolve to end antisemitism and protect all students and faculty on their campus through permanent and structural reform,” said Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service, which is part of the General Services Administration, one of the agencies calling for changes at Columbia.</p><p>Earlier on Monday, at least 50 professors turned out in a steady drizzle outside the campus gates to protest the funding cuts and what they criticized as Columbia’s conciliatory response. The professors said they hoped to be the vanguard of a resistance movement among academics that remains, for now, at an early stage.</p><p>“We need to stand up, all of us,” said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia and vice president of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors, speaking to the crowd. “We need to organize, from the grass roots to the national level. If we lead, our leaders will follow.”</p><p>The protesting professors included a biomedical researcher who spoke on behalf of colleagues who had been laid off because of the funding cuts and a professor who studies autocratic regimes and protest movements. They held up signs with slogans including “Protect Academic Freedom” and “Columbia Fight Back.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“What is happening to Columbia now is what the erosion of democracy looks like,” said Virginia Page Fortna, a political science professor.</p><p>Calling on their knowledge of history and university governance, the professors said that the attacks against Columbia resembled steps commonly taken by authoritarian leaders. They said that Columbia’s concessions had weakened academic independence by consolidating power in the office of the university president.</p><p>“We’ve studied what’s happened to universities in authoritarianism,” said Anya Schiffrin, a senior lecturer at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. “We’ve seen what happened in Spain under Franco, in Turkey, in India and in Hungary. It’s a mistake to think it won’t happen here.”</p><p>The professors said they were particularly upset at the concessions that reduced faculty power, a concept that academics call “shared governance.” They said those changes would make it easier for the university to bend to political will.</p><p>The Columbia University Judicial Board, which federal officials have said was too slow and lenient in its punishment of pro-Palestinian demonstrators, will now be overseen by the school’s administration, not by its <a href="https://senate.columbia.edu/content/111-university-senators-20-schools" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University Senate</a>, a 111-member deliberative body that includes faculty and staff members and students. The Columbia president will decide all appeals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A new vice provost will review curriculum and hiring processes for several university departments, including a Middle East Studies department that the Trump administration demanded be put into “academic receivership.”</p><p>Samantha Slater, a Columbia spokeswoman, said in a statement that the university “is fully committed to the steps we announced last week to continue to combat antisemitism and all forms of discrimination and harassment. Our focus will always be on our core mission to teach, create, and advance knowledge while protecting free expression.”</p><p>The professors demonstrating on Monday, who said they were working on recruiting more people to the ranks of academic freedom activism, acknowledged that they could not operate at the speed of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency and other Trump White House “shock and awe” tactics. But they said they wanted to try.</p><p>“Institutions respond more slowly, and that’s just the reality,” Professor Thaddeus said. “We are going to respond vigorously, just on a time frame of weeks or months, not days.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon Otterman is a Times reporter covering higher education, public health and other issues facing New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sharon-otterman">More about Sharon Otterman</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Musk Effect:</strong> Elon Musk is seemingly everywhere, dominating the news out of Washington and beyond.
