Police officials said officers seized two dozen guns and about 500 knives during fare evasion stops in just the first nine months of 2024.</p><p>But critics say that the fare evasion crackdown is misguided and too costly for what it recoups in revenue. And when it leads to a police encounter that escalates, as it did that Sunday, Sept. 15, the effort can quickly turn dangerous for the New Yorkers it is supposed to protect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Surveillance camera footage from the Sutter Avenue subway station showed Derell Mickles hopping over a turnstile as two officers stood nearby.

On this day, only a few riders trickled in.</p><p>When Mr. Mickles entered the station, Officers Edmund Mays and Alex Wong were near the turnstiles as part of the broader effort to reduce crime in the subway. Officer Mays had been with the Police Department for 10 years; Officer Wong for six. Neither had faced significant accusations of misconduct on the job.</p><p>Mr. Mickles hopped a turnstile, backtracked when the officers confronted him and quickly left, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EaAraFPzEo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surveillance video shows</a>.

David LaFauci, a systems administrator on his way home from a trip to Italy, was on it. So was Kerry Ann Jahalal.

When the doors open, he backs into a car.</p><p>“Don’t touch me,” he says. “What is wrong with you all?”</p><p>Officer Wong looks toward the front of the train and yells for the conductor to hold it in the station.</p><p>Mr. Mickles walks toward the far end of the car as Officer Mays shadows him from the platform.

Mr. Delpeche, 50, walks toward the far end of the car and, eventually, onto the platform.</p><p>By now both officers are facing Mr. Mickles.</p><p>“Put down the knife.”</p><p>“Shoot me.”</p><p>“Put down the knife.”</p><p>“Shoot me.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>The officers take out their Tasers. Mr. LaFauci, 34, looks at an older man with a mustache and a tweed coat sitting across from him. They make eye contact, and the older man rises to get off the train. Mr. LaFauci stays put.</p><p><strong>3:06:58</strong></p><p>One of the officers fires his Taser at Mr. Mickles outside the frame of the body-camera footage.</p><p>Mr. Mickles has been hit, but it’s unclear whether the prongs have penetrated his shirt or skin. He walks toward the officers. This time, both fire.</p><p>“Taser! Taser! Taser!” Officer Mays shouts.</p><p>Mr. LaFauci later says he thought it was an odd thing to yell <em>after</em> firing. The thin copper Taser wires hang in the air in front of him. Still, he is not afraid.</p><p>Mr. Mickles, swatting the Taser prongs away, steps onto the platform and runs back toward the stairway. Officer Mays tries to head him off, his partner behind him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Mr. Delpeche, the man in the red shirt, is standing on the narrow platform next to a few other passengers. Mr. LaFauci is still on the train.</p><p><strong>3:07:12</strong></p><p>Mr. Mickles races at Officer Mays, who curses and backs up as his partner runs toward them.</p><p><strong>3:07:15</strong></p><p>Suddenly, Mr. Mickles stops near the open door of a car next to the one he was just in. He is facing Officer Wong several feet away. Officer Mays is farther down the platform. There are at least three people inside the car. One is Ms. Jahalal, on her way to her birthday dinner.</p><p>The officers have switched from Tasers to guns. They begin shooting.</p><p><strong>3:07:18</strong></p><p>Officer Wong fires six shots. Officer Mays fires three. Passengers scream and rush for safety. Mr. Mickles, clutching the knife, takes a couple of steps and crumples to the train floor.</p><p>“Put it down!” the officers yell. “Put it down! Put it down!”</p><p><strong>3:07:21</strong></p><p>“I’m shot!” Officer Mays shouts as he stands across the platform from Mr. Mickles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>In front of him, Mr. Mickles sits upright.</p><p>Both officers, guns drawn, continue to shout at him to put the knife down.</p><p><strong>3:07:28</strong></p><p>Officer Mays is yelling into his radio.</p><p>One of the bullets has hit him under the arm, and at least one is in Mr. Mickles’s abdomen. Another lodged in Ms. Jahalal’s left leg as she ran from the gunfire. Mr. Delpeche, who had moved as the police instructed, has been shot in the head.</p><p>It has been less than three minutes since Mr. Mickles slipped through the station gate.</p><h2 id="link-784ce397">‘A Violent Act’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mickles crumpled into a train car after the officers shot him. They fired a total of nine shots, and he was hit in the abdomen.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>A subway ride costs $2.90. But the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the system, estimates that at least 10 percent of riders do not pay.</p><p>The mayor and other officials, in a nod to the “broken windows” model of policing, argue that being tough on fare evasion has helped reduce crime in the subway. But it is difficult, if not impossible, to prove how many crimes are avoided.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>“Criminals don’t pay to ride, and stopping them at the gate makes us all safer,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/nyregion/mta-crichlow-subway-transit.html" title="">Demetrius Crichlow</a>, the head of New York City Transit, the authority division that runs the subway and buses, said in November after a fare evader was found with a loaded gun.</p><p>But the crackdown appears to mostly affect people of color, like Mr. Mickles: Of the roughly 2,800 people arrested on charges of fare evasion in last year’s third quarter, just 5 percent were white, according to Police Department data. Of the roughly 36,000 issued summonses for the offense, 16 percent were white.</p><p>“Cracking down on fare evasion has, to a large extent, amounted to cracking down in the highest-poverty station areas, which also tend to be in predominantly Black or Hispanic neighborhoods,” said Harold Stolper, a Columbia University economist.</p><p>The Sutter Avenue L station, which serves the mostly Black and Hispanic Brownsville neighborhood, had the second-highest rate of fare-evasion enforcement per ridership last year, according to Mr. Stolper’s research.</p><p>The mayor and police leaders insist that the Sutter Avenue shooting was not about fare enforcement but about a person who “had a clear mission to carry out a violent act,” as the mayor said at a news conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>Mr. Mickles had a history of substance abuse and a criminal record that included convictions for burglary and selling drugs. Since 2014, he has spent a total of a little more than a year in city jails spread across four short stints. There is no indication the officers knew any of that when they chose to follow him.</p><p>Some people, like Mr. Adams, saw in his history and demeanor that day — and his quick brandishing of a blade — a man who was out looking for trouble. Others, like Mr. LaFauci, have wondered whether he would have just gone on his way had he not been approached by the police.</p><h2 id="link-7f84fb5c">A Long Walk Home</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-35"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David LaFauci was on the subway on his way home from a trip when he got caught up in a confrontation between the police and a man the officers said had a knife.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Arredondo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>After the police officers stopped firing at Mr. Mickles, Mr. LaFauci looked over and saw Mr. Delpeche on the floor of the subway car, his legs extended out onto the platform as if he had fallen backward. He took a few steps toward him and saw a halo of blood pooled around his head. Mr. LaFauci grabbed his backpack and finally got off the train.</p><p>He saw people carrying someone who appeared to be unconscious down the platform.</p><p>He felt his antipathy toward the officers rising.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>“I’m not the most pro-police guy,” he acknowledged in an interview later.</p><p>In May 2020, Mr. LaFauci protested in Brooklyn after the police in Minnesota killed George Floyd. He later claimed in a lawsuit against the city that the officers had broken his hand with a baton before arresting him. The Brooklyn district attorney declined to prosecute, and the city settled with him for $115,000 without admitting wrongdoing.</p><p>This time, he had not been injured physically, but he was disoriented. Had it been 20 minutes since the gunshots rang out? More? He went down to the street, and an officer told him the block was being cleared, so he began the hour-plus walk home, even though friends he texted suggested he call an Uber. He flipped off police cruisers as they raced past him. Several times, he said, he broke down in tears.</p><h2 id="link-5a36fa5">‘A Long Road Ahead’</h2><p>John Chell, the Police Department’s chief of patrol at the time, called the shooting “a tragic situation.” Mr. Adams offered his sympathy, too. “No one wants to see innocent people get hurt,” he said.</p><p>But the mayor, a former police captain, also praised the officers for their “great level of restraint,” and he joined police leaders in saying that the shooting had been warranted because Mr. Mickles presented a risk to the officers and others. The police investigation is continuing.</p><p>As a result of his injuries from the shooting, Mr. Mickles had surgery to remove a large section of his small bowel and part of his stomach, as well as to repair 15 bullet holes in his arms, legs and abdominal wall, according to a city doctor’s report. He was charged with aggravated assault on a police officer, attempted assault, menacing a police officer, criminal possession of a weapon and theft of services. He has pleaded not guilty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>Officer Mays, who was struck near his armpit, returned to duty almost immediately.</p><p>Mr. Delpeche, who needed emergency brain surgery, has made significant strides in his recovery, but “as far as being normal, it’s a long road ahead,” said Leighton Lee, a friend. A guardian has been appointed for him because of his injuries, and a lawyer hired by relatives has filed court papers indicating plans to sue the city for $80 million.</p><p>“The fact that he’s alive is amazing,” said Nicholas Liakas, the lawyer.</p><p>As for Ms. Jahalal, the bullet in her leg will be there forever, according to a notice of claim she and her husband, Daniel Jahalal, filed saying that they plan to sue the city for $70 million.</p><p>The police had said Ms. Jahalal was “grazed” by a bullet. According to her notice of claim, her injury prevents her from walking normally and has kept her from working. She appeared in a production of “Romeo and Juliet” while attending a small Brooklyn high school and studied as an English major at Lehman College for several years.</p><p>Mr. LaFauci, too, has signaled his intention to sue the city. In his case, the claim is for emotional distress: He says he is now scared to ride the subway, although like any New Yorker, he does when he has to.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Ana Ley<!-- -->, <!-- -->Hurubie Meko<!-- --> and <!-- -->Wesley Parnell<!-- -->. <!-- -->Sheelagh McNeill<!-- --> and <!-- -->Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ed Shanahan is a rewrite reporter and editor covering breaking news and general assignments on the Metro desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ed-shanahan">More about Ed Shanahan</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
