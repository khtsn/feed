She dwells on the incident as she stares at empty tables once packed with immigrant families and construction workers.</p><p>Across the street, sales have plummeted at a Colombian bakery. The shop used to take in<strong> </strong>about $1,600 most mornings selling soups and pastries, but now makes about $900. Workers at the bakery scour WhatsApp groups for news of immigration raids in the neighborhood, even as the messaging app swirls with misinformation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And at the Guatemalan restaurant at the edge of the plaza, fewer customers are dining in, with sales declining by about half.

The showmanship was supported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/01/us/politics/ice-arrests-trump-immigration.html" title="">some early numbers</a> that showed an increase in immigration arrests, even as the authorities <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/21/ice-director-removed-caleb-vitello/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appear to be struggling</a> to round up enough people to meet Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/02/11/ice-enforcement-officials-reassigned/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mass deportation goals</a>. The shock-and-awe tactic, however, has profoundly rattled immigrant communities.</p><p>Few neighborhoods in New York were paralyzed like Corona, a working-class enclave that is about 75 percent Hispanic, home to generations of immigrants from Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and elsewhere.</p><p>But Corona was also one of the neighborhoods that swung most sharply<strong> </strong>toward Mr. Trump in last year’s election. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/trump-nyc-voters.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s inroads</a>, in Corona and elsewhere, exposed simmering<strong> </strong>tension between established immigrants and more recent arrivals who crossed the border during an era of more lenient Democratic policies.</p><p>Immigration, legal and otherwise, has long shaped this stretch of northern Queens. Waves of migration transformed Corona from an Italian stronghold at the turn of the 20th century into a magnet for African American families after World War II, and then a bustling hub for Central and South Americans in recent decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>That diversity has been most palpable in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/05/nyregion/corona-plaza-street-food-vendors.html" title="">Corona Plaza</a>, once a forlorn lot. The city paved it into a modest pedestrian plaza that quickly pulsated with life as vendors moved in<strong> </strong>to<strong> </strong>sell chorizos and cafe de olla, filling the air<strong> </strong>with a mix of Spanish dialects. Nearby, on Roosevelt Avenue, the aroma of Colombian coffee melded with the scent of lomo saltado from Peru, the blaring rhythms of cumbia and reggaeton and the roar of the elevated No. 7 train.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A campaign flag attests to President Trump’s popularity in Corona, where he received about 3,000 more votes in 2024 than in 2020.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Many residents here crowd into cheap apartments with strangers. Most work the service jobs that form<strong> </strong>the backbone of the city’s economy: cleaning, cooking, building.</p><p>Many are undocumented.</p><p>So it was perhaps no surprise that the once-bustling plaza, and the streets around it, cleared out the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. Immigrants stayed indoors. Food vendors <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2025/1/31/24355236/street-vendors-ice-raids-nyc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">retreated</a>. And many people continued to stay off the streets as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/nyregion/immigration-raids-nyc-ice.html" title="">fanned out across the city</a> a week later, an absence that <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/deportation-fears-play-out-in-queens-theres-an-economic-cost-to-that" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hurt</a> local businesses.</p><p>The combination of deportation fears, frigid temperatures and a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/nyregion/corona-plaza-food-vendors.html" title="">police crackdown</a> on illegal vending all helped mute the neighborhood — and created an eerily familiar scene in what was once <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york.html" title="">the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic</a>. The virus killed hundreds in Corona and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/nyregion/queens-ny-covid-recovery.html" title="">hobbled the area’s</a> economic recovery.</p><p>“It reminds me of Covid, but this is new,” said Fernando Cando, 48, who moved to Queens from Ecuador with his family in 1982, when he was a young boy. “If I were to sum it up with one word, it’s panic. We’ve never seen this.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Cando owns Leticias, an Ecuadorean restaurant with dishes based on his mother’s recipes. He<strong> </strong>said he recently began brushing up on his workers’ rights in case ICE shows up<strong> </strong>at the restaurant. He has instructed the workers not to run from agents, and has wondered whether they could take refuge in the restaurant’s basement. Despite the fear, his cooks and dishwashers continue to show up, even if diners aren’t always there with the same frequency.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fernando Cando owns the restaurant Leticias, where Ecuadorean food is on the menu and concern about the workers is in the air.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-17"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police respond in February to a disagreement near Park of the Americas, where residents and business owners say crime was an issue.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tortillas are made at Pollo El Campesino Corp, a small business on National Street near Corona Plaza.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>ICE sightings — whether real, imagined or distorted on social media and text threads — dominate conversations. Some parents have stopped sending their children to school.

The Bible says that. But the Bible does not say that an immigrant has a right to delinquency.”</p><p>Other immigrants, though<strong> </strong>uneasy about the high-profile crimes committed by some recent arrivals, were more wary of stoking rifts between recent immigrants and those who have been here longer.</p><p>“It’s not resentment,” said Faviana Linares, who migrated from Mexico nearly three decades ago. “You have to be very brave to leave everything behind and bring your family here.

She has made a living cleaning apartments, initially for well below the minimum wage, while her husband works at restaurants.
