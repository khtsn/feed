It was negative 8 degrees. “It didn’t feel chilly at all,” she joked.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>What Ms. Litchfield and the more than two dozen others sleeping in their vehicles that night really needed — the requirement for the right to sleep in the subzero cold in a landscape that looks like a snow globe — was a local pay stub.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/11re-snowcars-town-35385-cover/11re-snowcars-town-35385-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/11re-snowcars-town-35385-cover/11re-snowcars-town-35385-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/09/137359_1_11re-snowcars-town-35385_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A snowstorm envelops the parking lot in Frisco, Colo. where workers sleep.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As homelessness soars to the highest level on record, parking lots like this one have opened from coast to coast, offering a refuge to those who no longer have a house to sleep in, but still have a car.<span>  </span></p><p>But the backlash from neighbors has often been fierce, and to circumvent that, municipalities have imposed an ever greater number of rules on the parkers. The lot in the town of Frisco — a 30-minute commute to Vail, 14 minutes to Breckenridge and nine minutes to the powder of Copper Mountain, where the U.S. ski team trains — appears to be the only lot in the country that requires those who sleep there to prove that they are part of the local economy. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In the public imagination, homelessness looks like the man in soiled clothes sleeping on top of a subway grate or the woman peering out of a tent from under a highway overpass. But in cities and towns that have the highest concentrations of homelessness, many — and sometimes a majority — of those who do not live in shelters are in cars, not on the streets, according to the annual census known as the “point in time count.” </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In <a href="https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=8164-2024-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-results-long-version-.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Los Angeles County</a>, for example, two-thirds are living in vehicles. In <a href="https://www.smcgov.org/media/150519/download?inline=" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">San Mateo County</a>, which includes part of Silicon Valley, its even more — 71 percent. </p><p>“The American dream of owning a home is dead unless you make a gazillion dollars,” says Ms. Litchfield, sitting in the front seat of her van.</p><p>Her shift at the ski shop starts at 7:30 a.m. in a nearby strip mall. Customers are already queuing, hoping to hit the slopes of some of the most coveted runs in the world. The vacationers wait behind a cordon like in an airport line, then step onto a small platform towering over Ms. Litchfield who measures their feet and proposes a boot size.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11re-snowcars-KRISTINE-03-jqfg/11re-snowcars-KRISTINE-03-jqfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11re-snowcars-KRISTINE-03-jqfg/11re-snowcars-KRISTINE-03-jqfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11re-snowcars-KRISTINE-03-jqfg/11re-snowcars-KRISTINE-03-jqfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A smiling woman wearing a black shirt and pants is seen walking through the aisles of a ski shop.

According to Zillow, studios here rent for $2,500 a month — meaning that Ms. Litchfield would need to spend 87 percent of her income on rent, leaving too little to pay for her other needs. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A shop in the town of Frisco shows the distances to other locations in Colorado. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Homeownership is even further out of reach as the median sales price hovers near $1 million. </p><p>“We cannot afford to buy a home, and so people started to think, well, screw it,” she said. “Why should I put myself in that much debt just to live in a house? And so that’s how come people are here,” she said gesturing through the icy windshield at the snow-covered asphalt. “<em>This</em> is the American dream. Living in a van. Living in your car,” she said.</p><p>Affordable housing activists are being joined by employers in pushing for parking lots like the one where Ms. Litchfield lives. Local business owners struggle to hire and to retain workers in Summit County, where Frisco is and which was once ranked the <a href="https://www.kpcw.org/summit-county/2018-11-27/summit-county-named-sixth-wealthiest-county-in-the-u-s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sixth wealthiest county</a> in the United States. </p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-16"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/11re-snowcars-town-40399-cover/11re-snowcars-town-40399-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/11re-snowcars-town-40399-cover/11re-snowcars-town-40399-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/09/137343_1_11re-snowcars-town-40399_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The town of Frisco is a gateway to Colorado’s winter wonderland where vacationers spend as much as $1,000 a night to rent a condo.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Waitresses live three and four to an apartment, and at the ski resorts, J-1 visa holders, designed for guest workers from abroad, share bunk beds.</p><p>Andrew Aerenson, a former board member of the Frisco Town Council sees the parking lot as having created affordable housing at virtually no cost to the city: “We sit around and have constant conversations about work force housing,” says Mr. Aerenson, a retired lawyer and a ski instructor at Breckenridge, who estimates that it costs the town $150,000 in subsidies to build a single unit of affordable housing, a process that takes years even when the funds are available.</p><p>“This is a no-brainer for me,” he said of the parking lot where workers pay $75 a month to rent their spot, a fee that offsets costs including the portable restroom. “We want these people here.”</p><p>The lot here has been in existence for nearly six years, its location moving from a church to a marina to a library. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Though its model has been copied elsewhere, other communities have not been as welcoming, and similar programs have failed after pushback from homeowners. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The average home price in Colorado’s Summit County hovers near $1 million.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>After opposition by neighbors, two similar lots, one that opened in 2022 in a river-rafting town in Colorado, and the other that was scheduled to open in 2024 in a hiking destination<span>  </span>in Arizona, were closed. Both lots required proof of employment. </p><p>“Imagine talking to your grandma about this thing that you want to do, and every single little fear that pops into her brain, suddenly you have to address,” said Salty Riggs, who helped create the lot in the river rafting town of Salida, Colo. The location next to a park with room for 15<strong> </strong>vehicles was approved in 2022, and operated for two years before quietly closing, after the list of rules became so long and onerous that parkers began to feel unwelcome, she said.</p><p>In Sedona, after the City Council approved a zoning change in the spring of 2024 that would have allowed homeless workers to park in a public lot, enraged residents organized a referendum that shut it down a few months later, before anyone parked there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The windshield of Kristine Litchfield’s van serves as her living room window. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>To survive in Frisco, the organizers of the lot from a group called Unsheltered in Summit have treaded lightly and have tried to make sure the lot blends into the landscape. </p><p>Its discretion is outlined in a PowerPoint presentation that the organizers whip out when necessary for elected leaders or members of the local rotary club. The first few slides show a drug addict collapsed on the pavement and a derelict van with boarded up windows. A subsequent slide shows one of the neat and tidy lots in Frisco. One of the areas used also serves as a parking lot for the town’s utility vehicles, so a visitor happening across the lot would have a hard time distinguishing which cars are inhabited, and which are not.</p><p>To the side is a portable toilet. A new, brightly painted dumpster has a combination lock. Parkers are given the code only if they are approved. </p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-26"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Litchfield heads to the grocery for fresh produce...</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>.... and to a nearby recreation center to bathe.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Another slide makes the point that organizers most want to get across<span>  </span>—<span>  </span>the parking lot at midday is empty, because its residents are working. </p><p>Paul Minjares, the 41-year-old guitarist, is working on organizing an “open house” with members of the community. “Basically, to show that it’s not skid row,” he said.</p><p>He makes additional money by working as the intake coordinator, whose duties include managing the lot and vetting applicants.

A piece of Velcro across the ceiling of the van allows her to hang a curtain, trapping the heat in the back. “I heat the van up, and then I was telling you about the cloth that I put up? So, it’s right over your head, here. So that pulls down,” she said, explaining how she partitions the space. </p><p>She puts on her fuzzy socks and multiple layers of clothes. “Once I crawl up into my bunk, I close the curtains. So now you have all the hot air which rises in the back of the bunk with me in there and me with my sweats and my fuzzy blankets and a feather duvet and a fuzzy pillowcase and then if I get cold in the middle of night, let’s say I woke up, it’s three in the morning, and I’m like, ‘Damn, it’s really cold in here.’ I just get up, drop the cloth, turn it on. Heat it up,” she said, explaining her nightly ritual.</p><h2 id="link-85850e8">An Electric Blanket </h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-35"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/11re-snowcars-back-88071-cover/11re-snowcars-back-88071-cover-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/11re-snowcars-back-88071-cover/11re-snowcars-back-88071-cover-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/09/137367_1_11re-snowcars-back-88071_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Ms. Litchfield has outfitted her T250 van with a bunk bed.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Beside her, Mr. Minjares is getting ready for bed too.<span>  </span>An intricate contraption he has created using a hitch on the back of his RAV4 pumps hot air from a diesel heater, through a duct, into one of the windows of his car, cracked open just wide enough to let the duct through.
