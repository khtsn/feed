</p><p>Here in cars, trucks and vans, behind foggy windshields and zipped in sleeping bags, those who serve the vacationers who come to enjoy the snow tried to fall asleep on a recent night — two ski instructors, two snow plow drivers, a ski lift operator, an ice fishing guide, a dog sledding guide, the employee of a ski resort whose job includes scanning ski passes, two ER nurses who treat their injuries, a cashier at a drugstore, multiple servers at local restaurants, as well as Kristine Litchfield, who earns $24 an hour at a ski shop fitting people for their boots.</p><p>At 6 a.m., the 62-year-old woke up under multiple blankets in the bunk bed she built in the back of her Ford T250 van.
