That’s what you’re supposed to do — let go and absorb it and feel like you’re part of this thing.”</p><p>Such is the unique nature of the Swiss-American artist’s magnum opus, which premiered in London in 2010: The viewer cannot help but be implicated in it, and in some sense live it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The Clock” is a 24-hour film made up of thousands of clips from movies and television shows, each depicting the precise time of day that you are watching it. Many of the sources are famous, among them “The Godfather,” “The Simpsons” and, of course, “High Noon.” (So many that Marclay could not recall the sources of several stills made available.) Often the time is conveyed explicitly, via, say, a clock in the frame or dialogue in which a character is asked that most typical of questions, glances at his wristwatch and responds; occasionally the time is implicit, with the screen showing a woman tossing and turning during an evidently sleepless night.</p><hr/><h3 id="link-63d13c48"><span>Marclay on 3 moments from ‘The Clock’</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christian Marclay; via Paula Cooper Gallery and White Cube</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It’s that classic thing where the filmmaker wants you to know exactly what time it is, because something’s going to happen.

In classic memento mori paintings, 17th-century Dutch painting, you might have a candle. Fire is a good measuring-time device. There’s a lot of smoking in ‘The Clock,’ because it is also a durational thing.”</p><hr/><p>In addition to being itself a clock, “The Clock” is a cultural digest of our days and ways, depicting how humanity has spent — or imagined it has spent — each hour over the roughly hundred years of cinema preceding its composition. “Between four and five o’clock transport is significant: trains, cars, and airplanes,” the novelist Zadie Smith <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/04/28/killing-orson-welles-midnight/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a review in 2011. “If the phone rings after one in the morning do not expect good news. Cuckoo clocks, no matter when they chime, are almost always ominous. When Orson Welles says what time it is, it lends the hour an epic sound. At two AM everyone’s lonely.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The run of “The Clock” that commenced last week at the <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5746?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=gen_theclock&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA3Na5BhAZEiwAzrfagEKU8zixLRdJJikoj43Z4IwIc-wfAOok6umXiIpCi5v40ZTCLIndSRoCRS0QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Museum of Modern Art</a> and ends Feb. 17, 2025, marks the work’s return to the United States for the first time since 2016 and for the first time to New York in nearly a dozen years..</p><p>The last several years have made us, and therefore “The Clock,” fundamentally different, said Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA.</p><p>“Because this is literally a clock made of fragments from our cultural memory,” Comer said, “it is bound to take twists and turns each time it’s shown, as time goes on.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>When “The Clock” last showed in New York, Comer added, pandemics were a distant and obscure fear. “We all talk about people’s inability to finish a novel, or how memory and our sense of time in general has shifted,” he said. “It just felt like an interesting moment to revisit this work.”</p><p>Certainly Marclay, who turns 70 in January, has experienced “The Clock,” and the clock, differently depending on the season of his life. Though born in California, he spent his childhood in Geneva, the international watchmaking capital. He recalled inhabiting summers “that just seemed endless, with no notion of what was happening in the rest of the world.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“The Clock,” a cultural digest, contains movie and TV clips of roughly a hundred years of cinema. “It was really pre-iPhone madness,” Marclay said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">George Etheredge for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>With a background in music, Marclay began making ingeniously-edited films that were montages of pre-existing ones, such as “Telephones” (1995), a seven-minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fCXtxDhv4k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">movie</a> comprising black-and-white and color clips that depict various stages of telephone calls, and “Video Quartet” (2002), a piece of four simultaneously played movies whose sounds are synchronized — a work he saw older audiences struggle with, acknowledging, “it was just too much information for them.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For two years in the late 2000s, up to six assistants sourced appropriate clips for him — “the catch of the day,” as he put it — by raiding the DVD sections at rental shops in London, where Marclay still lives. He painstakingly edited them into the finished work.</p><p>One result is that “The Clock” is a time capsule not only of decades of cinema, but of the specific time of its making.</p><p>“In ‘The Clock’ there are a few flip phones, but that’s about it,” Marclay said. “It was really pre-iPhone madness. But when we started showing it, people were comparing it to their phone, introducing that element of real time in the cinema.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In 2010, YouTube and social media had not assumed the saturation they achieved in the following years. Marclay is not on social media, but understands that those who are — which is to say, most people — might view the work differently.</p><p>“The kids who were maybe 10 years old when they saw ‘The Clock’ with their parents are now 20, and they’ve been using social media for a decade,” he said. “How are they going to relate to it? It’s hard for me to answer, but that fragmentation is something that people are now quite familiar with.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>In many ways, “The Clock” will be presented the same way at MoMA as it was at Paula Cooper Gallery and Lincoln Center more than a decade ago. Marclay insists on sofas (often IKEA models are used) that permit filmgoers to arrive and depart when they would like. “In the cinema,” he said, “we all go in at the same time and we all leave at the same time. Here it’s a different choreography: you make the choices.” He has pushed the museum to open “The Clock,” which is digital and runs on a software that automatically syncs to the time of day, beyond typical museum hours.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“In the cinema, we all go in at the same time and we all leave at the same time.

I was thinking how so many of these actors who were alive when I made it are no longer alive, and eventually everybody in those films won’t be around.”</p><p>He added, “‘The Clock’ is a sad piece, in a way. It is a piece that confronts you with your mortality. I did it in my late 50s. I don’t think I would have made a piece like that in my 20s — that wasn’t a concern of mine.”</p><p><strong>The Clock</strong></p><p>Through Feb. 17, 2025, Museum of Modern Art, 11 W 53rd Street, 212-708-9400; moma.org. “The Clock” will run during public hours with two special longer screenings planned, for Dec. 21 and Dec. 31.
