    <h1>Sept. 11 Plea Deal Includes Lifetime Gag Order on C.I.A. Torture Secrets</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>But the agency has protected the names of other people who worked in the “black site” prisons, notably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/politics/cia-black-site-doctors.html" title="">medical staff,</a> guards and other intelligence agency employees. That includes the people who questioned Mr. Mohammed hundreds of times as he was shuttled between prisons in Afghanistan, Poland and other locations, which the C.I.A. has not acknowledged as former black sites.</p><p>Now, a recently unredacted paragraph in Mr. Mohammed’s 20-page settlement says he agreed not to disclose “any form, in any manner, or by any means” information about his “capture, detention, confinement of himself or others” while in U.S. custody.</p><p>He signed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/sept-11-guilty-plea.html" title="">agreement on July 31</a>, after more than two years of negotiations between his lawyers and prosecutors, who are responsible for protecting national security secrets. Two military courts have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/us/politics/911-case-plea-deals.html" title="">ruled that Mr. Austin acted too late when</a> he tried to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/911-plotters-plea-deal.html" title="">withdraw from the settlement</a> on Aug. 2, two days after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/susan-escallier-sept-11-plea-deal.html" title="">retired Army general</a> he put in charge of the case had signed it.</p><p>The settlement and similar agreements with two of Mr. Mohammed’s co-defendants, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/guantanamo-bay-detainees.html#detainee-10014" title="">Walid bin Attash</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/guantanamo-bay-detainees.html#detainee-10011" title="">Mustafa al-Hawsawi</a>, are still mostly under seal while defense lawyers seek to enforce the agreement and hold a sentencing hearing at Guantánamo Bay.</p><p>Secrecy surrounding the black site program <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/us/politics/9-11-defendants-trial.html" title="">has been one reason for long delays</a> in starting the trial. Mr. Mohammed was first charged in this case in 2012. Defense lawyers have spent years litigating for government versions of what happened to Mr. Mohammed and the other four defendants in the case, forcing prosecutors to frequently seek permission from the military judges to withhold or redact certain evidence in the case.</p></div></div>
