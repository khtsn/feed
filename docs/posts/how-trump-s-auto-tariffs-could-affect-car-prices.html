Affected models include the Toyota Tacoma pickup, gasoline and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox, and several models of Ram pickups. Ram is owned by Stellantis, which also produces Dodge, Chrysler and Fiat vehicles.</p><p>In addition to Canada and Mexico, the United States imports <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/04/business/economy/car-tariffs.html" title="">many cars from Japan and South Korea</a>. Smaller numbers come from European countries, including Germany, Italy, Sweden and Britain.</p><p>Higher prices will deter buyers and force automakers to curtail production, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. He forecast that U.S. factories would produce 20,000 fewer cars per week, about 30 percent less than usual.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“By mid-April we expect disruption to virtually all North American vehicle production,” Mr. Smoke said on Wednesday during a conference call with clients and reporters. “Bottom line: Lower production, tighter supply and higher prices are around the corner.”</p><p>In addition to the impact on car buyers, tariffs could hurt Americans who are employed in factories and car dealerships.</p><p>About one million people in the United States are employed in auto and parts manufacturing, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Two million more work at dealerships that sell cars or parts. If automakers are forced to significantly reduce production, they are likely to furlough workers at factories, and dealers would have to cut jobs if higher prices hurt sales.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Ewing writes about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-ewing">More about Jack Ewing</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/toyota-motor-corporation">Toyota Motor Corporation</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>India’s Hiring Binge: </strong>Higher U.S. tariffs meant to force India to lower its trade barriers, and the deportations of immigrants from the U.S., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/india-jobs-global-capability-center.html">will not slow the evolution of the partnership</a> between American companies looking for skilled workers overseas and India’s abundant pool of labor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hyundai Looks to Avoid Tariffs:</strong> Hyundai Motor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/business/hyundai-us-investment-tariffs.html">will invest $21 billion to expand manufacturing</a> in the United States in what President Trump said was proof that his tariff policies were creating jobs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Venezuelan Oil:</strong> President Trump threatened tariffs against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/trump-threatens-tariffs-against-countries-that-buy-venezuelan-oil.html">countries that bought oil from Venezuela</a>, claiming that the South American country “purposefully and deceitfully” sent criminals and murderers into America.</p></li><li><p><strong>Potatoes, Shrimp and Teslas:</strong> Makers of a vast array of American products submitted letters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/business/economy/trump-tariffs-us-exporters.html">highlighting the unfair trade treatment they faced</a> in hopes of bending the president’s agenda in their favor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Canada’s Small Businesses:</strong> A rice mill in Ontario is among many small businesses being hit by President Trump’s tariffs and also by Canada’s retaliatory levies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/world/canada/trump-tariffs-canada-small-businesses.html">putting their futures in doubt</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Boycotting U.S. Goods:</strong> A growing number of Europeans and citizens of other countries are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/europe/europe-boycott-american-products-trump.html">choosing not to buy American products</a> to demonstrate their anger at Trump’s policies.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
