Mayor Brandon Johnson is the latest leader to attempt to close Chicago’s gaping fiscal gap: He proposed a $300 million property tax increase to partly fill Chicago’s $982 million <a href="https://civicfed.org/blog/chicagos-fy2025-proposed-budget-exacerbates-structural-imbalance#:~:text=Chicago&#39;s%20FY2025%20Proposed%20Budget%20Exacerbates%20Structural%20Imbalance,-November%2013%2C%202024&amp;text=On%20October%2030%2C%20Chicago%20Mayor,in%20last%20year&#39;s%20budget%20forecast." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">projected</a> budget deficit, only to be unanimously <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2024/11/17/mayor-brandon-johnson-brokers-deal-to-cut-property-tax-hike-budget-city-hall-council" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rejected</a> by the City Council. The City Council narrowly passed a budget on Dec. 16, with far less in tax increases than the mayor had initially demanded.</p><p>The Windy City’s woes are the product of decades of fiscal profligacy and a cautionary tale to policymakers in every region and at every level of government: Retirement benefits are like free junk food to politicians — everyone loves them, and the bills don’t arrive until later. They can be ruinous for a city’s long-term fiscal health.</p><p>At the heart of Chicago’s deficit are decades of increasingly generous retirement benefits offered by Chicago’s leaders to more than <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dol/supp_info/labor.html#:~:text=The%20City%20of%20Chicago%20serves,of%20labor%20and%20employment%20law" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30,000 public employees</a>, a politically powerful constituency. Today, a city employee retiring after 35 years with a final salary of $75,000 would receive combined pension and retiree health benefits of about $77,000.</p><p>The City government has failed to fund those pension promises fully and the bill has come due. Retirement benefits and debt service together made up <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/220926-recent-pension-funding-gains-for-largest-u-s-cities-expected-to-be-short-lived-12501400" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">43 percent</a> of Chicago’s budget in 2022, the highest rate of any U.S. city. Chicago spends more on debt and pensions than it does on the police and infrastructure, according to an <a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/4-9b-in-pension-debt-costs-squeeze-essentials-from-chicago-2024-budget/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis from the Illinois Policy Institute</a>, a libertarian-leaning policy group. In other words, Chicago is paying for the past, not investing for the future.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Chicago’s pension actuary <a href="https://www.meabf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Actuarial-Valuation-2023-complete.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> in a letter to the plan’s leadership last year that “the Fund is still at risk of potential insolvency if an economic recession or investment market downturn were to occur in the near term.” (He wrote it in boldface to get policymakers to take notice.)</p><p>Chicago owes bondholders almost $29 billion. It also faces $35 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and almost $2 billion in unfunded retiree health benefits. And these figures do not include an additional $14 billion in unfunded benefits owed to Chicago’s teachers. The watchdog group Truth in Accounting <a href="https://www.truthinaccounting.org/news/detail/financial-state-of-the-cities-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gives</a> Chicago a grade of “F” for fiscal responsibility, ranking it 74 out of 75 cities. (New York City is last.)</p><p>City leaders may continue to ignore these warnings. If the pension fund does get close to insolvency, Chicago can most likely keep the pension checks flowing by suspending payments to bondholders. Illinois has no legal provision for Chicago to declare bankruptcy, meaning the state would be forced to rush legislation into place to prevent financial chaos.</p><p>Judging by the experience of places such as Detroit and Puerto Rico, where I serve on a federally appointed board overseeing the island government’s bankruptcy, pensions would largely be protected in the event of fiscal chaos, followed by core government operations. Nonessential government services would be reduced, and bondholders would receive what remains.</p><p>Even if Chicago can contain the political fallout locally, the economic impact would reach far beyond the city limits. Chicago is the largest city in the Midwest and the third largest nationwide. The state of Illinois, which faces vast debts of its own, is not in a position to bail out its largest city, so Congress or the Federal Reserve might have to step in to help.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Policymakers in other big American cities ought to be paying attention. Truth in Accounting gave San Francisco a fiscal grade of D, while New York’s largest-in-the-nation debt burden of $61,800 per taxpayer caused it to share a failing grade with Chicago. New York and San Francisco each already devote more than 22 percent of their total budgets to retirement benefits and debt.</p><p>One reason it’s easy to allow pension-fueled deficits to keep growing is that there are very few guardrails. State and local government pensions are unregulated by the federal government, so they operate with much lower funding standards than federal government pensions or those offered by private companies.</p><p>Like private pensions, state and local governments should be required to assume conservative returns on pension investments and to address unfunded liabilities quickly, rather than letting funding shortfalls fester over decades.</p><p>If, as in Chicago, decades of fiscal recklessness are allowed to go unchecked, changing course can be extremely painful. Chicago has increased its pension contributions significantly. But the city must pay for its $927 million in additional pension contributions by reducing other essential government functions.</p><p>The consequence is a lower level of public services for everyone. With the city police force down by over 1,600 officers since 2018, the city’s inspector general found that <a href="https://wgntv.com/news/wgn-investigates/wgn-investigates-chicago-police-officer-detective-manpower/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">49 percent of 911 calls appear to go unanswered</a>. Chicago is already seeing the effects of this deterioration. Companies such as Boeing, United Airlines, Tyson Foods and the hedge fund Citadel have all moved operations away from Chicago in recent years, <a href="https://www.openhausrealty.com/blog/the-great-corporate-exodus-why-major-companies-are-leaving-chicago/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">citing</a> the business environment, public safety and governance quality among their reasons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>These departures were one reason the city’s population fell by more than <a href="https://www.neilsberg.com/insights/chicago-il-population-by-year/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">200,000 residents</a> over the past two decades, leaving it at the <a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/chicago-population-hits-lowest-point-since-1920/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lowest level since 1920</a>, shrinking the city’s tax base. They also altered the city’s political dynamics, as the businesses and individuals that left were precisely those that might have pushed for change. In 2023, Chicago elected as mayor Mr. Johnson, a progressive county commissioner with strong ties to the city’s teacher unions. While he has worked to close the budget deficit, his political base expects him to be a protector of the status quo rather than a reformer.</p><p>There may be no way for Mr. Johnson to get Chicago out of its fiscal mess without political and economic pain. But he, and the rest of America’s big city mayors, have an obligation to try.</p><p>Andrew G Biggs is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Since 2016, he has served as a presidentially appointed member of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, which has overseen the Puerto Rico government’s bankruptcy.</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
