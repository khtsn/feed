They are not based on real people but are instead amalgams of contrasting blocs within the church, traditionalist and progressive, that loosely define existing currents. “It’s all politics in the end,” said Robert Harris, who wrote the 2016 novel on which Peter Straughan based his screenplay.</p><p>“Conclave” is hardly the first film to involve a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls066346269/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">papal election</a>, and church-based mystery-thrillers, like Dan Brown’s “Angels &amp; Demons” or Raymond Khoury’s “The Last Templar,” have regularly made best-seller lists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fiennes and Stanley Tucci as members of a progressive bloc in the Roman Catholic Church.

They set out the basics about what to do when a pope dies (the process of destroying his ring and sealing his room) as well as the election itself (the need to sweep the Sistine Chapel for electronic listening devices, the Latin oaths the cardinals swear before and during voting, the tradition of threading the paper ballots after they have been counted so they can be preserved) and so on, details rigorously reflected in the film.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The production team also took painstaking care when it came to recreating the Sistine Chapel and the more mundane Domus Sanctae Marthae, the Vatican guesthouse built to house cardinals during conclaves. It’s where Pope Francis currently lives.</p><p>Harris said he did have Francis in mind when defining the personality of the pope who dies in the book, adding that he began his research when Francis was elected in 2013.</p><p><strong>“</strong>I thought he was an interesting figure to take and to look at the risks and rivalries and problems that were under the surface,” Harris said. “And<em> </em>I liked the idea of that sort of political tension under the surface.”</p><p>The production designer Suzie Davies said she approached the film “more like a ’70s thriller than a religious film,” blending tradition, history and real-life mundanity like “cardinals on cellphones or vaping or going through security machines” often set against the architecture of 20th-century Rome.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brian F.

Were one to put the film’s cardinals’ robes alongside a real one, “you would tell the difference,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-13"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>4:18</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>‘Conclave’ | Anatomy of a Scene</h2><h4>The director Edward Berger narrates a sequence from his film, featuring Ralph Fiennes.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Hi, My name is Edward Berger and I’m the director of the movie “Conclave.” So we’re about 30 minutes into the movie. We’ve set up the place as the Vatican and the Pope has died. And now Cardinal Lawrence, the character played by Ralph Fiennes, is the Dean of the College of Cardinals, meaning he has to organize the coming election of the new pope. And now it’s his big day because it’s the first day of the conclave, meaning all the doors are being shut. The cardinals are going away into the Sistine Chapel to vote for this next pope. And Ralph Fiennes gives the introductory speech, a homily. And we chose this piece of music at the very beginning. It’s actually the only music that isn’t composed. Everything else is composed in the movie. So it’s the only kind of source music sung by a choir. And it is the only piece of music that is played in the Sistine Chapel for hundreds of years. And I found this fact on a 6:00 AM morning tour. We went to the Sistine Chapel on a guided tour with and it was empty. It’s the only time that it’s empty. If you go at 6:00 AM and the guide told us that this was the piece of music. So I looked it up and found it and found it immensely moving and beautiful. So I decided to put it into the movie. So Ralph starts out the speech in Italian, and Ralph spent a long time practicing Italian, and he was actually very, very adamant. We always had a dialogue coach or someone like an Italian woman there who listened to his diction and everything. She was very satisfied of how he performed it because also he was super meticulous that it felt believable that he’s lived there for 25 years and has practiced Italian for 25 years. So we paid a lot of attention to that. But then at some point, something comes over him, a feeling. And he stops. And then he switches into his natural language, which is English. “But you know all that.” “Let me speak from the heart for a moment.” And delivers a speech about really his true feelings, and that is doubt. He expresses his doubt about his own faith, about his own purpose in the church, about the Church in general, about what he thinks the next pope should be like, someone who accepts doubt and gives in to doubt. And that intuitive speech, that giving into it raises a lot of eyebrows. In this scene, you will notice, we’re usually fairly wide on Ralph in the beginning when he speaks Italian. We’re from behind. We’re from a profile. And then as soon as he speaks from the heart, as soon as his speech changes, we go in for a close up, a very frontal central close up, and the camera starts moving. And then it’s actually just one shot. “Certainty is the great enemy of unity.” “Certainty is the deadly enemy of tolerance.” It’s just one shot, uninterrupted small push in on Ralph as he speaks and he loses himself within his words and he doesn’t notice anyone around him. And only then, once he’s finished. We cut to the reverse of a wide shot of all the cardinals listening. “If there was only certainty and no doubt, there would be no mystery and therefore no need for faith.” “Let us pray that God will grant us a pope who doubts.” The scene sets Ralph Fiennes up as a character to be reckoned with. He delivers the speech that comes from his heart and other Cardinals, especially the ones with ambition to become the next pope, suddenly fear that there’s a new contender in the room. And that is the climax of the scene.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/multimedia/conclave-anatomy1-pmct/conclave-anatomy1-pmct-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The director Edward Berger narrates a sequence from his film, featuring Ralph Fiennes.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Philippe Antonello/Focus Features</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit expert on the church’s inner workings, gave the film a B-plus for “accuracy in terms of the procedures of a conclave,” quibbling only about minor details, like the misuse of some terms and the layout of the tables in the Sistine Chapel that he said “wasn’t quite accurate.”</p><p>Another minor detail: In the movie, the carpet laid on the Sistine Chapel floor is red, not beige, a deliberate choice “to heighten that whole sequence and again to bring that red-on-red of those beautiful costumes,” Davies said.</p><p>Berger, whose credits include the Oscar-winning “All Quiet on the Western Front,” described “Conclave” as a “chess game of political intrigue” that could have taken place at a multinational company or in Washington. A top job is open, and people are vying for it. “It just happens to be within the Vatican,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sergio Castellitto, second from left, plays one of the contenders in the election, which is in real life a mystery to outsiders.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Focus Features </span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>So far, the film has played the festival circuit, so it’s unclear how Vatican watchers, not to mention clerics themselves, will react to Berger’s interpretation of “an event surrounded by legend, one that uniquely blends theater with mystery, politics with prayer,” as John Allen described it in his book “Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election.”</p><p>Early ecclesiastical reviews have been mixed. Father Reese saw the film last month in New York and found it highly imaginative, if improbable. “It’s got everything an Italian opera would have,” he said in telephone interview from Rome, laughing.</p><p>Some Catholic outlets were more critical, calling the plot twists “half-baked” or accusing the film of being “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOY1LR46VOI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a mockery of our faith.”</a> But real life often outdoes art, and there has been no shortage of scandals in the Vatican’s long history, even before clerical sexual abuse became public.</p><p>While he was working on the screenplay, Straughan said, he met with a “friendly cardinal,” who was open about conclave logistics but tight-lipped when it came to the wheeling and dealing that the film depicts. “This is the most secretive election in the world, it’s quite hard to get the inside scoop,” he said. He took a private tour of the Vatican, and “I didn’t feel like there was hostility,” he said, pointing out that Harris’s novel had already been published. “They were quite open and that was very useful,” he added.</p><p>Berger spoke with several cardinals for the film and said “they told me, ‘We’re all going to watch the movie.’” He added, “They’re not necessarily going to comment on it, but they’re going to be interested in how their world is portrayed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Harris himself turned to the former archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, as a consultant for his book, he said. When it was published, he recalled, the prelate wrote him “a very nice letter saying it was just like a conclave and that the research was very good.” (The cardinal died in 2017.) As for the plot, the cardinal noted that “it was only a novel,” Harris recalled.</p><p>For Berger, verisimilitude is not the bottom line.</p><p>“In the end, not everything is known, but that gives you license to interpret and invent, and that’s what I always love in filmmaking,” Berger said. “It’s not necessarily the truth, but it resembles your interpretation of the truth, and ideally I can take you on that journey and have you be engaged,” Berger said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
