</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>It’s unusual for shifts in political ideology to be so pronounced, political scientists say. Young women are much more liberal than women 30 and up, according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/649826/exploring-young-women-leftward-expansion.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the analysis by the pollster Gallup</a>, which analyzed the answers to 54 questions about political beliefs that it has asked over time.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Young women have become more liberal whether or not they went to college, and whether they are white or Black.</p><p>Their move to the left is driving the large gender gap among voters this age. Sixty-seven percent of women 18 to 29 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/upshot/harris-polling-young-women.html" title="">supported Vice President Kamala Harris</a> in a New York Times/Siena College poll in six swing states last month, compared with 40 percent of young men.</p><p>Fifty-three percent of young men in those states <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/upshot/trump-polls-young-men.html" title="">backed Donald J. Trump</a>, compared with 29 percent of young women.</p><p>It’s hard to say definitively what changed for young women in the last eight years, researchers said. But the rise in liberal identification suggests that for a generation of women who were raised being told they could do anything, the triple punch of Hillary Clinton’s loss to Mr. Trump, the #MeToo movement and the overturning of Roe v. Wade forcefully shaped their political views.</p><p>These are women who grew up in a period with a focus on cultivating girls’ self-esteem, civic engagement and involvement in previously male arenas, said Melissa Deckman, a political scientist who is chief executive of P.R.R.I., a research firm, and author of “The Politics of Gen Z,” <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-politics-of-gen-z/9780231560085" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published this month</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Events since 2016 gave a contradictory message, she said: “Sexism isn’t a thing of the past.” That moved young women to become more politically active.</p><p>“The end result of all this is by the time these girls become voters, they have more confidence — ‘internal political efficacy’ is the term political scientists would use,” she said. “Basically, they believe in their ability to make change.”</p><p>In general, young people are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388988/political-ideology-steady-conservatives-moderates-tie.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more liberal</a> than older people, but also <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout#GGBG" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">less likely to vote</a>. Yet Generation Z women are highly politically engaged, data shows, and more of them are voting than men their age. Political events when voters are around age 18 are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/upshot/trump-era-molding-young-voters.html" title="">powerful in shaping</a> their lifelong views, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/08/upshot/how-the-year-you-were-born-influences-your-politics.html" title="">research shows</a>.</p><p>Together, these patterns suggest that today’s young women could be a longtime Democratic force, and a challenge for the Republican Party.</p><h3 id="link-d14676a"><span>The gender bomb of the 2016 election</span></h3><p>In interviews, young liberal women said that the 2016 election was a turning point. Many said that in the Democratic primary, Senator Bernie Sanders had helped mold their liberal views. As the race became in part a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/upshot/it-really-does-get-into-your-head-the-election-through-the-eyes-of-teenage-girls.html" title="">referendum on gender</a> — Mrs. Clinton running to be the first female president, Mr. Trump calling her a “nasty woman” and bragging about sexual assault on the “Access Hollywood” tape — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/21/upshot/high-school-girls-politics.html" title="">those views deepened</a>, they said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Danielle Stephenson, 25, said Mr. Obama’s election felt like a “moment of real hope” for a Black girl growing up in Birmingham, Ala. So did Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy her freshman year of college — and her loss felt painful.</p><p>“It was the most disillusioning thing to have that experience, not just as a woman in America, but as a girl becoming a woman,” said Ms. Stephenson, now a graduate student in Oakland, Calif.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/15/multimedia/15up-young-women-1-ktqj/15up-young-women-1-ktqj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/15/multimedia/15up-young-women-1-ktqj/15up-young-women-1-ktqj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/15/multimedia/15up-young-women-1-ktqj/15up-young-women-1-ktqj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A woman standing on an apartment balcony." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/15/multimedia/15up-young-women-1-ktqj/15up-young-women-1-ktqj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/15/multimedia/15up-young-women-1-ktqj/15up-young-women-1-ktqj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/15/multimedia/15up-young-women-1-ktqj/15up-young-women-1-ktqj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 768w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/15/multimedia/15up-young-women-1-ktqj/15up-young-women-1-ktqj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1536w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="800"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Danielle Stephenson, 25, at her apartment in Oakland, Calif.
