    <h1>Three Child-Free Women Swap Mothers for a Day</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>I’m a woman who has never wanted children. For years, the person who had the hardest time accepting that was my mother. Since two of my closest friends also chose a child-free life, I came up with a small experiment: We swapped moms. Each of us sat down for an open conversation not with our own mother but with another’s.</p><p>In a world where the right of women to make decisions about their bodies and life choices is still questioned, where child-free women are often seen as broken or selfish, I made this film to put that experience onscreen. Filmed in Israel in 2023, it captures a deeply personal and ongoing conversation. Maybe it will help us all be better understood.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
