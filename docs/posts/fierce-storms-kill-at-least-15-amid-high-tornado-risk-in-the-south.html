The Gulf Coast states and Georgia face a high risk level of four on Saturday.</p><p>Storms at this highest level of alert can often produce intense long-track tornadoes, meaning they stay on the ground for a very long time. A slow storm will typically only affect one or two communities, but a faster-moving storm such as this one can cross multiple states, leaving a long trail of damage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="14wea-severe-sat" data-id="100000010053495" data-source-id="100000010053495"><div slug="14wea-severe-sat" data-sourceid="100000010053495" id="embed-id-100000010053495">
