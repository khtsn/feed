Mr. Trump was scheduled to also be there late Thursday — Mr. Milei said Mr. Trump would receive an award, too — and Mr. Milei said he hoped the two would meet.</p><p>It was Mr. Milei’s 10th trip to the United States in 15 months as president, and nearly every time, he has met Mr. Trump or Elon Musk.</p><p>Mr. Trump has posited that he is reshuffling U.S. foreign policy strictly around what is good for the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>So what can be puzzling about his elevation of Argentina to the front row of America’s allies — Mr. Milei and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy were the only world leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration-attendees.html" title="">onstage at Mr. Trump’s inauguration</a> — is that the chronically distressed South American nation is not particularly important as an economic or geopolitical partner.</p><p>Instead, through Mr. Milei, Argentina has offered Mr. Trump something else he appears to crave: adoration.</p><p>“I love him because he loves Trump,” Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/n0p-8PGG_4kotGvM6TBfXLZk3hxOaRWAvnReqfsK860DvxI3PSBTgTE28XcEOFgaH937h2hweUuA8kJfFLZixcBGuus?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=2445.36" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said of Mr. Milei</a> in a speech last year. “Anybody that loves me, I like them.”</p><p>Mr. Milei has repeatedly and publicly lauded Mr. Trump. He has posted doctored images of them embracing. He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-cpac-chainsaw.html" title="">gifted Mr. Musk a custom chain saw</a>. And when Mr. Milei became the first world leader to visit Mr. Trump after the U.S. election, he danced around Mar-a-Lago and told the crowd, “Today the world is a much better place.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Carlos Kikuchi, a conservative talk radio host in Argentina who helped run Mr. Milei’s campaign, said that, to the Argentine leader, “having such a smooth relationship with Trump and Musk is like touching heaven.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Milei at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Milei has translated his devotion into policy. Weeks after Mr. Trump said he would pull the United States from the World Health Organization, Mr. Milei <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/americas/argentina-who-withdrawal-trump.html" title="">did the same</a> with Argentina.</p><p>After Mr. Trump exited the Paris Climate Agreement, Mr. Milei’s government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/world/americas/argentina-exit-climate-deal.html" title="">said it was looking into doing so, too</a>. Mr. Milei fired his first foreign minister because she voted at the United Nations — as Argentina always had — against the U.S. embargo on Cuba.</p><p>And after Mr. Trump began criticizing Ukraine — a nation Mr. Milei had steadfastly supported for years — Argentina abstained from a U.N. vote to condemn Russia for its invasion.</p><p>Mr. Milei has also become one of the loudest voices in the culture wars, going on a global speaking tour of sorts to attack leftists, feminists and transgender people, and to laud Mr. Trump as the champion who will, in Mr. Milei’s telling, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZr-aK01Vfc?si=XPbr7inMVharQcHu&amp;t=30" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">save the West from “woke ideology.”</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Every time we meet with President Trump, he always says, ‘I like this guy,’” Gerardo Werthein, Argentina’s new foreign minister, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFk7OfLHEJ0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said this week</a>. “He always says, ‘He is MAGA like me: Make Argentina Great Again.’”</p><p>Mr. Trump has praised Mr. Milei’s work in stabilizing Argentina’s economy. Indeed, Mr. Milei <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/americas/argentina-president-milei-inflation-economy.html" title="">has succeeded in lowering inflation</a>, increasing growth and balancing the budget.</p><p>Yet, for the United States, Argentina remains an awkward fit as a strategic partner. The nation of 46 million is geographically separated from much of the world and has been stuck for decades in cycles of economic crisis.</p><p>The two countries also sell many of the same things: corn, wheat, soybeans, meat, oil. Trade between them fell 8.6 percent to $16.3 billion last year. Argentina ranks 36th globally in buying American exports, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a research group.</p><p>On Wednesday, Argentina, was still hit with the 10 percent minimum levy applied to nearly every country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But Mr. Milei, who describes himself as a radical libertarian, found a bright side. “Friends will be friends,” <a href="https://x.com/JMilei/status/1907561598861852944" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote on social media</a>, linking to the Queen song and then sharing posts arguing that Argentina had gained an advantage over countries hit with higher tariffs.</p><p>Arguably the biggest potential prize for the United States is Argentina’s large stockpiles of strategic minerals, including lithium, a necessary component of renewable batteries. American and Chinese companies are major players in Argentina’s expanding lithium mines, and Tesla — run by Mr. Musk — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/technology/elon-musk-world-leaders.html" title="">buys Argentine lithium</a> for its electric-car batteries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Evaporation pools for lithium extraction in the province of Jujuy, Argentina.

Argentine officials have said they expect to have Mr. Trump’s support.</p><p>Lucía Cholakian Herrera<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Nicas is the Brazil bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of much of South America.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-nicas">More about Jack Nicas</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Antitrust Suit Against Meta:</strong> Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/technology/mark-zuckerberg-trump-meta-antitrust.html">lobbied President Trump and his aides to resolve a federal antitrust lawsuit</a> that is set to go to trial, three people with knowledge of the matter said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Another Law Firm Reaches Agreement:</strong> Milbank, based in Manhattan, has reached an agreement with the Trump administration over the kind of free legal services its lawyers can provide to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/trump-law-firms-milbank-deal.html">head off an executive order that could impair its business</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>C.D.C.:</strong> Alongside extensive reductions to the staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/health/cdc-tump-health.html">asked the agency to cut $2.9 billion of its spending on contracts</a>, according to three federal officials with knowledge of the matter.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.D.A.
