Israel, the second time in two months that the Iranian-backed group has successfully penetrated the skies over the central part of the country.</p><p>The assault was the latest illustration of the evolving conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iranian proxies, which have mounted attacks on Israeli territory in what they have said is solidarity with Palestinians under bombardment in Gaza. It also demonstrated the military capabilities of the Houthis, based hundreds of miles from Israel on the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula.</p><p>Air-raid sirens blared in dozens of towns and villages in central Israel around 6:30 a.m. on Sunday, sending people rushing to fortified safe rooms and bomb shelters.</p><p>The Israeli military initially said the Houthis had fired a surface-to-surface missile that landed in an “open area” and that no casualties were reported. In a follow-up statement, the military said an initial inquiry indicated the missile had “fragmented midair” and that it was reviewing its attempts to intercept the strike.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Yahya Sarea, a Houthi military spokesman, said the armed group had fired a ballistic missile at what he claimed was a military target in central Israel. His claims could not be independently verified.</p><p>“The enemy should expect more strikes and quality operations,” Mr. Sarea said in a televised statement.</p><p>The goal of the attack, said Nasruddin Amer, another Houthi spokesman, was to pressure Israel to end the war in Gaza.</p><p>“The problem is in Gaza and the solution is in Gaza,” Mr. Amer said in a text message.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel suggested his country would respond to the attack, which he cast as part of a wider “battle against Iran’s axis of evil that is striving to destroy us.”</p><p>“They should have known by now that we exact a heavy price for any attempt to harm us,” he said, referring to the Houthis, at the start of a government meeting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hamas in Gaza is one of several armed groups in the region that are backed by Iran, including the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing, welcomed the Houthi missile launch.</p><p>Since Israel started bombing Gaza in response to the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack, some of Iran’s regional proxies have launched attacks on Israeli interests and prompted fears of a widening war.</p><p>The Houthis are a Yemeni Shiite militia that over the past decade seized control of large parts of western Yemen, including the capital, Sana, and the Red Sea coastline. While the group’s opposition to Israel long preceded the war in Gaza, the Houthis had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/world/middleeast/houthi-drone-strike-israel-tel-aviv.html" title="">rarely attacked Israeli interests</a> before October last year.</p><p>Since November, the Houthis have menaced ships in the Red Sea that they claim have links to Israel. In response, the United States, Britain and other allies of Israel have attacked Houthi weapons depots, missile systems and radar facilities in Yemen.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A residential building in Tel Aviv that was struck by a Houthi drone attack in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On July 19, the Houthis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html" title="">launched a drone attack</a> on Tel Aviv that crashed into a building near the U.S. Embassy, killing one person and wounding several others.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A day later, Israeli fighter jets bombed the Red Sea port of Hudaydah, which is controlled by the Houthis. The strikes in Hudaydah killed three people and injured 87, according to the health ministry in Sana, which the Houthis control.</p><p>Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militant group, started firing across the border into Israel on Oct 8. Since then, it has traded near-daily fire with the Israeli military and the tit-for-tat strikes have led to widespread destruction and large-scale evacuations on both sides of the border.</p><p>On Sunday, Israel’s military said that around 40 projectiles had entered the country from Lebanese territory at around 8 a.m. Some fell in open areas, the military said, and others were intercepted. No injuries were reported.</p><p>In a statement, Hezbollah said it had fired dozens of rockets in response to recent Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon and in support of the Palestinian people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The war in Gaza is now in its 12th month, with no apparent end in sight despite efforts by international mediators — including the United States — to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held in the enclave.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">Mr. Netanyahu</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/world/middleeast/gaza-war-hamas-yahya-sinwar.html" title="">Yahya Sinwar</a>, the newly chosen political leader of Hamas, have been seen as the two most important figures to both securing — or impeding — any potential truce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke rising near the Israel-Lebanon border on Tuesday.

Mr. Sinwar also sent a note to the president of Algeria congratulating him on his re-election, according to Hamas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In the letter to Mr. Nasrallah, the Hamas leader thanked his counterpart for his “solidarity that is mixed with true and noble feelings.”</p><p>Ibrahim al-Madhoun, an analyst close to Hamas, appeared to caution against reading too much into the correspondence. While public statements from Mr. Sinwar had been few and far between, he said, Mr. Sinwar’s new role as the chairman of Hamas’s political office meant that it was “natural” for him to send letters to presidents and the heads of militant groups.</p><p>“The letters are an affirmation of his new tasks,” Mr. al-Madhoun said. “He’s fighting a war, but he’s also undertaking his responsibilities in his new role.”</p><p>Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Euan Ward<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">Israel-Hamas War News</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>How UNRWA Became a Flashpoint:</strong><strong> </strong>The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees has survived 75 years of Israeli-Palestinian strife. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/magazine/unrwa-gaza-war.html">Can it survive the latest conflict</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Israel Raids Secret Weapons Site: </strong>Israel carried out a commando raid in Syria that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/israel-raid-syria-weapons.html">obliterated a Hezbollah missile production facility</a> near the Lebanese border, killing a number of people at the site, according to American and other Western officials.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gazans Say Polio Drive Is Futile:</strong><strong> </strong>Palestinians living with the daily fear of Israeli strikes see a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-vaccination-futility.html">level of absurdity in the international drive</a> to vaccinate their children.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Road to a Cease-Fire</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Qatar has used <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/world/middleeast/qatar-hamas-israel-ceasefire-negotiations.html">its influence with Hamas to press for a truce with Israel</a>.
