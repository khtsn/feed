</span> to secure another grand final series. The results of this day mean that, while three teams in VCT Pacific have secured their spots at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions Paris</a>, the lower bracket final will determine who that final team is.</p>



<p>The first match was between TALON and Paper Rex, two teams in top form, competing to maintain that momentum. With the firepower between the two teams, it would ultimately come down to the shoulders of the star players to carry their team to victory.</p>

<p>Starting on Haven, it was a matchup of two different Yoru compositions, with TALON opting for a more defensive team with Deadlock and Cypher as Paper Rex ran double Duelist with <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9801/f0rsaken">
		f0rsakeN	</a>
</span> on Waylay. After TALON won the first pistol, it was clear as the half went on that this was a playground for both Yoru players, as they would often determine which team won the round with their plays. The game was tied at the half 6-6, but <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/17086/something">
		something	</a>
</span> already broke the 20 kill barrier, ending the half with an absurd 21/5/1 statline heading into their attack side. </p>

<p><em>something lands a nasty flick wallbang headshot.</em></p>

<p>TALON won the second pistol to regain the lead, with primmie stepping up on his own Yoru to take a 10-7 lead. Yet, even as thyy played well, <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7378/jinggg">
		Jinggg	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13744/patmen">
		PatMen	</a>
</span> were menaces on the attack side to quickly tie up the game, secure map point, and win a close one 13-11.</p>

<p>Haven was the map pick from TALON, meaning that now PRX was able to play their comfort pick of Bind. The double Duelist was back from PRX, but now Jinggg was on his signature Raze. TALON stuck to Deadlock compositions, this time having Gekko alongside her to make the post-plants on attack side very annoying to get through. Alas, PRX won the first pistol, and despite being unable to convert the bonus, they steamrolled their defense side to enter the half up 8-4. This time, it was f0rsakeN leading the charge on Brimstone, reminding everyone just how flexible he is. TALON won the second pistol to give some hope, but PRX quickly countered back to win the map 13-7 and secure the sweep.</p>

<p>Of all players in this series, something had an amazing Yoru performance on both Haven and Bind to take Paper Rex to their second straight grand final. He ended the game with a 1.30 match rating, 42 kills, +18, and 243 ACS.</p>

<p>As for TALON, their automatic qualification to Champions Paris will have to wait, with all the pressure now on their next game against RRQ.</p>

</span>, both teams had already secured their spot at Champions Paris. Both teams got trophies this year, with T1 from Masters Bangkok and RRQ from the Stage 1 playoffs, and they both fought hard for their chance at the Stage 2 playoff title.</p>

<p>This three-map series had a lot of variety, starting with Ascent. T1 decided to run the popular double Sentinel composition with Chamber and Vyse, while RRQ ran double Initiator and Yoru instead, with Tejo making a return. </p>

<p>With all the talent on RRQ, they were able to get a concrete lead despite losing the first pistol round. <span data-ref-id="8">

<p><em>crazyguy gets four kills to end the half up 9-3.</em></p>

<p>T1 were able to win the second half pistol and convert the bonus round to get four rounds in a row, taking it to 9-7, but RRQ quickly fought back on attack with a great half from <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4866/kushy">
		Kushy	</a>
</span> to end the map 13-7.</p>

<p>A great start from RRQ, now moving to Sunset. The compositions shifted, with <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/29833/izu">
		iZu	</a>
</span> playing Neon in a T1 double Duelist comp, and RRQ ran Breach and Waylay. T1 started the map winning pistol, and despite not being able to convert the bonus, they had a strong attack half. It was iZu leading the charge on Neon, as T1 reached the half with a 9-3 lead. However, once the sides flipped, RRQ showed the potential of the Jemkin Waylay pick. RRQ won pistol, converted the bonus, and nearly tied it at 10-10. T1 was able to keep the lead, but had to fight hard to the very end, only winning 13-11, but tying the series and taking it to Haven.</p>

<p>Haven would decide it all, and it would be a true mirror match for the win. Both teams ran double Duelist with Yoru and Neon, and T1 started off the map in form. T1 won the pistol, converted the bonus, and despite some unlucky post-plant rounds, had a good read on the attack to enter the half up 7-5. RRQ needed to win the second pistol, which they did, but T1 did take the bonus round to reach a 10-7 lead. Yet, just when they needed someone to step up, Jemkin did to help win RRQ five rounds in a row, up 12-10. T1 forced overtime for the first time in the series, but in double overtime, RRQ won to secure the map 15-13 and the series 2-1.</p>

<p>For a 2-1 win, it was a relatively quiet series for the normally unstoppable Jemkin, with the star for RRQ instead being <span data-ref-id="13">

		xffero	</a>
</span>. He played Cypher the whole match and ended the series with a 1.23 match rating, +13, 75% KAST, and 52 kills, helping anchor the defense sides. RRQ will face TALON in the lower bracket final.</p>

<p>These results mean that either TALON or <span data-ref-id="14">

</span> can be the final team to qualify to Champions Paris, entirely depending on whether TALON wins the lower final or not. Since a TALON win would secure a top two finish, they would be the fourth team, but if they do not, DRX would go in on points after a strong start to the year.</p>
