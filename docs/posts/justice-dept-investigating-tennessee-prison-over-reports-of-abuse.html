Private prisons are not above the law.”</p><p>The inquiry is part of a broader effort by Ms. Clarke’s civil rights division to scrutinize prisons and jails across the country, including in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-statement-interest-reiterating-prison-officials-duty-protect" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alabama</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-finds-conditions-three-mississippi-prisons-violate-constitution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mississippi</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/us/politics/georgia-jail-death-investigation.html" title="">Georgia</a>. At Trousdale Turner, which falls under the purview of the Tennessee Department of Correction, accounts of stabbings, killings and abuse are rampant.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Since the complex opened in 2016, it has been plagued by reports of “physical assaults, sexual assaults, murders and unchecked flow of contraband and severe staffing shortages,” said Henry C. Leventis, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee.</p><p>The department’s civil rights division is conducting the investigation with prosecutors in Tennessee. </p><p>According to one audit from state officials, a single correctional officer was responsible for supervising <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-kristen-clarke-delivers-remarks-announcing-civil-rights-3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 300 people</a>. In another, a corrections officer described how the staffing shortages had contributed to an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tennessee-prison-corecivic-audit-c6fd6dbd3a60efafe57d5b57457edbaf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alarming environment</a> for inmates.</p><p>“If you get assaulted, you’re going to get assaulted until the inmates get tired of beating you,” because there are no corrections officers available to help, the officer wrote.</p><p>This year, <a href="https://fox17.com/news/local/5-stabbings-at-trousdale-turner-correctional-facility-in-less-than-a-month" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five inmates were stabbed</a> at Trousdale Turner in less than a month. Two of the assaults, though unrelated, happened on the same day. A lawsuit filed last year said that understaffing and negligence by corrections officers contributed to the death of an inmate.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a nonprofit that pushes for prison reforms and has <a href="https://famm.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TTCC-FAMM-ltr-DOJ-Investigation-9.6.23.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">repeatedly urged the Justice Department to examine Trousdale Turner</a>, welcomed the investigation.</p><p>“At Trousdale, on a daily basis, people have to fear for their lives,” said Matthew Charles, a senior policy adviser for the group who was formerly incarcerated, adding that he hoped such an inquiry would force change.</p><p>The nonprofit had also raised concerns about lockdowns that have lasted as long as a month, cutting off inmates from family visits and even phone calls.</p><p>Steve Owen, a spokesman for CoreCivic, said the company took the investigation “very seriously” and would work with the Justice Department and the Tennessee Department of Correction.</p><p>“The safety and dignity of every person in our care is a top priority for our leadership and the staff at Trousdale Turner Correctional Center,” Mr. Owen said in an email. </p></div></div><div><div><p>The Biden administration has opposed private prison companies like CoreCivic, one of the largest private, for-profit prison operators in the country. The industry represents a <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/private-prisons-in-the-united-states/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">small sliver</a> of federal and state incarceration but rakes in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/us/prisons-immigration-detention.html" title="">billions of dollars</a> annually.</p><p>In his first week in office, President Biden signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/executive-order-reforming-our-incarceration-system-to-eliminate-the-use-of-privately-operated-criminal-detention-facilities/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> directing the Justice Department to not renew its contracts with private operators of corrections facilities.</p></div></div></section><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Biden Administration</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Washington.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Drug Price Limits: </strong>The Biden administration announced the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/drug-prices-medicare.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-biden-administration&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">results of landmark negotiations</a> between Medicare and pharmaceutical companies over the prices of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/drug-prices-medicare-negotiations.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-biden-administration&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">10 costly or common medications</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protections for Transgender Students: </strong>The Supreme Court temporarily continued to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/supreme-court-transgender-discrimination-schools.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-biden-administration&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">block Education Department rules</a> intended to protect transgender students from discrimination in several Republican states.</p></li><li><p><strong>Life After the White House: </strong>As he heads into his final months in office, President Biden has more publicly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/biden-retirement.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-biden-administration&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">embraced the idea of retirement</a> with a jovial serenity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Streamlining Customer Support:</strong> A set of policies proposed by the Biden administration could make it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/us-government-unsubscribe-memberships.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-biden-administration&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">easier for consumers</a> to cancel subscriptions, speak to customer service agents and get flight refunds.</p></li><li><p><strong>A New National Monument:</strong> Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/biden-springfield-race-riot-monument.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-biden-administration&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">designated a national monument</a> at the site of a 1908 race riot that laid waste to a Black community in Springfield, Ill.</p></li></ul></section></div></article></div></div></div>
