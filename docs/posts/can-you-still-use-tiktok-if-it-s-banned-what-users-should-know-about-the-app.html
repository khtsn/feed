(Apple and Google have not commented on their plans to remove the app.)</p><p>Apple has long complied with foreign governments that have ordered apps to be removed in their countries. Last April, for instance, Apple <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/technology/apple-whatsapp-china-app-store.html" title="">pulled communication apps</a> like WhatsApp, Signal, Threads and Telegram from its app store in China at the request of the Chinese government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-61a5a80d">Will the TikTok app still be on my phone if I have already downloaded it?</h2><p>Yes. The law does not make it illegal to have the TikTok app on your phone.</p><p>“The letter of the law is about future downloads and updates,” said Dean Ball, a research fellow with the Mercatus Center, a think tank out of George Mason University. “It’s not about taking the app off people’s phones.”</p><p>But without the ability for ByteDance to issue updates to TikTok via app stores, the app will likely degrade over time. Still, advertisers are anticipating some usage in the United States after the ban, and as of last month, new contracts to advertise on the app are still being signed, said Craig Atkinson, the chief executive of Code3, a digital marketing agency.</p><p>TikTok may also intervene before the app degrades and block its users in the United States from having access to videos on the platform after Jan. 19.</p><p>In India, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/business/tiktok-india-ban.html" title="">banned TikTok in 2020</a>, users of the app are met with a screen that says “Service not available” and blocks users from its platform.</p><p>TikTok has not said if it will limit access to the app if it is banned, and did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-99a9659">Would TikTok still be accessible from an internet browser?</h2><p>No. Along with banning app store companies from hosting the app, the law applies to internet providers.</p><p>It is likely, however, that users will still have access to TikTok if they use a virtual private network, or VPN, which encrypts a user’s location.</p><p>The ban “might even be a major business boost for VPN providers,” Mr. Atkinson said.</p><h2 id="link-28136a75">Could President-elect Donald J. Trump intervene and save the app?</h2><p>Some experts believe it is possible that Apple and Google could decide to not comply with the law, betting that President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/politics/trump-tik-tok-ban.html" title="">come out in support</a> of TikTok, would direct his attorney general not to enforce it.</p><p>“But unless there’s some new information that gets added to the equation, I would be very surprised if Apple and Google did that,” Mr. Ball said.</p><p>Mr. Trump could also change his mind, or even use the threat of enforcing the law as leverage against the two companies, said JB Ferguson, a managing director at Capstone focused on technology.</p><p>“I don’t know that you are appropriately defending shareholder value if you don’t take the law seriously, even if you believe Trump,” Mr. Ferguson said of Apple and Google.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eli Tan is a reporter covering the technology industry and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eli-tan">More about Eli Tan</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/tiktok">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-supreme-court">U.S. Supreme Court</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Supreme Court</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Alito-Trump Call:</strong> Justice Samuel Alito <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/justice-alito-trump.html">spoke with President-elect Donald Trump</a> shortly before Trump’s lawyers asked the Supreme Court to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/nyregion/trump-sentencing-supreme-court.html">delay his criminal sentencing in New York</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>TikTok Sale-or-Ban Law:</strong> When the justices hear arguments over whether protecting national security requires the app to be sold or banned, they will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/politics/tiktok-supreme-court-national-security-free-speech.html">working in the shadow of three First Amendment precedents</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gun Rights and Felons: </strong>The Supreme Court has repeatedly ducked Second Amendment challenges to a law that disarms felons. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/us/supreme-court-disarming-felons.html">Starkly different decisions from federal appeals courts</a> could change that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Roberts’s Warning:</strong> Judicial independence is under grave threat on several fronts, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/us/politics/chief-justice-roberts-report.html">unusually urgent and somber year-end report</a> on the state of the federal judiciary.</p></li><li><p><strong>Undisclosed Trips: </strong>Justice Clarence Thomas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/us/politics/clarence-thomas-trips-disclosure-investigation.html">failed to disclose two additional trips</a> from a billionaire patron that had not previously come to light, Senate Democrats revealed after conducting an investigation into ethics at the court.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
