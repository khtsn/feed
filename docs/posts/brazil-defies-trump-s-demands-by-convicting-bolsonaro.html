And last month, when Mr. Trump’s 50 percent tariffs on Brazilian exports took effect, Brazil said its global exports actually rose 4 percent because of increased purchases by China.</p><p>“Does anyone believe that a tweet from a foreign government official will change a ruling in the Supreme Court?” Justice Flávio Dino said as he cast his vote this past week to convict Mr. Bolsonaro.</p><p>In response, Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1966257934129864715" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a>: “The United States will respond accordingly to this witch hunt.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil this month in the capital, Brasília.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dado Galdieri for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>How much further Washington is willing to go in its fight with Brazil is unclear.

They accuse Justice Moraes of censoring free speech by ordering social networks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/world/americas/brazil-online-content-misinformation.html" title="">block accounts</a> that often he alone decides threaten Brazil’s democracy.</p><p>His actions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/americas/brazil-supreme-court-expanded-powers-democracy.html" title="">have indeed been harsh</a> at times and lacked transparency, prompting criticism within Brazil, too. He and fellow justices have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/americas/brazil-chief-justice-supreme-court-power.html" title="">argued</a> that the Brazilian right’s recent attacks on democracy — including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/02/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-coup-trial.html" title="">a plot to assassinate</a> Justice Moraes — have required a firm response.</p><p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, was asked about Justice Moraes’s approach to the internet this week. Her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5OeUDQQqUXQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">response</a>, delivered as the judge was voting to convict Mr. Bolsonaro, raised eyebrows: “The president is unafraid to use the economic might, the military might of the United States of America to protect free speech around the world.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Jair Bolsonaro greeting supporters in March in Rio de Janeiro.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dado Galdieri for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Brazil’s government <a href="https://www.gov.br/mre/pt-br/canais_atendimento/imprensa/notas-a-imprensa/em-defesa-da-democracia-brasileira" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">condemned</a> the statement, and Mr. Lula later <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/politica/noticia/2025/09/11/lula-diz-nao-temer-novas-sancoes-de-trump-reage-a-porta-voz-da-casa-branca-e-afirma-que-brasil-nao-e-republiqueta-de-banana.ghtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told a radio station</a>, “The U.S. needs to know it’s not dealing with a banana republic.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Trump, for his part, did not seem to be revving for a fight when asked Thursday if he would respond to Mr. Bolsonaro’s conviction with more sanctions. “It’s very much like they tried to do with me, but they didn’t get away with it,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTKr6MN1bIE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>. He did not mention any retaliation.</p><p>What is clear is that the White House’s campaign against Brazil did not stop Mr. Bolsonaro’s conviction, but it did hurt America’s image in the country and push its largest ally in the Western Hemisphere closer to China.</p><p>Mr. Lula has spoken with President Xi Jinping of China at least twice since the U.S. tariffs took effect — but not once with Mr. Trump.</p><p>China, already Brazil’s largest trading partner ahead of the United States, is becoming even more central to Brazil’s economic plan. China bought 31 percent more from Brazil in August, when the tariffs kicked in, compared with a year before. At the same time, Brazil’s sales to the United States dropped 18.5 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Public perceptions in Brazil of the United States and China have been following a similar pattern.
