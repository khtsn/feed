    <h1>Top Justice Department Officials Meet Lawyers in Adams Case</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Justice Department’s handling of the matter represents a high-profile test of the agency under the Trump White House and is likely to be seen as an indication of how extensively the president will interfere with the administration of justice during his second term.</p><p>Since Watergate, the White House has largely kept the Justice Department at arm’s length to ensure the agency’s independence. And while Mr. Trump broke with that norm during his first term, a dismissal of the case against Mr. Adams, who has curried favor with the president for months, would be a strong signal that any distance between the presidency and the department has closed.</p><p>Mr. Trump could, of course, pardon Mr. Adams, and in December suggested he was considering doing so. Under the law, the president’s attorney general also has the authority to ask the presiding judge to dismiss the indictment.</p><p>But if the federal prosecutors in Manhattan seek to dismiss it, Mr. Trump will be able to avoid the appearance of interference, and Mr. Adams, who is running for re-election, could say that the Justice Department determined that the case against him should not continue.</p><p>That would strongly counter the impression left by the prosecutors in recent weeks. Earlier this month, they said in a court filing that they had uncovered “additional criminal conduct” by the mayor. Last month, Mr. Adams’s lawyers revealed in court papers that prosecutors had presented more evidence to a grand jury in his case, a disclosure that also suggested that additional charges were in the offing.</p></div></div>
