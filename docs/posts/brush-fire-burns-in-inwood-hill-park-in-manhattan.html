Operations were ongoing, officials said. There were no injuries.</p><p>A fire chief at the scene said it was unclear what started the fire, although the cause did not appear to be suspicious.</p><p>The Fire Department first received a call about the fire around 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, the department said. Not long after, large clouds of orange and yellow smoke ascended into the sky from the woods, and officials urged residents nearby to close their windows and to avoid the area.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><a href="https://x.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1856788025520406921" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A video</a> of the fire posted on X by Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, showed zigzags of burning leaves among staircases and trees in the park.</p><p>The Inwood Hill Park fire was among the latest in an unusually high number of brush fires and wildfires to erupt <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/nyregion/jennings-creek-wildfire-nj-ny-wind.html" title="">in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut</a>, as the region contends with unseasonably dry conditions and gusty winds. Robert S. Tucker, New York City’s fire commissioner, said Wednesday that the department had responded to more than 225 brush fires since Oct. 29.</p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul said this week that the state was under a burn ban, prohibiting outdoor fires and grilling. The governor urged New Yorkers to conserve water, emphasizing that last month was one of the “driest Octobers” on record.</p><p>Lilith Ben-Or, 35, who works as a dog walker, said she was on a walk near the park when the thick smoke and the sound of helicopters overhead started to give her a headache.</p><p>Ms. Ben-Or, a lifelong Inwood resident, described the park as a special place for local residents. She said she recalled seeing fires in the area as a child but never one like this.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“This is so much bigger.
