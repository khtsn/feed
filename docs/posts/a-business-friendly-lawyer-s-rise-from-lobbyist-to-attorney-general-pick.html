Trump during her two terms as Florida’s attorney general, the state’s top law enforcement official.</p><p>Carnival feared it could be sued for damages of up to $600 million for parking its cruise ships at Havana docks that had been seized decades earlier by Cuban communists. The company wanted Mr. Trump’s aid in fending off the lawsuits.</p><p>With Ms. Bondi’s help, Carnival’s chairman, Micky Arison, got a meeting with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office to push its case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the end the president did not side with the company. But Ms. Bondi’s involvement demonstrated that she could help grease relations with the Trump administration for her new clients.</p><p>It was also a continuation of her open-door approach to companies, which started when she held office in Florida.</p><p>Now, critics question if Ms. Bondi will bring that same transactional philosophy to the Justice Department. She was picked by Mr. Trump to be his nominee for attorney general after Matt Gaetz, a former congressman from Florida who was Mr. Trump’s first choice for the job, withdrew his name in the face of formidable opposition, even within his own Republican Party.</p><p>Ms. Bondi would not be the first U.S. attorney general who previously served as a lobbyist. A review of lobbying records from the last 25 years showed that Eric H. Holder Jr., who served as attorney general during the Obama administration, had worked as a <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/search/?registrant=&amp;registrant_country=&amp;registrant_ppb_country=&amp;client=&amp;client_state=&amp;client_country=&amp;client_ppb_country=&amp;lobbyist=eric+holder&amp;lobbyist_covered_position=&amp;lobbyist_conviction_disclosure=&amp;lobbyist_conviction_date_range_from=&amp;lobbyist_conviction_date_range_to=&amp;report_period=&amp;report_year=&amp;report_dt_posted_from=&amp;report_dt_posted_to=&amp;report_amount_reported_min=&amp;report_amount_reported_max=&amp;report_filing_uuid=&amp;report_house_doc_id=&amp;report_issue_area_description=&amp;affiliated_organization=&amp;affiliated_organization_country=&amp;foreign_entity=&amp;foreign_entity_country=&amp;foreign_entity_ppb_country=&amp;foreign_entity_ownership_percentage_min=&amp;foreign_entity_ownership_percentage_max=&amp;search=search#js_searchFormTitle" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">registered lobbyist</a>, and that William P. Barr, one of Mr. Trump’s attorneys general, had been a corporate leader of a <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/press-releases/verizon-general-counsel-william-p-barr-announces-retirement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government advocacy group</a>.</p><p>But while she was Florida’s attorney general, Ms. Bondi became known for what one lobbying firm called her “<a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/1339573-3-ag-bondi/#document/p11/a183033" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">business-friendly</a>” attitude. She and her staff agreed to meet with a steady stream of lawyers whose clients — including <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/1339573-3-ag-bondi/#document/p74/a183188" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bridgepoint Education</a>, a <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/actions/bridgepoint-education-inc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for-profit</a> college chain, and <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/1339573-3-ag-bondi/#document/p50/a183181" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Herbalife</a>, a nutritional shake company — had been targeted by other states for investigations, a New York Times review of her work found.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Then, in her time as a lobbyist, which began in early 2019, Ms. Bondi represented a long roster of corporate clients, including Uber and Amazon. Many of these companies have business with the federal government — and could be subject to scrutiny by a Justice Department run by her, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest.</p><p>The client list in recent years has also included foreign entities that have tried to leverage Ms. Bondi’s influence and connections, such as a firm once run by a Russian businesswoman convicted in Kuwait of embezzling tens of millions of dollars worth of government funds.</p><p>Along the way, she also became <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000083774/pdf/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000083774.pdf#page=51" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a prominent ally</a> of Mr. Trump’s, serving as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/us/politics/trump-lawyers-defense-team-impeachment.html" title="">one of his defense lawyers</a> in his first impeachment trial and pushing <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2020/11/05/pam-bondi-throws-herself-into-trump-effort-to-stop-counting-votes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">efforts in Pennsylvania</a> to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000083774/pdf/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000083774.pdf#page=51" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overturn the results</a> of the 2020 election. She now appears poised for confirmation in the Republican-led Senate.</p><p>“The attorney general must first serve the American people and justice,” said James Tierney, a former Maine attorney general, who also spent nearly two decades as the head of a Columbia University program focusing on the practice of law by state attorneys general, when asked about Ms. Bondi. “She can never serve the personal interests of the president or others seeking favors from him.”</p><p>Senator Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee, called Ms. Bondi “a fierce, determined woman who will be a champion for the American people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s office did not respond to a number of detailed questions sent by The Times about Ms. Bondi’s engagements with lobbyists as Florida’s attorney general and her work as a lobbyist since. Ms. Bondi referred questions to a spokesman for the Trump-Vance transition team.</p><p>“All nominees and appointees will comply with the ethical obligations of their respective agencies,” said Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump transition, in a statement. “As attorney general, Pam Bondi will be solely focused on returning the Department of Justice to its true mission of fighting crime, prosecuting criminals and keeping Americans safe.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Ms. Bondi and Mr. Trump walking together under an umbrella." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj/00dc-bondi-02-tkqj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/71a4837b-a4e2-54e9-90d2-8ce0f2cc81b2" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Bondi has become a prominent ally of Mr. Trump’s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-5b4beb6a">An Approachable A.G.</h2><p>Appeals by corporate lobbyists to Ms. Bondi started from almost the moment she was sworn into office in January 2011 as Florida’s first female attorney general. One lawyer, Bernard Nash, the self-proclaimed “<a href="https://www.cozen.com/people/bios/nash-bernie" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">godfather</a>” of the small club of law practices that wooed attorneys general, was particularly aggressive in seeking her out.</p><p>Mr. Nash worked quickly to build a rapport with Ms. Bondi, engaging with her twice at industry events in her first months as attorney general and inviting her to a special lobbyist-funded dinner he was hosting for attorneys general at what was then one of the hottest French restaurants in Washington, Michel Richard Citronelle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Bondi was quickly identified by Mr. Nash’s office — which had a long list of clients from the pharmaceutical, education and consumer products industries, among others — as someone willing to engage with his team as they discouraged investigations and litigation, according to emails first obtained by The Times a decade ago.</p><p>The emails, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/us/politics/attorneys-general.html" title="">were reported on in 2014 by The Times</a> as part of a review of ties between state attorneys general, including Ms. Bondi, and industry lawyers and lobbyists, show that Mr. Nash’s team pushed Ms. Bondi’s staff to drop a lawsuit that had already been filed by her predecessor.</p><p>“Thank you so much for chatting with me last week about the online travel site suit,” Chris Tampio, then a member of Mr. Nash’s firm, <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/1339573-3-ag-bondi/#document/p24/a183042" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote to Ms. Bondi’s top aides in 2012.</a></p><p>Mr. Tampio was writing on behalf of Travelocity, the travel reservation website, which Florida was then suing for underpaying state sales taxes. “I wanted to see if your office had made a decision on how to proceed?”</p><p>The next year Ms. Bondi’s office moved to withdraw its lawsuit after repeated claims by Mr. Tampio and his team that the case against Travelocity, which <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/1339573-3-ag-bondi/#document/p54/a183183" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had failed</a> in lawsuits brought by other local governments in Florida, was flimsy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Bondi, the documents obtained by The Times show, was one of many state attorneys general pursued by Mr. Nash and his team. But these emails show that Ms. Bondi was among the most receptive to Mr. Nash’s appeals.</p><p>Accretive, a health care bill collection company, was <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/1e5bc318e18152d6/50fc7e00-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under investigation in Minnesota</a> for abusive tactics, including approaching patients in the emergency room for payment. Accretive hired Mr. Nash’s team to make sure other attorneys general in other states, including Florida, did not follow suit.</p><p>Again, Mr. Nash’s firm prevailed, later <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/1339573-3-ag-bondi/#document/p37/a183171" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">boasting in marketing materials</a> that “we persuaded A.G.s not to sue Accretive Health.”</p><p>The Times asked Ms. Bondi, when she was attorney general, about these efforts. She said the lobbyists’ appeals had no effect on her actions. “My office aggressively protects Floridians from unfair and deceptive business practices, and absolutely no access to me or my staff is going to have any bearing on my efforts to protect Floridians,” <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/8c8cab5490b8a294/9ed5916e-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she said in a statement</a> at the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Appeals by corporate lobbyists to Ms. Bondi started from almost the moment she was sworn into office in January 2011.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris O&#39;Meara/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>These appeals to Ms. Bondi to not pursue various investigations were often paired with donations and free travel.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Nash’s firm, for example, <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/1339571-1-raga/#document/p28/a183009" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped cover the bill to charter a plane</a> to fly <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/1339571-1-raga/#document/p31/a186158" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ms. Bondi</a> and other attorneys general to Mackinac Island in Michigan for a meeting of the Republican Attorneys General Association, where they stayed at the famed Grand Hotel.</p><p>Attorneys general in Washington State, Oregon and Vermont were at the time investigating 5-Hour Energy, a caffeinated drink company, and they would later file a lawsuit accusing the company of deceptive marketing.

ETC Capital, an investment fund controlled by the owner of the 5-Hour Energy brand, then <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/4f9f4f0c3472d27f/d5ed3102-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">donated $10,000 to a political action committee</a> run by Ms. Bondi as she was starting her re-election effort.</p><p>Mr. Hughes, the spokesman for Mr. Trump’s transition, did not respond to specific questions about each of these cases, but said in a statement that “Pam Bondi executed her duties as attorney general of Florida with complete integrity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Ms. Bondi’s political action committee, And Justice for All, also took in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/14/us/politics/check.html" title="">$25,000 donation</a> the same month, in September 2013, from the Donald J.

The check was signed by Mr. Trump several weeks after New York State <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/nyregion/trump-university-made-false-claims-lawsuit-says.html" title="">sued Trump University</a>, accusing him of deceptive marketing practices. The civil suit ultimately resulted in a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2018/ag-schneiderman-statement-final-trump-university-settlement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$25 million settlement with the state.</a></p><p>Again, Ms. Bondi’s office was one of several state attorneys general, including Kamala Harris, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/us/politics/trump-kamala-harris-donation.html" title="">then the attorney general in California</a>, who decided not to take up the matter.
