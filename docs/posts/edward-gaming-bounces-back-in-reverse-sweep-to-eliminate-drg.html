<p>The series started on EDG&#39;s pick of Split. Throughout early goings of 2026, EDG&#39;s struggles have stemmed from its Duelist approach and how to use <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/search/r/event/2097/ac" target="_blank">Champions Seoul</a> <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> to the best of his ability. After showing some discomfort in the team&#39;s attempts at using Iso, KangKang began the series on Neon, an agent that fits smoothly with his chaotic, frag-heavy playstyle.</p>

<p>Both DRG and EDG played with two Duelists, Neon and Yoru, but while EDG went with an Omen-Viper comp, DRG went with Omen as the lone Controller and <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3741/vo0kashu">
		vo0kashu	</a>
</span> on Cypher. As a map, Split went about as back-and-forth as it could. With EDG starting on attack, both teams went on short runs of their own to enter halftime tied 6-6. </p>

<p>Once on defense, DRG Controller <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4705/flex1n">
		Flex1n	</a>
</span>&#39;s shots started to heat up. With vo0kashu continuing to prove himself as one of the best anchoring Sentinel players in the region, DRG kept EDG&#39;s attack just enough at bay to squeeze out a win, 13-11.</p>

<iframe type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/E6-RFJ96xqs?si=1NwW3SRSbdWyXG0n&amp;clip=Ugkxk79WuN4bKyiSSdNarbtxG2z8j6r5qEJp&amp;clipt=ELSd5QEYlPLoAQ&amp;showinfo=0&amp;origin=https://www.vlr.gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p><em>A chaotic round ends with DRG stealing EDG&#39;s map pick away.</em></p>

<p>Flex1n and vo0kashu had 22 and 20 kills, respectively, leading DRG to a crucial map win while <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span>&#39;s 19 kills ended up being just not enough.</p>

<p>The series moved to DRG&#39;s pick of Pearl, a map that could be argued as a counter pick to EDG due to the team&#39;s recent struggles on the map. The map has been a sore spot in EDG&#39;s map pool since the start of the 2025 season, and now, 13 rounds away from elimination, it needed to be at its best.</p>

<p>Since its changes last fall, Pearl has been the host to some interesting trends across VCT. The map has had several blowouts on the map, with near shutouts for the defense and attack taking place globally. On this particular day, the advantage fell to EDG, which started on attack. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/39697/cb">
		cb	</a>
</span> and KangKang could do no wrong on the map, helping EDG to a near shutout in the first half. The pair combined for 31 kills in the first half, overwhelming DRG&#39;s defenses as part of an 11-1 half.</p>

<iframe type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/E6-RFJ96xqs?si=qbStgWTFyzRrdr2E&amp;clip=Ugkxl99JNXhZFL_B4G_IdAA6EITbi6MASoNU&amp;clipt=EOCSkAMY3-OTAw&amp;showinfo=0&amp;origin=https://www.vlr.gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p><em>Even with ZmjjKK&#39;s Outlaw out of the equation, four Classics blend DRG into oblivion.</em></p>

<p>DRG won the pistol round to start its attacking half, but an anti-eco round threw a wrench into the DRG engine, hijacking any semblance of a comeback en route to a dominant 13-2 win.</p>

<p>The win forced a map three, which was Corrode. Both teams have their own unique approaches to Valorant&#39;s newest map. DRG uses a Gekko-centric double-Duelist comp with Omen as the lone Controller, while EDG stuck with its unique Phoenix-Yoru double-Duelist comp with <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span> on Sage.</p>

<p>Out of the gates, EDG carried over its momentum from Pearl into Corrode. After dominating the last map on attack, EDG began Corrode on defense. With cb on Yoru, EDG did not rely on KangKang heavily with the Operator, instead opting for cb.</p>

<p>Earlier in the event, DRG showed shades of struggles on Corrode, with moments of weakness — misused ultimate abilities, a struggle against time, and lapses in decision-making. On this day, EDG appeared to be the stronger team, as opposed to DRG beating itself. EDG forced the issue onto the attacking DRG, channeling KangKang&#39;s 4-0 record in first bloods to disrupt their opponents in the first half. A 6-0 run to open the map was responded to by DRG, but only as far as an 8-4 deficit.</p>

<p>Once on attack, everything flowed into place for EDG. With vo0kashu&#39;s Cypher utility often set up on the weaker side of the map, EDG pestered his setups, with cb&#39;s Fakeout and KangKang&#39;s Phoenix utility burning him up in more ways than one. While EDG couldn&#39;t find the bonus following a pivotal pistol round win, the 2024 world champs eventually closed out the map 13-6, never quite looking uncomfortable.</p>

<iframe type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/E6-RFJ96xqs?si=oAcf36qK8mS7kLxW&amp;clip=UgkxSEQzr_apC_Jk1GBWkwBq7UYWVTK8RbOg&amp;clipt=EKTLuwQYhKC_BA&amp;showinfo=0&amp;origin=https://www.vlr.gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p><em>EDG takes the A site and holds it down to reach series point.</em></p>

<p>While cb&#39;s team-high 52 kills played a massive role in the team&#39;s success, one of the biggest proponents of EDG&#39;s win was KangKang&#39;s success in first duels. He went 13-3 in first battles, creating more early man advantages than anybody else in the lobby. vo0kashu&#39;s game-high 56 kills were not enough, as a more well-rounded performance from EDG helped send DRG home.</p>

<p>With the win, EDward Gaming keeps its <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2760/valorant-masters-santiago-2026" target="_blank">Masters Santiago</a> hopes alive. They will wait two days while the upper and middle bracket&#39;s finals are completed, awaiting either <span data-ref-id="8">
