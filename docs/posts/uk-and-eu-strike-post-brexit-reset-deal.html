However the hostile reaction from opponents illustrated the political perils for him of seeking to improve a basic trade deal negotiated after Brexit, the most fraught and divisive issue in recent British politics.</p><p>“It’s time to look forward,” Mr. Starmer said in a statement, “to move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions. We’re ready to work with partners if it means we can improve people’s lives here at home.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Under the deal, European countries will be encouraged to allow British people<span>  </span>to use electronic gates in Europe when crossing borders, and traveling with pets will be easier too. The sale of some British meat products in the European Union — Britain’s biggest trading partner — will be possible again and some border checks on animal and plant products will end.</p><p>The agreement was unveiled in a gilded room in Lancaster House, an ornate government building in London. Mr. Starmer stood at a podium flanked by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive body.</p><p>However, the agreement is politically contentious for Mr. Starmer and has involved months of difficult negotiations with the agreement only signed off on Monday.</p><p>One of the most delicate issues in the trade talks was an extension of the right of European trawlers to fish in British territorial waters, in exchange for reduced trade barriers for British food products entering the E.U.’s giant single economic zone.</p><p>After discussions that continued until almost the last minute, the two sides agreed that they would allow European boats access to U.K. fishing waters until June 30, 2038.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That was not the indefinite extension that some in Europe had sought, but is a far longer window than the British had initially suggested.<span>  </span>Though economically of little significance, fishing is a politically sensitive issue and the agreement<span>  </span>was quickly seized on by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/world/europe/uk-brexit-eu-summit.html" title="">Britain’s right-wing, pro-Brexit tabloids</a>, with one calling it a “surrender.”<span>   </span></p><p>There was a much warmer reaction from other business sectors and Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, which represents thousands of firms, said that “a permanent deal to remove unnecessary checks on food and drink exports in both directions is a huge boost; it will cut costs, reduce waste and increase sales. “</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Worried about a potential backlash among Brexit hard-liners, Mr. Starmer had already ruled out joining the E.U.’s single market or customs union — two measures that would have jolted economic growth. </p><p>Much of the detail will now need to be hashed out by committees of experts but Mr. Starmer said that the agreement could be worth £9bn annually to the Britain — a modest sum relative to the size of the economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But some<span>  </span>concessions were required to reach the deal on food exports, requiring Britain to stick to European standards.</p><p>Mr. Starmer will be hoping that concrete benefits to consumers and travelers will outweigh the objections of Brexit supporters.</p><p>The deal includes plans for a new program to allow young Europeans to travel and work in Britain and vice versa. It is politically sensitive in Britain, where the government is trying to cut immigration numbers. Previously described as a “youth mobility” program, it has been rebranded as a “youth experience” program to avoid any hint of immigration. Mr. Starmer’s office said that the new program will limit the time young Europeans can spend in Britain and that their numbers will be capped.</p><p>The European Union noted in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_25_1268" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fact sheet</a> that the two sides had agreed to “work toward” a youth plan, but that the details were still to be negotiated. European officials have been pushing for their students at British universities to pay the same fees as U.K. students, something their counterparts have rejected as too expensive.</p><p>“The exact conditions related to this scheme will be decided during the negotiations,” per the European Union description of the plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Given Britain’s status as one of Europe’s two main military powers, the European Union has long wanted a security pact with Britain. That idea, however, was rejected by former prime minister, Boris Johnson, when he negotiated Britain’s exit from the bloc.</p><p>The war in Ukraine and President Trump’s approach to European security have changed the climate and increased the sense of urgency for cooperation. At the same time, Britain is pushing for some of its companies to participate in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/europe/eu-defense-spending.html" title="">a 150 billion euro</a> loan program to fund joint defense procurement. This deal could be an early step toward that inclusion.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.</p></div><div><p>Jeanna Smialek is the Brussels bureau chief for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
