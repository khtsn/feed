Although it rebounded and recouped its losses, the jolt has left investors braced for further turbulence. Activity in derivatives markets suggests traders are prepared for the S&amp;P 500 to move more than 1 percent in either direction on Wednesday, according to Bank of America analysts.</p><p>Some analysts are less concerned, pointing to inflation data on Tuesday that showed producer prices slowing more than expected, helping the S&amp;P 500 to rise 1.7 percent for the day.</p><p>“Everyone is so laser-focused on C.P.I., but it is a much bigger picture than that,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at the fund manager Invesco. “The mosaic of data is telling a positive story.”</p><p>But other factors are intensifying the market’s vulnerability to swings in response to unexpected data points about the economy. They include a slow buildup of risky bets, and concern about whether the rally in shares of big tech companies has gone too far. Both factors have contributed to the choppy movement in recent weeks.</p><p>“That backdrop leaves you susceptible to volatility when you have things come out of left field,” said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
