Others, however — despite the early hour and the daunting task ahead of running 26.2 miles through all five boroughs — were acting like they were at a party, chatting up strangers, wishing them luck and, in many cases, complimenting them on what they chose to wear for the race.</p><p>There were costumes (Waldo of “Where’s Waldo?” fame could be spotted in the crowd); flexes (some runners wore gear from past marathons); and lots of glitter. Some people put a lot of thought into their outfits (including homemade costumes) and others threw on mismatched layers that could be discarded as the day heated up.</p><p>“I think the fashion police will arrest me right now,” said Jill Holterman, 33, an Olympian from the Netherlands, who was wearing an ugly Christmas sweater with pink leggings. “I need something that is keeping me warm and that I can throw away. My mom gave this one to me, but I have another one at home, so don’t worry.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>She did, however, acknowledge the positive power of a fun outfit at a marathon: “It’s giving everyone Christmas cheer a little early,” she said. “We’re going to enjoy today.”</p><p>Below are some of the best looks at the starting line.</p><p>Interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><h3 id="link-1e40a8bc"><span>Eric Sung, 30</span></h3><p>Queens</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/03/multimedia/03MARATHON-STYLE-ppl-01-hkcv/03MARATHON-STYLE-ppl-01-hkcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/03/multimedia/03MARATHON-STYLE-ppl-01-hkcv/03MARATHON-STYLE-ppl-01-hkcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/03/multimedia/03MARATHON-STYLE-ppl-01-hkcv/03MARATHON-STYLE-ppl-01-hkcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A man in a yellow and blue minion costume has mirrored sunglasses and a mustache.

Maxx. I saw it, and it was calling me.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Do you love the Minions?</strong> Not really. This is pretty much just for attention and to keep me warm.</p><p><strong>Are you getting a lot of attention?</strong> Oh, yes. I’ve already made friends today. At least 20 people have come up to me. They compliment me, and they say, “We should all dress up as Minions next year.” They are copying me. I am into it.</p><hr/><h3 id="link-2210e96f"><span>Christina Brandt, 28</span></h3><p>Manhattan</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>How did you decide how to dress today?</strong> The sparkle freckles were inspired by Taylor Swift. She wore them to a Chiefs game, and I bought them five minutes later on Amazon. I was like, “She knows what she’s doing. I should do that.” I also love my freckles; they are something different and defining about me.</p><p><strong>Why are you wearing a blazer?</strong> You know what they say: Dress to impress.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h3 id="link-6e505a1"><span>Jennifer Ledesma, 34</span></h3><p>Harrison, N.J.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>How did you get your hair braided like this?</strong> My co-worker did it on Friday. She did it so quickly, like in 30 minutes. I am very thankful for her.</p><p><strong>Why did you want this color in your hair?</strong> I chose it to match my shoes. I chose an all-black outfit so my hair and the shoes can be the main focus.</p><p><strong>Do you think people will cheer for you more because of your hair?</strong> I hope they will cheer for me not just because of my hair, but also for all the work I’ve put into this. It’s my first time doing the New York City Marathon or any other marathon. I’m so ready for this. I’ve been training, and I feel ready.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h3 id="link-73e9ad92"><span>Kathleen Zhou, 29</span></h3><p>Brooklyn</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>Tell us about your hair!</strong> Well, my hair is pink, so I thought it would be fun to have bows to match it. A friend also brought glitter, so I was like, “I should do that too.”</p><p><strong>Are the bows going to get in the way?</strong> I’ve worn them in a race before, and people laugh because they fly behind me as I go by. But I think people like it; they smile.</p><p><strong>Is the glitter going to stay on?</strong> I really hope so. I think it will, unless I sweat too much. That will probably happen around mile 22 or 23.</p><p><strong>How did you decide to do black-and-white checkered nails?</strong> My run club has this checkered shirt that is inspired by New York taxi cabs but also the finish line flag. I wanted my nails to match it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><hr/><h3 id="link-22f863fb"><span>Paul Auguin, 28</span></h3><p>New York City</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p><strong>Tell us about your polka dot shirt!</strong> I painted it yesterday. I took a wine bottle cork and used it to paint the dots.</p><p><strong>Why did you want custom clothes for the marathon?</strong> I want to look stylish. My friends are going to be on the course, and I want to look good running in front of them. Also, if I am going to suffer, I want to look good doing it.</p><p><strong>Why the bandanna?</strong> I wore it for my first marathon and that went well, so I guess it’s a good look.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><h3 id="link-4b81882a"><span>Antonio Marshall, 41</span></h3><p>Chile</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>Why are you dressed as Forrest Gump?</strong> I run for the people who are autistic and neurodivergent to promote inclusion, empathy, and respect. Forrest is the story of an autistic man who has a successful life, whose dreams come true with perseverance and discipline.</p><p><strong>How long did it take you to grow the beard?</strong> Four years. People ask me if the hair is authentic, and I’m like, “Yeah, yeah. It’s authentic.”</p><p><strong>So many people are asking you for selfies! How many do you think you will take today?</strong> I wore this outfit to a similar event in Santiago, and there I counted that I took at least 400.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><h3 id="link-51cd1a8d"><span>Dere Villerreal, 52</span></h3><p>Mexico</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p><strong>Is this your first marathon?</strong> This is my 18th marathon, but my first time doing it in New York City.</p><p><strong>Why the tutu?</strong> When I first started running marathons I saw other people looking very glam, like they were at a party. I wanted that too.</p><p><strong>How do you feel in this outfit?</strong> I feel like a princess. I know I am 52, but I can still feel that way.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><h3 id="link-53fc09a8"><span>Matt Kobyra, 30</span></h3><p>New York City</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p><strong>You have a turtle shirt and a turtle hat.

Slow and steady wins the race!</p><p><strong>Who is your favorite Ninja Turtle?</strong> Probably Raphael because he is the jokester of the crew.</p><p><strong>Do you think you will get a lot of attention wearing this shirt?</strong> I’ve worn it out many times. I’ve gotten more compliments on this — a $7 Walmart shirt — than any nice article of clothing I own.</p><hr/><h3 id="link-41c25983"><span>Chloe Dillingham, 26, and Luis Hernandez, 27</span></h3><p>New York City</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p><strong>Why did you dress in unicorn onesies?</strong></p><p>Chloe: We wanted to do something fun to bring joy to the morning that can be very stressful.</p><p><strong>What is stressful about this morning?</strong></p><p>Chloe: We had to Uber to the bus and then take a long walk through security.
