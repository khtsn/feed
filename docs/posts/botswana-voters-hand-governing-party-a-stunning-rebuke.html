Botswana, a southern African nation of about 2.5 million people, is known for its political stability and diamond mining, which has produced tremendous wealth and friction over how to distribute it equally.</p><p>“I promise to do my part in building a strong country and to work with the new administration to ensure that every Batswana has opportunities at their fingertips,” Mr. Masisi said, using the term for citizens of Botswana.</p><p>The president-elect is Duma Boko, a 54-year-old human rights lawyer and graduate of Harvard University who leads the main opposition party, the Umbrella for Democratic Change. Mr. Boko’s party won enough seats in Parliament to secure a majority, according to results released on state television.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Botswana has had one of the most successful economic turnarounds that Africa has seen since the fall of British colonial rule. It grew wealthy from diamond production and earned a reputation for fiscal prudence and good governance, qualities that many in the country now say are on the decline.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The governing party lost support amid an economic slump fueled largely by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/africa/botswana-election-diamonds.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">a slowdown in the global diamond trade</a>, which accounts for the largest share of the nation’s economy. The mining giant De Beers gets most of its stones from Botswana, whose diamond output is rivaled only by Russia.</p><p>Critics also have blamed Botswana’s economic struggles on mismanagement and corruption within the governing party.</p><p>“I couldn’t be happier to see us out of the rule of Masisi and his administration,” said Tumelo Eetsi, a 43-year-old teacher living in Gaborone, the capital. “I just wanted to see change for this nation, and I’m hopeful we’ll have a fresh start on many things.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The governing party’s defeat adds to a list of long-dominant political parties in southern Africa that have lost public support in recent years. In May, the African National Congress, which has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/world/africa/south-africa-election-anc.html?searchResultPosition=5" title="">lost its parliamentary majority for the first time</a>.</p><p>Analysts say the lofty reputations that many African political parties earned during the fight against colonialism no longer resonate with a growing population of young voters who are mostly concerned about getting a good education and finding work.</p><p>Botswana’s unemployment rate has climbed to nearly 28 percent, and among young people it is closer to 38 percent. The International Monetary Fund expects the country to see growth of just 1 percent this year, down from 5.5 percent in 2022, largely because of the global diamond slump.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Eligon is the Johannesburg bureau chief for The Times, covering a wide range of events and trends that influence and shape the lives of ordinary people across southern Africa.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-eligon">More about John Eligon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
