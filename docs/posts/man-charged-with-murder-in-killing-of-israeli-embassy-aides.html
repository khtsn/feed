    <h1>Man Charged With Murder in Killing of Israeli Embassy Aides</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The suspect in the shooting deaths of two Israeli Embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C., was charged today with first-degree murder and other crimes. He told police officers, “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza,” when he was taken into custody, according to court documents. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/22/us/israel-embassy-shooting-dc" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>The charges were announced hours after federal agents raided the Chicago home of the suspect, whom the police identified as Elias Rodriguez. A post on social media last night from an account that The Times verified as belonging to Rodriguez condemned the Israeli and American governments, as well as Israeli military actions against Palestinians. The F.B.I. director described the killings as targeted antisemitic attacks. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/22/us/rodriguez-aff.html" title="">Read the F.B.I. affidavit</a>.</p><p>The victims were identified as Yaron Lischinsky, 30, who grew up in Israel and Germany, and Sarah Milgrim, 26, who was from Kansas. They were a couple, and Israel’s ambassador to the U.S. said that Lischinsky had purchased an engagement ring this week and planned to propose to Milgrim in Jerusalem. They had plans to fly there on Sunday. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/world/middleeast/israel-embassy-dc-shooting-victims-sarah-milgrim-yaron-lischinsky.html" title="">Here’s their story</a>.</p><p>The shooting punctuated a moment of rising tension after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza. Around the world, offenses against Jewish people and property <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/world/europe/shooting-dc-jewish-museum-antisemitism.html" title="">have doubled or even tripled</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6353285d">Justices rejected the nation’s first religious charter school</h2><p>The Supreme Court announced that it was split 4 to 4 over a plan that would allow Oklahoma to use government money to run the nation’s first religious charter school. The deadlock <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/supreme-court-religious-charter-school-oklahoma.html" title="">means that an earlier rejection of the plan by the state’s highest court</a> will be allowed to stand.</p><p>The court’s nine-member makeup is designed to avoid ties. But Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, recused herself from the case without providing reasoning. The lack of a majority means that the decision will not set a nationwide precedent on the larger question of whether the Constitution allows states to finance religious charter schools.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> The court also let President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/supreme-court-trump-agency-firings.html" title="">temporarily remove the leaders of two independent agencies</a>, setting up a possible challenge to many agencies long thought to be protected by Congress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Speaker Mike Johnson after the House passed Trump’s tax bill.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-2ec5e1a6">Trump’s domestic agenda squeaked through the House</h2><p>The House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/22/us/trump-news-updates#trump-bill-house-vote-passes" title="">narrowly passed a bill</a> this morning to deliver Trump’s domestic agenda.
