Israeli officials said the assaults were intended in part to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/27/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas#israeli-officials-say-the-lebanon-strikes-were-aimed-at-breaking-hezbollah-by-killing-its-leaders" title="">eliminate the group’s leadership</a>; an airstrike on Friday killed Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah. But officials had also suggested the attacks could thwart the need for a ground invasion.</p><h2 id="link-144bd88b">Why is Israel targeting southern Lebanon?</h2><p>Southern Lebanon is a rugged area, filled with steep valleys in which defenders can easily ambush an invading army, a factor that may have shaped Israeli military planning. The <a href="https://www.countryreports.org/country/Lebanon/geography.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tough terrain</a> has historically helped factions in the region defend themselves, and Hezbollah has used the geography to its advantage in past wars with Israel.</p><p>Israeli military leaders conducted months of preparatory drills for troops who could be sent to fight in the region, exercises they announced throughout the summer and into the fall.</p><h2 id="link-4f8ad8cf">What is U.N. Resolution 1701?</h2><p>United Nations Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war, called on Israeli troops to withdraw from southern Lebanon to an area in the Golan Heights below what is known as the Blue Line, and for Hezbollah to withdraw north of the Litani River, about 20 miles from Israel’s northern border. The area in between, where much of the fighting between them had taken place, was to become a buffer zone. </p><p>The resolution called for the area to be controlled by the Lebanese military and United Nations peacekeeping forces. A U.N. peacekeeping force has remained in the area, but the resolution was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/24/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah/un-general-assembly-hezbollah-israel?smid=url-share" title="">never fully implemented</a>.</p><p>Hezbollah has argued that its presence in the buffer zone is justified because Israel still occupies Lebanese land. Although the U.N. deemed that Israel had fully withdrawn from Lebanon in 2000, Israel remained in an area known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/world/middleeast/lebanons-threesided-postwar-game-who-gets-shabaa-farms.html" title="">Shabaa Farms</a>, which the U.N. considers an occupied part of Syria. Lebanon and Hezbollah say the land is Lebanese.</p><p>The resolution had envisioned the demilitarization of Hezbollah, but the group has only gained political and military might. In 2008, Israel sought <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/world/africa/18iht-19lebanon.13798155.html" title="">peace talks with Lebanon’s government</a> but was rebuffed, in large part because Hezbollah had gained political power in an agreement with the Lebanese government.</p><p>Israel maintains that Hezbollah has built up its arsenal of missiles aimed at Israel’s northern border and has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-missile-strike.html" title="">constructed more underground tunnels</a> that would allow the group to infiltrate and attack Israel, as it did in 2006. In 2018, an Israeli military operation uncovered tunnels built by Hezbollah, prompting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/world/middleeast/israel-calls-for-international-action-against-hezbollah-tunnels.html" title="">Israel to call for international action</a>. U.N. forces in Lebanon confirmed the presence of tunnels.</p><p>Last month, as Israel ratcheted up its air attacks on Hezbollah, Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, sent a letter to the United Nations arguing that the Israeli military aimed to thwart the armed group’s plans to infiltrate Israel and called for enforcement of Resolution 1701.</p><p>Israeli <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-missile-strike.html" title="">officials have long feared</a> that Hezbollah would conduct the kind of attack that Hamas led last Oct. 7 of last year, the incursion that killed about 1,200 people and set off the war in Gaza.</p><p>Hezbollah has suffered serious blows beyond the loss of its leader in the intensified Israeli attacks that preceded the current invasion, including heavy airstrikes near and in Beirut over the weekend. But Hezbollah has continued to fire rockets on northern Israel — and occasionally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/tel-aviv-hezbollah-missile.html" title="">into central Israel</a> — proving its resilience.</p><p>Hezbollah is thought to have perhaps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/hezbollah-military-capability.html" title="">the largest arsenal of any armed group</a> in the world, excluding governments, according to experts. A report in March by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research organization based in Washington, put the size of <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah#_ftn19" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hezbollah’s stockpile</a> between 120,000 and 200,000 rockets and missiles, including guided ballistic missiles, short-range and midrange unguided ballistic missiles and short- and long-range unguided rockets.</p><p>Patrick Kingsley<!-- -->, <!-- -->Matthew Mpoke Bigg<!-- --> and <!-- -->Isabel Kershner<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israel Strikes Multiple Fronts:</strong><strong> </strong>The escalation of violence between Israel and Iran-backed proxies across the Middle East <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-yemen-gaza.html">threatened to bring the combatants</a> closer to an all-out regional war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran Projects Caution: </strong>Leaders in Tehran suggested it would be the Lebanese militia that would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-hezbollah-israel-nasrallah.html">strike back at Israel</a> after the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, and bombings in Beirut.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disconnect Between Biden and Netanyahu:</strong><strong> </strong>Israeli officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/us/politics/hezbollah-strike-nasrallah-biden-netanyahu.html">gave their American counterparts no advance warning</a> of the strike that killed Nasrallah.
