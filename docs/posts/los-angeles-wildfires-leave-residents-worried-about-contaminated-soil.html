Its beds, flanked by lavender plants, are lush with parsley, lettuces and kale that are weeks overgrown.</p><p>But a sign on the gate forbids entry, describing the site as “DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH.”</p><p>In the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, the Altadena Community Garden is adjacent to the more than 14,000 acres that were scorched by the Eaton fire in January. Across the road are burned-out homes, crumpled roofs and the husks of cars.</p><p>State and federal leaders have touted the speed with which cleanup efforts have occurred here and in Pacific Palisades, where a separate fire burned more than 23,000 acres. President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/politics/tour-pacific-palisades-wildfire-damage.html?smid=url-share" title="">made clear in January</a> that he felt residents should be able to rebuild immediately, and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said last month that hazardous waste had been removed at “a record pace never seen before at this scale.”</p><p>Still, fears abound that pollutants could linger on the land long after federal authorities clear about <a href="https://www.spl.usace.army.mil/Missions/Emergency-Management/Los-Angeles-County-Wildfire-Debris-Removal-Mission/FAQ/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4.25 million tons</a> of waste from the two fires, including ash, debris and topsoil.

Federal officials are not planning to test the topsoil that is being removed, they said, nor will they test the soil that remains. That approach, they said, has been standard since 2020.</p><p>Curtis Brown, the Federal Emergency Management Agency officer responsible for coordinating federal recovery efforts in areas affected by the wildfires, told California officials last month that removing the topsoil was sufficiently protective, and that testing the soil would have meant delaying the rebuilding process by months. After past fires, he said, soil testing mainly found contaminants that were already present in the soil before fires broke out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>State leaders, however, say it is crucial to test the soil that is left behind. And many residents, already questioning whether they want to return and rebuild, are anxious to know whether the current cleanup efforts have made their properties safe.</p><p>Wildfires, particularly those in densely populated areas, incinerate common household objects and construction materials, including PVC pipes, appliances, batteries and paint. The combustion of these materials can release pollutants, including heavy metals like lead and arsenic, as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/climate/six-things-to-know-about-forever-chemicals.html" title="">PFAS</a>, a class of chemicals found in some common household items, including carpets and clothing. Asbestos, sometimes present in older buildings, may also be released.</p><p>These contaminants — some of which have been linked to <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/asbestos" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancer</a>, stunted <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/symptoms-complications/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">development</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8078867/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">birth defects</a> — can leach into the soil and into storm-water runoff. Some may already be present in soil, but scientists say that wildfires can increase their concentrations to potentially hazardous levels.</p><p>People may be exposed when they inhale dust or eat produce grown in the soil, three experts said in interviews. Children playing outside may be at risk of ingesting contaminated dirt.</p><p>Various groups of <a href="https://academics.lmu.edu/studyla/studies/communityactionprojectla/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers</a> are now offering to test residents’ soil in the absence of federal testing. They are planning to collect samples on a broader scale than was sought by state leaders, including properties where houses survived the fires and soil that is not adjacent to a building that burned down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Some homeowners have taken matters into their own hands by <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdc7lUUrbDloFdRitMw33zYcpiCilt-9lapK_GqozXdv6TrBg/viewform?fbclid=IwY2xjawIpvJ9leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHaWHEbEWPESWclSzP_6vgKPe7jVrGX9eIUNrwfxmxQ6yyaniOqWsZsNywQ_aem_YkjfvtmA_pVXjlUC-tsSzw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hiring private contractors</a> to examine their soil.

Wearing appropriate protective equipment and wetting down the earth before work begins can help mitigate the risk, Dr. Wexler said. Residents of fire-affected areas should also keep their windows closed and run air purifiers when construction occurs nearby, he said.</p><p>For all that, though, Dr. Wexler suggested that it may not be worth testing the soil, because the results of such tests can be difficult to interpret and may miss some contaminants.</p><p>“I’m not so sure that testing the soil is going to get you anywhere, other than freaking people out, because people are still going to want to rebuild,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The federal decision to forgo testing emerged last month in correspondence between California officials and FEMA, which is funding the <a href="https://recovery.lacounty.gov/2025/02/04/corps-of-engineers-begins-phase-2-of-debris-removal-in-los-angeles-wildfire-recovery/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cleanup efforts</a>.

The agency, he wrote in the letter, had not paid for soil testing in areas affected by wildfires in California for several years.</p><p>Before 2019, FEMA would remove three inches of soil, test it, then remove about three more inches and test it again, according to Mr. Brown. That practice ended after the 2018 Camp fire in Northern California. Doing it that way, Mr. Brown wrote, “was tedious, inefficient and a barrier to timely cleanup and recovery.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He said in his letter that Environmental Protection Agency officials determined that going ahead and removing a full six inches of soil without stopping for testing would “necessarily abate threats from the debris.”</p><p>The federal agency is following that approach in neighborhoods affected by the Palisades fire as well as the Eaton fire. The city of Los Angeles, which includes Pacific Palisades, has not said whether it plans to do any soil testing of its own.</p><p>After the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/californias-worst-wildfires-history.html#:~:text=The%20state&#39;s%20most%20devastating%20wildfire,it%20burned%20across%20153%2C000%20acres." title="">Camp fire</a>, which killed 85 people and destroyed more than 18,000 structures, <a href="https://www2.calrecycle.ca.gov/Docs/Web/121344" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an assessment</a> of residual ash in the soil found metal concentrations that were above, and in some cases “significantly above,” what they had been before the fire. The effects of wildfires on soil chemistry tend to be poorly monitored, and rarely factor into post-fire recovery efforts or risk assessments, according to a 2024 <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/05/how-wildfires-change-soil-chemistry" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> led by researchers at Stanford University and Colorado State University.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Goldschmidt, a retired landscape architect, is hoping to rebuild his house in Altadena, which was destroyed by the Eaton fire.

The results were reassuring: though the samples showed elevated levels of heavy metals, they were not high enough to pose a risk to human health.</p><p>Dr. Borch’s team is now studying properties affected by the Eaton fire, and so far, only a few sites have shown elevated concentrations of heavy metals. Still, he cautioned, surveys can miss spots where pollutants may be extremely concentrated — for example, the soil beneath the melted battery of a Tesla electric vehicle. And windy conditions or heavy rains can spread contaminants far beyond burned structures. So for these reasons, Dr. Borch said, the best way to know whether a site is contaminated is to test it individually.</p><p>Brianne Gilbert, a senior lecturer in urban and environmental studies at Loyola Marymount University, is part of a <a href="https://academics.lmu.edu/studyla/studies/communityactionprojectla/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">separate soil study</a> that has so far received interest from more than 1,000 residents affected by the Eaton or Palisades fires. The study team hopes to soon begin examining soil from properties in and adjacent to the burn zone, she said.</p><p>“In an ideal world, homeowners are able to feel 100 percent comfortable with the soil on their property, and there would be no need for these type of efforts,” Ms. Gilbert said. “But that just isn’t the case.”</p><p>Some residents acknowledged that it was impossible to completely allay concerns about the risks that come with continuing to live in a neighborhood scarred by wildfire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Leslie Aiken, who grows olives, oranges, lemons and guavas in her Pasadena garden, merely a block away from houses that burned down, said that she would not eat some of this year’s produce. But the possibility of lingering contaminants would not stop her from continuing to grow food in the future.</p><p>“We’re alive in 2025, so no soil on Earth is absolutely safe from any toxin,” Ms. Aiken said. “Let’s start there, with the obvious.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Livia Albeck-Ripka is a Times reporter based in Los Angeles, covering breaking news, California and other subjects.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/livia-albeck-ripka">More about Livia Albeck-Ripka</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
