    <h1>November’s Jobs Report Is Expected to Show a Rebound in Hiring</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Federal Reserve officials are trying to decide whether to cut interest rates in December and how much to lower them next year. Friday’s employment report could be an important factor as they weigh both decisions.</p><p>This is the final snapshot of the United States labor market that central bankers will glimpse before their <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dec. 17-18 meeting</a>, the Fed’s last policy meeting of 2024. It will shape how officials understand the economy as they release both a rate decision and a fresh set of forecasts predicting how much they will cut borrowing costs in 2025.</p><div><p>Fed officials are unlikely to hang their entire decision on this one job market report: Hiring data have been muddled by strikes and hurricanes, which is likely to make the numbers tough to read. And officials are also focused on what is happening with inflation. A fresh <a href="https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Consumer Price Index</a> report is set for release on Dec. 11.</p><p>But Friday’s figures do matter, in part because this is the last major data point officials will receive before they enter their pre-meeting blackout period, during which officials do not speak in public about their outlook for interest rates.</p><p>If joblessness holds steady, for instance, that would be encouraging news for central bankers and a sign that they do not need to rush to slash borrowing costs. If it picks up, that could argue for faster rate cuts. And if the job market seems to be accelerating at a time when the broader economy is also strong, that could argue for a slower pace of rate cuts going forward.</p><p>“The unemployment rate might matter — that&#39;s less directly impacted by hurricanes and strikes,” said Julia Coronado, founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives.</p><p>The Fed raised its policy rate to about 5.3 percent in 2022 and 2023 and then held it there for more than a year in a bid to slow the economy and bring rapid price increases under control. But inflation has come down meaningfully, so officials began to lower the rate in September. They cut it for a second time in November, to a range of 4.5 to 4.75 percent.</p><p>The economy, though, has been more resilient than policymakers had expected and inflation has proved slightly sticky in recent months, which has called into question how much and how quickly rates will fall.</p><p>Ms. Coronado said she thinks that the Fed is likely to cut rates at its meeting this month, but that it will simultaneously dial back its forecast for reductions in 2025. Officials had predicted four rate cuts in 2025 back in September, but she said that they could drop that to three, or even two.</p><p>Of course, if a strong economy were to deter Fed officials from cutting interest rates as much as they otherwise would have next year, that could put the central bank on a crash course with the incoming administration.</p><p>Donald J. Trump, the president-elect, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/economy/trump-federal-reserve-powell-interest-rates.html" title="">has a track record</a> of pushing for lower interest rates — and blasting the Fed on social media and in public when it fails to deliver them.</p><p>But the Fed is independent of politics, and its officials regularly say that they set rates solely based on what they see and expect to see in the economy.</p><p>Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/dealbook/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-inflation.html" title="">said during an interview</a> at The New York Times’s DealBook Summit this week that “we’re in a very good place with the economy,” noting that growth had been stronger and the unemployment rate was still at a “very, very low level.”</p><p>Compared with when the Fed began to cut rates in September, “the labor market is better, and the downside risks appear to be less, in the labor market,” Mr. Powell said, explaining that the Fed could be more “cautious” with its moves.</p></div></div>
