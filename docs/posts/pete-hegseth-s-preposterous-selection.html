The implication seemed to be that, since good and honorable had failed, it was time to try something else.</p><p>Hegseth <em>is</em> something else. As has been widely reported, in 2020 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/police-report-sexual-assault-claim-hegseth.html" title="">he paid off a woman</a> who filed a police report accusing him of sexual assault. (He insists they had consensual sex.) As Jane Mayer <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/pete-hegseths-secret-history" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> in The New Yorker, Hegseth “was forced to step down by both of the two nonprofit advocacy groups that he ran — Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America — in the face of serious allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety and personal misconduct.” His own mother <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/us/politics/pete-hegseth-mother-email.html" title="">wrote</a>, in an email obtained by The New York Times, that he<strong> “</strong>belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego.<strong>”</strong> (She has since disavowed that message.)</p><p>But this is Trump’s America; abusing and degrading women is obviously not disqualifying for high office. As Democratic Senate aides <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/inside-the-senate-battle-over-pete-hegseths-nomination.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> New York magazine’s Rebecca Traister, success in the hearings<strong> </strong>“would mean not leaning in on the rape allegations and instead creating space to oppose him on grounds that Republicans can also oppose him on.<strong>”</strong> Much of the hearing on Tuesday seemed to involve a search for those grounds, but it’s not clear they exist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Several Democrats focused on Hegseth’s insulting comments about female troops, perhaps hoping they could reach Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican who is a veteran and an advocate for women in the military. (“We need moms,” Hegseth <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pete-hegseth-background-defense-secretary-confirmation-hearing-e160e10c86385a8beff110d9190fb34e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in one of his books</a>. “But not in the military, especially in combat units.”)</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
