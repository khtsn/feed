    <h1>Israeli Military Forces Patients and Staff to Leave Hospital in Northern Gaza</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Israeli military forced patients and staff members to leave one of the last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza on Friday, leaving health officials in the territory concerned for the people who had been getting treatment there amid continued fighting.</p><p>The hospital, Kamal Adwan, has been caught in the middle of Israel’s offensive against Hamas militants in the northern part of Gaza, and fighting has raged around the facility for nearly three months.</p><p>In a statement, the Israeli military said that the hospital was a stronghold for Hamas and that it was carrying out “targeted operations” in the area. It added that soldiers had evacuated medical staff and patients from the facility “in order to mitigate harm to the civilian population in the area.”</p><p>The Gaza health ministry said the Israeli military was forcing sick and wounded people to move to another nearby hospital, which it said lacked medical supplies, water and electricity.</p></div></div>
