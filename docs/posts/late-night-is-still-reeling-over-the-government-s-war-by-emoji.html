This week, in the race between dumb and evil, dumb’s in the lead.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“At first, Goldberg was concerned that it might be a hoax. But he got a hint it might be real when he was added to a text chain called ‘Houthi PC small group.’ Turns out it was real and that ‘Houthi’ is short for ‘Houthis idiots running our government?’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“And they should’ve known someone from The Atlantic was there, because after 10 messages, Goldberg chimed in to say: ‘You’ve reached your free article limit. Please log in to continue.’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“And by the way, it wasn’t even Pete Hegseth who added him, it was some other incompetent guy at the highest levels of government, OK? Like, what, you think Hegseth has the editor of The Atlantic magazine saved in his phone? No way, all right? If Hegseth auto-filled a contact into a group chat, it would be like, ‘Tampa Bay Blonde With Bugs Bunny Tattoo.’” <em>— RONNY CHIENG</em></p><p>“Apparently, the reporter was mistakenly added to the group chat by Trump’s national security adviser. This adviser can’t catch a break. Today, he sat down and butt-dialed the nuclear codes to North Korea.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“And even if they didn’t accidentally add a journalist into this group chat, they weren’t supposed to be talking about this stuff on Signal in the first place, OK? Signal might be a good app for you and me and our local drug dealer, but it’s not for the Pentagon to plan wars on.” <em>— RONNY CHIENG</em></p><p>“Today Trump said it’ll never happen again, and from now on they’ll only talk about war plans over Snapchat.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-4aa0f1ec">The Punchiest Punchlines (Meat Loaf Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“It’s a pretty epic blunder. Today, Trump gave it four out of five Giulianis.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Yep, Trump called the massive leak of classified information a ‘glitch,’ which feels sort of like Boeing referring to a door flying off as ‘a little oopsie.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“President Trump — he claims he’s perfectly OK with it. He says he’s not planning to fire anybody. He says mistakes were made. What happened to this guy? He used to fire people on a daily — he fired Meat Loaf for less than this. Firing used to be his favorite thing. It’s kind of sad. He’s like an old dog who doesn’t chase the ball anymore.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“I don’t know if he’s enjoying this, which is possible. I mean, he does love tumult, and for once, he’s not the one who screwed it up.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>On Tuesday&#39;s “Tonight Show,” Naomi Watts talked about working with her late mentor and friend David Lynch.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-1f978490">What We’re Excited About on Wednesday Night</h2><p>The “White Lotus” star Michelle Monaghan will appear on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fanny, an all-female band that released five albums and had two Top 40 hits, will receive Lincoln Center’s inaugural American Songbook Award.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Putland/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
