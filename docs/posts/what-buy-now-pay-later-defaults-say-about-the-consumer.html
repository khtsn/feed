That’s in jeopardy as President Trump has essentially tried to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/business/cfpb-layoffs-trump-musk-doge.html" title="">dismantle the watchdog</a>, Grady McGregor reports.</p><p><strong>The context:</strong> Pay-later borrowing in the United States has soared rapidly, with American consumers taking out more than <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/business/buy-now-pay-later-services-shopping-dg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$75 billion</a> worth of these loans in 2023. But as household finances deteriorate, buy-now-pay-never fears have grown; <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/personal/buy-now-pay-later-loan-statistics/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">late payments were on the rise</a> over the past year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee plan to intervene, </strong>some<strong> </strong>with knowledge of the matter told DealBook. Concerned about rising defaults, they intend to call for more oversight of pay-later lenders, including pushing for more robust reporting on their loan losses.</p><p>The consumer bureau did not respond to a request for comment about the Democrats’ plan.</p><p><strong>Pay-later lenders see no reason for alarm.</strong> That’s despite Klarna, one of the biggest providers, reporting a <a href="https://s205.q4cdn.com/644747736/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-25-Klarna-Earnings-Release.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">17 percent year-on-year rise</a> in credit losses this month. The company — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/technology/tariffs-digital-commerce.html" title="">paused its I.P.O. plans</a> amid tariff-related market volatility — acknowledged that its losses were growing, but said that its default rate rose only marginally and represented a tiny share of its total loans. “There’s nothing troubling or worrisome from this data,” Clare Nordstrom, a spokeswoman, told DealBook.</p><p>Affirm, one of Klarna’s rivals, had a similar response: “We really aren’t seeing anything we would label as signs of stress with our borrowers,” said Rob O’Hare, its C.F.O.</p><p><strong>Recent data suggests otherwise.</strong> In January, in the final days of the Biden administration, the consumer bureau released <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-research-reveals-heavy-buy-now-pay-later-use-among-borrowers-with-high-credit-balances-and-multiple-pay-in-four-loans/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a study</a> that found that nearly two-thirds of pay-later loans went to borrowers with risky credit scores. “Americans were using ‘buy now, pay later’ as a Band-Aid on top of their credit card debt,” said Julie Margetta Morgan, a former bureau official who is now president of the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank.</p><p>“We look at it as a kind of bellwether of risks to the overall economy,” she added.</p><p><strong>The Trump administration has upended oversight of the industry. </strong>This month, the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-announcement-regarding-enforcement-actions-related-to-buy-now-pay-later-loans/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bureau announced</a> that it would not enforce a Biden-era rule that sought to treat pay-later lenders like credit card companies, such as by requiring them to provide monthly billing statements to customers and to offer protections to customers seeking refunds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-to-ensure-consumers-can-dispute-charges-and-obtain-refunds-on-buy-now-pay-later-loans/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rule was adopted last year</a> after a <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/consumer-use-of-buy-now-pay-later-and-other-unsecured-debt/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lengthy investigation</a> into pay-later lenders. The industry objected, arguing that the loans finance relatively small purchases, and that the rule would <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/CFPB-2024-0017-0015" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confuse customers</a>. A trade association representing fintech companies had <a href="https://www.ftassociation.org/fta-statement-on-bnpl-interpretive-rule-lawsuit/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued the bureau last fall</a>, seeking the rule’s withdrawal.</p><p><strong>Critics say the lesser oversight comes at a fraught moment,</strong> especially as <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. household finances are worsening</a>.</p><p>“Consumers are going to be squeezed and more reliant on these products,” Morgan said, “and the companies are being offered a free pass to construct those products in ways that are the most profitable to them.”</p><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>A tax provision in the Republican spending bill is alarming Wall Street.</strong> Section 899 of the legislation would give the government <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b400009a-9a0e-4ee0-b6ed-2a25c2de0d8f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leeway to impose an additional tax</a> on foreign investors and companies connected to countries that Washington deems to have hostile tax regimes. The concern is that the move could chill investment in the United States at a time when investors are already rethinking the “buy America” trade amid President Trump’s tariff war.</p><p><strong>Inflation is back in focus on Friday.</strong> The Personal Consumption Expenditures report for April is expected to show that price increases have cooled somewhat, with economists forecasting that headline <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/economy/forecasts-april-pce-report-show-another-good-month-inflation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inflation grew 2.2 percent</a> on an annualized basis. But even at that level, the Fed is expected to keep interest rates on hold for the foreseeable future — which continues to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/politics/trump-powell-meeting-fed-economy.html" title="">rankle Trump</a> — as it watches the effect of tariffs on growth and inflation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Is somebody trying to impersonate Susie Wiles?</strong> Federal authorities are reportedly investigating a series of suspicious phone calls and text messages that purportedly came from a person <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/federal-authorities-probe-effort-to-impersonate-white-house-chief-of-staff-65da0d59?mod=hp_lead_pos3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claiming to be the White House chief of staff</a>, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing “people familiar with the matter.” It appears as though Wiles, who has deep connections in Republican circles, had her personal phone hacked, and that the impersonator may have used artificial intelligence to imitate her voice.</p><h2 id="link-5de276e2">C.E.O. gloom </h2><p>Even as consumer confidence wavered in recent quarters, American business leaders found reason for optimism. That C-suite exceptionalism appears to have faded though as President Trump’s trade war and economic slowdown concerns now predominate.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/topics/CEO-Confidence/press/CEO-confidence-Q2-2025#:~:text=CEOs&#39;%20assessment%20of%20general%20economic,%2C%20down%20significantly%20from%2044%25." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest report</a> by the Conference Board and the Business Council shows one of the biggest drops in C.E.O. confidence on record. The closely followed tally recorded that C.E.O. confidence in the second quarter dropped to 34 — (a score below 50 reflects a pessimistic mood) — from 60 in the previous quarter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><strong>“All components of the measure weakened into pessimism territory,”</strong> Stephanie Guichard, a senior economist at the Conference Board, wrote in a statement. “C.E.O.s’ views about current economic conditions led the plunge, registering the largest quarter-on-quarter decline in almost 50 years.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>She added: “Expectations for the future also plummeted, with more than half of C.E.O.s now expecting conditions to worsen over the next six months, both for the economy overall and in their own industries.”</p><p><strong>This shouldn’t come as a big surprise.</strong> This past earnings season, corporate chiefs told analysts that tariff uncertainty had essentially paralyzed their business plans. A string of companies, including Mattel, Ford and Marriott <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-tariffs-trade-war-05-09-2025/card/ford-marriott-mattel-a-look-at-companies-that-pulled-or-cut-guidance-this-week-d0VL1zxfa18Mh3fZQF2t" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pulled or lowered their guidance</a>. Walmart said that the levies would most likely force it to raise prices, drawing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/us/politics/trump-walmart-eat-the-tariffs-prices.html" title="">an all-caps rebuke from Trump</a>.</p><p><strong>The upshot:</strong> A majority of corporate bosses plan to freeze hiring and reassess investment, the survey found. The share of C.E.O.s expecting to increase their work force declined to 28 percent, from 32 percent. On capital spending, 26 percent plan to revise down those capital expenditures budgets; last quarter, 13 percent said the same.</p><p>Perhaps more ominously, 71 percent of respondents said they were bracing for “a brief and shallow U.S. recession” over the next 12 to 18 months. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-414b2eaf">What’s next for tariffs? </h2><p>An appeals court on Thursday <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/blocked-trump-tariffs-trade-court-appeal.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">temporarily preserved</a> many of President Trump’s tariffs, reversing Wednesday’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/business/economy/trump-tariffs-ruling-businesses.html" title="">landmark decision by a trade court</a>. More challenges are likely, however, compounding the trade war uncertainty.</p><p><strong>A recap:</strong> Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), to impose some of his broadest tariffs, an act that the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled illegal. The issue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/politics/trump-tariffs-trade-strategy.html" title="">could ultimately reach the Supreme Court</a>.</p><p><strong>In the meantime, Trump has other tools to impose tariffs. </strong>They’re narrower than IEEPA, but they could face less legal pushback “than stretching to use IEEPA as a shortcut to imposing tariffs,” Michael Froman, president of the Council on Foreign Relations who was a U.S. trade representative under President Barack Obama, told DealBook.</p><p><strong>Trump’s options include:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Sector-specific tariffs, </strong>building on the ones he’s already imposed. Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and cars and auto parts, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, are not affected by Wednesday’s court ruling. Trump could add other sectors under 232, such as pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Country-specific tariffs</strong>, under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. This would require opening unfair-trade investigations against trading partners. Typically, these would involve public hearings, and take months. </p></li><li><p><strong>Temporary broad tariffs </strong>under Section 122 of the same 1974 trade law, which allows for the imposition of limited levies of up to 15 percent. After 150 days, these tariffs would expire, unless Congress extends them.</p></li></ul><p>The 301 and 122 options reportedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-trade-tariff-strategy-pivot-bfe11596?mod=hp_lead_pos1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">feature prominently in the White House’s thinking</a> as the administration plots next steps, The Wall Street Journal reports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>Refunds could be on the table</strong>, depending on how the litigation pans out. The United States would have to reimburse billions of dollars, <em>plus interest</em>, to companies that have paid the levies. Dan Ujczo, senior counsel at Thompson Hine, said that many of his clients had filed for reimbursements after Trump eased some tariffs on China this month.</p><p>Still, “this is going to be a large undertaking to refund anything that came into the door, potentially back to February,” Ujczo told DealBook.</p><p><strong>What does this mean for trade negotiations?</strong> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News on Thursday that talks with Beijing were “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/30/us-china-talks-bit-stalled-and-need-trump-and-xi-to-weigh-in-treasury-secretary-bessent-says.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a bit stalled</a>,” and that reviving them may require a conversation between Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.</p><p>The legal uncertainty hanging over the tariffs may put the Trump team at a disadvantage, especially if their counterparts decide to drag their feet. “The pressure for big concessions to avoid extreme outcomes has gone down,” Brad Setser, an economist and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told DealBook.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-2954e3c9">“This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way.
