On Friday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/us/politics/nancy-pelosi-hospitalized-luxembourg-falling.html" title="">she tripped and fell</a> while going down marble stairs at the Grand Ducal Palace, according to a person familiar with the incident who was not authorized to comment and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>People close to Ms. Pelosi said at the time that she had fractured her hip in the accident, though it was not immediately clear if she would be treated in Europe or the United States. Her spokesman’s statement indicated that her surgery ultimately had taken place at a U.S. military base in Germany.</p></div></div>
