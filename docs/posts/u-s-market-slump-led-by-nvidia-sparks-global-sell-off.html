On Tuesday, the semiconductor giant’s stock plunged nearly 10 percent, erasing some $279 billion in market value, the biggest one-day decline for a U.S. stock on record.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A report released by the Labor Department on Wednesday showed that job openings in the United States fell below expectations in July, to 7.7 million, a decrease from a downwardly revised 7.9 million the previous month. It was another sign of the labor market cooling, a source of anxiety for investors monitoring the health of the U.S. economy. </p><p>U.S. Treasury yields fell after the report, as traders bet that the Federal Reserve would announce a potentially bigger interest rate cut than had been expected when officials meet next week.</p><p>“The markets may not be as nervous as they were a month ago, but they’re still looking for confirmation the economy isn’t cooling off too much,” Chris Larkin, head of trading and investing at E-Trade, said in a statement. “So far this week, they haven’t gotten it.”</p><p>Benchmark indexes in Japan and Taiwan dropped more than 4 percent on Wednesday. South Korea’s Kospi index fell 3 percent and stocks in Shanghai and Shenzen also dipped. Trading in Europe followed a similar pattern, with the Stoxx 600, which tracks shares across the continent, down 1 percent.</p><p>Oil prices have also fallen sharply, reflecting broader unease about the global economy. Brent crude, the international benchmark, slipped to its lowest point of the year, at about $72 a barrel on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The reaction in global markets shows that investors are still jittery weeks after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/business/global-stocks.html" title="">market meltdown</a> in early August, when fears about a slowdown in the U.S. economy snowballed into a global rout.</p><p>A series of economic data points since then has eased concerns about a potential recession in the United States, and stocks had rebounded sharply in recent weeks.</p><p>That rise ruptured on Tuesday.</p><p>The sell-off predominantly affected technology and semiconductor stocks, mirroring the declines seen in major U.S. tech companies such as Nvidia.</p><p>The Japanese chip equipment maker Tokyo Electron fell more than 8 percent on Wednesday, while the technology investor SoftBank was down nearly 8 percent. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company saw a decline of more than 5 percent. ASML, a Dutch manufacturer of chip-making equipment, fell more than 6 percent.</p><p>In a report this week, analysts at the Bank of America said it expected the global economy to grow 3.1 percent this year, a slightly slower pace than it had earlier predicted. The bank said it expected the United States to avoid a recession but took a less positive view of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/business/china-economy-consumption.html" title="">China</a>, downgrading its growth estimate and calling government policies insufficient to stimulate demand.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Investors in the United States and elsewhere are awaiting the U.S. Labor Department’s August jobs report, scheduled for release on Friday.</p><p>Anticipation of that report has reignited concerns about a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy. It could also provide clues about how aggressive the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/business/economy/pce-inflation-fed-interest-rate.html" title="">Fed</a> will be in its expected interest rate cut later this month.</p><p>Michael J. de la Merced<!-- --> contributed reporting from London.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
