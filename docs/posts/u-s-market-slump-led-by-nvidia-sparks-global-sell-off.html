On Tuesday, the semiconductor giant’s stock plunged nearly 10 percent, erasing some $279 billion in market value, the biggest one-day decline for a U.S. stock on record.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Benchmark indexes in Japan and Taiwan dropped more than 4 percent. South Korea’s Kospi index fell 3 percent and stocks in Shanghai and Shenzen also dipped. Trading in Europe followed a similar pattern, with the Stoxx 600, which tracks shares across the continent, down 1 percent.</p><p>Oil prices have also fallen sharply, reflecting broader unease about the global economy. Brent crude, the international benchmark, slipped to its lowest point of the year, at just over $73 a barrel on Wednesday.</p><p>The reaction in global markets shows that investors are still jittery weeks after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/business/global-stocks.html" title="">market meltdown</a> in early August, when fears about a slowdown in the U.S. economy snowballed into a global rout.</p><p>A series of economic data points since then has eased concerns about a potential recession in the United States, and stocks had rebounded sharply in recent weeks.</p><p>That rise ruptured on Tuesday.</p><p>The sell-off predominantly affected technology and semiconductor stocks, mirroring the declines seen in major U.S. tech companies such as Nvidia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Japanese chip equipment maker Tokyo Electron fell more than 8 percent on Wednesday, while the technology investor SoftBank was down nearly 8 percent. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company saw a decline of more than 5 percent. ASML, a Dutch manufacturer of chip-making equipment, fell more than 6 percent.</p><p>In a report this week, analysts at the Bank of America said it expected the global economy to grow 3.1 percent this year, a slightly slower pace than it had earlier predicted. The bank said it expected the United States to avoid a recession but took a less positive view of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/business/china-economy-consumption.html" title="">China</a>, downgrading its growth estimate and calling government policies insufficient to stimulate demand.</p><p>Investors in the United States and elsewhere are awaiting the U.S. Labor Department’s August jobs report, scheduled for release on Friday.</p><p>Anticipation of that report has reignited concerns about a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy. It could also provide clues about how aggressive the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/business/economy/pce-inflation-fed-interest-rate.html" title="">Federal Reserve</a> will be in its expected interest rate cut later this month.</p><p>Michael J. de la Merced<!-- --> contributed reporting from London.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div><div><p>River Akira Davis covers Japan, including its economy and businesses, and is based in Tokyo.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/river-akira-davis">More about River Akira Davis</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/09/03/business/stocks-us-economy-nvidia.html">4</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
