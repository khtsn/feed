He filled Manhattan galleries with sex dolls and live tiger cubs. Wealthy collectors bought his work. Norwegian curators wrote that he was <a href="https://www.munchmuseet.no/en/exhibitions/archive/2015/melgaard--munch/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this generation’s answer to Edvard Munch</a>.</p><p>But there was a darker side to Melgaard’s practice, and a lengthy addiction to crystal meth and other drugs that he said encouraged impulsive behavior.</p><p>He acquired mink coats he could not afford. His production studio in New York collapsed and a former employee <a href="https://cultbytes.com/the-backstory-bjarne-melgaards-former-studio-manager-nicholas-cueva-just-called-him-out/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused him of withholding wages</a>, which he said was caused by a delay from his investors.

They paid him nearly $10 million from 2008 to 2020 in exchange for artwork, both sides said, a relationship that lasted through more than a dozen agreements despite the artist’s continual money trouble.</p><p>In 2020, Melgaard signed the Main Agreement, which outlined financial terms between the two parties going forward. But in an attempt to void the contract, Melgaard filed a lawsuit last year arguing that Grande and Lie had verbally pressured him with misleading details about his debts. Lie countersued, saying that Melgaard had breached the Main Agreement.</p><p>Now the future of the artist’s career could be in the hands of a Norwegian court, which will begin hearing the case on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Main Agreement was supposed to be a lifesaver, absolving Melgaard of nearly $16 million that Grande and Lie said he owed them, according to Melgaard’s lawsuit, in addition to nearly $500,000 for unpaid studio rent, American taxes and a book project. (A lawyer for the investors said they did not name a specific amount.)</p><p>But Melgaard said in an interview with The New York Times that he felt pressure to sign the contract and did so while drunk, only realizing later what he had signed away: ownership of hundreds of paintings and thousands of prints; the rights to produce a series of sculptures; and the ability to oppose sales of his own work. The value of the forfeited art trove <a href="https://www.vg.no/spesial/2023/melgaard/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been estimated at millions of dollars</a>, according to emails from Tim Smith, his studio manager at the time, that are included in Melgaard’s lawsuit.</p><p>“My biggest mistake is the same one that most artists make,” Melgaard, 57, said during a video interview from his studio in Oslo. “You would do just about anything for your art.”</p><p>In aviator sunglasses and a bleached buzz cut, he appeared restless, clutching the lapel of his denim jacket, which obscured the words printed on his shirt: “I ruined my own life.”</p><h2 id="link-7973c541">Modern-Day Patronage</h2></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Melgaard said he was pressured to sign the contract with his two investors when he was drunk.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David B.

That was when influential families like the Medici clan financed Florence’s most famous artists, including Botticelli and Michelangelo.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Grande and Lie aspired to that kind of relationship with Melgaard, who was connected to them when he moved from Barcelona to Oslo in 2008; Grande ran a transport company and Lie had earned a small fortune selling bed duvets. The friends struck a series of deals with Melgaard to finance his operations. According to his lawsuit, that initially included $20,000 a month to rent a large art studio in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick.</p><p>Despite the money provided by his backers, Melgaard continued to overspend, leaving him with large debts that he believed would be covered by his investors. The Main Agreement was supposed to clear the air.</p><p>But Melgaard said that signing the contract, which also authorized a proxy to sign prints with his name, was a mistake.</p><p>“If you see the contract that I signed, you would realize that no person with a clear mind would sign it,” Melgaard said.</p><p>Melgaard also said in his lawsuit that the investors had watered down his market by selling copies of his artworks in nearly 40 galleries across Norway, creating such a high supply that prices have dropped. Some galleries sold editions of his sculptures in variations he never approved, he said, including a version of “Don’t Wanna See,” a depiction of a rat sitting on a concrete box, with a price of more than $42,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One version of “Don’t Wanna See” includes a wooden crate that is not part of Melgaard’s original sculpture.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via FLØ</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Lie and Grande did not respond to those assertions about his artwork, but in a written statement to The Times, they said the evidence would dispel Melgaard’s claims.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Bjarne Melgaard is a fantastic artist but with limited abilities to convey facts,” they wrote. “These are agreements that Bjarne himself has initiated, but which he is now trying to escape in order to evade a significant debt burden from the U.S.A. and Norway after two decades of reckless and uncontrolled spending.”</p><p>The investors have also said, in a legal filing, that Melgaard owed his international reputation to their money.
