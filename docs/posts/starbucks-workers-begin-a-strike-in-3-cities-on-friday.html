If the company raised wages by more than that — as it did this year, with a recently announced increase of 2 percent — unionized workers would get the higher amount.</p><p>Andrew Trull, a Starbucks spokesman, said union delegates “prematurely ended” this week’s negotiations. “It is disappointing they didn’t return to the table given the progress we’ve made to date,” he added.</p><p>The two sides have been bargaining a national contract framework during monthly sessions since April. They have reached more than two dozen tentative agreements on a variety of issues, including health and safety, attendance policies and ensuring that workers can be fired only for just cause.</p><p>The union workers will also receive <a href="https://about.starbucks.com/press/2024/message-from-brian-making-starbucks-the-best-job-in-retail/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an expansion of paid parental leave</a> that Starbucks recently announced for all workers; union members say the announcement appeared to be a response to a demand the union made during bargaining.</p><p>While Starbucks workers have waged one- and two-day strikes since they began to unionize in the fall of 2021, the latest action could see workers at dozens or even hundreds of stores walk off the job for longer periods. The union said the strike would end within five days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The company had largely resisted the union’s organizing efforts for more than two years until February, when it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/business/economy/starbucks-workers-united-union.html" title="">sought a peace deal</a> of sorts that would establish a process for workers to unionize without opposition from the company, and another process for bargaining contracts at hundreds of stores. The two sides also agreed to try to resolve litigation that had been filed during the fight.</p><p>The decision to engage with the union was made by the company’s former chief executive, Laxman Narasimhan, who faced pressure from a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/business/starbucks-union-workers-boycott.html" title="">union-backed campaign</a> to elect three new candidates to the company’s board, as well as from boycotts and protests tied to the war between Israel and Palestinians.</p><p>Mr. Narasimhan said on <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/starbucks-sbux-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an earnings call</a> in January that the protests were having a “negative impact” on the company financially despite being “driven by misperceptions” that the company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/briefing/starbucks-union-labor-contract.html" title="">was hostile to Palestinians</a> and their supporters.</p><p>Starbucks ousted Mr. Narasimhan in August and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/business/starbucks-ceo-brian-niccol-chipotle.html" title="">replaced him</a> with Brian Niccol, the former chief executive of Chipotle. Mr. Niccol <a href="https://one.starbucks.com/negotiations/starbucks-reaffirms-commitment-to-advancing-the-path-forward-with-workers-united/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote a letter</a> to the union in September saying he was “committed to making sure we engage constructively and in good faith.” But union members involved in the bargaining say the momentum slowed somewhat during the fall.</p><p>“Our C.E.O. Brian doesn’t know what it’s like to preside over the company while it’s fighting with us,” said a Starbucks barista and bargaining delegate, Silvia Baldwin, on a call open to supporters and the media on Thursday night.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“It was pretty clear very quickly that we were going to have to remind him or teach him what that looks like.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Noam Scheiber is a Chicago-based reporter who covers workers and the workplace.
