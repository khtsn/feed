Just since Donald Trump’s election, Musk’s personal net worth has grown <a href="https://x.com/peterbakernyt/status/1886872717393322407" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by far more</a> than the entire <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10261" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual budget</a> of U.S.A.I.D., which in any case accounts for less than 1 percent of the federal budget. It’s callous for gleeful billionaires like Musk and President Trump to cut children off from medicine, but, as President John F. Kennedy pointed out when he proposed the creation of the agency in 1961, it’s also myopic.</p><p>Cutting aid, Kennedy noted, “would be disastrous and, in the long run, more expensive.” He added: “Our own security would be endangered and our prosperity imperiled.”</p><p>Perhaps that’s why Russia has <a href="https://x.com/MedvedevRussiaE/status/1886330971160518961" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">praised</a> Trump’s move.</p><p>In contrast with Kennedy, the Trump administration braids together cruelty, ignorance and shortsightedness, and that combination seems particularly evident in its assault on American humanitarian assistance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>One person has already died of bird flu in the United States, and there is growing concern of a pandemic — yet Trump’s suspension of foreign aid has interrupted bird flu surveillance in 49 countries, <a href="https://globalhealth.org/media/global-health-council-urges-immediate-action-to-resume-life-saving-foreign-assistance-amid-uncertainty/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Global Health Council</a>, a U.S.-based nonprofit.</p><p>Remember the American panic over the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014? (Trump was <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/898317/trumps-2014-ebola-freakout-polar-opposite-coronavirus-response" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">particularly</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-behavior-during-ebola-2014-offered-preview-of-coronavirus-response-2020-5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hysterical</a> back then.) In the end, an Ebola pandemic was averted — in part because of U.S.A.I.D.’s work in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p><p>As it happens, another Ebola outbreak has just been reported in Uganda, with 234 contacts identified so far. U.S.A.I.D. would normally help suppress it — but now Trump and Musk have put it out of commission.</p><p>Another hemorrhagic fever, called Marburg virus, <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/marburg-virus-outbreak-tanzania-msf-responds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broke out</a> in Tanzania last month. Aid workers are rushing to contain the virus, but again Trump has made the United States AWOL, leaving the world a little more vulnerable.</p><p>A disclosure: In 2012, U.S.A.I.D. made some games for India and Africa based on a book my wife and I wrote, “Half the Sky.” U.S.A.I.D. did not pay us anything for this, and the games did a good job promoting deworming, girls’ education and safe pregnancy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>I’ve seen U.S.A.I.D. operate all over the world, and it’s a mixed picture. It is fair to complain that U.S.A.I.D. is endlessly bureaucratic and that too much of the aid goes to so-called Beltway bandit American contractors rather than to needy people abroad.</p><p>Yet there’s no basis for the White House mythology that U.S.A.I.D. is an enclave of woke waste, reflected in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgOa3LdkZ4k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump’s claim</a> that it spent about “$100 million on condoms to Hamas” (he doubled his previous claim of $50 million).</p><p>Hmm. Male condoms cost the U.S. government 3.3 cents each, so that would be three billion condoms. By my calculation, for Hamas to use up that many condoms in a year, each fighter would have to have sex 325 times a day, every day.</p><p>That might wipe out Hamas as a fighting force more effectively than Israeli bombardment.</p><p>In any case, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/29/gaza-condoms-fact-checker-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actual amount</a> of U.S. assistance spent on condoms for Gaza in recent years appears to have been not $100 million but $0.</p><p>Trump’s policies are as reckless as his rhetoric. I’d welcome some restructuring of U.S.A.I.D. But this isn’t restructuring but demolition — a blow to our values and interests alike.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Musk lambasted U.S.A.I.D. as “<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886102414194835755" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a criminal organization</a>.” In fact, many of its employees have risked their lives in the best tradition of public service. The <a href="https://afsa.org/sites/default/files/flipping_book/0524/77/#zoom=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S.A.I.D. Memorial Wall</a> honors 99 people killed while working for the agency in places such as Sudan, Haiti, Afghanistan and Ethiopia.</p><p>I’ve seen genuine improvements in U.S.A.I.D. over the years. Its public-private partnership to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/opinion/lead-poisoning-children-smart-science.html" title="">tackle lead poisoning</a>, announced last year, was a model of American leadership. And so from my travels, this is what U.S.A.I.D. has come to mean to me:</p><p>I’ve seen women and girls with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/opinion/obstetric-fistula-recovery.html" title="">obstetric fistula</a>, a horrific childbirth injury, get a $600 surgery that gives them back their lives — and this is something that U.S.A.I.D. supports.</p><p>I’ve seen men humiliated by elephantiasis and grotesquely enlarged scrotums, occasionally requiring a wheelbarrow to support their organs as they walk. And U.S.A.I.D. has fought this disease and made it less common.</p><p>I’ve seen children dying of malaria (and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/30/weekinreview/correspondence-sick-in-tokyo-i-lived-to-tell-about-japan-s-medical-miracle.html" title="">I’ve had malaria</a>), and I’ve seen U.S.A.I.D. help achieve major strides against the disease over the last two decades.</p><p>I’ve seen southern Africa ravaged by AIDS. And then President George W. Bush’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/08/opinion/aids-pepfar-bush.html" title="">landmark program</a> against AIDS, called PEPFAR and implemented in part through U.S.A.I.D., transformed the landscape. I saw coffin makers in Lesotho and Malawi grumble that their business was collapsing because far fewer people were dying. PEPFAR has <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/01/1159556#:~:text=More%20than%2026%20million%20lives,under%2015%20years%20of%20age" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saved 26 million lives so far</a>. (In the coming months, I’ll see if I can calculate how many lives are lost to Trump’s cuts in aid.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>I’ve seen the suffering of communities where people in middle age routinely go blind from trachoma, river blindness or cataracts — and the transformation when U.S.A.I.D. helps prevent such blindness.</p><p>Trump scoffed that U.S.A.I.D. was “run by radical lunatics.” Is it radical lunacy to try to save children’s lives? To promote literacy for girls? To fight blindness?</p><p>If this is woke, what about the evangelical Christians in <a href="https://www.ijm.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Justice Mission</a>, which, with U.S.A.I.D. support, has done outstanding work battling sex trafficking of children in Cambodia and the Philippines? Does Trump believe that rescuing children from rape is a radical lunatic cause?</p><p>Trump’s moves are of uncertain legality, not least because U.S.A.I.D. was established by Congress, but the outcomes are indisputable. Around the world children are already missing health care and food because of the assault on the agency that Kennedy founded to uphold our values and protect our interests.</p><p>To billionaires in the White House, it may seem like a game. But to anyone with a heart, it’s about children’s lives and our own security, and what’s unfolding is sickening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
