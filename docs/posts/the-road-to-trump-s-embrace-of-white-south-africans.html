The officials who might have rebuffed Mr. Trump’s ideas have been replaced by loyalists, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who are willing to turn his impulses into policy.</p><p>And a conversation with the renowned South African golfer Gary Player stayed on Mr. Trump’s mind.</p><p>When Mr. Trump raised the issue of white farmers in the Situation Room, Mr. Bolton recalled that the president, while practicing his swing with Mr. Player, had heard that the Afrikaners were being “driven from their land.” Two other former administration officials also said Mr. Trump had heard about the struggle of Afrikaners from Mr. Player.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South African golfer Gary Player with Senator Lindsey Graham, after they spent a day golfing with Mr. Trump in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Susan Walsh/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In February, Mr. Player said he had “not even once” spoken to Mr. Trump about U.S. policies in South Africa.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I’m a big Trump fan, but I can’t get involved with politics,” Mr. Player said, adding, “Donald Trump’s going to make the decisions about South Africa.

Instead, they reiterated their concerns about the Afrikaners.</p><p>“Afrikaner refugees who arrived in the United States today shared their harrowing stories of discrimination and persecution in South Africa, including violent attacks, vandalism of property, death threats, racial slurs against farmers, songs calling for the death of all Afrikaners, affirmative action laws that prevent many from finding work and a government that, at a minimum, did not respond to their requests for help,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a statement on Monday. “It’s truly sad The New York Times is attempting to minimize the suffering of this long-persecuted minority group.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Celebrating the inauguration of President Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria last June.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joao Silva/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>To Mr. Trump, South Africa is a cautionary tale for the United States.</p><p>In the 1990s, when one of his advisers mentioned a news item projecting that nonwhite people could become the majority in the United States, Mr. Trump shot back that there would be a revolution should that happen. “This isn’t going to become South Africa,”<span>  </span>he said, according to a book about the president, “Confidence Man,” by Maggie Haberman, a New York Times reporter.</p><p>Years later, in August 2018, one of Mr. Trump’s favorite newscasters crystallized his views of South Africa. Tucker Carlson, a Fox News host at the time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EThwj4NtnvU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that South Africa’s president</a> had begun “seizing land from his own citizens” under a new law that Mr. Carlson called “the definition of racism.”</p><p>“Racism is what our elites say they hate most — Donald Trump is a racist they say — but they pay no attention to this at all,” Mr. Carlson said.</p><p>Within hours of the newscast, Mr. Trump had fired off a <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1032454567152246785" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweet</a> claiming that there was “large-scale killing” of white farmers in South Africa, and that he had directed the State Department to “closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations.”</p><p>“South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers,” he wrote, tagging the accounts of Fox News and Mr. Carlson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>With that comment, Mr. Trump had weighed in on an issue at the root of tensions in South Africa for generations.</p><p>For nearly five decades, South Africa lived under the Afrikaner-led apartheid government, which violently segregated the Black majority, denying them access to quality housing, education and land, and the ability to build generational wealth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People lining up to vote in Soweto in April 1994, in the first free elections in South Africa following the end of apartheid.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Denis Farrell/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Since the end of apartheid in 1994, the government has made efforts to undo the economic imbalance created by the system, including through a program created to redistribute land to Black South Africans that had been seized by the former colonial and apartheid governments.</p><p>But Black South Africans continue to lag behind white South Africans by virtually every economic measure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>President Cyril Ramaphosa this year signed a law enabling the government to take private land without compensation when it is deemed to be in the public interest. Legal experts say that uncompensated seizures are likely to be rare — the government has long purchased land from white farmers. The law also includes a judicial process that gives landowners an opportunity to challenge seizures.</p><p>Despite Mr. Trump’s statement, white South Africans still dominate landownership. White-owned farms occupy about half of South Africa’s surface area, even as white people make up just 7 percent of the population.</p><p>While gruesome killings of white farmers in South Africa have captured national attention, police statistics show that the farmers are no more vulnerable to violent crime than other people in the nation.</p><p>A State Department report on South Africa in the first Trump administration said that “farm killings represented only 0.2 percent of all killings in the country.” Those killings have remained minuscule in the years since.</p><p>South Africa’s governing party, the African National Congress, has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid.<span>  </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mural in the Alexandra section of Johannesburg in 2014.

Boer means farmer in Dutch and Afrikaans. The African National Congress distanced itself from the chant years ago.</p><p>After lobbying for decades to gain allies in Washington, the Afrikaners finally found the most powerful one in Mr. Trump.</p><p>Ernst Roets, a prominent Afrikaner activist who has been featured on Mr. Carlson’s show, said activists have long wanted U.S. leaders to put more pressure on South Africa.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“South Africa is changing,” he said, “and the American administration has taken note of this.”</p><h2 id="link-bccb626">Divisions Erupt, and the Ambassador Is Expelled</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has amplified misinformation about a “genocide of white people.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Mr. Trump wasted no time resurrecting the Afrikaner issue when he returned to office this year.</p><p>And he was no longer surrounded by officials willing to limit his fringe ideas to social media.</p><p>Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire who has become a ubiquitous presence in Mr. Trump’s second term, has made baseless claims on social media about a “genocide of white people in South Africa.”</p><p>Just weeks after Mr. Trump was inaugurated, Mr. Rubio announced that he would skip a Group of 20 foreign ministers meeting in South Africa. He accused the South African government of using the occasion to promote “solidarity, equality and sustainability,” the official theme of this year’s G20. “In other words: D.E.I. and climate change,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Rubio and other Trump aides were particularly incensed that South Africa had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/world/middleeast/israel-icj-genocide-south-africa.html" title="">brought a genocide case</a> against Israel at the International Court of Justice.
