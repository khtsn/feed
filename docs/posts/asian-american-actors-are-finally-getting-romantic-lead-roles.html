And eventually, in 2022, he got to portray a gay Asian American man in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/02/movies/fire-island-review.html" title="">“Fire Island,”</a> a groundbreaking rom-com that he also wrote. “So much of that movie,” Booster said, “is just a literal transcript from my life.”</p><p>As it turned out, things did get a little better for Asian American men in Hollywood during the decade that Booster spent toiling. And he senses that the momentum has continued in the two years since “Fire Island” debuted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many of the newest Asian and Asian American stories seem unconcerned with “the white gaze,” he said. And so “the conversation has sort of moved on for a lot of people,” he said, adding that his movie “almost feels a little retrograde now.”</p><p>Indeed, since the 2018 blockbuster “Crazy Rich Asians” became <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1157858817/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a box office hit</a>, Asian and <a href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/news/research-and-impact/progress-what-progress-inclusion-hollywood-limited-and-lacking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asian American stories and characters have proliferated</a> in American pop culture. And after decades of degrading, often emasculating portrayals, Asian and Asian American men like Booster have been at the center of the new work, often playing the sort of hunky hero parts that Hollywood long kept out of reach.</p><p>The year “Crazy Rich Asians” premiered, HBO’s “Insecure” introduced Alexander Hodge as the romantic interest known as “<a href="https://www.verygoodlight.com/2020/05/06/insecures-alexander-hodge-is-grateful-to-be-your-asian-bae/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asian Bae</a>.” The next year Randall Park co-starred with Ali Wong in “Always Be My Maybe,”<em> </em>which Park and Wong co-wrote with Michael Golamco<em>.</em> And in 2021, Jimmy O. Yang starred in a Christmas rom-com, “Love Hard.”</p><p>Asian American men like Booster and Park have seized the moment to work behind the scenes, too. Park directed “Shortcomings,” the 2023 film that stars <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/09/movies/justin-h-min-shortcomings-beef-umbrella-academy.html" title="">Justin H. Min</a> as an angsty, flawed Asian American protagonist. And Sean Wang’s coming-of-age film “Dìdi” premiered this summer, offering a look at what it was like to grow up Asian American in the early days of social media amid California skateboard culture.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-3"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Netflix"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/29/multimedia/00asian-romance-STILL-01-fwqk/00asian-romance-STILL-01-fwqk-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/29/multimedia/00asian-romance-STILL-01-fwqk/00asian-romance-STILL-01-fwqk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Lucasfilm/Disney+"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/07/multimedia/00asian-romance-STILL-05-pzwg/00asian-romance-STILL-05-pzwg-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/07/multimedia/00asian-romance-STILL-05-pzwg/00asian-romance-STILL-05-pzwg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit="Sophie Mutevelian/Disney - Marvel Studios"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/29/multimedia/00asian-romance-STILL-03-fwqk/00asian-romance-STILL-03-fwqk-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/29/multimedia/00asian-romance-STILL-03-fwqk/00asian-romance-STILL-03-fwqk-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-3-" data-credit="Jeong Park/Searchlight Pictures/20th Century Studios/Hulu"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/29/multimedia/00asian-romance-STILL-02-fwqk/00asian-romance-STILL-02-fwqk-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/29/multimedia/00asian-romance-STILL-02-fwqk/00asian-romance-STILL-02-fwqk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left: Ali Wong and Randall Park in “Always Be My Maybe”; Manny Jacinto in “The Acolyte”; Joel Kim Booster in “Fire Island”; Kumail Nanjiani in “Eternals.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Clockwise from top left: Netflix; Lucasfilm/Disney+; Jeong Park/Searchlight Pictures/20th Century Studios/Hulu; Marvel Studios </span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Waves of representation can be cyclical, and those who study film and TV are quick to point out that representation is still lacking and that many of the characters who do manage to make it onscreen are often <a href="https://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/aii-inequality-in-1600-popular-films-20230811.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still marginalized in frustrating ways</a>.</p><p>But as the number of Asian Americans has risen across the United States and audience members have shown an appetite for their stories, many actors, writers and directors say it is clear that roles for Asian American men have evolved, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/movies/joy-ride-beef-shortcomings-asian-americans.html" title="">smattering of new, more nuanced</a> parts is helping to propel a shift in how Asian American men are perceived.</p><p>“All of us want to push that narrative of Asian males being more desirable,” said Manny Jacinto, who got his break playing a hot but dumb “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/what-is-the-asian-himbo-and-why-is-this-character-so-popular-nup3on/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">himbo</a>” on NBC’s “The Good Place” and is now gearing up to star as Lindsay Lohan’s husband <a href="https://ew.com/manny-jacinto-play-lindsay-lohans-freaky-friday-2-love-interest-8672236" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an upcoming “Freaky Friday” sequel</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/arts/manny-jacinto-the-acolyte.html" title="">after a stint in “The Acolyte”</a> as a Star Wars Sith Lord.</p><p>“And the thing is,” he continued, “those opportunities aren’t really being given to us.
