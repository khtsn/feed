Trump swept through Southern states on Saturday, outlining sharply divergent economic messages for voters in top battlegrounds and, in Mr. Trump’s case, solidly blue Virginia.</p><p>Mr. Trump, after a week in which controversies often overshadowed his closing argument, traveled to North Carolina and Virginia, where he gave rambling speeches in which he tried to turn the race back toward immigration, the economy and transgender issues.</p><p>Ms. Harris began her day at a rally in Atlanta, where she focused on her plans to bolster the economy, an approach that her advisers say has been intentional in the last days of a coin-flip race.</p><p>At an event that featured food trucks and a performance by the Georgia-born rapper 2 Chainz, she said her first goal as president would be “to bring down the cost of living for you” through tax cuts and measures like expanding Medicare to help cover home care. She emphasized that message soon after at a rally in Charlotte, N.C., saying that Mr. Trump would fight for “billionaires and big corporations.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump, in his speeches at an airport in Gastonia, N.C., and arenas in Salem, Va., and Greensboro, N.C., pounced on Friday’s labor report showing that employers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/business/economy/jobs-report-october.html" title="">added just 12,000 jobs last month</a>.</p><p>“These are depression numbers, I hate to tell you,” he said in Gastonia, wildly distorting the picture of what is actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/economy/economy-gdp-report.html" title="">a healthy economy</a> and leaving out that the latest figures were driven down by hurricanes and a labor strike.</p><p>In all three speeches, Mr. Trump characteristically interrupted that jobs-focused message with winding digressions, personal insults and occasional profanity.</p><p>At his rally in Greensboro, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/trump-harris-crude-remark.html" title="">he chuckled and signaled some approval</a> after a supporter shouted a crude joke insinuating that Ms. Harris had once been a prostitute.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Donald J.

In the morning, Air Force Two and what the former president’s team calls Trump Force One started virtually next to each other in Milwaukee. Later in the day, Ms. Harris’s plane landed in Charlotte, N.C., just a few hundred yards from where Mr. Trump’s plane was parked.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Then, on Sunday evening, Ms. Harris’s plane made a surprise detour to New York, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/us/politics/kamala-harris-snl.html" title="">she appeared on “Saturday Night Live.”</a></p><p>Ms. Harris’s final push in Georgia came a day after the state’s early-voting period ended. According to election officials, more than four million people in the state have already cast their ballots, a breathtaking figure in a place where just under five million people voted in 2020 — and where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-georgia.html" title="">fewer than 12,000 votes</a> decided that year’s outcome.</p><p>Onstage in Atlanta, Ms. Harris also spoke about reproductive rights, telling the crowd that Georgia, which has the most restrictive abortion law of any battleground state, had “a Trump abortion ban.”</p><p>“I pledge to seek common ground and common-sense solutions to the challenges you face,” she said. “I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump, as he often does, painted a hyperbolic and apocalyptic picture of the stakes.</p><p>“If Kamala is re-elected, every town in America will be turned into a squalid, dangerous refugee camp,” he said. “That’s what’s happening.”</p><p>Throughout Ms. Harris’s speeches, she urged supporters to make sure they voted and to encourage people they knew to do so as well. She especially focused on young and first-time voters. </p><p>Mr. Trump instructed his audience to drag people to the polls if it had to: “They’re couch potatoes? Get them off the couch.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Harris supporters at her event in Atlanta on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Even as both candidates push supporters to the polls, Democratic and Republican strategists alike have warned against over-interpreting early-voting data.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s newfound, if reluctant, embrace of early voting has appeared to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/trump-republicans-early-voting.html" title="">drive more Republicans nationally to cast ballots before Election Day</a>, and that trend has seemed to play out in Georgia since in-person voting began on Oct. 15.</p><p>Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in North Carolina every day until Election Day — a potentially defensive move in a state he won in both 2020 and 2016. On Sunday, he will travel to Kinston, a rural town in eastern North Carolina. And he will open Monday with a rally in Raleigh.</p><p>In Gastonia, a town of roughly 80,000 people about 20 miles west of Charlotte, Mr. Trump directly appealed to suburban women, saying that he believed they in particular needed to be protected “when they’re at home in suburbia” as he made exaggerated, fear-mongering depictions of America as being occupied by undocumented immigrants. He again compared migrants crossing the border to Hannibal Lecter, the cannibalistic serial killer from “The Silence of the Lambs.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Trump supporters during his event in Gastonia, N.C., on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Though his advisers have urged him to focus on the economy, Mr. Trump has seen fear-based appeals about immigration as a way to reach persuadable female voters in swing states. Of the battlegrounds expected to decide the election, North Carolina is the only one that Mr. Trump won in both 2016 and 2020, when he defeated Joseph R. Biden Jr. there by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-north-carolina.html" title="">1.3 percentage points</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Trump campaign also sees an advantage in stoking fear about transgender women and girls in female sports, which make up a significantly small fraction of the population, as a way to win over female voters.</p><p>In Virginia, Mr. Trump brought onstage members of the Roanoke College women’s swim team who had objected to a transgender athlete joining their team. Mr. Trump has made attacking transgender athletes a mainstay of his speeches, and the swimmers stood behind him in pink T-shirts that used an image of hot dog as a stand-in for genitalia and read, “Keep hot dogs out of women’s sports.”</p><p>Later, while praising Elon Musk, Mr. Trump described the mechanical arms that caught a SpaceX rocket booster as “like you grab your beautiful baby, your beautiful child, see?” He added: “In the old days, I would have said, ‘like you grab your girlfriend.’ Now I don’t say that anymore. I say, ‘like you grab your child.’”</p><p>Mr. Trump, who has faced a number of sexual misconduct allegations and was caught on a recording bragging about grabbing women by their genitals, is facing a widening gender gap, with polls showing likely female voters favoring Ms. Harris.</p><p>Indeed, in the final days of his campaign, Mr. Trump has been choosing to defend or participate in the sort of commentary that could alienate undecided voters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He continues to be dogged by criticism over his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/trump-liz-cheney-tucker-carlson.html" title="">violent language about former Representative Liz Cheney</a>; remarks he made about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/us/politics/trump-women-like-it-or-not.html" title="">protecting women “whether they like it or not”</a>; and fallout from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/trump-msg-rally.html" title="">racist jokes by a comedian at his rally</a> in New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump signing a vintage airplane in Gastonia, N.C., on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Calling in to Fox News before his rallies, Mr. Trump tried to defend himself on all three counts. He downplayed the seriousness of the comic calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage,” referring to him as “one comedian telling one little joke early in the show when nobody had even started going into the arena, practically.”</p><p>“He mentioned Puerto Rico, and they made it like a big deal,” Mr. Trump added.</p><p>President Biden also hit the campaign trail on Saturday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/us/elections/biden-scranton-harris-campaign.html" title="">making appearances in his hometown, Scranton, Pa.</a> The Harris campaign has not scheduled any more events with Ms. Harris appearing alongside Mr. Biden, a recognition of the president’s unpopularity and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/politics/biden-comments-harris-campaign.html" title="">his tendency to make verbal gaffes</a>. In Scranton, he largely stayed on message, although he did make one curious remark about Republicans who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, cut Social Security and reduce taxes for the wealthy.</p><p>“These are the kind of guys you’d like to smack in the ass,” Mr. Biden said.</p><p>On Saturday, the Harris campaign released what it called Ms. Harris’s “closing ad,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6bv6jYEVAs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a two-minute spot</a> that will air during N.F.L. games on Sunday, including a rivalry matchup between the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions, two battleground-state teams.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The ad features Ms. Harris speaking directly to the camera and emphasizing the arguments she has made in her campaign’s final stretch, including her pledges to lower costs, protect health care and serve as “a president for all Americans.”</p><p>On Sunday, Ms. Harris will travel to Michigan for a day of campaigning. One of her senior advisers, who insisted on anonymity to describe internal strategy, said the vice president would attend a mix of local events in addition to holding a traditional campaign rally, in part so that staff members in Michigan would have the opportunity to participate in get-out-the-vote activities, rather than setting up and breaking down a large event.</p><p>Erica L.
