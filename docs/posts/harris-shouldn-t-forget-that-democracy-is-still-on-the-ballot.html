    <h1>Harris Shouldn’t Forget That Democracy Is Still on the Ballot</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kamala Harris is running an artful campaign so far, thanks in part to her upbeat, hopeful message. She has shrewdly positioned herself as the change candidate — no small feat for a sitting vice president — and has tagged Donald Trump as representing the weird past we should leave behind.</p><p>In her often joyful stump speech, Harris talks more about freedom than about threats to democracy. That makes strategic sense. Polls show that voters are more concerned with specific issues than about the specter of authoritarian government. But going too far in this direction risks letting some of the terrifying stakes move to the periphery of the campaign. Defending democracy was a potent issue for Democrats in avoiding a red wave in 2022, and it should remain a critical part of their argument.</p><p>It’s smart to make fun of Trump and treat him like a loser, which gets inside his head and causes more unforced errors. But jibes about his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/us/politics/trump-helicopter-willie-brown.html" title="">Willie Brown helicopter fantasies</a> and crowd size nonsense should be matched with reminders that Trump inspires violence (including the attack on Paul Pelosi and Trump’s vile jokes about it), has promised to be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hannity-dictator-authoritarian-presidential-election-f27e7e9d7c13fabbe3ae7dd7f1235c72" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“a dictator” on his first day</a> and proposed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/04/us/politics/trump-constitution-republicans.html" title="">“termination” of the Constitution.</a></p><p>Democrats shouldn’t forget to emphasize that Trump said Russia could “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-nato-foreign-aid-russia-2b8054a9fe185eec34c2c541cece655d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">do whatever the hell they want</a>” to NATO countries that displeased him, a position that, as his own former aides say, could cause a world war.</p></div></div>
