Brawley stood on the roof of a new home for seniors he had helped create, his coat fluttering in the wind. He surveyed his domain.</p><p>He pointed to the left, toward the hazy outline of the Manhattan skyline, to the rows of rental apartments below that he had helped develop. He pointed to the right, toward Jamaica Bay, to the mall and the rowhouses, built on top of landfill and overgrown fields, whose construction he had championed.</p><p>Squint, and you could almost see it: his vision of 10,000 more apartments, in new buildings stretching into every undeveloped corner of a neighborhood once known as the murder capital of New York City.</p><p>Mr. Brawley, 56, is not a real estate developer. He is the pastor of one of Brooklyn’s most storied Black congregations, St. Paul Community Baptist Church in East New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But at a moment when Black families are leaving the city in droves, there’s no way to lead a church like his without having a keen — in his case almost obsessive — interest in building more affordable housing.</p><p>It’s the only way he can keep his flock intact.</p><p>This corner of Brooklyn, at the edge of one of the most expensive cities on the planet, has long been an epicenter of New York’s Black civil servant class, the people who drive buses, administer food stamps, work with children with disabilities.</p><p>But they are being priced out of the city they have helped power, and where they continue to have enormous influence by showing up to vote en masse.</p><p>New York has a lot to lose if they leave.</p><p>So does Mr. Brawley. “There’s an unspoken grief” every time another one of his congregants decides they can no longer keep up with the cost of living here, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“There’s a part of your soul that gets affected.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Rev.

But with each passing year, it feels harder to maintain a decent quality of life. They want homes they can be proud of, that they can pass on to their children, not just the first rental they can find.</p><p>They want to enjoy the occasional night out, and to have enough savings to help their kids if they need to.</p><p>For some congregants, that kind of life is now possible only outside of New York City.</p><h2 id="link-50ba6fb6">‘The City That We Helped to Build’</h2><p>One Sunday a few weeks before Easter, Mr. Brawley was gearing up for St. Paul’s 8 a.m. service, the week’s marquee event.</p><p>Hundreds of people filed through the building, passing hallways covered in zebra-print wallpaper and a miniature museum depicting the horrors of the Atlantic slave trade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-7"><div><figcaption><span>Black history is woven into every aspect of worship at St. Paul, including the church building itself, which houses a miniature museum that depicts the horrors of the Atlantic slave trade.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Congregants filled the chapel, taking their seats under ornate chandeliers and rippling white curtains that looped across the ceiling like clouds.</p><p>As Mr. Brawley looked out, he saw a congregation divided.</p><p>There were those who had won the lottery, which here meant getting a subsidized home that the church had helped develop. Then there were those who were watching their rents climb in public housing or crummy walk-ups and worrying about how long they would be able to stay put.</p><p>When he took the pulpit, Mr. Brawley acknowledged a third group, for whom it was already too late: the St. Paul members who had left the city and were joining the church service online.</p><p>Linda Boyce, who was recently named an elder in the church after being a member for 49 years, took her usual seat up front. She had driven just a few blocks from her spotless three-bedroom rowhouse, purchased through the church’s neighborhood development project.</p><p>Pia Horton, who has been a member for 11 years, greeted friends as she walked in, wondering if this would be the day she finally told them that she was thinking of moving to Atlanta.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ayanna Watts, who joined the church when she was 12 years old, logged on from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where she had moved after her mother died a few years ago and she couldn’t pay the rent by herself.</p><p>In Brooklyn, the congregation was on its feet for much of the morning, swaying to the hymns and shuffling to the front of the chapel to deliver their tithes, sealed in white envelopes.</p><p>Mr. Brawley’s sermon on this day was about political power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Before the coronavirus pandemic, St. Paul held three Sunday services, starting at 6 a.m. After the pandemic, the church dropped to two services, at 8 and 11 a.m.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Macy for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He described Jesus returning to Jerusalem from Galilee to take on the establishment, and he encouraged the congregation to do the same.</p><p>“It’s important to make sure we feed folks and we clothe folks,” he said, “but it’s also important to raise the question: Why are people poor in the first place?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The way that his church could flex its influence, Mr. Brawley said, was to demand that elected officials make their constituents’ lives better, easier and more affordable.</p><p>The church would not endorse a candidate in the upcoming mayoral election. Instead, St. Paul’s members would create a list of priorities that they would ask the candidates to respond to.</p><p>“Turn your face toward Jerusalem for the city of New York,” Mr. Brawley said, to raucous applause. “The city that we helped to build.”</p><h2 id="link-14bc86ce">One of the Lucky Ones</h2><p>After the service, a 911 dispatcher, a school safety agent and a hotel housekeeper pulled their chairs together in the church basement and started to tally the indignities of living in New York these days.</p><p>They compared notes on the time of day they had to pay their credit card bills to avoid late fees — 6 p.m., 8 p.m., midnight. A 24-pack of eggs was now $20.89 at the nearest supermarket.
