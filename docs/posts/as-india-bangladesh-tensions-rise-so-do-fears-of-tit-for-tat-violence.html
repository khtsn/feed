A diplomatic dispute has since erupted as Hindu rights groups in India accuse Bangladesh of complicity in violence against Hindus and as Bangladesh’s government says India has exaggerated the situation to further its own Hindu-nationalist agenda.</p><p>The situation has led to growing fears inside Bangladesh of tit-for-tat violence between Muslims, who make up more than 90 percent of the population, and Hindus. It also threatens to derail efforts by Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, to set his country on a new course.</p><p>Communal tensions have “inflamed public passions on both sides,” said Smruti Pattanaik, a research fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in Delhi, adding that social media had fanned “inflammatory content” from both sides. “This needs to be addressed by the governments and is not conducive to long-term bilateral relations,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ties between the two countries have been fraught since Bangladesh’s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, fled to India in August after the student uprising that led to the overthrow of her government.</p><p>In the ensuing chaos, reports of communal attacks on Hindus by Muslims have fomented religious unrest within Bangladesh and across the border in India. Hindu leaders in Bangladesh have said that among the hundreds of people who died in the chaos, only a few were from their community.</p><p>The relationship between the two nations took a nosedive last week after the police in Bangladesh <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/asia/india-bangladesh-relations-hindu.html" title="">arrested a monk</a> associated with a global Hindu organization on sedition charges, accusing him of disrespecting the Bangladeshi flag at a rally protesting the persecution of Hindus. Supporters of the monk, Chinmoy Krishna Das, staged a protest outside the court, and a Muslim lawyer was hacked to death during a riot that broke out as the police and the monk’s supporters clashed.</p><p>The fallout spilled over into this week.</p><p>On Monday afternoon, more than 2,500 demonstrators from a newly formed right-wing Hindu alliance in India gathered outside a Bangladeshi diplomatic outpost in Agartala, the capital of the northeastern Indian state of Tripura, to protest Mr. Das’s arrest and the attacks on Hindus, according to a senior police official. About 50 protesters then entered the building, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons.</p><p>The group, the Hindu Sangharsh Samiti — which loosely translates to the Committee to Fight for Hindu Rights — was assembled in response to the recent tensions, according to Shankar Roy, a member of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a well-known Hindu-nationalist group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Roy said the committee was made up of about a dozen hard-line groups that are associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological linchpin of a movement that seeks to turn India into a Hindu nation.</p><p>The party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, the Bharatiya Janata Party, is also part of what is known as the “Sangh family” of organizations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chinmoy Krishna Das, a Hindu leader in Bangladesh, being escorted to court last week. He is accused of sedition.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a statement late last week, the R.S.S. urged India’s government to “continue with every possible effort to prevent the ongoing atrocities against Hindus and other religious minorities in Bangladesh.”</p><p>Bangladesh’s ousted prime minister, Ms. Hasina, is an ally of Mr. Modi’s. In her first public address since her ouster, she said in a YouTube video this week that Mr. Yunus, the interim Bangladeshi leader, was involved in “genocide in a meticulously designed manner.” Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal, a domestic war crimes tribunal, ordered a ban on circulation of her comments, labeling them “hate speech.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>For its part, Bangladesh’s foreign ministry accused Indian police officers of doing little to stop the Agartala protesters from desecrating the Bangladeshi flag. It said in a news release that the “heinous” act was part of a pattern of Indian aggression against Bangladesh, and it called on India’s government to prevent future acts of violence.</p><p>India’s foreign ministry said that it “deeply” regretted the episode at Agartala, and vowed to shore up security there. Earlier, the ministry had said it was “deeply concerned” about Mr. Das’s arrest, and urged Bangladesh to ensure the safety of all of its minorities.</p><p>Three police officers were suspended on Tuesday for negligence of duty over the Agartala violence, Kiran Kumar, the police superintendent for West Tripura, said in an interview. Another was transferred, and seven protesters were arrested, Mr. Kumar said.</p><p>India’s foreign secretary is scheduled to visit Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, next week.</p><p>The assault on the diplomatic outpost has prompted anti-India protests in many parts of Bangladesh. On Monday night, students held a rally at the University of Dhaka, the birthplace of the student movement that overthrew Ms. Hasina’s government. Among the chants by protesters, who included Hindu students, were slogans like “Stop Indian aggression. Rise up, people.”</p><p>Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of the Indian state of West Bengal, which shares India’s longest border with Bangladesh, called for United Nations peacekeeping forces to be sent to Bangladesh.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>She said her state would provide refuge to any persecuted Hindus fleeing Bangladesh if needed.</p><p>“We have no problem sharing our one roti with them,” Ms. Banerjee said in public remarks.</p><p>Her comments drew criticism from Bangladesh leaders. Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party — the main political opponent of Ms. Hasina’s party — called Ms. Banerjee’s remarks about sending in a peacekeeping force “a direct threat to our sovereignty.”</p><p>Analysts said it was not surprising that ties between India and Bangladesh had grown fraught, given that the Yunus government is still trying to establish itself.</p><p>“India had invested in fostering ties with the Hasina government and were comfortable with her,” said Harsh V. Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College London. “So it’s quite natural that there would be some turbulence with the new government.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
