The Haitian workers are legal residents of Springfield and “valuable employees,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/opinion/springfield-haitian-migrants-ohio.html" title="">DeWine wrote in a guest essay in The Times</a>, though he stopped short of calling out this tangle of Trump-Vance lies for hypocrisy and, yes, rank racism.</p><p>We all know that if the immigrants were, say, Polish, they would not be shamelessly accused of eating pets. But it’s worse than that. In 1980, Donald Trump had a chance to take a stand against using undocumented Polish workers in the New York construction industry. Instead, he hired them to demolish the old Bonwit Teller department store building (including the Art Deco friezes that Trump had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1980/06/09/archives/builder-says-costs-forced-scrapping-of-bonwit-art-threeweek-delay.html" title="">claimed he was going to donate</a> to the Metropolitan Museum of Art) to make way for Trump Tower.</p><p>And Trump exploited these migrants. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/nyregion/trump-tower-illegal-immigrant-workers-union-settlement.html" title="">The Times reported in 2017</a>, Trump “employed a crew of 200 undocumented Polish workers who worked in 12-hour shifts, without gloves, hard hats or masks.” It added: “The workers were paid as little as $4 an hour for their dangerous labor, less than half the union wage, if they got paid at all.”</p><p>As usual, Trump feigned ignorance, but in 1998 a judge ruled that he “should have known,” and the Trump Organization settled the case for $1.38 million.</p><p>This was hardly a hypocritical one-off. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/my-whole-town-practically-lived-there-from-costa-rica-to-new-jersey-a-pipeline-of-illegal-workers-for-trump-goes-back-years/2019/02/08/8cdbc1dc-2971-11e9-97b3-ae59fbae7960_story.html?noredirect=on" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an exhaustive 2019 Washington Post report</a>, Trump illegally employed undocumented immigrant housekeepers, cooks, landscapers, greenskeepers, waiters, bellhops, farm hands and caddies at 11 Trump Organization properties in Florida, New Jersey, New York and Virginia.</p><p>When reporters asked Trump to comment, he said, “Probably every club in the United States has that, because it seems to me, from what I understand, a way that people did business.”</p><p>Contrast this “everybody does it” excuse for breaking the law with the way the companies that are reviving Springfield, Ohio, handle employment. They are obeying the law and hiring properly documented Haitians to fill their many vacancies. Unlike Trump, these employers treat their workers — many of them victims of unspeakable violence in Haiti — with dignity and respect.</p><p>Their reward? Bomb threats, death threats and continuing lies from MAGA world about Springfield, all fueled by candidates for high office who are asking American voters to trust them.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="29" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzI3MzEzZjlkLTg2ZWQtNWNiMy04NmJjLWNmMzBlMmNjZGQwYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#global-warming-adaptation" data-source-id="100000009714446"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-wallace-wells"><img alt="David Wallace-Wells" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/16/reader-center/author-david-wallace-wells/author-david-wallace-wells-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/16/reader-center/author-david-wallace-wells/author-david-wallace-wells-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/16/reader-center/author-david-wallace-wells/author-david-wallace-wells-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-23T18:52:20.672Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 23, 2024, 2:52 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Forget for a second the challenges of a hotter future. How well are we coping with the global warming we’ve already got?</p><p>A new, eye-opening paper suggests the distressing answer is not very well at all. In “Are We Adapting to Climate Change?” — a preprint <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32985#:~:text=Using%20comprehensive%20panel%20data%20across,evidence%20of%20adaptation%20to%20date." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research — a distinguished group of researchers examined human outcomes of weather extremes over the last 50 years. For each of 21 climate impacts — for instance, on mortality, agricultural productivity and damages from flooding and hurricanes — they asked whether the impact of a given shock had shrunk in recent decades, as the world has grown wealthier, more technologically advanced and more aware of the risks of warming.</p><p>In certain corners of the climate and public policy worlds, it is taken for granted that it has — that adaptation has been a hugely underappreciated success story, illustrated by charts of declining deaths from extreme weather, and a success story that is poised to continue, even on a hotter and more ragged planet. But by drilling into the historical record, the authors of the new paper uncovered a very different story from the recent past, which implies a much more challenging one about the future.</p><p>“We find limited evidence of adaptation to date,” they wrote. On three-quarters of the impacts they studied, our vulnerability to warming hasn’t improved at all, meaning that a given climate event would be just as damaging as 50 years ago — perhaps more damaging.</p><p>“In many settings,” they wrote, “sensitivities appear to be growing, even in wealthy countries.”</p><p>The results weren’t uniformly bleak. The researchers found improving climate sensitivity when it comes to American corn and European wheat yields, some European mortality impacts, the relationship between income and temperature within the United States, and the relationship between temperature and both violent crime and injury mortality in the United States. But those are only six of the 21 case studies; in the others, sensitivities either worsened or remained unimproved.</p><p>We know, of course, that climate change will worsen from here. Even relatively optimistic scenarios suggest the world is due for roughly twice as much of a rise in temperature as we’ve seen to date, when warming has already brought the planet outside the range of conditions that have enclosed and supported everything we know as human history.</p><p>As the authors were careful to emphasize, adaptation failures to this point are not signs that adaptation is impossible or foolish. But they suggest that almost certainly we’re going to have to do a whole lot more preparation for the stiffer climate tests to come.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="26" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzViMDc3ZGEwLWRhNmItNTg0Yy1hNGM5LWZlMzIwMGU3MzBiNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#nixon-marijuana-unjust" data-source-id="100000009714026"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/brent-staples"><img alt="Brent Staples" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-23T15:49:00.401Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 23, 2024, 11:49 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>President Richard Nixon insisted on classifying marijuana as a dangerous drug <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-science-behind-the-dea-s-long-war-on-marijuana/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on par with heroin</a>, despite abundant evidence to the contrary. In 1972, for example, his own <a href="https://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/nc/ncmenu.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse</a> found that the harm of use was not great enough to warrant criminal prosecution in personal possession cases.</p><p>When Nixon ignored this advice, countless people were unfairly prosecuted and research into an important therapeutic drug was stalled.</p><p>We now know what the Watergate president actually believed: that marijuana was no more harmful than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/01/18/our-wasteful-war-on-drugs/3bfa245d-d8ab-4273-bed0-0dbc5e3af5c0/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his favorite mind-altering substance, the martini.</a></p><p>As my colleague Ernesto Londoño reported earlier this month, newly released tapes from Nixon’s secret Oval Office recordings reveal him saying that marijuana was “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/us/nixon-marijuana-tapes.html" title="">not particularly dangerous</a>.” While publicly advocating harsh sentencing, he privately expressed discomfort with decades-long prison terms for marijuana crimes. During one conversation, he referred to a 30-year sentence that had come to his attention as “ridiculous.”</p><p>Why did the president preserve a system of punishment he knew to be unjust? Nearly a decade ago, <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the journalist Dan Baum, writing in Harper’s Magazine,</a> reported putting the question to John Ehrlichman, Nixon’s political adviser and Watergate co-conspirator.</p><p>According to Baum, Ehrlichman said Nixon’s drug policy was designed to punish two groups of enemies, the antiwar left and Black activists. “We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or Black,” Ehrlichman said, “but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and Blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. … Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”</p><p>Nixon’s marijuana tapes come to light as legalization is sweeping the nation. Recreational use of marijuana is now permitted in <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/marijuana-overview.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">24 states and Washington, D.C.</a>, and medical use is established in <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">38 states</a>. Last year, President Biden <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-marijuana-pardons-clemency-02abde991a05ff7dfa29bfc3c74e9d64" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pardoned</a> thousands of people who were convicted of simple possession on federal lands and in the District of Columbia.</p><p>Federal law enforcement authorities are finally and belatedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/us/politics/justice-department-reclassify-marijuana.html" title="">writing new rules</a> aimed at reclassifying marijuana. Instead of being listed on <a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling#:~:text=Schedule%20I%20drugs%2C%20substances%2C%20or,)%2C%20methaqualone%2C%20and%20peyote." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Schedule I</a>, with heroin, LSD and peyote, marijuana would be listed on <a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Schedule III</a> — with Tylenol, codeine, ketamine and testosterone.</p><p>These changes are 50 years overdue.

Here’s what we’re looking at this week:</em></p><ul><li><p>We all know from years of polling that Donald Trump is one of the most unpopular political figures in American history. What gets far less discussion is how unsympathetic a figure Trump has made himself into. I think this is crucial to understanding why Trump is beatable in November, and more specifically why he has been so stuck and unable to build past 47 percent in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">national polling averages</a> — despite having an edge with voters on issues they care most about, like the economy and immigration.</p></li><li><p>One of the paradoxes about Trump is that he badly wants to be liked by people and yet says and does things that make him off-putting to many voters. Most Americans were taught at an early age not to whine, not to be a sore loser and not to break the rules. In my conversations with voters and Times Opinion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/focus-groups" title="">focus groups</a> over the years, Trump gets little sympathy for his constant grievances from people outside his MAGA base because he puts his interests ahead of the country’s.</p></li><li><p>To wit: Here is a man who faced two assassination attempts this summer, and has no evident or sustained “sympathy vote” to show for it, even from those who might be inclined to support him. It would be puzzling with any other candidate — surely, to face what Trump faced, you would gain sympathy from some voters for being a victim and some admiration for bouncing back. But Trump receives little of either beyond his base, if the polls and interviews are any measure.</p></li><li><p>Last week I asked our Times Opinion panel of 14 young, undecided voters for their reactions to the second assassination attempt, how it made them feel about Trump, and whether it made them more likely to vote for him. I was struck by how little sympathy they felt for Trump, and how his personal behavior and political record have made him such a figure of distaste for centrist voters even in the context of assassination attempts.</p></li><li><p>“I am worried that he might be mentally unfit to be president after this,” said Jasper, 25, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/17/opinion/politics/17focus-group-persuadable-voters-2.html" title="">who had been leaning toward Trump</a> in this election. Lillian, 27, said the apparent assassination attempt was “really shocking” but it did not affect her thinking about him. McLane, 25, who wrote in Mitt Romney’s name on the ballot for president in 2020, said she disagreed with Trump’s claim that the attack was due to “inflammatory language” from Democrats. “That’s far too simple. I imagine the gunman was angry or depressed, and latched onto the polarized environment and rhetoric,” she said.</p></li><li><p>With Trump and Harris heading into the final six weeks of the election, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-newly-popular-harris-challenging-trump-change-rcna171308" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new polls</a> showing a bit more <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-harris-poll-debate-economy-09-22-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">momentum for Harris</a>, Trump needs to start winning over more people. No doubt he has ability — his staying power with such a large fraction of voters is testament to his base appeal. But are enough undecided and swing voters really still open to him? That’s his big challenge, and Harris’s big opportunity.</p></li></ul></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="23" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2U0YmZmOGQzLTM1M2UtNTY4Yy04ZDUwLTg5YzEzMGE2ZmFmMQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#georgia-election-board-nonpartisan" data-source-id="100000009709754"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-20T19:10:53.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 20, 2024, 3:10 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A meeting of the Georgia State Election Board on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Stewart/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>What’s happening in Georgia right now — a rogue, partisan election board <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/us/elections/georgia-election-board-rules.html" title="">attempting to rewrite state law</a> to benefit its preferred candidate, Donald Trump, in November — makes as strong a case as can be made for a long-overdue and relatively simple reform: nonpartisan election administration in America.</p><p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/us/elections/georgia-election-board-rules.html" title="">the Georgia State Election Board voted</a> to require all ballots to be counted by hand, a move intended to create chaos and delay, and one that would jeopardize the security of ballots. This power grab is so nakedly illegal that several state Republican officials are pushing back. Good for them, but the problem isn’t confined to Georgia or to Republicans.</p><p>Ballot-box stuffing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lbj-stolen-election-box-13-mangan-c818e478ec509c65585d3094bda69f96" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gave Lyndon Johnson his Senate seat</a> in 1948. In 2000 and 2004, two secretaries of state, Katherine Harris in Florida and J. Kenneth Blackwell in Ohio, ran elections while simultaneously serving as the state chairs for George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate.</p><p>And in the 2022 midterms, half a dozen “stop the steal” candidates ran for the top election jobs in their states. They were defeated, thankfully, but it shouldn’t be the voters’ job every year to ensure the integrity of our elections. It should be written into the way elections are run in the first place.</p><p>In most other modern democracies, elections <em>are</em> run this way — by nonpartisan officials whose only job is making sure the vote is free, fair and secure. The U.S. is a global outlier in vesting authority over elections in partisan officials, whether elected or appointed. Notwithstanding the honesty of most elections officials — especially those like Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state who has held firm against efforts to corrupt the vote — any system that lets an interested party administer the rules of the game is vulnerable to exactly the kind of manipulation we are seeing play out in Georgia.</p><p>Whether or not that manipulation takes place, the fact of partisan officials overseeing the vote makes Americans understandably cynical about the integrity of their elections.</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/democracy/new-models-keeping-partisans-out-election-admin-013122.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">easy fixes</a>, several of which can be found in a Carter Center report released after the 2020 election. The most obvious: The top election-administration job in every state should be a professional and nonpartisan post, and, even better, one appointed by a nonpartisan board. And state election boards should look more like independent redistricting commissions, with a mix of lawmakers, judges, independents and civil-society groups. No more five-member boards, as in Georgia, appointed by the two parties, the governor and each chamber of the legislature. A majority of one party can presume to dictate the rules by which everyone must play.</p><p>Human beings have biases; that’s normal and expected.

As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/springfield-ohio-pet-eating-claims-haitian-migrants-04598d48?mod=Searchresults_pos2&amp;page=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> on Wednesday, the rumor started with a Facebook post by a Springfield woman who later found the thirdhand claim unsupported and disavowed it. Earlier this month, the city manager of Springfield told a JD Vance staff member that there was no truth to the rumor, and the cat mentioned in the Facebook post was later found safe and not in danger. The mayor, a registered Republican, told The Journal: “We have told those at the national level they are speaking these things that are untrue.”</p><p>Trump gave the lie national exposure during the presidential debate. Vance, who has been flailing embarrassingly since the day he was named Trump’s running mate, also promoted the story. Astonishingly, he asserted that he had no choice but to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/17/jd-vance-fake-stories-immigrants-haitians/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“create stories”</a> to get news media attention.</p><p>The reach of the campaign’s fake news has proved alarmingly vast: <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-republicans-haitian-migrants-eating-pets-poll-1954875" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A recent poll shows that more than half of Trump supporters believe the pet story</a>.</p><p>As The Journal reported, Trump’s exploitation of this baseless rumor at the debate proved immediately disastrous: “The morning after the debate, parents in Springfield kept their children home en masse. Several schools, City Hall and the state motor vehicle offices in Springfield were forced to evacuate after receiving bomb threats. The city canceled its two-day CultureFest celebrating diversity, arts and culture ‘in light of recent threats and safety concerns.’”</p><p>A neo-Nazi group took “a victory lap for its presence in the town, boasting on Sept. 11, ‘We are on the ground in Springfield weekly — we even showed up to their City Council Meeting.’” Springfield has logged dozens of bomb threats and has reacted to security concerns by erecting a tower for cameras near City Hall. State police troopers were sent in to protect local children as they returned to school. As the city manager summed up the episode: “It induces panic and fear and depletes resources. We’re living the danger that misinformation and created stories leads to.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="20" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzc1ZWY5ZTZjLTUyMjItNWNmNC04N2Y0LWQ4OTBmYjQzMDAzOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#bad-political-behavior" data-source-id="100000009707164"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-20T09:05:38.340Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 20, 2024, 5:05 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lt.

Gov. Mark Robinson, for quite a while. He has a tendency to do things like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/04/politics/kfile-nc-lt-gov-mark-robinson-mocked-school-shooting-survivors/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deride</a> school shooting survivors and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-attacked-civil-rights-movement/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bad-mouth</a> the civil rights movement.</p><p>But the many, many vile remarks that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CNN is reporting he posted</a> on the porn site Nude Africa from 2008 to 2012 are some next-level stuff. For those of you with a weak stomach, I won’t go into the gory details. I’ll simply note that according to CNN’s KFile, Robinson referred to himself as a “Black Nazi,” expressed support for bringing back slavery and said he’d prefer Hitler to the leadership in Washington during the Obama years. And these are some of the tamer bits in the report.</p><p>Robinson has denied making the comments and told CNN he would not “get into the minutiae of how somebody manufactured this, these salacious tabloid lies.”</p><p>He also said none of it was characteristic of him. I’m sure the people of North Carolina are deeply reassured.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>There has been a lot of discussion of late about when political attacks cross the line into irresponsible and dangerous. JD Vance, notably, has been piously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/politics/vance-trump-fascist.html" title="">accusing Democrats</a> of inciting violence against Donald Trump by calling him a fascist and other mean names — thus proving irony really is dead.</p><p>Whatever your political persuasion, I like to think most of us can agree that the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/libertarian-party-of-new-hampshire-unapologetic-after-post-about-kamala-harris-murder/ar-AA1qHFXh?ocid=BingNewsSerp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blew past all the lines last Sunday</a>, with a since-deleted tweet (<a href="https://x.com/artcandee/status/1835275855393632412?s=43" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helpful pic here</a>!) asserting, “Anyone who murders Kamala Harris would be an American hero.”</p></li><li><p>Not all of the political drama in Washington happens at the federal level. This month, Trayon White, a Democrat on the District of Columbia City Council, was <a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2024/08/dc-council-member-trayon-white-was-arrested-on-bribery-charge-federal-authorities-say/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">indicted</a> on a federal bribery charge. This week, White was due back in court. Meanwhile, his council colleagues, in their first session since his arrest, <a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2024/09/dc-council-member-trayon-white-set-to-rejoin-council-for-first-time-since-arrest/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">created</a> an ad hoc committee to conduct a separate investigation into his alleged monkey business.</p><p>White <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trayon-white-bribery-dc-city-council/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is accused</a> of agreeing to accept $156,000 in exchange for helping a business owner extend some contracts with the district government. And there’s video! The F.B.I. says it caught the councilman taking an envelope of cash from the business owner and stuffing it into his jacket. Public service in action.</p></li><li><p>Daydreaming about his next administration, Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/trump-california-wildfire-aid-newsom.html" title="">vowed last Friday</a> that if Gov. Gavin Newsom of California refused to bow to Trump’s will on water policy, then Trump would refuse to send federal disaster aid to help fight the state’s wildfires.</p><p>Nope. Nothing creepy and authoritarian about that.</p></li><li><p>Finally, in the category of Say Wuh?: This week, Melania Trump, in promoting her new book, released a <a href="https://x.com/MELANIATRUMP/status/1836375317646086533?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> defending her “nude modeling work” and demanding to know why the media has “chosen to scrutinize my celebration of the human form.”</p><p>I mean, why even bring it up? I certainly wasn’t scrutinizing it before now, mostly because I don’t much care that Melania used to go bare. And while nude modeling might once have caused a dust-up among the Republican Party’s ranks of religious conservatives, those folks seem to have loosened up a bunch since embracing Trump in all his degenerate, gropey glory. So, you know, you go, girl!</p></li></ul></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="19" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzUxMWQxNmQ3LTJlZDMtNTQ3NC1iNGZhLWZmZDNjMzI3ZjA1OQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#pennsylvania-early-vote-counting" data-source-id="100000009706029"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-19T18:00:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 19, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jenny Kane/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A reasonable, fact-bound citizen gets vanishingly few opportunities these days to agree with Republicans on matters of election integrity, so it was a pleasant surprise to find that I see eye-to-eye with Representative Byron Donalds, Republican of Florida, on at least one thing: Pennsylvania’s reckless refusal to process early-arriving mail ballots before Election Day.</p><p>“What happens is the polls close and it takes three, four, five days to find out who won the election. That doesn’t make any sense at all,” Donalds <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1833572558161031659" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said last week</a> in an interview on CNN.</p><p>“Trust me, the Eagles fans here in Pennsylvania, they know the score of the game when they leave the stadium or when they turn off their TV. But when we’re talking about elections, we don’t know who won simply because they’re not even going through that process in an earlier fashion?”</p><p>Amen. This may sound like a wonky bit of election administration, but it could massively complicate how and when the American people find out the winner of the November presidential election. That’s because of a phenomenon known as the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/opinion/voting-mail-election-night.html" title="">blue shift</a>” — ballots cast before Election Day tend to favor Democrats, while those cast on Election Day tend to favor Republicans. If those same-day votes are counted first, what might look like a lead for a Republican candidate on election night can evaporate once the state finally gets around to counting the early votes.</p><p>The longer this process drags on — and it will keep getting longer as more voters choose to vote by mail in the wake of the pandemic — the more space there is for bad actors to exploit the uncertainty and sow doubt about the outcome. That’s what happened in 2020, when Pennsylvania took days to finish its count (Joe Biden won the state <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-pennsylvania.html" title="">by about 81,000 votes</a>, a margin of just over 1 percent), giving Donald Trump and his allies grist for all sorts of bogus claims of fraud. These claims, combined with others around the country, were at the heart of the Stop the Steal movement that led directly to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.</p><p>Trump may never change, but Pennsylvania can. There is no reason the biggest and most consequential swing state in the country, with 19 electoral votes, can’t follow the lead of states like Florida and Georgia, which get a head start on counting the millions of ballots that come in before Election Day. That way, whatever tally is released on election night will be much closer to the final count, reducing the opportunities to spread disinformation and sow chaos. It’s a simple and proven way to administer elections better.</p><p>So what’s the problem? The state’s Republican-led Senate <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/05/precanvassing-mail-ballots-2024-election-pennsylvania-legislature/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has refused to pass</a> an early-counting bill written by the House, led by Democrats, unless it is paired with a strict voter-ID law, which <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/voter-identification" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research suggests</a> would have no impact on the incidence of voter fraud. Republicans also claim they are concerned that early counts might be leaked to the public. More likely, they are concerned that the public wouldn’t be fooled by incomplete (and more Republican-friendly) results on Election Day.</p><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Sept. 20, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Pennsylvania’s electoral votes.

But Donald Trump has managed something remarkable: He’s making traditional right-wing economic nonsense look relatively sensible in retrospect.</p><p>Ever since the rise of Ronald Reagan, Republicans have been vocal believers in the magical power of tax cuts for the rich. The idea was that if you reduced tax rates at the top, “job creators” would respond with a surge of productive energy, boosting the economy — hence trickling down to the middle class — and maybe even reducing the budget deficit.</p><p>This idea wasn’t unadulterated nonsense. Rather, it was adulterated nonsense. It described something that could happen in principle but doesn’t happen in practice; tax cuts never produced the promised economic surge, tax hikes never had the predicted destructive effects. Still, it remained party orthodoxy, largely because rich people put their money behind a doctrine that called for cutting their taxes.</p><p>But Trumponomics, which increasingly seems to center on tariffs — which are, by the way, taxes — as the answer to all problems really is unadulterated nonsense. Until this week, Trump’s big claim was that taxes on imports won’t raise prices for consumers, which is not only completely at odds with Economics 101 but also at odds with everything Republicans have ever said about taxes.</p><p>And on Tuesday he cranked the nonsense up to 11. Asked how he would cut grocery prices, he responded by saying that he would <a href="https://x.com/Brendan_Duke/status/1836196410233962855" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restrict food imports</a>: “We allow a lot of farm product into our country. We’re going have to be a little like other countries. We’re not going to allow so much.”</p><p>What? This is going from trickle-down to upside-down. Even in the fever swamps of the right, it must be hard to find people who believe that you can make something cheaper by reducing its supply.</p><p>For what it’s worth, I don’t think there’s a doctrine here. What we’re looking at here is probably a brain glitch. Somebody said “food,” which activated some neurons in Trump’s brain linked to “farmers,” and he fell into his usual habit of proposing import restrictions as the answer to everything.</p><p>Still, Trump has gone on and on about high food prices, with a particular thing about bacon for some reason. You might have expected him to have some kind of idea ready when asked what he would do to bring them down.</p><p>But Trump doesn’t have ideas. He has fixations.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzg1YmRkYTA2LWQwZDctNTU4OC04MDAwLWM2MGZjYTVjYzI2Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#jill-stein-green-party" data-source-id="100000009703925"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gail-collins"><img alt="Gail Collins" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/01/opinion/opcollins-headshot-2021/opcollins-headshot-2021-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/01/opinion/opcollins-headshot-2021/opcollins-headshot-2021-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/01/opinion/opcollins-headshot-2021/opcollins-headshot-2021-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-19T09:05:26.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 19, 2024, 5:05 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Young/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>OK, people, tell me when you last contemplated Jill Stein, perennial Green Party candidate for president.</p><p>“Y’all, this is a little spicy, but I have thoughts,” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a recent Instagram post criticizing Stein’s third attempt at running for president.</p><p>Truly, “a little spicy” and “Green Party candidate Jill Stein” do not often come up in the same sentence. Or paragraph. Or train of thought.</p><p>But this is the season when we start to fret a lot about third-party presidential candidates who could divert enough cranky voters from the real options to change the outcome of the election.</p><p>We will stop now for a moment to remember the Green Party’s presidential candidate in 2000, Ralph Nader, who drained just enough support from Al Gore in Florida to tip the election to George W. Bush.</p><p>Or, um, Jill Stein. Whose presence on the ballot in a few swing states was just enough to keep Hillary Clinton from beating Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>The danger isn’t nearly as great as it was a few months ago, when it looked like the race was going to be Biden-Trump and millions of depressed voters were wondering whether to write in the name of a close friend or, hey, George Clooney.</p><p>But still, you can never tell how things might get screwed up, particularly since any outcome not involving the election of Trump is going to lead to months of legal battles and protests.</p><p>So feel free to worry about Stein — or other presidential candidates, like Cornel West, whose only major achievement this time around has been <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4882419-cornel-west-ballot-access-pennsylvania/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not making</a> the ballot in Pennsylvania.</p><p>They’re not exactly building a movement, and as Ocasio-Cortez said, if “all you do is show up every four years,” you really ought to be doing something else. Maybe running for a less ridiculous office, the way Ocasio-Cortez did when she knocked off an entrenched and deeply unthrilling House veteran in 2018.</p><p>Or sign up for a night-school class. Clean the basement. Reread “War and Peace.” The options are endless.

The format is pretty watchable and the voter questions have been <a href="https://youtu.be/T3tZ05xWDBA?feature=shared&amp;t=2632" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">primarily</a> about the high cost of living, though the events have really gone a lot of places, thematically.</p><p>The clip a lot of people saw was Sanders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2r31Kw4Xoo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a> that her children reminded her of what’s important and also kept her humble, and that Kamala Harris “doesn’t have anything keeping her humble” (a curveball return to the implicit criticism of people who don’t have children). This was actually the second town hall to open with children as a topic: In Gabbard’s case, she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/fQgxK_GS-ic?feature=shared&amp;t=580" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke</a> about her own desire and inability to have children and the importance of I.V.F.</p><p>But one small thing that also came up at Tuesday night’s event, albeit one that some people may have heard a thousand times before, was Trump’s response to a fairly anodyne question. “We’ve never needed a fighter more and we’ve never had someone more qualified to step in and lead our country than you,” Sanders <a href="https://youtu.be/T3tZ05xWDBA?feature=shared&amp;t=155" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told him</a> at the outset of the event after a discussion of the apparent second assassination attempt. “I’d love for you to tell us why you want to be president and why do you keep fighting even after they keep attacking you every single day?”</p><p>This is how that answer started:</p><blockquote><p>Yeah, so we ran — a lot of love in this room, you love me, I love you, and we love Sarah — we all ran in 2016 and it was amazing and we won. We then ran in 2020 and we did much better than 2016; people don’t like to hear it. “Oh, he’s a conspiracy theorist” — we got millions and millions more votes, we did much better, it wasn’t even a contest. I was telling one of the papers; they said, “What was the difference?” I said the difference is we did much, much better the second time. But we had a lot of things happen. We know what those things are, so what difference — because now, in like 48 days or whatever it might be, we’re going to do something that will be, I don’t think it’s going to shock the world actually, I think the world is going to be prepared already. In Europe, they want it to happen. Even though they would not prefer dealing with me in terms of the economics, they still want it to happen, because the whole world is blowing up, and they know it is not going to happen if I’m president here. So we did great, and honestly, if I didn’t do great, and we know what happened, and if that didn’t happen, if I didn’t do well in 2020, I wouldn’t even think about doing this.</p></blockquote><p>Obviously he’s said iterations of this so many times that it fades into the back of the mind. But I just read the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/735736/trump-in-exile-by-meridith-mcgraw/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new book</a> by Politico’s Meridith McGraw on Trump’s post-presidency, and one of the takeaways is just how much the aftermath of losing the 2020 election and Jan. 6 shaped the last few years for Trump. The book details his interest in the audits of votes, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/politics/blake-masters-donald-trump-arizona-voter-intimidation/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his calls</a> to the 2022 Republican candidates about how they needed to emphasize his claims, his interest in defeating candidates who’d voted for his impeachment in the House to prove the point of his influence. And that aftermath shaped the people who have been around him and the way the party’s changed.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2JkM2I5Y2ViLTBjYzUtNTU1NS1hMDRkLTFlZTk1YjVmNDU1MQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#fed-rate-cut-political" data-source-id="100000009704334"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-coy"><img alt="Peter Coy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-18T18:14:41.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 18, 2024, 2:14 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Was it “political” for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates less than two months before the presidential election, as Donald Trump has charged? Not a bit. Not cutting rates is what would have been political.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Fed’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cut the target range for the federal funds rate — the short-term interest rate it controls — by half a percent. A cut that big was at the high end of forecasters’ predictions. More often the Fed moves a quarter-point at a time, but the committee members apparently wanted to make sure that they didn’t fall behind the curve and allow the economy to slip into a recession.</p><p>The nub of the argument that the Fed was trying to help the Democrats is that lower rates might help the economy grow a little faster, which would in principle help the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris, since her party controls the White House.</p><p>Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/business/economy/trump-interest-rates.html" title="">referred</a> to the expected rate cut as “political stuff” during a town hall in Michigan this week. Earlier this year, in an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-trump-interview-transcript/?sref=B3uFyqJT" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with Bloomberg Businessweek, he said that an interest-rate cut by the Fed is “something that they know they shouldn’t be doing.”</p><p>John Paulson, the billionaire investor who is informally advising Trump, issued a statement noting that “the Fed claims to be above politics,” but saying the timing of the rate cut “cast doubt on its claims.” He said that although interest rates are too high, the Fed should have waited until November to start cutting them.</p><p>But the arguments of Trump and Paulson don’t hold up to scrutiny. If the members of the Fed committee had really wanted to help the Democrat get elected, they would have started cutting earlier, since it takes <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2023/oct/what-are-long-variable-lags-monetary-policy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least half a year</a>, and possibly much longer, for changes in interest rates to affect the real economy.</p><p>If anything, the Fed waited too long to start cutting. Inflation has cooled, while the unemployment rate shot up to 4.2 percent last month from 3.5 percent in July 2023.</p><p>Asked the politics question at the Fed’s news conference, Powell said, “This is my fourth presidential election at the Fed. It’s always the same.” </p><p>“Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people,” he said, adding, “We don’t put up any other filters. If we start to do that, I don’t know where we stop.”</p><p>Unfortunately, sometimes not being political is going to look political. Under these economic conditions, for the Fed to try to dodge criticism from Trump by leaving interest rates high would have been highly political — and indefensible.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzliOThjZGM2LTgwNjMtNWU0Yy1hN2JiLWU5NDcwODhjZDUzMg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#hezbollah-israel-pagers-assassinations" data-source-id="100000009704056"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/serge-schmemann"><img alt="Serge Schmemann" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-18T17:39:36.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 18, 2024, 1:39 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>We may never know all the details of how Israel got explosives into thousands of pagers, and apparently other wireless radios, that have been exploding in Lebanon, mostly in the possession of members of Hezbollah. The Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, is not in the habit of divulging information about its methods, and Israel is not likely to say anything. Yet the fusillade of exploding pagers has set a new standard — if not in ingenuity, then at least in scale.</p><p>Assassinations are as old as politics, and for most of history they were carried out by relatively straightforward means — knives or guns, with an occasional flourish. The mother of the nefarious Roman emperor Nero, for example, helped him to the throne by serving her husband Claudius a plate of poison mushrooms. (Nero then had her assassinated.)</p><p>But it is in the modern era that assassinations — now often whitewashed as “extrajudicial killings” — have become instruments of state and have harnessed cutting-edge science and inventiveness. Drones, bombs, disguised assassins and special forces are the most common killing tools, but ingenuity is still prized for the toughest targets — or as a way to send a signal.</p><p>Israel has long been among the busiest, most creative and audacious of states that practice extrajudicial killing. According to Ronen Bergman, an Israeli journalist, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and the author of “Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations,” there have been about 2,700 such killings.</p><p>The pager explosions in Lebanon were not the first time Israel used a hand-held wireless device as a weapon. In January 1996, I covered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/world/palestinians-vow-vengeance-at-gaza-funeral-of-terrorist.html" title="">the funeral of Yahya Ayyash</a>, a Palestinian known as “the Engineer” for building suicide bombs used against Israelis. He was killed in Gaza when his booby-trapped mobile phone exploded. Other noteworthy techniques used by Israel involved <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-01-24/poisoned-toothpaste-and-exploding-phones-israel-s-proxy-for-war?embedded-checkout=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poisoned toothpaste</a> and a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-and-mossad-killed-senior-hezbollah-figure-in-car-bombing/2015/01/30/ebb88682-968a-11e4-8005-1924ede3e54a_story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bomb hidden in a spare tire</a>.</p><p>One Israeli attempted hit dramatically misfired. In 1997, Mossad agents in Jordan managed to inject poison into the ear of a Hamas official, Khaled Meshal. The assassins were caught; Jordan demanded an antidote from Israel; and Meshal is today probably the top political leader of Hamas.</p><p>Dramatic hits — and certainly dramatic failures — are hardly confined to Israel. The United States tried and failed to kill Fidel Castro hundreds of times, once by an exploding cigar. The Soviet Union and Russia also launched some doozies. There was the celebrated “poison umbrella” against a Bulgarian dissident in 1978, the polonium-laced tea that Alexander Litvinenko drank in 2006, or the nerve agent used against Sergei Skripal in 2018 and Alexei Navalny in 2020 (both survived the attacks).</p><p>Still, the pager attacks open a new chapter in the gruesome history of assassinations. This time, the target was not one person but an entire organization, with the certainty that the dead and injured would not be limited to members of Hezbollah. The long-term goal, moreover, remains unclear — Hezbollah has not been crippled, and is now compelled to retaliate.</p><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Sept. 18, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the affiliation of Khaled Meshal.

In the days since they began peddling these lies, more than 30 bomb threats have forced hospital lockdowns and school closures. Ohio’s governor has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/us/springfield-ohio-troopers-bomb-threats.html" title="">called</a> in the State Highway Patrol to ensure children can make it to class despite threats of racially motivated violence.</p><p>The way MAGA has rocked Springfield is an extreme example of what some academics call <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051211021378" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">networked harassment</a>, in which a powerful figure’s vocal, devoted audience mobilizes to enforce conformity with a particular worldview. Online, this typically takes the form of harassing messages and death threats spread through forums and social media. But Donald Trump’s adherents have managed to bring such digital fanaticism into the real world, breathing new life into a racist culture of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/the-danger-within" title="">political violence</a> that should have died with Jim Crow.</p><p>The MAGA faithful have deployed their power before, to intimidate poll workers and to force Republican politicians to hew to Trump’s will. With the lurking threat of his powerful base backing him, the former president has slowly created an atmosphere in which it is commonly understood that opposing him invites retribution, in the form of online harassment,<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/29/us/politics/paul-pelosi-political-violence.html" title="">home invasions</a>, bomb threats, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/opinion/trump-documents-jan-6-prosecute.html" title="">violent insurrections</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/23/us/verdict-trial-gretchen-whitmer-kidnap.html" title="">kidnapping attempts</a>.</p><p>Where once this country might have relied on Republicans with a backbone to stand up against Trump’s worst tendencies, the threat of retribution has become so great that<strong> </strong>the former president has come close to achieving total submission within his own party.</p><p>What’s now playing out in Springfield, however, marks a more ominous shift in the MAGA faithful’s focus.<strong> </strong>Lacking noncompliant politicians to harass, Trump’s supporters have now turned outward, using threats against the town as a warning to the nation of what happens if it ignores MAGA’s racist demands — “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/nx-s1-5037992/trump-immigrants-border-mass-deportation-presidential-race-migrants" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mass deportation now!</a>”</p><p>It should be unsurprising that this attempt to force the culture to shift has begun just as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/my-president-was-black/508793/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another Black American</a> has a real shot at this country’s highest office. A culture of white supremacy, which Trump and Vance’s racist lies clearly serve, cannot thrive if the majority of the country welcomes a multiracial democracy with open arms. So, the thinking goes, they must be intimidated with threats of violence into acceding to Trump’s will.</p><p>Harris made it clear on Tuesday that she understands — and cares about — the risks of unrestrained speech. “When you have this kind of microphone in front of you,” she said in an interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists, “you really ought to understand at a very deep level how much your words have meaning.”</p><p>Like so many politicians throughout this country’s history, she chooses to follow a personal code of morality and decency. That used to be the norm in a national political campaign, but Trump has made such behavior seem optional. In this particular election, even Harris’s bare minimum should be enough.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2I3NDc3YzNkLTRmMmEtNTRkNy05MDQxLTRhYzM2MTdkN2ViYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#instagram-children-regulation" data-source-id="100000009699333"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zeynep-tufekci"><img alt="Zeynep Tufekci" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-17T19:56:32.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 17, 2024, 3:56 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Instagram just announced “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/technology/instagram-teens-safety-privacy-changes.html" title="">sweeping</a>” changes to how it handles minors’ accounts, a belated acknowledgment that a social platform that seeks to encourage engagement can have pernicious effects on children. Accounts whose owners self-identify as minors will now be private by default, stop notifications between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., and allow parent accounts to see who receives their children’s messages.</p><p>But these new policies will have little impact on many teenagers, because the platform has not set up age verification.</p><p>In response to Instagram’s new policy, many kids will simply create “finstas” — fake accounts — and carry on as before. Additionally, 16- and 17-year-olds will be able to opt out of these settings without needing parental approval. Anyone familiar with teenagers and the platform can see that Instagram’s new policy is less of a solution and more of a performance of doing something in response to public outcry.</p><p>Even these minor changes came only after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/technology/instagram-teens-safety-privacy-changes.html" title="">dozens of lawsuits</a> by state attorneys general and recent legislation aimed at protecting minors online that overwhelmingly passed in the Senate. In an age of polarization, such consensus is a strong indicator of how bothered the public is by all this.</p><p>While our new connected reality does have upsides, many teenagers suffer greatly from the constant judgment that characterizes social media platforms. And then there are the many documented cases of blackmail and exploitation of vulnerable youngsters.</p><p>Obviously, those best able to protect themselves from social media’s harms are going to be the young people who already have trusting relationships with their parents. Those kids are more likely to voluntarily self-identify as minors and now have slightly better default settings. But what about the rest of them?</p><p>Age verification is the kind of policy that would allow such changes to have widespread effect. But it’s not an easy fix. And it would certainly not be without major downsides, especially if it allowed a company to collect even more information on everyone. It also might overly stifle legitimate and necessary access to online information and speech. But those problems are potentially solvable in part by developing new technological approaches, if companies had the incentive to try.</p><p>So far, tech companies have little incentive to do much else besides belatedly change a few settings. Little else is likely to happen until Congress finally gets serious, resists the lobbying by these wealthy companies and puts some thoughtful effort into legislation with sharp enough teeth to force platforms to act.</p><p>Until then, the most vulnerable kids are still on their own.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFmNGIyMjA3LTA0NDctNWQ1ZC05ZjI5LWIxYTI1NzBiYzJiNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#supreme-court-roberts-immunity" data-source-id="100000009696787"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-17T09:04:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 17, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Jacquelyn Martin/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Does John Roberts live in the same world as the rest of us? One has to wonder, given how frequently the Supreme Court’s chief justice seems removed from the social and political realities of the country.</p><p>As revealed by my Times colleagues Jodi Kantor and Adam Liptak in their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/justice-roberts-trump-supreme-court.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">remarkable, deeply reported article</a> that was published on Sunday, Roberts orchestrated several high-profile rulings last term in ways that benefited Donald Trump, at least partly by acting as though the American people would not interpret them as political. In drafting the majority opinion for the Jan. 6 presidential immunity case, for example, Roberts “seemed confident that his arguments would soar above politics, persuade the public, and stand the test of time,” Kantor and Liptak wrote.</p><p>That attitude was dangerously naïve, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor tried to warn Roberts in the justices’ private conference following oral arguments in the case. The court was weighing whether to reverse a federal appeals court ruling that Trump was not immune from prosecution for his actions on and around Jan. 6. Sotomayor “did not see how the court could reverse the appellate decision. It would look like the Supreme Court was being used to delay the trial, she said,” according to the article.</p><p>She was right, of course: “Both conservatives and liberals saw it as an epic win for Mr. Trump.” Combined with the rulings in Trump’s favor in the other two Jan. 6 cases, it is no surprise that the Supreme Court’s public approval level is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/08/favorable-views-of-supreme-court-remain-near-historic-low/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hovering around its all-time low</a>. You don’t need a law degree to understand that in the post-Bush v. Gore era, the court treads on extremely thin ice when it inserts itself into presidential politics, all the more so if the justices in the majority share a political ideology with the winning side.</p><p>At the same time, Roberts gives indications of being aware of the fragility of the court’s legitimacy. In one of the article’s most telling details, the chief justice took charge of writing an opinion in a case involving Jan. 6 rioters — one that had initially been assigned to Justice Samuel Alito. Roberts did so just days after The Times reported that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/justice-alito-upside-down-flag.html" title="">a pro-Trump flag had flown outside Alito’s home</a> around the time of the Capitol attack. Given how unusual it is for a majority opinion to change hands, the timing suggests Roberts was trying to counteract a perceived bias of at least one of the justices.</p><p>Still, masking the radical partisanship of the court’s right-most flank doesn’t fool anyone. If Roberts wants to rebuild public confidence in the court, he could start by acknowledging the real world outside One First Street. In a world as polarized as ours, you can’t issue a hugely consequential ruling that’s about Trump and pretend that it has nothing to do with Trump. The immunity ruling has already affected the operation of the presidency, and it’s natural for people to consider it in light of how Trump (or Kamala Harris, for that matter) would react to it starting in 2025. </p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2U4Njc5ZTlhLTlmYjUtNTkxZC05Y2Q5LTFmNmVjNGQ4ZWMyZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#kamala-harris-polish-voters" data-source-id="100000009694363"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-alter"><img alt="Jonathan Alter" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-16T18:59:21.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 16, 2024, 2:59 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Kamala Harris’s powerful message on abortion and Donald Trump’s deranged lies about Haitian immigrants eating pets are getting most of the post-debate attention, but Harris’s appeal to Polish American voters in Pennsylvania might prove more influential in the outcome.</p><p>One highlight of the debate came when the moderator David Muir asked Trump: “Do you believe it’s in the U.S.’s best interests for Ukraine to win this war? Yes or no?”</p><p>After Trump basically said no, Harris detailed her 2023 visit to Poland and Romania on NATO’s eastern flank and her role in the “righteous defense” of Ukraine. She explained why our NATO allies are “so thankful that you are no longer president.” If Trump had been in office then, “Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland. And why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor.” She ended by calling Putin “a dictator who would eat you for lunch.”</p><p>That was a smart line of attack for reasons beyond Pennsylvania and the Polish American vote. It appeals to veterans and to swing voters looking for a candidate who will stand up for American interests in the world. Many of these voters understand that persuading other nations to contribute more to our common defense (which Biden and Harris have done) is not our only foreign policy objective.</p><p>More broadly, the exchange over the war in Ukraine made Harris look strong and Trump weak. He came across as not just a patsy for dictators (and an autocrat who uses the Hungarian strongman, Viktor Orban, as a character reference), but clueless in claiming that he could settle a complex conflict overnight. While foreign policy is rarely a critical issue in elections during which no American soldiers are in combat, Harris’s fluency in its nuances signaled to voters that she is presidential.</p><p>It’s hard to predict how all of this will play with a bellwether constituency in a bellwether state. Polish American voters have sided with the losing candidate only three times in more than a century. A gaffe by President Gerald Ford in a debate with his challenger, Jimmy Carter, (“I don’t believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.”) helped sink Ford in the 1976 election. But an overheard ethnic slur against Poles by the vice-presidential candidate Spiro Agnew in 1968 did not cost Richard Nixon the election that year.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, Polish Americans were essential to Joe Biden’s victory over Trump there in 2020, following Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss in the state. They identified with Biden as a Scranton native and fellow Catholic, advantages that Harris does not possess.</p><p>It may be “wishful thinking,” as one Pennsylvania professor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/kamala-harris-polish-americans-pennsylvania.html" title="">told The Times</a> last week, to assume Harris can make inroads with this constituency, which cares a lot about the immigration issue. But at least Harris is trying. Attacking Trump for selling out to Putin on the future of Poland is more than just good politics. It’s a sign that she is ready to be the leader of the free world.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2MxMWU1MWExLTEyMjktNWNiMi04MDc5LWZhZWNmYjRiY2Q5ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#parenting-costs-usa" data-source-id="100000009694103"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/pamela-paul"><img alt="Pamela Paul" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-16T16:43:02.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 16, 2024, 12:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Last month, the surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/28/us-surgeon-general-issues-advisory-mental-health-well-being-parents.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued an advisory</a> on the mental health and well-being of parents. Too many parents, Murthy noted, are stressed out by the demands of parenthood in an environment dominated by gun violence, social media and drug epidemics. Murthy recommended policies to support parental mental health, improve child care access, increase parental leave and improve community support.</p><p>That’s nice.</p><p>As for Kamala Harris, if she becomes president, she <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wants to offer</a> $6,000 child tax credits to families with newborns and make high-quality child care more affordable.</p><p>That’s also nice.</p><p>But it’s a drop in the bucket. Across the developed world, parents are stressed over social media and their kids doing well at school. But in many European countries, parents can <em>afford</em> to stress about those things because they have access to free or heavily subsidized child care, health care and education. (These countries also have sensible gun laws, but that’s another story.)</p><p>Here in America, we get none of that. If American parents didn’t have to sweat over saving <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/cost-raising-child" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> to pay for these larger things, they might have the time and mental space to attend to child-rearing’s ordinary challenges. If they didn’t have to panic over their kids’ futures being subject to these same expenses and a merciless job market, they wouldn’t be quite so frantic about their children’s education and whether it will adequately prepare them for an economically secure future.</p><p>My European friends think what American parents put up with is bonkers, but unlike many Americans, they don’t blame parents. They recognize that American parents are trapped in an impossible system.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, I wrote a book called “<a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805089240/parentinginc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Parenting, Inc.: How the Billion-Dollar Baby Business Has Changed the Way We Raise Our Children</a>.” That book was largely about how companies exploit parents’ fears to sell them products and services intended to make their children “succeed.” That market has since metastasized, but its underlying cause remains the same. “The cost of raising children is rising far faster than our earnings,” I wrote. “That leaves even couples who make decent salaries belaboring the decision to have children based on the bottom line.” Republicans like JD Vance have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-child-tax-credit-5000-what-to-know/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested a similarly meager tax credit</a> in their push to get Americans reproducing. And even Democrats are too tentative to push for systemic change in health care, child care or education. The picayune proposals currently on the table amount to petty change, not to any material change at all.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMyZjZmOGQwLWNhM2YtNTRkNS04NzNkLTEzZDFjZDkwZTc0ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#american-voters-in-the-shadow-of-another-gunman" data-source-id="100000009693475"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy"><img alt="Patrick Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-16T09:04:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 16, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Every Monday morning on The Point, we start the week with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign. Here’s what we’re looking at this week:</em></p><ul><li><p>After the Kamala Harris-Donald Trump debate last week, I held a focus group with young, undecided voters and we discussed the 2024 election.</p><p>“It feels like something out of a dystopian movie,” a 22-year-old said.</p><p>“Full of twists and turns,” one 24-year-old replied.</p><p>“A confusing whirlwind,” a 21-year-old called it.</p></li><li><p>These three voters grew up in a country and a world shaped and scarred by 9/11, the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, Twitter, the Great Recession, Sandy Hook, a rapidly warming planet, the famines and food crises across Africa, President Donald Trump, Charlottesville, Covid, George Floyd, Jan. 6, deep fakes, Ukraine, Oct. 7, Gaza. I call these young voters the wrong-track generation: For pretty much their entire lives, a majority of Americans have said that the country was on the wrong track, and were dissatisfied with how things were going. I’m 53 and I can’t imagine growing up and, through no fault of their own, only knowing an America where so many people thought so many things were so bad.</p></li><li><p>Yesterday I was editing the transcript of this undecided voter focus group when I got an email from the Trump campaign at 2:23 p.m. saying, “President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity.” I thought of those young voters who described last week’s debate as another twist and turn, as more dystopian confusion, and wondered, what will they think of America now?</p></li><li><p>Some have historical perspective, of course: we don’t live in a nation where a senator is caned in the chamber, or assassinations feel commonplace, or the KKK is marching en masse, they told me last week. In our focus groups, one thing people argue about the most is whether America’s best days are behind us or ahead of us. I find those arguments fascinating — the participants feel a deep stake in America, no matter what side they take. And yet I can’t imagine what it is to be a young person in America today, processing so much in a real-time information deluge. What I can imagine is why some young voters are still undecided. Many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/22/opinion/young-voters-focus-group.html" title="">loathe Trump and found Jan. 6 traumatic</a>; at the same time, they care a great deal about trust, and don’t confer it easily — and they don’t feel like Kamala Harris has earned their trust with the handful of big policy speeches, interviews and debates she’s done. People ask me, how can these voters be undecided? But I feel only empathy for them. Thinking about what America has given them in the last two decades, I reply, can you really blame them?</p></li><li><p>This week, these voters and the rest of us will learn more about the F.B.I.’s investigation of what may be an attempted assassination and of the suspected gunman. Trump and Harris both have <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/14/kamala-harris-to-make-blue-wall-campaign-stop-in-wisconsin-next-week/75223412007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">events</a> in which Sunday’s news — and the state of America — will get full airings, I’m sure. The lies about Haitian migrants will most likely continue, and the economy will swing back into public focus with a probable Fed interest rate cut. More twists and turns, in other words, as a lot of voters look for some meaning in it all and think about America’s best days.</p></li></ul></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzY1NTFiOTk4LTYwZTMtNWFmMC1iNjRhLWQwMjBmZDNjODRmZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#week-bad-political-behavior" data-source-id="100000009691364"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-13T21:43:15.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 13, 2024, 5:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>With less than two months to go until Election Day, it is impossible to keep track of all the political madness afoot.

Loomer started things off by snarking on X that if Kamala Harris wins the presidency, “the White House will smell like curry &amp; White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Get it? Because Harris is half Indian.</p><p>The smear wasn’t clever or funny and, in fact, was so thuddingly racist it prompted a public scolding from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (yep, you read that right: Marjorie. Taylor. Greene), who denounced Loomer’s post as “<a href="https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1834006729966723558?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1834006729966723558%7Ctwgr%5E63d35bad8e5c15b88f98e2572ac4f97c469a826f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fmaga-civil-war-erupts-as-laura-loomer-and-mtg-trade-blows-in-public" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appalling and extremely racist</a>” and later told CNN that Loomer lacked “<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-calls-far-right-activist-laura-loomer-s-rhetoric-huge-problem-that-doesn-t-represent-maga/ar-AA1qtqpy?ocid=BingNewsSerp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the right mentality</a>” to advise a presidential campaign.

There’s more. One of the Senate’s top Trump toadies, Lindsey Graham, also publicly warned his MAGA king against associating with the “toxic” Loomer, prompting Loomer <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1834305481436967305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1834305481436967305%7Ctwgr%5Eaac1537431bd7d53161ca4c898e229e4949f2b32%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rawstory.com%2Flaura-loomer-lindsey-graham%2F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to go hard</a> at Graham, with an attack on the senator’s loyalty to Trump and on his sexual orientation.</p><p>I guess this is what happens when you build a political movement on the idea that nastiness and pugilism are signs of courage and integrity.</p></li><li><p>It looks as though Mayor Eric Adams of New York may have a Trumpian predilection for surrounding himself with questionable characters. Various aides have been swept into multiple federal investigations of possible corruption at City Hall and the Police Department. The mayor, a Democrat, has had his phone seized and his judgment questioned, since many of those under investigation were his direct appointees, including the police commissioner, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">who resigned on Thursday</a>.</p><p>How is Adams responding to the gathering storm? By explaining to New Yorkers what’s going on or by vowing to clean up his administration? Don’t be silly. He is instead cloaking himself in the good book <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/nyregion/eric-adams-black-churches.html" title="">by comparing himself to Job</a>, the biblical innocent whose suffering was imposed by God as part of a divine test.</p><p>“I wish I could tell you that I had one moment in my life that was a Job moment,” he said at an evangelical Black church in Brooklyn on Sunday. “But I did not have one. I had many.”</p><p>Lord, deliver us from this shameless posturing.</p></li><li><p>Just when you thought Trump’s migrants-munching-pets hullabaloo couldn’t get any more delicious, up pops Marianne Williamson, the erstwhile Democratic presidential hopeful, <a href="https://twitter.com/marwilliamson/status/1834230977788313677" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with this</a> spiritually themed warning on X:</p><p>“Continuing to dump on Trump because of the ‘eating cats’ issue will create blowback on Nov. 5. Haitian voodoo is in fact real, and to dismiss the story out-of-hand rather than listen to the citizens of Springfield, Ohio confirms in the minds of many voters the stereotype of Democrats as smug elite jerks who think they’re too smart to listen to anyone outside their own silo.”</p><p>I’m just going to leave this here for you to unpack on your own.</p></li></ul></div></div></section></div></div>
