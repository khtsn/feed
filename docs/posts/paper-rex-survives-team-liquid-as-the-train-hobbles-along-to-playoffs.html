    <h1>Paper Rex survives Team Liquid as the train hobbles along to playoffs</h1>

		<p>Paper Rex has taken the final spot in the Masters Toronto playoffs, defeating Team Liquid in a 2-1 victory that was never in doubt.</p>

<p>For a team with no practice, a brand-new sixth man, and an IGL shipped in days late, it&#39;s a miracle that Team Liquid had made it this far in Toronto. After a close loss to Bilibili Gaming, the return of nAts saw them spring back to life as they flattened MIBR.</p>

<p>On the other side, the Paper Rex that was one single round away from being eliminated in the group stage all the way back in Pacific have their own divine train chugging along through Toronto. Already having taken out Team Heretics, the second EMEA team was the next team in their path.</p>

<p>While Liquid was able to snatch away Split 15-13, Paper Rex quickly returned with a 13-5 on Sunset. The decider map of Lotus was one for the ages, but Paper Rex closed it out 14-12.</p>
