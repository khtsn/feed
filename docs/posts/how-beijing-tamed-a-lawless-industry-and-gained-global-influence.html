At a warehouse in Guangzhou, near Hong Kong, acid was used illegally to extract rare earths, and the residue, faintly radioactive, was dumped into the municipal sewage. The gang operating the warehouse brought in foreign buyers in the trunks of cars to keep its location a secret.</p><p>But since then, a crackdown by Chinese law enforcement and the government’s consolidation of the industry have allowed China to seize control over the country’s supply of minerals and curb its excesses.</p><p>“Gone is the Wild West, go-go mentality where the environment was given short shrift — now it is much more controlled,” said David Abraham, a rare earth industry consultant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The environmental costs of unregulated mining and refining were high for many years. In southern China, forested hillsides and emerald rice fields were turned into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/business/global/26rare.html" title="">expanses of toxic mud</a>, as Chinese crime syndicates hired laborers to dig up ore and process it in unlined acid pits.</p><p>In northern China, groundwater laced with the industry’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/30/business/global/30rare.html" title="">radioactive waste</a> began seeping toward the Yellow River. Thousands of square miles of pasture were closed to grazing because of contamination by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/business/international/china-tries-to-clean-up-toxic-legacy-of-its-rare-earth-riches.html" title="">radioactive dust from refineries</a>, which was blamed for the deaths of thousands of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/business/global/20cashmere.html" title="">goats</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rare earth refineries dumped slightly radioactive effluent into these mud flats in Baotou, China, contaminating the groundwater underneath.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Kanter for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Chinese metals syndicates developed an international reputation for murder. One night in 2000, thugs broke into the office of a Hong Kong rare metals trading firm and killed the general manager, slicing his throat with a box cutter. The police tracked the suspected perpetrators to the rare earth mining district of China’s neighboring Guangdong Province, where the police lost their trail.</p><p>Starting in 2006, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/business/global/29rare.html" title="">Beijing</a> gradually reduced the quantity of rare earths that could be exported legally. It acted for environmental reasons — leading academics were warning about the industry’s pollution — and to assert control over a key component in multinationals’ supply chains.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But the export limits triggered shortages and a speculative frenzy. Prices for some of the 17 different rare earth metals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/business/global/prices-of-rare-earth-metals-declining-sharply.html" title="">soared nearly thirtyfold</a>.</p><p>Hundreds of illegal mines were dug. Smugglers melted rare earths into steel exports, then melted the steel again overseas to recover the rare earths. An initial police crackdown in 2010 had few lasting results.</p><p>I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/business/global/26rare.html" title="">visited one of the mines</a>, then abandoned, in Guangdong Province in 2009, along with other journalists for The New York Times. It was a red-brown clay scar, leaving barren a large swath of a valley otherwise full of lush rice fields.</p><p>A year later, when we hiked into another illegal mine, which the Guangdong government had described as closed, we were confronted by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/business/global/30smuggle.html" title="">thugs</a> who threatened to “carve you up like animals in a slaughterhouse.” Four cars chased our taxi across the fields to the nearest highway entrance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/wen-jiabao" title="">Wen Jiabao</a>, then the premier of China and a geologist by training who did his master’s degree in rare earths, ordered a nationwide campaign seven weeks later by all Chinese security agencies to break rare earth crime syndicates. Raids, arrests and prosecutions followed. Police officers publicly destroyed illegal mining equipment. The national government seized control of 11 rare earth mining districts from often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/21/business/global/21rare.html" title="">corrupt local officials</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A worker at the Jinyuan Company’s smelting workshop in 2010 stirred cauldrons of the rare earth metal lanthanum before pouring it into molds near the town of Damao, in Inner Mongolia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Gray/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Still, progress in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/business/global/china-vows-tighter-controls-over-rare-earth-mining.html" title="">taming the industry</a> was slow. “Excessive rare earth mining has resulted in landslides, clogged rivers, environmental pollution emergencies and even major accidents and disasters, causing great damage to people’s safety and health and the ecological environment,” China’s cabinet said in a policy paper in June 2012.</p><p>Mr. Wen ordered that dozens of licensed companies be consolidated into six companies controlled by the government, often with little or no payment to the owners.</p><p>Michael Silver, the chief executive of American Elements, a Los Angeles-based company that manufactures or distributes over 38,000 chemicals, said a rare earths joint venture in which his company held a stake was expropriated without compensation in 2012.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Customs checks on metal exports have discouraged the smuggling of rare earths out of China in recent years. An end to a speculative market bubble has meant <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/22/business/a-bubble-bursts.html" title="">lower prices</a> and made illegal mines less remunerative. However, much of the environmentally destructive mining for one rare earth in particular — dysprosium for advanced computer chips and magnets — has reportedly moved a few miles across China’s southern border to <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144702" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lawless areas</a> of northernmost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/20/world/asia/myanmar-civil-war.html" title="">Myanmar</a>. The ore is then brought into China for refining.</p><p>The six state-controlled companies have since been reduced to three. Benefiting from consistent government support, they have periodically flooded world markets with rare earths to drive down the price whenever Western producers try to ramp up production.</p><p>“They’ll do whatever it takes, from low interest rates to staffing to land,” Mr. Silver said. “They will always control the supply of rare earths.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Keith Bradsher is the Beijing bureau chief for The Times.
