Whales sing. Fish croak, chirp, grunt, hum and growl. But in the chatter of the sea, one voice has been missing — until now.</p><p>Sharks have long been seen as the silent killers of the water. But scientists at the University of Auckland in New Zealand recently recorded a rig shark, or Mustelus lenticulatus, making a sharp clicking sound, most likely by snapping its teeth together, according to findings published in the journal <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.242212" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Royal Society Open Science</a> on Wednesday. They believe it’s the first time a shark has been recorded actively making noise.</p><p>The lead researcher, Carolin Nieder, first heard the sound while she was researching the hearing abilities of sharks. While she was handling one shark, it made a clicking, snapping sound similar to that of an electric spark, she said.</p><p>The noise came from a rig shark, a fairly small shark common in the waters around New Zealand that grows to up to five feet and mainly eats crustaceans. It is eaten by bigger shark species — and by New Zealanders, who use it to make fish and chips.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Dr. Nieder was taken aback when she heard the noise.</p><p>Other sea creatures have mechanisms for making sound. Fish, for example, have a swim bladder, a gas-filled sac that is used for buoyancy but can also be used as a kind of drum. Many fish have a muscle that can vibrate the swim bladder in a way similar to a human’s vocal cords, generating sounds.</p><p>But sharks “were thought to be silent, unable to actively create sounds,” Dr. Nieder said.</p><p>For the study, she and her co-authors observed the behavior of 10 rig sharks housed in tanks equipped with underwater microphones. They found that all 10 sharks would begin to make the clicking noise when they were being moved between tanks or gently held.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/27/multimedia/27xp-shark-01-qfpc/27xp-shark-01-qfpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/27/multimedia/27xp-shark-01-qfpc/27xp-shark-01-qfpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/27/multimedia/27xp-shark-01-qfpc/27xp-shark-01-qfpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The jaw of a rig shark, with many rows of flat, diamond-shaped teeth." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/27/multimedia/27xp-shark-01-qfpc/27xp-shark-01-qfpc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/27/multimedia/27xp-shark-01-qfpc/27xp-shark-01-qfpc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/27/multimedia/27xp-shark-01-qfpc/27xp-shark-01-qfpc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/27/multimedia/27xp-shark-01-qfpc/27xp-shark-01-qfpc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b632331b-a109-5a3a-bdba-b3f722b5f792" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rig sharks grow rows of flattened teeth.
