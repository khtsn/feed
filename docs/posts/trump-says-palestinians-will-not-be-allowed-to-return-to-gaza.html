    <h1>Trump Says Palestinians Will Not Be Allowed to Return to Gaza</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“There won’t be anybody there,” Mr. Trump added. “Hamas won’t be there,” he said, referring to the militant group that led the assault on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that touched off the war in Gaza. “We’ll be building through other of the very rich countries in the Middle East; they’ll be building some beautiful sites for the people, the Palestinians, to live in,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu, at a government meeting in Israel on Sunday, praised Mr. Trump’s vision for the region following the war. “There are opportunities for possibilities that I think we never dreamed of, or at least a few months ago they did not seem possible — but they are possible,” he said.</p><p>“President Trump came with a completely different vision,” for the future of Gaza, Mr. Netanyahu said, “much better for the State of Israel, a revolutionary and creative vision, which we are discussing. He is very determined to carry it out.”</p><p>When Mr. Trump introduced the proposal at the White House last week, his administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-gaza-takeover.html" title="">had not done even the most basic planning</a> to examine the feasibility of the idea, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. It would involve displacing two million Palestinians from Gaza; Mr. Trump suggested they should be relocated to countries like Egypt and Jordan, both of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/world/middleeast/arab-nations-reject-trump-evacuate-gaza.html" title="">swiftly rejected the idea</a>.</p><p>At that news conference, Mr. Trump said that the United States would take over the Gaza Strip, “and we will do a job with it too.” He said the U.S. would be responsible for disposing of unexploded munitions and rebuilding Gaza, ultimately turning it into what he called, “the Riviera of the Middle East.”</p><p>Hiba Yazbek<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ephrat Livni<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
