Last month, she went home to find her own children struggling to cope after the electricity went out there, too, shutting off the air-conditioning.</p><p>And Mishari al-Olyan, 40, a lawyer, said the rolling blackouts that the government had resorted to recently as electricity demand surged were a “catastrophe.” His father needs an oxygen tank to breathe — and the tank needs electricity to operate, he said. So now he makes sure he has a spare machine charged and ready.</p><p>“Since when does a country like Kuwait have electricity cuts?” he asked.</p><p>The country’s power problems have many causes. As the planet warms, <a href="https://kuwaittimes.com/article/16659/kuwait/other-news/electricity-crunch-addressing-the-energy-problem-at-its-core/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">soaring demand</a> has outpaced the capacity of the existing electrical grid, while bureaucratic delays have stymied efforts to expand it. Kuwait has also largely shifted away from burning oil to generate power — a more polluting method — in favor of natural gas. And since the country produces relatively little natural gas, it needs to import it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The blackouts in Kuwait this summer underscore the challenges that even affluent countries in the region face as climate change <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/18/world/middleeast/extreme-heat.html" title="">reorders life</a> across the Middle East. In April, heavy rains caused <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/climate/dubai-floods-what-we-know.html" title="">severe flooding</a> in Dubai, wreaking havoc at its international airport. And in June, heat waves contributed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/23/world/middleeast/hajj-pilgrim-deaths-saudi-arabia.html" title="">the death of more than 1,300 people</a> making the annual hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Summer blackouts are not new in Kuwait; they have occurred regularly <a href="https://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticlePrintPage.aspx?id=1681547&amp;language=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">since 2006</a>. But this year, the ministry of electricity, water and renewable energy has increased scheduled power cuts, and Kuwaitis say it feels like the electricity is going out more often.</p><p>On Aug. 18, the ministry warned that cuts would happen in several neighborhoods across the country and asked people to conserve energy during the peak hours of 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. It blamed those cuts on a “fuel supply disruption” for natural gas. And in a statement this summer, the ministry attributed outages in June to “the inability of power generation stations to meet the increasing demand during peak times, compounded by higher temperatures compared to previous years.”</p><p>In late August, the ministry said Kuwait had recorded its highest electrical load in history as temperatures reached 50 degrees Celsius, or more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit, aggravated by high humidity along the coast.</p><p>“Just walking out of the house is difficult,” said Ms. al-Shammari, 31.</p><p>Sarah Hashem Ibrahim, 34, a middle school teacher, said she had noticed her students increasingly affected by the heat, finding it more difficult to concentrate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“When it’s so hot and the electricity is out, your whole life stops,” she said. “Even just basic daily tasks you can’t do anymore.”</p><p>The Persian Gulf nation is one of the world’s largest oil exporters and has a $980 billion sovereign wealth fund. Yet its citizens often complain of government mismanagement. In a <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/621231a39fabb3281dda0d11/t/66cacb5aecb9854a0718d035/1724566368989/20240825-KE.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent report</a>, AlShall, a business consultancy, blamed the power cuts on disorganized public administration rather than on a financial deficit or fuel shortage, pointing out that there have been 14 electricity ministers over the past 10 years, two of whom served twice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kuwait City in December.
