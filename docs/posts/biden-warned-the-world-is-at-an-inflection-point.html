He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/politics/biden-unga-speech.html" title="">celebrated his efforts to defend Ukraine</a> and rebuild America’s global alliances, however he also said that the progress could easily collapse if the U.S. turns to isolationism.</p><p>“Our task, our test, is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than those that are pulling us apart,” Biden said to the world leaders gathered in New York City. “The choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come.”</p><p>The president’s warning appeared to be an unspoken reference to the possible election of Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the NATO alliance. Biden cast his decision to step down from the presidential ticket as a lesson for world leaders. “Some things are more important than staying in power,” he said.</p><p><strong>For more:</strong> Many leaders focused on the Middle East, with some speakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/24/world/unga-2024-biden/furious-over-the-continuing-war-in-gaza-world-leaders-castigate-israel" title="">criticizing Israel for its war with Hamas in Gaza</a>, where a cease-fire has appeared to become less likely in recent weeks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Traffic in the town of Damour, south of the capital, Beirut, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ibrahim Amro/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-42a77ba5">Thousands fled southern Lebanon</h2><p>Thousands of people tried to escape southern Lebanon today, as Israel pounded Hezbollah targets there in response to the militant group’s continued barrage of rockets directed at Israel.

They are often looking for trustworthy advice to make important health decisions. To keep up, doctors at more than 150 health systems have begun allowing artificial intelligence to help draft their responses.</p><p>The workaround, which appears to ease the doctors’ cognitive burden, troubles some experts, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/health/ai-patient-messages-mychart.html" title="">worry that the A.I. tool will make potentially dangerous errors</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-407ece6c">Our favorite restaurants of 2024</h2><p>My colleagues in the Food section have spent the past year traveling to every state in the country to scout out America’s best food spots.
