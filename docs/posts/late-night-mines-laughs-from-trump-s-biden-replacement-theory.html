While mindful to note that this was likely meant “to distract us,” as Jon Stewart said on “The Daily Show,” late night hosts couldn’t help but tackle the topic like the sci-fi movie it needs to be — with incredulity.</p><blockquote><p>“You’re saying that the Joe Biden who doesn’t even know where he is, is actually an incredibly advanced cloned robot? How much ketamine are you on?” — <em>JON STEWART</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WIhlC3L99x8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><blockquote><p>“You can’t be a robot and a clone, OK?” — <em>STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“How is this not on the front page of everything? The president of the United States is spreading deranged stories about his predecessor being a robot.” — <em>JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“It was a perfect plan with only one flaw: The Joe Bot couldn’t recognize George Clooney.” — <em>STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-3"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-TpfDpjlbQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Hey, Republicans. Remember when you were very concerned Joe might not have the mental acuity to be president? Come get your guy, because he thinks Biden was executed and replaced by a clone, a ‘robotic clone.’ I mean, if your dad was saying stuff like this, you’d start looking for an assisted-living facility.” — <em>JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“The media needs to stop being polite when they report this stuff. This is the headline from NBC: ‘Trump Shares Unfounded Conspiracy Theory Claiming Biden Was “Executed” in 2020.’ Never mind ‘unfounded,’ this is not even a theory. That headline should be ‘Convicted Felon Posts Insane Fairy Tale About Cancer Patient While Constipated on Toilet.’” — <em>JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“And, by the way, whoever built that Joe Biden robot is very bad at building robots. I mean, if anyone was replaced by a robotic clone, it’s Melania, right?” — <em>JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-28578532">The Punchiest Punchlines (Side Effects Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“Trump was effusive in his praise for Musk. He thanked him for working ‘tirelessly.’ Well, yeah, of course he was working tirelessly. They say he was gobbling down 20 different kinds of uppers every day when he was there.” — <em>JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Over the weekend, The New York Times published a crazy story about Elon Musk, claiming, among other things, that he was taking ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, pills believed to be Adderall, and so much ketamine it was affecting his bladder control, which is a delightful detail. Between him and Trump, that Oval Office has got to smell like an abandoned nursing home.” — <em>JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“This dude is a one-man antidrug campaign. ‘These are your pants. These are your pants on drugs.’ And I do love the fact, though, that the detail is he’s the one who told them he had bladder problems. That means things were so bad, he had to be, like, ‘Oh, don’t worry, it’s nothing weird. It’s just an overabundance of ketamine.’” — <em>JON STEWART</em></p><p>“Now Elon had previously said that he took ‘a small amount’ of the drug to treat depression, but it seems like he might have been taking way more than that, because bladder problems impact chronic users of ketamine, and can lead to frequent and painful urination and episodes of incontinence. That is rough. You know, you’re depressed, so you take ketamine, then you take so much ketamine that you pee your pants, and that makes you more depressed, so you need more ketamine. I mean, is there any way to break this vicious cycle?” — <em>STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Musk denied the drug abuse, posting, ‘I am not taking drugs! The New York Times was lying their ass off. I tried *prescription* ketamine a few years ago and said so on X.’ Well, it wasn’t just on X. It was also on mushrooms and ketamine.” — <em>STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>John Oliver stuck the landing when he dissected the national air traffic controller crisis on Monday’s “Last Week Tonight.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-102ce59">What We’re Excited About on Tuesday Night</h2><p>Former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand is sure to make compassion in politics more exciting than it sounds when she visits Stephen Colbert on “The Late Show.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Clooney as Edward R.
