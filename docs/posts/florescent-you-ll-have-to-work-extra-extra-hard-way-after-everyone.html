</span> secured a reappearance at Berlin&#39;s Riot Games Arena this upcoming year, albeit in a completely different league.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with VLR.gg, florescent shared her reflections on both past and present endeavors, highlighting her journey up to this point in time. The prodigy&#39;s path to pro started many years ago in the form of a small monthly tournament.</p>

<p>“My first tournament was a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/598/sakura-cup-3/playoffs" target="_blank">Sakura Cup</a>, an NA Monthly Game Changers tournament. I don&#39;t think it had an age restriction, because I was 14, so I just played with friends for fun.”</p>

<p>Two monthly Game Changers tournaments made up the entirety of florescent&#39;s 2021 as recorded on VLR. However, her break into a more competitive environment took the shape of <span data-ref-id="3">

</span>, the first organization she signed with.</p>

<p>“Around that time was when I realized that I wanted to take this super seriously and focus more on playing Valorant [in general].”</p>

<p>And play Valorant she did. Following her stay with Misfits, florescent would go on to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/165497/version1-reveal-2023-roster" target="_blank">sign</a> with the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/286445/version1-transfer-championship-roster-to-shopify" target="_blank">now-Shopify Rebellion</a> roster, vaulting her even further up the competitive ladder as she trained with the top players of Game Changers.</p>

<p>Even heading into the 2023 Game Changers Championship, her performance did not falter, as she and the rest of Shopify claimed the organization&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/289382/shopify-rebellion-overcome-team-liquid-brazil-to-win-the-game-changers-championship" target="_blank">first GCC trophy</a> following an undefeated run throughout the upper bracket. However, the job wasn&#39;t quite done for the coronated monarchs of Game Changers.</p>

<p><img src="https://owcdn.net/img/6765a18600d36.png" alt="shopify 2023 image"/>

<p>The new year meant new challenges and competition for most, but not for florescent and Shopify. The team won all three series of NA Game Changers and secured yet another appearance at this year&#39;s GCC. By this time, however, florescent&#39;s performance had finally caught the attention of organizations outside of Game Changers.</p>

<p>“[Apeks] reached out during [Series 3]... and we organized for me to fly into Berlin earlier than my teammates so I could trial. It went pretty well… I thought I would make it off the trials. I thought I did pretty good. I didn&#39;t know how well the other people at trials did, but just for myself, I was pretty confident going into it.”</p>

<p>Throughout her time in Berlin – which once again ended with yet <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/422854/shopify-rebellion-sweeps-mibr-gc-to-lift-back-to-back-game-changers-championships" target="_blank">another trophy</a> for the talent alongside an MVP award – florescent&#39;s path to Tier 1 was finally solidifying through her performance in trials. Shortly after her second victory on an international stage, Apeks <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/427110/apeks-changes-the-game-with-florescent" target="_blank">officially announced</a> her signing.</p>

<p>“I was definitely excited. I remember telling my team when it happened.”</p>

<p>However, signing with Apeks meant leaving behind not just her teammates but competing in Game Changers. Despite this, Shopify&#39;s former star had nothing but good things to say about her stay within the scene.</p>

<p>“It was definitely really positive, I [didn&#39;t] really have any bad experiences. I feel like I&#39;ve gotten to know a lot of people and made a lot of friends. I&#39;m pretty grateful.”</p>

<p><img src="https://owcdn.net/img/6765a283076ba.png" alt="flor mel image"/>
<em>florescent&#39;s signing with Apeks ended a two-year stint with <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3063/mel">
		meL	</a>
</span> and the rest of the rebels. (Photo: Adela Sznajder/Riot Games)</em></p>

<p>Her new environment didn&#39;t seem to faze the newly-signed talent at all, either. Even making the jump from North America to EMEA for more than just a brief tournament seemed almost insignificant to florescent.</p>

<p>“When I turned 16 I moved all the way across Canada for better ping and I didn&#39;t have any family there, so I think it&#39;ll be fine. My teammates are all nice and helpful so I feel like I won&#39;t have many problems there. I know some people in Berlin just from VCT, so I&#39;m not too worried about that.”</p>

<p>The shift in attitude also felt miniscule to the competitor, who confirmed the hard work that players across all scenes put into improving themselves.</p>

<p>“I didn&#39;t really notice that much, it doesn&#39;t feel too different to me. At the end of the day everyone&#39;s just trying to win.”</p>

<p>The rest of Apeks meshed very well with florescent, as she recalled past practices the team underwent ahead of their debut in the EMEA League.</p>

<p>“We all get together really well. Everyone is really funny. We just had a two-week bootcamp in Serbia and it wasn&#39;t the best of circumstances for some days, but we all had a good time. I think everyone likes each other.”</p>

<p>“We&#39;ve just been grinding. We have the least amount of time compared to all the other teams since I had the GC schedule going on. I&#39;m in NA right now, and we&#39;re working on getting our fifth fully confirmed. We just have to grind, really, that&#39;s all it is. During the bootcamp we were practicing really hard, working on everything that we could.”</p>

<p>New to Tier 1 but not new to winning, florescent stayed confident when asked about the teams within the EMEA League, her new competition for the year.</p>

<p>“I&#39;m always confident. I never want to say that I think we&#39;re gonna lose or I think we&#39;ll do ok. I&#39;m super confident. It&#39;s gonna be fun.  I&#39;m really excited, honestly.”</p>

<p>While on the topic of teams she would want to play, the new pickup struggled to choose.</p>

</span> is not the strongest because even if they have a super good roster on paper they just need a little more time. Heretics… they play good together, so I think they&#39;ll be pretty exciting to play against if we get to.”</p>

<p>Making the jump from Game Changers to Tier 1 was no small feat, and although the change in competition brought on new challenges, florescent still had goals for herself throughout the year in hopes of improving even more than she already has.</p>

<p>“I just want to be able to play confidently and be comfortable playing with my teammates, especially because I&#39;m just starting to get to know them more now. I just want to have fun really.”</p>

<p>Finally, when asked about advice for not just aspiring Game Changers players but all those aiming to go pro, the two-time World Champion responded with what brought her from humble beginnings to the grandest of stages.</p>

<p>“Just grind hard, be a nice person, and sometimes you&#39;ll have to work extra, extra hard, way after everyone. Come in early, bring your stuff, just work your hardest and don&#39;t be an asshole. Can I swear? Just be a good person to others. Even if you don&#39;t reach your goals, if you leave a good impression on people, you&#39;ll be fine.”</p>
