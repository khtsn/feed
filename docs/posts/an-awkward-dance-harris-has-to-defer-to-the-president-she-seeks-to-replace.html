But he could not resist taking a question about whether he would reconsider dropping out of the presidential race.</p><p>“I’m back in,” Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/biden-drop-out-2024-election.html" title="">said</a>, laughing before cracking a smile and offering a wave of his hand, as if to say, “I wish.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Within Ms. Harris’s campaign, reactions to the president’s impromptu appearance ranged from calling it unhelpful to genuine anger and incredulity, according to several aides who insisted on anonymity to detail private reactions.</p><p>Ms. Harris has under a month left to make her case to the American people that she should lead the nation. But even as she tries to show that she is more than Mr. Biden’s understudy, moments like these are a reminder of the awkward dance steps required of Ms. Harris to both serve a boss and seek to replace him.</p><p>While by all accounts Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden have a good working relationship, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/politics/biden-kamala-harris.html" title="">tensions have arisen</a> in recent months between their teams of anxious advisers, who are balancing the goals — and navigating the egos — of two of the most powerful people in American politics. Both want to defeat former President Donald J. Trump. But there are questions about how visible the still-unpopular president should be in this neck-and-neck contest, especially as Ms. Harris offers herself as representing change. And every day leading up until Nov. 5 matters.</p><p>With crises bearing down, they are determined to keep any disagreements backstage.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris received a briefing from federal officials about Hurricane Milton. The president, who was in Washington, took the lead on questioning officials. Ms. Harris attended the call virtually from New York, and later dialed into several TV networks to talk about the storm. </p><p>And it was Mr. Biden who spoke from the White House on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/biden-trip-hurricane-milton.html" title="">warning Florida residents</a> to “evacuate now, now,” as Ms. Harris urged them to do the same thing on ABC’s “The View.” The previous evening, Mr. Biden announced on social media that he had spoken about the storm with Florida’s Republican governor just minutes after CBS broadcast the vice president’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview-takeaways.html" title="">interview on “60 Minutes.”</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A week earlier, when Iran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles into Israel, the world saw Mr. Biden in the Situation Room, managing the crisis.</p><p>There is nothing to indicate that Mr. Biden is trying to upstage his vice president, whom he heartily endorsed soon after dropping out of the race. And on Wednesday, Ms. Harris spoke to the nation from the hurricane briefing after Mr. Biden did, seeking to demonstrate her role as a central player in the administration’s response to the once-in-a-century storm.</p><p>“President Biden and I and our administration will continue to do everything we can to protect the people who have been in the path of this storm,” the vice president said.</p><p>Her advisers argue that some of these moments offer opportunity: They say that sitting next to the president draws a contrast not between Ms. Harris and the president, but between Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump, whom she has accused in recent days of lacking the empathy needed to lead the country through a crisis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Biden made a rare appearance at the White House briefing room on Friday to promote a better-than-expected jobs report, just as Ms. Harris was speaking at a campaign rally in Michigan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Still, the events of the past week have highlighted just how much the work of being vice president can interfere with owning the news cycle as a candidate. It was Ms. Harris’s duty, her advisers said, to retool her campaign travel to be with Mr. Biden in the Situation Room over the course of several hours, when the president directed American naval forces to help defend Israel against the barrage of Iranian missiles.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And it was her duty, they said, not only to stand back and let Mr. Biden be the first to visit areas affected by Hurricane Helene but also to pause campaigning, return to Washington and receive updates on the storm.</p><p>White House officials point out that Mr. Biden has gone out of his way to say how central Ms. Harris has been in the series of recent crises. He told reporters on Tuesday that she had been helpful during the response to the hurricanes.</p><p>It could also damage the vice president’s campaign if Mr. Biden did not appear engaged during a natural disaster or a national security episode. If he did that, Mr. Trump would no doubt attack Ms. Harris for being part of an unresponsive administration.</p><p>“President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris partner closely on essential matters for the American people that require both of their attention, such as hurricane preparations, response and recovery, and defending our ally Israel from Iran,” Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Still, the past week has shed light on the complicated nature of Ms. Harris’s relationship with Mr. Biden, who dropped out because he worried about igniting an intraparty fight, not because he thought he would lose.</p><p>Though the president and some of his most loyal advisers remain bitter toward Democratic leaders for his ouster, he is also feeling a newfound sense of freedom in the final weeks of his term, two people familiar with his thinking have said.</p><p>As her campaign hits its most crucial phase, Ms. Harris has publicly and privately been loyal to Mr. Biden. But there has been anxiety within her orbit about how much she should break with the president to further define herself.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/harris-the-view-interview-trump.html" title="">appearance on “The View”</a> on Tuesday, Ms. Harris offered a glimpse of what that might look like when she was asked whether there was a thing Mr. Biden had done in office that she would have done differently.</p><p>“There is not a thing that comes to mind,” Ms. Harris replied — an answer that she had to give to remain in lock step with Mr. Biden, but which Republicans quickly seized on to exploit the president’s unpopularity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>But later, she offered a view of how her leadership might differ from his, and referred to an earlier promise to name a Republican to her presidential cabinet: “I don’t feel burdened by letting pride get in the way of a good idea,” Ms. Harris said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Harris appeared on Tuesday on the television program “The View,” where she encouraged Florida residents in the path of Hurricane Milton to evacuate.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Although Mr. Biden delivered his remarks about Hurricane Milton around the same time, White House officials said that few people watching “The View” would have left the program to watch Mr. Biden on one of the cable networks.</p><p>On matters of policy, Ms. Harris has praised Mr. Biden’s leadership and has not diverged from him, particularly on how to handle the Mideast war, even though the administration’s support for Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/michigan-harris-arab-muslim-jewish-voters.html" title="">threatens to endanger her standing</a> in crucial states, including Michigan.</p><p>James Carville, the veteran Democratic strategist, said that Ms. Harris did not need to break with Mr. Biden to further define herself, but needed to contrast herself with Mr. Trump on the economy and other issues that a majority of voters say they care the most about.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“She’s not totally filled out,” Mr. Carville said. “I think they could up their game on this, day to day.”</p><p>He thought the campaign should rely on surrogates like former President Barack Obama, who is traveling to Pennsylvania on Thursday to make the case for Ms. Harris, to talk about popular policies, including the Affordable Care Act, which remains a target of Republicans.</p><p>He said Mr. Biden was best left to do his job: “To say the least, he’s a busy man,” Mr. Carville said.</p><p>Mr. Biden visited Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on Tuesday and was recently in Michigan — three important battleground states. But he has not been an avid campaigner for the vice president, as he had previously promised, which aides to both have said represents a lack of urgency from Ms. Harris’s campaign about sending him into battleground states. Mr. Biden’s policies are broadly popular with Americans, but he is not.</p><p>And Mr. Biden is still focused on buttoning up his legacy: On Tuesday, he traveled to Wisconsin to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/climate/biden-epa-lead-pipes.html" title="">highlight the administration’s work</a> to upgrade lead pipes throughout the state.</p><p>That is the type of event expected of Mr. Biden at this stage, according to a Harris campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail strategy. The official said that Mr. Biden could be useful at get-out-the-vote events targeting union workers and older voters, including older Black voters, but that it ultimately helped Ms. Harris if Mr. Biden continued to focus on being the president.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katie Rogers is a White House correspondent.
