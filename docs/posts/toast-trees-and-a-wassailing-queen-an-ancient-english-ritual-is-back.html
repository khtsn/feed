But she values the event, which attracts more than 400 paying guests, promotes cider and features folk dancers known as Morris Men and a lively barn dance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>But before the dancing, visitors first joined in a song directed at two trees, imploring them to yield “hatfuls, capfuls, three-bushel bagfuls,” of fruit.

data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The ceremonies have evolved over time, according to Ronald Hutton, a professor of history at the University of Bristol, who dates the first recorded wassails to the 13th century, when a large wooden bowl with alcohol was passed around by friends standing in a circle.</p><p>Someone would drink and call “waes hael” — be well — and the others would chorus back “drinc hael” or drink well, he said, adding that this could descend into a medieval drinking game.</p><p>“You’d carry on passing the wassail bowl from hand to hand and taking a slurp until either the host decided enough was enough — or people gradually keeled over and the winner was left standing,” said Professor Hutton, author of <a

16th century, the link to agriculture was established, with farmers singing to and blessing bee hives, fruit trees, crops, sheep and cattle to encourage a bountiful harvest.</p></div></div><div

century, said Professor Hutton, “with the growth of horticulture and fertilizers, a better knowledge of how trees and farms work, and a decline in the belief that singing to your trees or fields actually does any good.”</p><p>As he prepared to put on his multicolored costume, Mike Highfield, 64, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/arts/dance/morris-dancing-english-folk-tradition.html" title="">a Morris dancer</a> and master of ceremonies at Sheppy’s, where he gives visitor tours, welcomed the resurgence.</p><p>“We should celebrate our culture because cider really was the wine of England at one stage,” Mr. Highfield said, adding that the night brings people together over a beverage that, apart from its low alcohol version, typically ranges in strength from 4 percent to 7.5 percent alcohol.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“Once you let your hair down and scream at an apple tree — and you shout and you sing — you start to talk to people because you lose some of your inhibitions,” he said.</p><p>One spectator, Matthew Mudge, 62, a church musician from Cardiff, Wales, said he had wanted to attend a wassail for decades. “It’s a fantastic tradition. I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to get here,” Mr. Mudge said as he enjoyed a cider after the ceremony, adding, “All wassails involve drinking and perhaps that’s why they’ve lived for six centuries.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The wassail procession passes through the town of Midsomer Norton.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People watch the procession pass.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>In the village of Midsomer Norton, about 50 miles away, 100 people or so turned out for a community event to wassail three small apple trees in the local park.

Trevor Hughes, 70, a Morris dancer, who conducted the ceremony, said the tradition had never disappeared here.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“We have always done wassails at this time of year.
