    <h1>TSMC Pauses Chip Shipments to Chinese Customers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Experts say it is hard to know exactly how powerful a chip will be on the basis of its design alone, making it challenging for TSMC to verify that the chips its Chinese customers order meet the U.S. requirements.</p><p>Most of TSMC’s revenue comes from North American companies, including Apple and Nvidia, the world’s largest corporations. But Chinese firms like Baidu, a technology giant that makes artificial intelligence systems, and Horizon Robotics, an autonomous driving software company, have remained a small but important part of the Taiwanese chip maker’s business.</p><p>TSMC’s revenue from Chinese companies has been nearly cut in half since the U.S. government started to crack down on chip exports. In 2019, 20 percent of TSMC’s revenue came from China. Last year, it was down to 12 percent.</p><p>The Commerce Department, which oversees U.S. export controls, declined to comment.</p><p>The U.S. government put restrictions on TSMC in October 2023 that required the company to verify that chip designs from China did not exceed certain parameters, or else obtain a special license from the U.S. government to make them, one of the people familiar with the requirements said. The intent was to require TSMC to verify if the chips exceeded certain thresholds, the person said, but that process had somehow broken down.</p><p>TSMC said in a statement that it was a law-abiding company and had not supplied chips to Huawei since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/economy/commerce-department-huawei.html" title="">the U.S. restrictions</a> went into effect. “We are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls,” the company said.</p><p>John Liu<!-- --> contributed reporting from Seoul.</p></div></div>
