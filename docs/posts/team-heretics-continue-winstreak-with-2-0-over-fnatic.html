</span>. </p>

<p>This series is the fifth time the teams have played each other, having faced off on three occasions in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1998/champions-tour-2024-emea-stage-1/regular-season" target="_blank">EMEA Stage 1</a> alone.  This year, Team Heretics won the meeting twice, but FNATIC won the more recent, and more important, matchup in the Stage 1 grand final. </p>

<p>In the veto, both teams continued with their previous bans: Icebox for FNATIC and Ascent for Team Heretics. Having similar map pools, the teams opted for different approaches in their map pick. FNATIC chose Lotus, on which they were <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/2593/fnatic/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2024-06-14&amp;date_end=" target="_blank">8-1 since the beginning of Stage 2</a>, while Heretics chose Abyss, which they tended to float but FNATIC appeared content to not play. FNATIC then banned Sunset, a strong map for both but <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/1001/team-heretics/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2024-06-14&amp;date_end=" target="_blank">common Heretics pick</a>, while Heretics decided to take Bind off the table. This left Haven as the decider, FNATIC&#39;s 100% win rate map in the latter half of the season and a map which this Heretics lineup had only played three times. </p>

<p>A 2v5 comeback gave Team Heretics the opening round on their opponent&#39;s map, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378825/team-heretics-vs-fnatic-valorant-champions-2024-ubqf/?game=180423&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Lotus</a>. The anti-eco continued as expected, and Boo&#39;s Odin gave his team the bonus round. FNATIC turned their luck around in the anti-eco, and were able to exploit the B setup to win a pair of rounds. An oppressive round following a timeout gave the lead back to Heretics, with three more to follow as they forced mistakes out of FNATIC. The Heretics defense continued on their path to success, ending the first half 9-3.</p>

</span> makes impact kills look easy</em></p>

<p>Team Heretics opted for a methodical approach in their attacking pistol round, with a flawless round putting them up to double-digits. In their bonus, they baited FNATIC into an early fight outside A, finishing the round out after cutting noise and continuing their push into the site. They won the final round with little resistance, winning the opener 13-3. </p>

<p>With a now 28-9 historical record, the 13-3 scoreline is FNATIC&#39;s worst-ever defeat on Lotus. This improves on Heretics&#39; previous wins, 17-15 and 15-13, as they now boast one-third of FNATIC&#39;s losses on the map. </p>

</span> was unconcerned about FNATIC&#39;s reputation on the opening map. “Lotus is one of our better maps; it was our best before Sunset” he said after their 13-3 win. “They haven&#39;t changed too much. We know what they&#39;re going to play and how they&#39;re going to react,” he added. “We also played really well; it helps when you do that.” <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/29873/benjyfishy">
		benjyfishy	</a>
</span> agreed after the match. “I don&#39;t think we were the best prepared, but we shot very well.”</p>

<p>Team Heretics extended their ten-round win streak on the second map, Abyss. <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/10971/riens">
		RieNs	</a>
</span> gifted his team the pistol and bonus with separate triple kills, in turn leading to straightforward anti-eco rounds. FNATIC finally showed up on round 6, but they were unable to gain momentum, as <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/18350/miniboo">
		MiniBoo	</a>
</span> won a 1v1 and then found a key opening kill to set the score 7-1. </p>

<p>Identifying Heretics&#39; lurking intentions, FNATIC were able to win their second point of the map. This began a back-and-forth, with the teams trading rounds and slowly adapting to the opposition&#39;s gameplan. In the end, Heretics set up a utility heavy post-plant, winning a 3v3 to end the half 9-3. </p>

</span> with his own 3K</em></p>

<p>FNATIC won a fourth round, their first pistol of the series, with a fast mid push and using a missed Heretics lineup to weaken the defense. An impossible 3K from MiniBoo was met with <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/29867/hiro">
		hiro	</a>
</span>&#39;s own, as he clutched the bonus round to continue closing the gap. Heretics were able to win two more rounds following a timeout, but FNATIC continued taking rounds on the offense. Heretics used their second pause after FNATIC&#39;s tenth point.</p>

<p>The defenders used their half-buy to whittle FNATIC down to a 1v2, but <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/5022/derke">
		Derke	</a>
</span> was able to win the clutch and tie at 11-11. A late B execute turned into a hectic defense, putting FNATIC in the lead for their match point. RieNs single-handedly avoided the decider map, stopping the attacker&#39;s favored mid push and using his Hunter&#39;s Fury to find a fourth kill. </p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/10971/riens">
		RieNs	</a>
</span> avoided the decider map with a 4K</em></p>

<p>Derke opened the overtime with two early kills. FNATIC left the opposite site open for a plant, and the remaining Heretics players were able to explore deep before planting, their forward positioning preventing a flood onto site and leaving the defuse without enough time. benjyfishy and RieNs continued their heroics, finding three to halt FNATIC&#39;s offense. The 5v2 was won with ease, ending the map 14-12 and closing out the series 2-0.</p>

<p>“We all feel amazing. It&#39;s our first Champions playoffs win.” RieNs said after the series. “I want to be humble, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any team that can beat us,” he concluded. “We&#39;re just confident right now on every map; our map pool is super good,” benjyfishy added.</p>

<p>The victory is Team Heretics&#39; third win at Champions 2024, their debut in the marquee VCT tournament. It is also their second victory against a regional winner, as they defeated the Pacific title holders, Gen.G, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378664/gen-g-vs-team-heretics-valorant-champions-2024-winners-b" target="_blank">2-1 in the group stage</a>. </p>

<p>Heretics will <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378827/leviat-n-vs-team-heretics-valorant-champions-2024-ubsf" target="_blank">next play</a> against Leviatán, the Americas Stage 2 winners. The winner of the series will move on to the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378828/tbd-valorant-champions-2024-ubf" target="_blank">upper bracket final</a> and guarantee a top-three finish. FNATIC, meanwhile, will <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378832/g2-esports-vs-fnatic-valorant-champions-2024-lr1" target="_blank">play against</a> G2 Esports in an elimination match. </p>
