He has exported his wine — made from Sangiovese grapes and aged in barrels of French oak — across the Atlantic since the mid-1990s. Strong American demand helped grow his business, he said, and he now sells nearly 40 percent of his wine to importers in the United States.</p><p>But now, the importers are telling him to pause further shipments.</p><p>“A pillar is crumbling,” he said. “We would have never expected that we would find a closed door where we always had absolute freedom.”</p><p>Some producers said the threat of tariffs added to other recent woes, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/well/eat/nonalcoholic-beverages-health-benefits.html" title="">the rise of nonalcoholic wines, beers and spirits</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“We would have never expected that we would find a closed door where we always had absolute freedom,” said Giancarlo Pacenti, the owner of the Siro Pacenti winery. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alessandro Penso for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On the other side of the ocean, importers said the uncertainty caused by the escalating global trade war was forcing them to take a break as shipments, which travel by sea, could arrive at customs after tariffs go into effect.</p><p>“The tariffs could be 200 percent,” said Brian Larky, an American importer of Mr. Pacenti’s wines, who is based in Napa Valley, in California. “That’s enough to stop you in your tracks.”</p><p>Importers, who are responsible for paying the tariffs, could pass the cost to customers, but it would no doubt reduce sales. They could also absorb the cost of the tariffs, erasing their profits, or request that producers bear some of the burden, hitting their earnings. But with a 200 percent tariff, “we’d all end up jobless,” said Ms. Mazzetti, from the Montepulciano winery.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114155003492555395" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced his intention of imposing the crushing tariffs</a> on European wine and champagne on Truth Social on March 13. It was part of a tit-for-tat trade fight with the European Union that started with a batch of Trump-imposed tariffs. The bloc responded with what Mr. Trump called a “nasty” 50 percent tariff on American whiskey, which led him to issue his threat against “all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, &amp; ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U.
