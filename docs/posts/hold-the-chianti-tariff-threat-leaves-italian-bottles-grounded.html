It was part of a tit-for-tat trade fight with the European Union that started with a batch of Trump-imposed tariffs. The bloc responded with what Mr. Trump called a “nasty” 50 percent tariff on American whiskey, which led him to issue his threat against “all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, &amp; ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U.
