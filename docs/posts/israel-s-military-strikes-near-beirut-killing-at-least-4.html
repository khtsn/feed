It did not provide further details. Hezbollah made no immediate comment on the overnight strike.</p><p>The airstrikes, which came without an evacuation warning, killed at least four people and wounded several others, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>Lebanon’s prime minister, Nawaf Salam, said the attack was a “clear breach” of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/middleeast/cease-fire-israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">cease-fire deal</a> between Israel and Hezbollah that was agreed to in November. The truce halted Lebanon’s deadliest war in decades, but a recent uptick in violence and tension has stoked concerns of a creeping escalation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Despite the truce, Israel has repeatedly attacked purported Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, while the militant group has so far refrained from responding. Experts say that Hezbollah, battered by the 14-month war with Israel, has little impetus to risk sparking another conflict while it struggles to recover.</p><p>But Palestinian armed groups like Hamas — a key ally of Hezbollah — also maintain a sizable presence in Lebanon, operating mostly from decades-old refugee camps. During the war in Gaza, these groups intermittently launched rockets from Lebanon into northern Israel.</p><p>“We expect the Lebanese government to act against the terrorist elements that operate from their territory,” Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said at a briefing on Tuesday. “We see cooperation between Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah on Lebanese soil.”</p><p>On Friday, the Israeli military also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/middleeast/israel-beirut-evacuation-hezbollah.html" title="">launched airstrikes in the Dahiya</a> after telling residents in a densely populated neighborhood there to evacuate. It was the first time since the cease-fire that the Lebanese capital had been targeted. The attack came hours after rockets were fired at northern Israel from Lebanese territory.</p><p>Hezbollah denied any involvement in that attack on Israel and said that it remained committed to the cease-fire. The Israeli military said it had targeted a site that stored Hezbollah’s drones; it also attacked targets in southern Lebanon in response to the rocket fire, killing three people, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones at Israeli positions in solidarity with Hamas after that group led an attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. After nearly a year of low-level fighting, the violence escalated into full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah, killing nearly 4,000 people and leaving swaths of Lebanon in ruins.</p><p>It was Lebanon’s deadliest and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/europe/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-government-economy.html" title="">most destructive</a> conflict since the country’s 15-year civil war ended in 1990.</p><p>Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
