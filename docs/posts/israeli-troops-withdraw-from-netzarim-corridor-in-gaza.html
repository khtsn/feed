Israeli troops had already partly withdrawn from the Netzarim Corridor last month, leaving the foreign contractors to fill the void.</p><p>Their complete withdrawal from the corridor was required under the first 42-day phase of the cease-fire deal — which is now at the halfway point — and necessary to advance to its next stage to end the war in Gaza fully.</p><p>Significant new pitfalls to reaching an agreement for the next phase — which could involve a complete Israeli military withdrawal from all of Gaza — emerged over the past week, however, after President Trump said that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-gaza-strip-netanyahu.html" title="">United States could take over Gaza</a> and turn it into the “Rivera of the Middle East” by relocating its Palestinian residents.</p><p>On Sunday, Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry again rejected the proposal, repeating that no lasting peace agreement could be reached without creating a sovereign Palestinian state — a diplomatic goal for generations, but one that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/trump-gaza-two-state.html" title="">officials and experts now say</a> is probably all but impossible to achieve.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Egypt’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that it would host an emergency Arab summit late this month in Cairo “to address the new and dangerous developments in the Palestinian cause,” noting that the meeting was being coordinated with high level officials in Arab nations and had been scheduled at the request of Palestinian officials.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Or Levy, one of the three Israeli hostages freed by Hamas on Saturday.

The statement demanded that Israeli leaders “take the necessary humanitarian steps to rescue Alon and the other victims from the hell they are experiencing.”</p><p>“Time is running out,” the statement added. “The second phase of the deal must be advanced to bring back all the hostages.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But despite the presence of negotiators and mediators this weekend in Qatar, no progress was expected in talks concerning the next stage of the truce until Mr. Netanyahu convenes a meeting of his top security officials in the coming days.</p><p>In an interview on Saturday in Washington, where he had been meeting with the Trump administration, Mr. Netanyahu said Hamas, not he, was to blame for the hostages’ conditions. He predicted that at least a half-dozen more hostages would be released by the end of next week.</p><p>“We have three war aims in Gaza,” Mr. Netanyahu said in an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368533920112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with Fox News</a>. “One, destroy Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. Two, get all the hostages out. Three, make sure that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again. And I’m committed to achieving all three.”</p><p>Even as Israeli troops left the key corridor in Gaza, they continued raids and patrols in the occupied West Bank. Palestinian health officials there said at least two people, including a woman who was eight months pregnant, were killed in the Nour al-Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm. The Israeli military said that its police criminal investigation unit had begun an inquiry.</p><p>Hiba Yazbek<!-- --> , <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ephrat Livni<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
