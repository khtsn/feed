The gaunt appearances of three Israeli hostages who were released on Saturday, stoking public <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/08/world/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages/db9c15a3-37a0-58a4-93ee-a6e3910cf636?smid=url-share" title="">comparisons</a> to Holocaust victims, heaped new pressure on the negotiations.</p><p>In a statement on Sunday, the Israeli military said troops were “implementing the agreement” to leave the corridor and allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to continue returning home to northern Gaza.</p><p>Two Israeli military officials and a soldier in Gaza who were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly or by name said the troops had already left the Netzarim Corridor by Sunday morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Hamas also said that Israeli troops had departed from the Netzarim Corridor, saying in a statement that it was “a victory for the will of our people.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A drone view after Israeli forces withdrew from the Netzarim Corridor on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Sunday’s withdrawal from the corridor means that the presence of Israeli troops in Gaza is now mostly limited to a small sliver of land in southern Gaza, near the Egyptian border, and a buffer zone along the Israeli border.</p><p>Gaza’s interior ministry alerted Palestinians heading north on Sunday that their vehicles could still be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/middleeast/gaza-us-contractors.html" title="">inspected by foreign security contractors</a> there to prevent weapons from being transferred from the south.</p><p>“We call on citizens to be careful and adhere to moving according to the currently permitted mechanism for their safety,” the interior ministry said in a statement Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Israeli military had ordered a mass evacuation of northern Gaza in the early days of the war and patrolled the corridor, in part to prevent Palestinians from returning. Israeli troops had already partially withdrawn from the Netzarim Corridor last month, leaving the foreign contractors to fill the void.</p><p>Their complete withdrawal from the corridor was required under the first 42-day phase of the cease-fire agreement — which is now at the halfway point — and necessary to advance to the next stage of the deal to fully bring an end to the war in Gaza.</p><p>Significant new pitfalls to reaching an agreement for the next phase — which could involve a complete Israeli military withdrawal from all of Gaza — emerged over the past week, however, after President Trump said that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-gaza-strip-netanyahu.html" title="">United States could take over Gaza</a> and turn it into the “Rivera of the Middle East” by relocating its Palestinian residents.</p><p>On Sunday, Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry again rejected the proposal, repeating that no lasting peace agreement could be reached without creating a sovereign Palestinian state — a diplomatic goal for generations, but one that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/trump-gaza-two-state.html" title="">officials and experts now say</a> is likely all but impossible to achieve.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Or Levy, one of the three Israeli hostages who were freed by Hamas on Saturday.

He predicted that at least a half-dozen more hostages would be released by the end of next week.</p><p>“We have three war aims in Gaza,” Mr. Netanyahu said in an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368533920112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with Fox News</a>. “One, destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. Two, get all the hostages out. Three, make sure that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again. And I’m committed to achieving all three.”</p><p>Even as Israeli troops left the key corridor in Gaza, they continued raids and patrols in the occupied West Bank. Palestinian health officials there said at least two people, including a woman who was eight months pregnant, were killed in the Nour al-Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm. The Israeli military did not comment on any casualties.</p><p>Hiba Yazbek<!-- --> and <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
