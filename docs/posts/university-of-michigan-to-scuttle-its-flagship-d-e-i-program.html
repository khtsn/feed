But on Thursday, amid intensifying pressure on colleges from the Trump administration, Michigan said it would discontinue its diversity “strategic plan,” known as D.E.I. 2.0, and effectively dismantle the large administrative bureaucracy constructed to drive it through the university’s colleges and professional schools.</p><p>In a campuswide email, officials said Michigan would expand its existing prohibition on so-called diversity statements in faculty hiring, banning their use more broadly in admissions, promotions, awards and annual reviews. Michigan’s academic units <a href="https://president.umich.edu/news-communications/messages-to-the-community/evolving-our-approach-to-dei-and-moving-forward-together/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will also</a> be asked to “evaluate their web presence” to reflect school and federal guidance.</p><p>At the same time, the officials said, they planned to redirect funds toward expanded financial aid and student counseling, shifting resources into mental health, pre-professional guidance “and other efforts that strengthen community, promote a sense of belonging and expand accessibility.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“These decisions have not been made lightly,” the university’s president, Santa J. Ono, and other top officials wrote in their letter. “We recognize the changes are significant and will be challenging for many of us, especially those whose lives and careers have been enriched by and dedicated to programs that are now pivoting.”</p><p>School leaders have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/university-of-michigan-dei.html" title="">debating whether and how to overhaul</a> Michigan’s D.E.I. program since last spring. The Board of Regents signaled in December that changes were likely, arguing that the school’s expansive D.E.I. effort had failed to make it meaningfully more diverse or inclusive.</p><p>But Thursday’s announcement comes at a more charged moment, as the Trump administration mounts an all-out war on what it considers D.E.I. in both the public and private sectors. Through executive orders and administrative actions — and often operating under a vague and expansive definition of D.E.I. — President Trump has taken aim at an array of policies and programs in higher education, framing them as part of a pernicious and illegal spoils system for racial minorities.</p><p>Last month, the Education Department warned universities that it viewed any consideration of race in hiring or services to students — such as scholarships, housing and even graduation ceremonies — as a violation of federal law.</p><p>At the same time, the Trump administration has cited high-profile anti-Israel protests, including at Columbia University, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/hhs-ed-gsa-announce-additional-measures-end-anti-semitic-harassment-college-campuses.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to threaten the loss of federal grants</a> under laws requiring that schools receiving federal money work to prevent racial, ethnic and religious discrimination. Michigan faced similar controversies before Mr. Trump was elected: Campus protests in Ann Arbor exploded after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/magazine/university-of-michigan-dei.html" title="">complaints</a> from both Jewish and Muslim students that they had faced harassment or discrimination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Universities have sought to navigate intense pressure from Washington with rising discontent among students and faculty, many of whom have urged school leaders to fight back harder against the Trump policies and resist the administration’s efforts to dismantle D.E.I. entirely. Across the country, some schools have closed down D.E.I. programs and scrubbed websites; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/trump-dei-executive-orders-schools.html" title="">others have rebranded them</a>, hoping to avoid closer scrutiny.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Michigan once considered its D.E.I. program a model for American universities.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sylvia Jarrus for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Thursday’s announcement alluded to that pressure, citing some of Mr. Trump’s executive orders and a recent court decision supporting them. But school officials also pointed to dissatisfaction from some students and faculty, who had argued that they did not feel included in D.E.I. initiatives and that the programming “fell short in fostering connections among diverse groups.” In December, Michigan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/university-of-michigan-dei-administrator-antisemitism.html" title="">fired a senior D.E.I. administrator</a> over accusations that she had made antisemitic comments.</p><p>Even before Mr. Trump took office, other Michigan students and faculty members began lobbying to preserve the existing D.E.I. program. Thousands <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/news/focal-point/university-of-michigan-board-of-regents-allegedly-considering-cuts-to-dei/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed a petition</a> this winter attesting to what they saw as the positive impact of Michigan’s D.E.I. efforts. Many said they agreed with the broad goals of the D.E.I. program; some Black students have argued that it should be strengthened, with a greater focus on the experience of racial minorities on campus.</p><p>As Mr. Trump’s inauguration approached, however, Michigan’s largest academic unit, the College of Literature, Science and Arts, quietly paused its D.E.I. planning process, according to an email shared with The New York Times, to avoid drawing more attention from the incoming administration. In February, D.E.I. officials at Michigan circulated talking points that reframed the program as an engine of economic growth for the state and emphasizing that it consumed a tiny portion of the university’s overall budget.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Jordan Acker, a Michigan regent, said in a statement that Thursday’s announcement was about making the school’s D.E.I. program work more effectively, not dismantling it in the face of outside criticism.</p><p>“The focus of our diversity efforts needs to be meaningful change, not bureaucracy,” Mr. Acker said.</p><p>School officials are likely to face intense pushback from some students and faculty members. As word of the decision began to spread across campus on Thursday, the head of the Faculty Senate, Rebekah Modrak, called an “emergency meeting” for faculty, students and staff on Friday. In an email to her colleagues, Ms. Modrak said university leaders “seem determined to comply and to collaborate in our own destruction.”</p><p>Michigan’s current D.E.I. program — one of the largest among major public universities in the United States — was started in 2016 amid concerns that the school had failed to attract and retain enough Black students and faculty. Since then, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/magazine/dei-university-michigan.html" title="">according to an investigation published</a> by The Times Magazine in October, Michigan has spent roughly a quarter of a billion dollars on a wide range of D.E.I. initiatives aimed at improving both economic and racial diversity.</p><p>The majority of that money went to salaries and benefits for D.E.I. staff across the university’s three campuses, according to an internal accounting prepared by Michigan’s D.E.I. office last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>During roughly the same period, however, the proportion of Black students on campus did not substantially change. And in surveys, students reported a less positive campus climate than at the program’s start and less of a sense of belonging.</p><p>Some students and faculty complained that the school’s heavy emphasis on D.E.I. had chilled the intellectual climate on campus and led academic work to focus too much on questions of identity and oppression. According to one <a href="https://dei1evaluationreport.dei.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/supplemental-appendix-reports.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report produced</a> by Michigan’s D.E.I. office in 2023, nearly half of all the school’s undergraduate courses included what the office considered “D.E.I. content,” such as explorations of racial, ethnic or religious identity.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
