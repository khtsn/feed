    <h1>Daring Trump, Harris’s Campaign Says It Will Release Her Medical Information</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As president, Mr. Trump was hospitalized in 2020 when he contracted Covid-19, and his doctors at the time did not share the full extent of his illness with the public. The limited information about his health contrasts with the picture his former physician shared of him as a candidate in 2015, declaring that he would be “the healthiest person ever elected to the presidency.”</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPyzhupx1BQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> CBS News in August that he would <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-insults-harris-intelligence-medical-records-tv-exclusive/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“very gladly”</a> release his medical records to the public, but did not respond to a request from The New York Times for that information. The Times also requested Ms. Harris’s health records last month, as well as an interview with her physician. The campaign did not respond.</p><p>The sharing of medical records has become a campaign-season cudgel over the past several decades. In the 1996 presidential election, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/15/us/responding-to-dole-clinton-releases-more-health-data.html" title="">successfully pushed his opponent</a>, President Bill Clinton, to release more health information by arguing that he had not shared a full account. But there is a longer history of candidates and presidents hiding illnesses, at least initially, or being selective about what information they share.</p><p>In September 2016, Hillary Clinton, then the Democratic nominee, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/us/politics/hillary-clinton-health-donald-trump.html" title="">fell ill with pneumonia</a> while campaigning, leading to a raft of questions about her health after her aides initially covered up her illness.</p><p>Running against Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump repeatedly brought up her health on the campaign trail, often to suggest that she did not have his stamina. He also did so in the 2020 and 2024 campaigns against President Biden, calling him “sleepy” and acting confused by Mr. Biden’s damaging debate performance in June.</p></div></div>
