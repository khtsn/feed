They also follow a transit through the strait on Sunday by American and Canadian warships, in what a Chinese military spokesman called an attempt at “stirring hype” and “undermining peace and stability.”</p><p>The live-fire drills are expected to take place for four hours around China’s Niushan Island, the closest point between mainland China and Taiwan, and about 100 miles from Taipei. Drills were also scheduled at another location farther north. They were announced by the local Maritime Safety Administration in Fuzhou, the Chinese city that oversees Niushan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Taiwan appeared to downplay the significance of the drills. The island’s premier, Cho Jung-tai, told reporters in Taipei on Tuesday that the exercises were a pointless threat.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“No matter the scale of the exercises, there should not be such meaningless shows frequently or near to Taiwan,” he said. “This will only cause sudden and unnecessary tension.”</p><p>He added that the Taiwanese military would be prepared: “Nothing unexpected will happen.”</p><p>Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense struck a similar note, issuing a statement calling the drills “part of annual routine exercises” by China’s military. Still, it acknowledged that China could be using the exercises for a “deterrent effect.”</p><p>China did not give a reason for Tuesday’s live-fire exercises. But Beijing routinely uses smaller-scale exercises to convey dissatisfaction with developments related to Taiwan, and they were probably a response to the Western warships, said Shu Hsiao-huang, a researcher at Taiwan’s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, a think tank backed by Taiwan’s defense ministry.</p><p>“China often uses these kinds of small-scale exercises as a very flexible means of external propaganda,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Beijing put on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/world/asia/china-taiwan-war-games.html" title="">much larger show</a> of dissatisfaction last week, in response to a National Day speech by Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te. It sent a record number of Chinese warplanes across an informal boundary between China and Taiwan. Chinese Coast Guard boats also joined naval ships in encircling the island, and a Chinese aircraft carrier was deployed on Taiwan’s east flank. A Taiwanese official, speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity, said last week that China fired two missiles during those drills.</p><p>The exercises were aimed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/asia/china-taiwan-blockade-drills.html" title="">demonstrating how China could try to cut off Taiwan</a> if it invaded. That would make it more difficult for the United States and its allies to come to Taiwan’s aid, as President Biden has pledged to do.</p><p>The frequency of the exercises suggests that China is stepping up its intimidation efforts: The Chinese military has held two such large-scale exercises since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/19/world/asia/taiwan-president-china-us.html" title="">Mr. Lai took office in May</a>, the same number that it held over the previous eight years.</p><p>Beijing has long loathed Mr. Lai, accusing him of advocating Taiwanese independence, though Mr. Lai’s supporters say he wants self-rule without calling for outright independence.</p><p>The drills are part of a larger pressure campaign that has grown in recent years. Chinese jets already regularly fly in skies near Taiwan, testing the island’s defenses. If tensions continued rising, China would likely deploy expanded drills again, coordinating between its various military services and showing off modern warfare capabilities, said Amrita Jash, an assistant professor at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education in India who studies China’s foreign policy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But the frequency of such incursions also raises the risk of a conflict, accidental or otherwise, that could draw in the United States.</p><p>About a week after Beijing’s exercises ended, the U.S. and Canadian warships sailed through the strait. The U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet, which oversees the American ship, said in a <a href="https://www.c7f.navy.mil/Media/News/Display/Article/3940306/us-7th-fleet-destroyer-and-the-royal-canadian-navy-conduct-bilateral-transit-in/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> that the transit was routine, through waters beyond any country’s territorial waters, and “demonstrated the United States’ and Canada’s commitment to upholding freedom of navigation for all nations.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photograph released by the U.S. Navy showing an American destroyer operating  with a Canadian navy ship in the Taiwan Strait on Sunday.
