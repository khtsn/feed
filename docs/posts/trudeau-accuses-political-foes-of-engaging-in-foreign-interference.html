The Indian government had made “a horrific mistake,” Mr. Trudeau added, “in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did.”</p><p>The Indian government has vehemently denied Canada’s accusations. Mr. Modi’s government has accused Canada of harboring Sikh separatists who promote violence in their campaign to establish a Sikh enclave in India.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau spoke a day after his top aides <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/americas/trudeau-aides-india-foreign-interference.html" title="">testified before the inquiry</a> and came under intense questioning.</p><p>Last spring, a special parliamentary committee released an intelligence <a href="https://www.nsicop-cpsnr.ca/reports/rp-2024-06-03/special-report-foreign-interference.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> implicating current and former members of Parliament from different parties in foreign interference.</p><p>Individuals were named in an unredacted version, which some party leaders chose to read after getting security clearance. Mr. Poilievre declined, saying that would then bound him to secrecy regarding the report.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trudeau had long opposed measures to combat foreign meddling, downplaying its threat and opposing the creation of the inquiry where he testified.</p><p>But on Wednesday, in a shift, Mr. Trudeau emphasized the threats of foreign interference in his testimony.</p><p>He said that Canada was facing increasing attempts by hostile nations to interfere in its domestic affairs, even as he rejected accusations that his government has not done enough to thwart such meddling.</p><p>“There is no question that foreign interference and in general threats geopolitically have increased significantly around the world over the past number of years,” he said. “We need only to look at the headlines this week to see the extent of interference activities and the impact they have on Canadians.”</p><p>Tensions between Canada and India erupted last year when Mr. Trudeau accused the Indian government of orchestrating the killing of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/23/world/canada/canada-india-sikhs.html" title="">Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a>, a prominent Canadian Sikh leader in Vancouver and supporter of a separate Sikh homeland in India. The Indian government had designated Mr. Nijjar and other secessionist leaders as terrorists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trudeau spoke at the inquiry as he confronts serious challenges at home and abroad. While Canada’s diplomatic relations with India remain frozen, a movement to oust the deeply unpopular Mr. Trudeau gained momentum within his own Liberal Party.</p><p>On Tuesday, two lawmakers from his party indicated publicly that Mr. Trudeau should step down to make way for a new leader before the next general election, which must be held by next fall. Polls show that the Conservatives now enjoy a double-digit lead over Mr. Trudeau’s party.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau’s attacks Wednesday underscored how the issue of foreign interference has become intimately linked with electoral politics in Canada.</p><p>Large and well-organized Chinese and Indian diasporas in Toronto and Vancouver are some of the most coveted voters by Canada’s political parties — and the targets of China and India, the two nations most actively involved in meddling in Canada, according to intelligence reports.</p><p>Intelligence reports have shown that Beijing and its proxies have tended to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/02/world/americas/canada-elections-china.html" title="">support Liberal candidates</a> and sought to undermine Conservatives, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/15/world/americas/canada-china-election-interference.html" title="">who have taken a hard line against China on human rights and other issues</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the past, including before the inquiry last <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/world/canada/trudeau-election-interference-inquiry.html" title="">April</a>, Mr. Trudeau had sought to minimize cases of meddling by China when the episodes may have helped Liberal candidates.</p><p>But as attention over foreign interference has shifted to India, it has given Mr. Trudeau an opening to use the issue of meddling to attack the Conservatives.</p><p>In Canada’s complicated diaspora politics, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/30/world/canada/modi-canada-hindu-nationalism.html" title="">Indian-Canadian communit</a>y has become increasingly split with the rise of Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalism. Mr. Trudeau’s government has included many Sikh-Canadians at the highest levels.</p><p>For their part, the Conservatives have long had friendly relations with Mr. Modi’s government. According to the intelligence <a href="https://www.nsicop-cpsnr.ca/reports/rp-2024-06-03/special-report-foreign-interference.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> that Mr. Poilievre, the Conservative leader, declined to read in its unredacted form, India has interfered “in a Conservative Party of Canada leadership race.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Norimitsu Onishi reports on life, society and culture in Canada.
