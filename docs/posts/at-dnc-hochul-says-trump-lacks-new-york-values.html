Kathy Hochul of New York took outsize blame for a lackluster election night in her state that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/nyregion/new-york-republicans-house.html" title="">helped cost Democrats control</a> of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p><p>This week, she arrived at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago determined to prove her political acumen and demonstrate that she could help the party win back the House and the presidency in November.</p><p>Over breakfast with fellow New Yorkers, she highlighted her efforts to rebuild the state’s Democratic Party. In a meeting with a women’s group, she emphasized the impact of policies enacted by the Biden administration. And in a capstone speech on the convention floor, Ms. Hochul made a forceful case that Vice President Kamala Harris was best positioned to lead the Democratic Party and the nation into the future.</p><p>“We have kids to feed. Roads to build. Jobs to create. Real problems to solve,” Ms. Hochul said. “And we need leaders who can get it done.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>She continued: “Trump talked big about bringing back manufacturing jobs. But you know who actually did it? President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.”</p><p>The roughly five-minute speech was one of the most high-profile moments of Ms. Hochul’s career. A political journeywoman, she assumed the governorship three years ago after the resignation of Andrew M. Cuomo, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/nyregion/hochul-governor-new-york.html" title="">won a full term</a> in 2022 by a narrower-than-expected margin.</p><p>But while many of her predecessors have used similar venues to nurse their own presidential ambitions or personal interests, Ms. Hochul, 65, appeared to try a more workaday, collaborative approach that has defined her governorship.</p><p>She attacked former President Donald J. Trump, noting his litany of criminal indictments and calling him a fraud. “Trust me, America,” she said. “If you think you’re tired of Donald Trump, talk to a New Yorker.” And she spoke with pride of her own Irish-Catholic upbringing in Buffalo, where “grit,” “determination” and “compassion” were celebrated.</p><p>“Kamala Harris and Tim Walz grew up with those same values,” she said, adding that Mr. Trump did not.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Finally, Ms. Hochul pointed to billions of dollars in investments by the federal government to bring semiconductor manufacturing to places like Syracuse. That funding will be one of Mr. Biden’s lasting legacies, she said, assuring the crowd that such investments will continue if Ms. Harris is elected.</p><p>Ms. Harris, a former California senator, is expected to easily win New York in the fall. But the state is home to a half-dozen crucial swing races, from Long Island to Syracuse, that both parties say could decide the House majority.</p><p>Ms. Hochul’s <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/2024/06/20/hochul-favorability-38-49-job-approval-44-50-ratings-lowest-ever-voters-hochul-doesnt-care-about-people-like-them-or-provide-decisive-leadership-small-pluralities-think-she-works-hard-a/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approval rating</a> is at an all-time low, but she has shown herself an able fund-raiser, collecting millions of dollars for the state party and running a coordinated voter turnout operation of the sort Mr. Cuomo and other party leaders in New York never put in place.</p><p>Republicans, who have delighted in using Ms. Hochul as a foil, said they were happy to see her getting more exposure on the national stage.</p><p>“We are grateful that Kathy Hochul gets to share with the world what a failure she has been for New York,” said Savannah Viar, a spokeswoman for House Republicans’ campaign arm, citing the state’s high taxes, its migrant crisis and a recent spate of high-profile crimes.</p></div></div><div><div><p>On a night when Mr. Biden, Hillary Clinton and a handful of other party luminaries spoke, Ms. Hochul’s speech was unlikely to be remembered as clearly as those given at prior conventions by some of her predecessors. Both Mr. Cuomo and his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, successfully leveraged prime-time slots at the convention in past years to gain more national prominence.</p><p>But fellow Democrats said the timing of Ms. Hochul’s appearance showed that her loyalty to the president was paying off.</p><p>“She played her cards very carefully,” former Gov. David A. Paterson of New York said. “I can’t think of a better supporter that he has from an elected representative in this whole country.”</p><p>Ms. Hochul, for her part, seemed to revel in her first convention as a major party figure. She spoke on Monday morning at a breakfast for New York delegates alongside Representative Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate.</p><p>“She needs to have a Democratic House of Representatives to get her agenda through — full stop. Full stop,” Ms. Hochul said, referring to Ms. Harris. “And the nation needs us to do it.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The governor spent the rest of the day speaking with leaders from other states and members of the news media about the potential to tip the House in New York. At one point, Ms. Hochul, a vocal Buffalo Bills fan, even found herself signing bright yellow Cheesehead hats for Wisconsin Democrats.</p><p>“I’m committed to doing whatever it takes to win in November, even if it means signing some Packers gear,” she <a href="https://x.com/KathyHochul/status/1825594158179905643" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Fandos is a Times reporter covering New York politics and government.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-fandos">More about Nicholas Fandos</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kathy-hochul">Kathy Hochul</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
