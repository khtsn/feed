He replied, “I don’t know.”</p><p>“Wow, they talked a lot about Biden’s mental decline, but this guy can’t even remember stuff from, like, four months ago,” Seth Meyers said on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wGo3YXu8vJw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><blockquote><p>“Well, it’s been great, folks, but that’s it — I think we can roll credits on the United States.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“On ‘Millionaire,’ that’d be the warm-up question, like ‘What color is an orange?’ or ‘Name a planet with people on it.’ I mean, if you can’t answer that the president’s supposed to uphold the Constitution, I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t even let you become a citizen.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“It’s the same answer he gives when they ask where Melania lives: ‘I don’t know, I’d have to ask my lawyers.’” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“The Constitution isn’t one of Don Jr.’s birthdays. You can’t just ignore it.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Trump, asked about the economy, also doubled down on his suggestion that children could get by with fewer toys. “I don’t think a beautiful baby girl needs — that’s 11 years old needs to have 30 dolls,” he said. “I think they can have three dolls, or four dolls.”</p><blockquote><p>“Right, think of them like wives: Two, three, four would be a good number.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“All you need to know about the relationship he has with his daughters and granddaughters is he thinks 11-year-olds still play with dolls.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson. It’s a beautiful 11-year-old baby! You did so well in your 44th trimester.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“In response, Pokémon has rolled out their new slogan: ‘Pokémon, Gotta Catch a Couple!’” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“I mean, who runs on a pledge of ‘Let’s make Christmas worse for children’?” <em>— BILL MAHER</em></p><p>“A billionaire telling kids they need to cut back on dolls. That is some world-class political messaging right there.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Every interview now is like an episode of ‘Kids Say the Darndest Things.’” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3ea28cc7">The Punchiest Punchlines (May the Fourth Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“Trump also posted some bizarre AI-generated images this weekend. Some more offensive than others. First up was him as the Pope. Now, as a Catholic, let me just say, in the words of St. Peter, go <em>[expletive]</em> yourself.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“It’s not the most presidential thing, but Trump and the pope do share the same taste in interior design, so it’s not the worst fit.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“I have to say I knew this would happen. I predicted it when he went to the funeral. He saw all the gold at the Vatican and thought, ‘I could live here. This feels right to me.’” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“He was like, ‘Feeling blasphemous, might delete later.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><blockquote><p>“The White House yesterday shared an AI-generated image of President Trump with a lightsaber to celebrate Star Wars Day. And I think it says something that the lightsaber is the most believable part. Whose arm is that supposed to be? Is he from a planet where the only food is steroids?” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“He probably thinks those are his real arms.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><blockquote><p>“Trump is presenting himself as a Jedi, but his lightsaber is red, and the only way you can have a red lightsaber is by infusing its Kyber crystal with the power of your rage and hate, thereby corrupting it into a vessel for the dark side. Therefore — therefore — every one of those photos that Trump is putting out there, he’s admitting — he is admitting! — he’s not a Jedi, but in fact a Sith Lord.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“In one weekend, he upset the two most religious groups of people on the planet — Catholics and ‘Star Wars’ fans.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“The Fourth may be with you, but I’m not. But I do want to extend my congratulations to Jar Jar Binks for no longer being the most despised character in the Star Wars universe.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Noah Wyle, star of “The Pitt,” was quizzed about his knowledge of “commonly used medical tools” on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-102ce59">What We’re Excited About on Tuesday Night</h2><p>Glennon Doyle, Abby Wambach and Amanda Doyle will discuss their popular podcast-turned-book, “We Can Do Hard Things,” on “The Daily Show.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The asterisk in the original title indicates a  switch in the movie’s name that was unveiled on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mario Anzuoni/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
