Officials postponed the city’s iconic Sugar Bowl until Thursday and said they were investigating potential bombs found in the French Quarter.</p><div><p>The suspect, who died in a shootout with police officers, was identified by the F.B.I. as Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, a lifelong Texas resident. An Islamic State flag, weapons and a potential explosive device were found in the truck that officials say he used in the attack.</p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The attack:</strong> The man drove the truck, which officials said he had rented, at a high speed into crowds around 3:15 a.m. before crashing and exchanging fire with three police officers, said Anne Kirkpatrick, the New Orleans Police superintendent. Two officers were injured in the gunfight and were hospitalized, but will be OK, she added.</p></li><li><p><strong>The suspect: </strong>Mr. Jabbar served several years in the Army and was honorably discharged. He recently converted to Islam and began behaving erratically, according to his ex-wife’s husband. <a href="#suspect-new-orleans-texan-isis-flag" title="">Here’s what we know about him</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The investigation:</strong> The ISIS flag and potential bombs have raised the specter that the international terrorist group <a href="#new-orleans-attack-terrorism" title="">played a role in the attack</a>. Alethea Duncan, an assistant special agent for the F.B.I. in New Orleans, urged anyone who has had contact with the suspect in the last 72 hours to reach out to law enforcement. “We’re aggressively running down every lead, including those of his known associates,” she said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security questions:</strong> Officials said that security bollards along a section of Bourbon Street had been removed for repairs in preparation for the Super Bowl next month. Patrol cars and barriers had been set up instead, but the attacker drove around them, Superintendent Kirkpatrick said, adding, “We did indeed have a plan, but the terrorist defeated it.” <a href="#new-orleans-attack-security-system-under-repair" title="">Read more about security</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Location:</strong> The attack happened near Canal and Bourbon Streets during raucous celebrations in the French Quarter, hours before Notre Dame and the University of Georgia were scheduled to play in the Sugar Bowl at the city’s Superdome. Officials said that they would postpone the game until Thursday afternoon. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/us/french-quarter-tourist-attraction.html" title="">Read more about the French Quarter’s importance to New Orleans</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="44" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNTE3ODM1ZWEtMmFjZi01MzkyLWIwMWItN2NhNjQxNGU0NDkx"><div id="517835ea-2acf-5392-b01b-7ca6414e4491" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-vehicle-crash#517835ea-2acf-5392-b01b-7ca6414e4491"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dave-philipps"><img alt="Dave Philipps" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/reader-center/author-dave-philipps/author-dave-philipps-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/reader-center/author-dave-philipps/author-dave-philipps-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/reader-center/author-dave-philipps/author-dave-philipps-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-01T23:47:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 1, 2025, 6:47 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar served in the Army from 2007 to 2015 and deployed to Afghanistan, then served in the Army Reserve until 2020, according to an Army release, leaving with the rank of staff sergeant.

She added, “We did indeed have a plan, but the terrorist defeated it.”</p><p>Capt. Lejon Roberts, the police commander who oversees the French Quarter as part of the city’s Eighth District, said that the police car had been “strategically placed” to prevent access to Bourbon Street, where the pickup slammed into New Years revelers, killing at least 10 people and injuring about 35.</p><p>Asked about how officials regarded the possibility of someone driving around the police car, Captain Roberts said, “It wasn’t something we expected to account for.” </p><p>As federal and state officials investigated the attack, they said part of their focus would be on how the driver was able to barrel into the crowd. Gov. Jeff Landry said, “We intend to be transparent in assessing any defects that may have existed in the system so that we can address it.”</p><p>Mr. Landry issued an order declaring a state of emergency, already drafted in anticipation of the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras celebrations next month, to unlock additional resources. And he said he had called in a military police company from the Louisiana National Guard — about 100 people — to provide law enforcement support.</p><p>Alethea Duncan, an assistant special agent for the F.B.I. in New Orleans, said that officials did not believe that the driver — identified as Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, 42, of Texas — was “solely responsible” for the attack. She urged anyone who had contact with him in the prior 72 hours to reach out to law enforcement.</p><p>“We’re aggressively running down every lead, including those of his known associates,” she said.</p><p>Police officers and dogs were sweeping the streets of the French Quarter, looking for any suspicious devices. The Sugar Bowl between Notre Dame and the University of Georgia, originally scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed for 24 hours, and the police said that the venue, the Superdome, would remain under lockdown until the football game went forward on Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Landry said that he planned to attend the game, in part to demonstrate that the city and the stadium remained safe and that New Orleans would not be intimidated. Asked how he had the confidence that the game would be safe, he declared, “I’m going to be there.”</p><p>Kate Selig<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="35" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMzk0MmI0ZjItNWM4Ni01NDhlLWE2YmYtOTU0MmUyZDRkY2M4"><div id="3942b4f2-5c86-548e-a6bf-9542e2d4dcc8" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-vehicle-crash#3942b4f2-5c86-548e-a6bf-9542e2d4dcc8"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane"><img alt="Emily Cochrane" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/28/multimedia/author-emily-cochrane/author-emily-cochrane-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/28/multimedia/author-emily-cochrane/author-emily-cochrane-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/28/multimedia/author-emily-cochrane/author-emily-cochrane-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-01T21:54:10.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 1, 2025, 4:54 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The White House said President Biden had received additional briefings about the attack while at Camp David on Wednesday.

Counterterrorism specialists pointed to several telltale signs.</p><div><p>“By carrying an ISIS flag with him during the attack, the suspect wanted to show that he was a true believer, aligned with the ISIS cause, and perhaps hoping to trigger others into following suit,” said Colin P. Clarke, a counterterrorism analyst at the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm based in New York.</p><p>Mr. Clarke said the attack was a fairly sophisticated assault, given the multiple layers involved: truck ramming, firearms and improvised explosive devices.</p><p>“This horrific attack is a painful reminder of how effective ISIS propaganda is at inspiring violent extremists, including many living in the West,” he said.</p><p>U.S. officials have been warning for months that the conflict in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as unrest in Central Asia, could spill into the United States, most likely in the form of small radicalized groups acting on their own initiative or lone-wolf terrorists.</p><p>Authorities have voiced particular concern about the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/us/politics/isis-k-moscow-attack.html" title="">Islamic State Khorasan Province, or ISIS-K</a>. The group carried out deadly bombings in Iran and Russia last year, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/us/politics/terrorism-threat-fbi-tajik.html" title="">eight Tajik men</a> were detained last year after crossing the southwestern U.S. border when authorities learned they might have ties to the Islamic State.</p><p>“At a time when the terrorism threat was already elevated, the ongoing war in the Middle East has raised the threat of an attack against Americans inside the United States to a whole ’nother level,” Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said in a speech in April.</p><p>“We continue to be concerned about individuals or small groups drawing twisted inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks here at home,” Mr. Wray said.</p><p>If counterterrorism officials conclude that ISIS inspired or directed the attack in New Orleans, it would be the deadliest ISIS-related assault in the United States since a 2016 shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., killed 49 people and injured 53 others.</p><p>Since the last shards of the Islamic State’s religious state, or caliphate, were destroyed in Syria in 2019, the group has been making a slow but steady comeback. It has built on the strength of affiliates in Afghanistan and Africa, as well as in areas of Syria that were formerly controlled by Russia and Bashar al-Assad’s government.</p><p>Just last month, the United States conducted one of its largest strikes in Syria against ISIS in months, saying it hit “over 75 targets.” Earlier in 2024, the Pentagon warned that the group’s attacks in Iraq and Syria were on track to double.</p><p>But the question on the mind of investigators on Wednesday was to what extent, if at all, the suspect in New Orleans was influenced by ISIS or some other terrorist organization.</p><p>In a 2010 article in its magazine, Inspire, Al Qaeda encouraged adherents to use vehicles “to mow down the enemies of Allah.” But the tactic did not really catch on among would-be terrorists until several years later, when <a href="#vehicle-ramming-attacks" title="">the Islamic State began to call publicly</a> for vehicle attacks.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="33" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzYyYWI1Y2IxLWU3YjEtNWU0NC1iZTg2LWJlNmVjY2M0ZmU4OQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-vehicle-crash#new-orleans-attack-suspected-bombs" data-source-id="100000009903928"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/devlin-barrett"><img alt="Devlin Barrett" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-selig"><img alt="Kate Selig" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/01/reader-center/author-kate-selig/author-kate-selig-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/01/reader-center/author-kate-selig/author-kate-selig-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/01/reader-center/author-kate-selig/author-kate-selig-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-01T21:19:56.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 1, 2025, 4:19 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers around an evidence box depicting a firearm near the scene where a man drove a pickup into crowds in the French Quarter of New Orleans early on New Year’s Day.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Edmund D.

The F.B.I. said in a statement that another potential I.E.D. was found in the vehicle.</p><div><p>Officials also said other potential I.E.D.s were “located in the French Quarter.” The F.B.I. added that<strong> </strong>“special agent bomb technicians are working with our law enforcement partners to determine if any of these devices are viable and they will work to render those devices safe.”</p><p>The presence of multiple potential bombs has raised investigators’ suspicions that the attacker, identified as Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, might have had accomplices. They are looking into possible connections between Mr. Jabbar and terrorist organizations.</p><p>After a terror attack, the police often face a secondary problem: Terrified civilians tend to drop bags as they flee, forcing investigators to carefully inspect any such items as potential bombs. When a suspected explosive device is found, the police will often detonate a small charge next to the device, rather than try to disarm it.</p><p>Brian O’Brien, 57, a tour guide who lives a block from Bourbon Street, said he woke up on Wednesday to find a state trooper inspecting a cooler about 100 feet from his stoop. Mr. O’Brien said that he made coffee for the officer and walked over to ask what had been discovered. </p><p>According to Mr. O’Brien, the officer said the cooler contained pipes, tape and lots of nails, and a bomb squad arrived soon after and detonated the contents. </p><p>Mr. O’Brien recalled hearing the squad shout, “Fire in the hole!” while he sat, with his ears covered, from a safe distance. “I’m still in shock,” he said.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="32" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M1ZWY1ODFlLTg4YmYtNWYzMC1hYjkzLWYxZmNjYmZkMTNiNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-vehicle-crash#sugar-bowl-postponed-new-orleans-attack" data-source-id="100000009903896"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/billy-witz"><img alt="Billy Witz" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-billy-witz/author-billy-witz-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-billy-witz/author-billy-witz-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-billy-witz/author-billy-witz-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-01T21:07:50.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 1, 2025, 4:07 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Superdome in New Orleans last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Kaufman/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Sugar Bowl organizers took the extraordinary step of postponing the college football playoff game that was scheduled for Wednesday night at the Superdome in New Orleans, after a 42-year-old man rammed a pickup into New Year’s revelers in the early morning hours on Bourbon Street and killed at least 15 people.</p><p>The game, a playoff matchup between Notre Dame and Georgia, is now scheduled to be played on Thursday afternoon.</p><div><p>The Super Bowl is scheduled to be played at the Superdome, not far from the scene of the attack, on Feb. 9.</p><p>Postponements of major sports events are rare and have happened typically because of storms or earthquakes.

Fountain for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The man killed in a shootout with the police after ramming into dozens of revelers in New Orleans early on New Year’s Day was Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, a native of Texas who had served with the U.S. Army, officials confirmed on Wednesday as they sought to determine a motivation for the attack. </p><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that it was examining an Islamic State flag that was found in the truck used in the attack and that it believed the Mr. Jabbar “was not solely responsible.” Several improvised explosive devices were found and disposed of, officials said.</p><div><p>Mr. Jabbar, who officials confirmed was honorably discharged from the Army, had converted to Islam at some point, according to Dwayne Marsh, who is married to Mr. Jabbar’s ex-wife Nakedra Charrlle.<span>  </span>Mr. Jabbar and Ms. Charrlle had two daughters, ages 15 and 20, Mr. Marsh said, adding that “the girls are a mess” after the attack.</p><p>In recent months, he said, Mr. Jabbar had been acting erratically, “being all crazy, cutting his hair” after converting, Mr. Marsh said. Mr. Marsh and his wife then stopped allowing the daughters to spend time with Mr. Jabbar, he said.</p><p>In a YouTube video from 2020 that appears to have been posted by Mr. Jabbar, he spoke positively about his skills in real estate. He said he had been born and raised in Beaumont, Texas, and had served in the U.S. military. </p><p>“I’ve been here all my life, with the exception of traveling for the military,” he said. Court records from his first divorce, in 2012, list his employment as active duty with the U.S. Army and his residence at the time as Fort Bragg, in North Carolina.</p><p>In the video, Mr. Jabbar said that in his 10 years in the armed forces, he had worked as a human resources specialist and an information technology specialist. </p><p>Criminal records in Texas show that Mr. Jabbar had previously been charged with minor infractions — once in 2002 for a misdemeanor theft and once in 2005 for driving with an invalid license.</p><p>The vehicle used in the New Orleans attack, an electric Ford pickup, was registered to a Houston man who made vehicles available for rent on a peer-to-peer car sharing website. That man, who asked that his name not be made public, said that he and his family had been preparing for an outing to the zoo on Wednesday morning when he saw the news of the attack and recognized his truck as the one involved.</p><p>The man said the F.B.I. called him and he explained that he had not been driving the vehicle but had rented it out. He said he had been asked by the federal agents not to discuss the matter publicly.</p><p>Records show that Mr. Jabbar was married twice, with his first marriage, to Ms. Charrlle, ended in 2012. In the midst of a second divorce in January 2022, Mr. Jabbar wrote an email to his wife’s lawyer in which he described financial problems. “I cannot afford the house payment,” he wrote.</p><p>“It is past due in excess of $27,000 and in danger of foreclosure if we delay settling the divorce,” he wrote.</p><p>He said in the email that the business corporation he had formed, a real estate company, had lost more than $28,000 in the previous year and that he had taken on $16,000 in credit card debt in order to pay for lawyers and for “establishing a second residence.” He suggested in the email that he and his wife sell the house and divide the proceeds evenly.</p><p>But in a court document from August 2022, he said he worked at the accounting firm Deloitte and made about $120,000 a year.</p><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs<!-- --> contributed reporting, and <!-- -->Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research. </p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzA0NTRiNDAyLTFiNmQtNTM2MS04MGNiLTI3Mzk2MmY1OTk2MA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-vehicle-crash#witnesses-french-quarter-attack" data-source-id="100000009903752"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/keith-bradsher"><img alt="Keith Bradsher" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/12/universal/Keith-Bradsher/Keith-Bradsher-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/12/universal/Keith-Bradsher/Keith-Bradsher-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/12/universal/Keith-Bradsher/Keith-Bradsher-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-01T18:07:37.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 1, 2025, 1:07 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kimberly Stricklin, left, and her husband Michael Stricklin, on Canal Street at the intersection with Bourbon Street on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Keith Bradsher/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Kimberly Stricklin and her husband, Michael Stricklin, visitors from Mobile, Ala., were crossing Canal Street in New Orleans early on New Year’s morning when they saw and heard a pickup truck suddenly accelerate in front of them.</p><p>The pickup swung right onto Bourbon Street, slamming into pedestrians. “We heard him punch the gas and then the impact and then the screams,” Mrs. Stricklin said in an interview at the corner of Canal and Bourbon.

The mayor of New Orleans at first said it was, but a local F.B.I. official countered that it was not. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and F.B.I. officials in Washington then said they were in fact investigating the incident as terrorism.</p><div><p>The F.B.I. said that in the attack, the suspect, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, a U.S. citizen from Texas, drove a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year’s revelers on Bourbon Street around 3:15 a.m. on Wednesday. A flag of the Islamic State terror group was found in the vehicle, the agency said. One law enforcement official familiar with the investigation described the flag as “furled,” suggesting its significance was not immediately apparent to law enforcement responding to the chaotic crime scene.</p><p>F.B.I. officials, who are typically cautious in public statements until investigators can gather more evidence about a suspect’s intentions, said on Wednesday that as law enforcement officials learned more —<span>  </span>including about the discovery of a cooler containing an improvised bomb next to the suspect’s vehicle — they became more certain it was a terror attack. The combination of a truck used as a weapon, along with the flag and the bomb, led investigators to believe that the perpetrator’s goal was to cause additional casualties on civilians.</p><p>Many elected officials and member of the public think of terrorism primarily as a method of violence, such as using a vehicle, gun, or bomb to kill random civilians on a street. To investigators and prosecutors, however, motive or ideology is an important part of defining terrorism.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
