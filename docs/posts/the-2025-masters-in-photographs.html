    <h1>The 2025 Masters In Photographs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Masters Tournament is a symbolic start of spring in North America, and the hundreds of acres of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/masters-augusta-pollen-allergies.html" title="">magnificent flora</a> at Augusta National Golf Club — azaleas, pink dogwood, yellow jasmine, magnolia and oak trees, and hundreds more varieties of flowers, shrubs and trees for which the course’s 18 holes are famously named — are a breathtaking backdrop for the first major tournament of the men’s golf season.</p><p>Rory McIlroy, a 35-year-old Irishman, began Sunday’s final round at 12 under par, followed closely by the two-time U.S. Open winner Bryson DeChambeau at 10 under. Scottie Scheffler, the 2022 and 2024 Masters champion, was in a four-way tie for sixth at five under par.</p><p>McIlroy is making his 17th attempt for the green jacket on Sunday, which would complete a career Grand Slam. He narrowly missed a Masters win in 2022 when he finished as runner-up.</p></div></div>
