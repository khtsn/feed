    <h1>The 2025 Masters In Photographs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Masters Tournament is a symbolic start of spring in North America, and the hundreds of acres of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/masters-augusta-pollen-allergies.html" title="">magnificent flora</a> at Augusta National Golf Club — azaleas, pink dogwood, yellow jasmine, magnolia and oak trees, and hundreds more varieties of flowers, shrubs and trees for which the course’s 18 holes are famously named — are a breathtaking backdrop for the first major tournament of the men’s golf season.</p><p>Rory McIlroy, a 35-year-old Irishman who had previously competed in the Masters 16 times, won his first green jacket on Sunday. The tournament ended in a playoff between McIlroy and Englishman Justin Rose, who both ended the final round at 11 under par.</p><p>McIlroy’s win places him among a select few golfers to achieve a career Grand Slam — victories in golf’s four major championships. He narrowly missed a Masters win in 2022 when he finished as runner-up.</p></div></div>
