    <h1>The 2025 Masters In Photographs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Masters Tournament is a symbolic start of spring in North America, and the hundreds of acres of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/masters-augusta-pollen-allergies.html" title="">magnificent flora</a> at Augusta National Golf Club — azaleas, pink dogwood, yellow jasmine, magnolia and oak trees, and hundreds more varieties of flowers, shrubs and trees for which the course’s 18 holes are famously named — are a breathtaking backdrop for the first major tournament of the men’s golf season.</p><p>Justin Rose began Saturday’s third round at eight under par, followed closely by the two-time U.S. Open winner Bryson DeChambeau at seven under and the 2022 Masters runner-up Rory McIlroy tied with Corey Connors at six under. Scottie Scheffler, the 2022 and 2024 Masters champion, was in a four-way tie for fifth at five under par.</p><p>Rose, a 44-year-old Englishman, has led or shared the lead after a round at the Masters 10 times, including on both Thursday and Friday, but has never won a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/sports/golf/green-jacket-masters.html" title="">green jacket</a>. He finished as a runner-up in 2015 and again in 2017, when he lost in a playoff to Sergio Garcia.</p></div></div>
