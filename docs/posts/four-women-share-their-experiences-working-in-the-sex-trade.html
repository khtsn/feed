She was an essential link in making this film; her trust and love in the community made it possible for the women to open up to us.</p><p>To ensure the women felt comfortable sharing their often ignored stories without fear of judgment or compromised privacy, we chose to incorporate animation. Collaborating with illustrator and animator Ola Szmida was crucial. Her distinctive, stream-of-consciousness animation conveys the nuanced emotions and inner worlds of the women.</p><p>This film is about listening and understanding, seeing beyond the surface to the common threads that bind us all — resilience, loneliness, and the search for connection and purpose. We hope it fosters greater empathy and insight into lives that deserve to be understood and valued.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
