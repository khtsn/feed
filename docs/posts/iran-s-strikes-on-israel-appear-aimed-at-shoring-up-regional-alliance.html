    <h1>Iran’s Strikes on Israel Appear Aimed at Shoring Up Regional Alliance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Iran’s success in crafting an alliance across the region was ironically helped on by the United States’ invasion of Iraq in 2003, as its yearslong occupation spurred the formation of many Shiite Muslim militias, with support from the regional Shiite power, Iran. These militias helped Iran forge a chain of alliances across the region, linking it geographically with its most important and powerful ally, Hezbollah, in Lebanon.</p><p>Their potency seemed to culminate with Iran’s success, thanks largely to Hezbollah’s forces, in helping Syria crush a rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad. In more recent years, Hezbollah and Iran began fostering ties with the Houthis, offering it more leverage against its longtime regional Gulf rival, Saudi Arabia, with whom it has now established diplomatic relations. But now, under heavy pressure from Israeli attacks in the wake of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 assault, Iran fears that network is at risk of unraveling.</p><p>Though the situation has recently looked dire for Iran’s allies, in particular Hezbollah, many analysts predict the dynamic could change if Israel were to push forward with what it has called limited ground operations in Lebanon. Ms. Yahya called that possibility a “favor to Hezbollah,” whose roots in guerrilla warfare could make a troop presence costlier for Israel than attacks by air.</p><p>Reports from southern Lebanon underline such claims, with Israel announcing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/israel-soldier-killed-lebanon-invasion.html?smid=url-share" title="">the deaths of eight of its soldiers</a> by Wednesday.</p><p>“Israel cannot kill the octopus — they won’t be able to eradicate it,” said Kassem Kassir, a Lebanese expert on Hezbollah who is close to the group. “The fight will continue.”</p><p>Some experts see Iran’s latest attack more as a message than an attempt to inflict serious damage, though it did manage to strike an Israeli air base and near the headquarters of its intelligence services, the Mossad. At the same time, Iranian officials <a href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/222309/Iran-sent-warning-message-to-United-States" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> they had informed Switzerland, a country they often rely on as an intermediary, when they launched their attack, allowing for some advance warning.</p><p>A similar attempt, however, failed at restoring deterrence in April, when Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel in retaliation for a strike on its embassy in Damascus — an attack it telegraphed well in advance, in what was seen as an attempt to avoid causing so much damage that escalation was inevitable.</p><p>Iranian leaders said they refrained for months from a second attack on the back of promises and gestures from the United States and Europe that Iran’s restraint would enable a cease-fire in Lebanon and Gaza, experts said, as well potentially restarting negotiations on a nuclear deal.</p><p>They now feel such overtures were “entirely false,” as Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said this week.</p><p>“The view in Iran is that the West is, at best, unwilling to restrain Israel, and at worst, has a direct hand in the escalation,” said Mohammed Shabani, an Iran analyst and editor at the independent news site Amwaj.media. “The latest Iranian operation against Israel, therefore, certainly is accompanied by a message that Biden should act to draw a line under things.”</p><p>And with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/world/middleeast/israel-retaliate-iran-missile-attack.html" title="">officials</a> in Israel, and Republicans in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah#in-congress-republicans-urge-israel-to-strike-back-hard-at-iran" title="">Congress</a>, calling this a moment to go after Iran, experts say the leadership in Tehran may see few reasons not to rapidly pursue nuclear weapons.</p><p>Deterrence or no, Iran and its allies may feel there is now little left to lose, said Ms. Yahya.</p><p>“There have been increasing noises from different policymakers saying ‘regime change, new order in the Middle East’ — this is the language we heard in 2003 when the United States invaded Iraq,” she said. “And we can see the disaster that ended up in.”</p></div></div>
