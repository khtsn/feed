Two vehicles exploded outside the synagogue, and the doors to the building were also set on fire, the statement said.</p><p>Five people, including the rabbi, were inside the synagogue at the time. No one was killed, but one police officer responding to the explosions was hurt when a gas bottle near one of the vehicles also exploded, the statement said.</p><p>The suspect, who was caught on video surveillance, hid with a hatchet after setting the fire, Gérald Darmanin, France’s interior minister, said in a television interview. He added that the suspect appeared to be waiting for people to leave the synagogue before police arrived.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The suspect and law enforcement traded gunfire during the arrest, which occurred about 11:30 p.m. Saturday, and the suspect was wounded in the face, according to the prosecutor’s office. Two other people were also taken into custody, whom the prosecutor’s office referred to as the suspect’s “entourage,” without providing additional details.</p><p>Mr. Darmanin said police officers responded to the scene in less than two minutes because they had just finished a patrol near the synagogue, which, like many Jewish institutions around France, is under heightened protection because of persistent fears of antisemitic attacks.</p><p>“A tragedy was probably avoided” by the quick police response, Mr. Darmanin said.</p><p>Mr. Darmanin said in the interview, on France 2 television, that the suspect arrived in France in 2016, and fathered a child born three years later in the country, which allowed the suspect to obtain a temporary residency permit.</p><p>Mr. Darmanin said the suspect had a record for illegal drug consumption and driving without insurance, but was not on the radar of French or foreign antiterrorism services. French intelligence agencies did not believe he had acted on behalf of a larger organization, Mr. Darmanin added.</p><p>But Mr. Darmanin added that the police had not yet been able to question the suspect because he was still hospitalized after being wounded.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>6</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Suspect Held After Attack on Synagogue in France<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
