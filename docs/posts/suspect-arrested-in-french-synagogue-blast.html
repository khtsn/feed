In the process, the man was wounded in the face, the statement said. The extent of his injuries and whether the arresting officers were injured were not immediately clear.</p><p>Two other people were also taken into custody, the statement said, referring to them as members of the suspect’s “entourage” without providing further details.</p><p>The suspect was arrested in Nîmes, a city about 24 miles from La Grande Motte, the resort town on the southern coast where the attack took place. Two vehicles exploded outside the Beth Yaacov synagogue. The doors to the building were also set on fire, the antiterrorism prosecutor’s office said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>French authorities have publicly condemned the attack, which comes during a time of mounting fears about antisemitism in the country. In the first three months of 2024, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/world/europe/french-election-antisemitism-jews.html" title="">France recorded more than 360 antisemitic episodes</a>. That is an average of four a day — and an increase of 300 percent over the same period in 2023, the government said.</p><p>“To attack a French person because he is Jewish is to attack all French people,” Gabriel Attal, the prime minister, <a href="https://x.com/GabrielAttal/status/1827419887255372227" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on the social media platform X</a> before the arrest, adding that nearly 200 law enforcement officers had been mobilized to find the suspect.</p><p>The attack has sharpened anxiety and reopened painful memories for Jews across France, which has the largest Jewish population in Western Europe and a history of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/world/europe/2-months-after-attack-paris-kosher-market-reopens.html" title="">deadly</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/books/review/marc-weitzmann-hate.html" title="">antisemitic</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/05/world/europe/torture-and-death-of-jew-deepen-fears-in-france.html" title="">attacks</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/world/europe/france-new-anti-semitism.html" title="">messaging</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">war in Gaza</a> has only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/europe/europe-antisemitism-israel-hamas.html" title="">heightened tensions</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/12/world/europe/france-antisemitism-march.html" title="">debates about antisemitism</a> in France, where antisemitism and support for Israel emerged as prominent themes in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/world/europe/french-election-antisemitism-jews.html" title="">recent national elections</a>.</p><p>The far-right National Rally party, once known for antisemitism and tinged with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/world/europe/france-far-right-bardella-national-rally.html" title="">Nazi nostalgia</a>, emphatically expressed its support for Israel. The left, by contrast, tends to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/world/europe/france-election-new-popular-front-far-right.html" title="">pro-Palestinian</a> in policies and statements. </p></div></div><div><div><p>The attack on the synagogue in La Grande Motte could have been far worse. Five people, including the rabbi, were inside when the vehicles exploded. No one was killed, but one police officer responding to the explosions was hurt when a gas bottle near one of the vehicles exploded, the antiterrorism unit said.</p><p>National antiterrorism prosecutors are investigating the episode as a terrorism-motivated assassination attempt, among other charges.</p><p>“We probably avoided an absolute tragedy,” Mr. Attal, the prime minister, <a href="https://x.com/GabrielAttal/status/1827419887255372227" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p><p>Aurelien Breeden<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amelia Nierenberg is a breaking news reporter for The Times in London, covering international news<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/amelia-nierenberg">More about Amelia Nierenberg</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Women’s Safety in India: </strong>The rape and murder of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/asia/india-women-safety-rape.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">a trainee doctor at a hospital in Kolkata</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/asia/india-women-safety-rape.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article"> </a>has raised uncomfortable truths about a country that wants to be a global leader.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Plant Messiah’</strong><strong>: </strong>Carlos Magdalena, whose botanical adventures have shades of Indiana Jones, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/europe/carlos-magdalena-flowers-royal-botanic-gardens-kew.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">was a driving force in saving the world’s smallest water lily</a> and finding the largest one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Old Bombs, Deep Lakes</strong><strong>: </strong>Switzerland is offering $58,000 in prize money for ideas to remove munitions from the depths, in case they start polluting.
