A CT scan carried out Tuesday showed the “onset of bilateral pneumonia” which required additional drug therapy, the Vatican added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Nevertheless, Pope Francis is in good spirits,” and was grateful for the prayers for his recovery, the Vatican said.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Matteo Bruni, a Vatican spokesman, told reporters at a news briefing at the Vatican that the pope had rested, eaten breakfast and had read newspapers “as he usually does.”</p><p>The Vatican said earlier that the pope would not be attending events through the weekend. Francis delegated a Vatican prelate to participate in a Mass for him on Sunday. Last week, Francis was unable to attend another scheduled event, for artists, at the Vatican.</p><p>This is the fourth time Francis has stayed at the hospital, the Policlinico A. Gemelli.<br/></p><p>In 2021, he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/04/world/europe/pope-francis-surgery.html" title="">colon surgery</a> there. In 2023, he was admitted for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/world/europe/pope-francis-hospital-tests.html" title="">respiratory infection</a> but went home after three days. He was hospitalized again a few months later to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/world/europe/pope-francis-hospital.html" title="">undergo abdominal surgery</a> for a hernia. Last February, he underwent diagnostic tests at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/pope-francis-hospital.html" title="">Gemelli hospital</a> after a slight flu.</p><p>As a young man, he had the upper lobe of his right lung removed, and he is prone to bouts of influenza and bronchitis during the cold winter months. His medical challenges have increased in recent years. Because of knee problems and sciatica, he often uses a wheelchair, walker or cane.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Francis’ engagements have increased since the start of the <a href="https://www.iubilaeum2025.va/en.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2025 Jubilee</a> — a year of faith, penance and forgiveness of sins that takes place every quarter-century — which opened on Christmas Eve.
