The White House hit back with a series of financial threats and penalties.</p><p>The Trump administration has argued that its goal in going after elite universities is to crack down on antisemitism on college campuses. But <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Letter-Sent-to-Harvard-2025-04-11.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its demands are much broader</a>, including rooting out diversity programs and performing audits of the student body’s ideological views.</p><p>“It is a privilege to have foreign students attend Harvard University, not a guarantee,” Ms. Noem wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times. “The United States government understands that Harvard University relies heavily on foreign students funding from over 10,000 foreign students to build and maintain their substantial endowment. At the same time, your institution has created a hostile learning environment for Jewish students due to Harvard’s failure to condemn antisemitism.”</p><p>The sweeping request from Ms. Noem comes as hundreds of international students across the United States have had their visas revoked in recent weeks, causing alarm on campuses and a string of federal lawsuits seeking to overturn the decisions. In other cases, officials from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement have arrested students for protesting against Israel on college campuses.</p><p>Sarah Kennedy-O’Reilly, a Harvard spokeswoman, said the university was aware of the letter from Ms. Noem, which she said “follows on the heels of our statement that Harvard will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. We continue to stand by that statement.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Noem wrote that ICE’s <a href="https://www.ice.gov/sevis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Student and Exchange Visitor Program</a> could withdraw its approval of Harvard as a school that international students can attend if it did not meet a demand for records by April 30.</p><p>Her demand also includes information about campus “disciplinary actions taken as a result of making threats to other students or populations or participating in protests which impacted their nonimmigrant student status.”</p><p>It was the Trump administration’s latest move against Harvard after the school <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/harvard-trump.html" title="">refused this week</a> to cave to what the school’s president called “assertions of power, unmoored from the law.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-status.html" title="">threatened Harvard’s tax-exempt status</a>, even <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7217" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">though federal law</a> prohibits the president from “directly or indirectly” telling the Internal Revenue Service to conduct specific tax investigations. Still, the I.R.S. is weighing whether to revoke Harvard’s tax exemption, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-irs-harvard.html" title="">according to three people familiar with the matter.</a></p><p>“This newer tactic will damage the reputation of the U.S. higher education long earned over the course of centuries, and compromises the U.S.’s position as the global leader in higher education,” said P. Deep Gulasekaram, a professor of immigration law at the University of Colorado Law School. He said it would “also more systemically and long-term degrade the incentives for the best and brightest from around the globe to come to the U.S. to study, research, and innovate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Harvard has a higher percentage of international students than the average American college. About a quarter of its students, both graduate and undergraduate, are foreign.</p><p>While Harvard is among the 20 American universities with the highest percentage of international undergraduate students, coming in at No. 18 on a recent <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/harvard-university-2155" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. News &amp; World Report list</a>, it’s likely that Harvard relies less on income from those students than practically any other major university in the country.</p><p>Unlike some schools that work to attract wealthy international students to shore up their bottom lines, Harvard attracts undergraduate applications from international students who do not have the wherewithal to pay, according to Terry Mady-Grove, a college admissions adviser in Port Washington, N.Y.</p><p>“Harvard provides the same financial aid to domestic and international students,” Ms. Mady-Grove said in an email. “So, the financial impact on Harvard would be less than at other institutions.”</p><p>The financial aid package was recently increased to cover the full cost of attendance for students from families with annual incomes of $200,000 and below. The package — the exact same for domestic and international undergraduates — includes not only the annual tuition, but also housing, food and health insurance.</p><p>For these students, Harvard even throws in money for a winter coat.</p><p>Steven Rich<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Luke Broadwater covers the White House for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Stephanie Saul reports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Higher Education in America</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Harvard Under Fire:</strong> President Trump threatened Harvard University’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-status.html">tax-exempt status</a> after the school <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/harvard-trump.html">rebuffed the administration’s demands</a> ostensibly aimed at purging “woke” ideology.
