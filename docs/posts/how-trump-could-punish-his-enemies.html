He wants President Biden to be prosecuted for corruption, Nancy Pelosi for her husband’s stock trades and Google for its search results about Trump and Harris. His list of targets for investigation also includes state prosecutors, judges and former officials from the F.B.I. and other parts of the Justice Department.</p><p>If Trump wins, he can use the Justice Department, including the F.B.I., to seek revenge against his political enemies — even if, as in the cases above, there is little or no evidence of a crime. Doing so would go far beyond anything Trump pursued in his first term.</p><p>There are multiple safeguards in the American legal system. They largely held when Trump was president. Will they hold again if he has a second term? We posed that question to 50 former top officials from the Justice Department and the White House Counsel’s Office, along with a few retired judges and nonpartisan career D.O.J. lawyers. The former officials, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, have served seven presidents.</p><p>Most of them are freaked out about Trump’s potential impact on the Justice Department, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/magazine/trump-justice-department-rivals.html" title="">we wrote today in a story for The New York Times Magazine</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-17ad90c2">Sounding an alarm</h2><p>Here’s what they told us.</p><ul><li><p>Forty-two of the 50 former officials said it was very likely or likely that a second Trump term would pose a significant threat to the norm of keeping criminal enforcement free of White House influence, a policy that has been in place since the Watergate scandal.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Thirty-nine of 50 said it was likely or very likely that Trump, if elected, would order the Justice Department to investigate a political adversary. (Six more said it was possible.) This, too, is something presidents don’t do.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The respondents were more split on how the Justice Department would respond. Twenty-seven of the 50 said it was very likely or likely that career prosecutors at the D.O.J. would follow orders and pursue the case. Thirteen said it was possible. Nine said it was unlikely or very unlikely.</p></li></ul><p>Not everyone was panicked. A handful of respondents rejected our survey’s premise, saying we had unfairly or unnecessarily focused on Trump. The survey was an example of “mainstream media bias,” one Reagan-appointed official said, “that permits liberal prosecutors to violate norms for the rule of law with limited oversight in the court of public opinion.” Other former officials said the department’s career professionals would keep Trump in check.</p><p>But several Republican appointees, along with Democratic ones, warned that an extremist president in general, and Trump in particular, was the biggest threat they saw to the rule of law. “There is every reason to believe that Donald Trump would seek to use criminal enforcement and the F.B.I. as leverage for his personal and political ends in a second term,” said Peter Keisler, a founder of the conservative Federalist Society who was an acting attorney general for President George W. Bush, capturing a common sentiment we heard.</p><h2 id="link-5819fdb7">Imposing his will</h2><p>How would a politically motivated prosecution unfold? With help from our colleagues, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/02/magazine/trump-politics-justice-department.html" title="">we created this digital feature</a> showing the steps Trump could take to jail his adversaries.</p><p>Here’s how it could start: Justice Department leaders nominated by the president typically set up a task force to investigate a set of allegations. With a handpicked group of F.B.I. agents and prosecutors, Trump’s appointees could open an inquiry into, say, Merrick Garland’s decision to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Trump. Even if Garland is never indicted or convicted, defending himself will cost him lots of money and hurt his reputation. In some ways, Trump will have successfully punished his enemies just by naming them as targets.</p><p>It’s possible for F.B.I. agents and D.O.J. career lawyers to block a case from going forward by telling their superiors that they don’t have enough evidence, resigning, leaking to the press or notifying Congress. But that demands a lot of them. For some, it will be simpler just to follow orders by seeking the desired indictment from a grand jury.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Trump could also fire en masse career D.O.J. employees who might stand in the way. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s plan for the next Republican administration, recommends removing civil-service protections from tens of thousands of federal employees who supervise other government workers. Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025, but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CNN found</a> that at least 140 people who worked in his administration had contributed to the report.</p><p>“We don’t know what will happen,” Keisler acknowledged about the implications of Trump’s re-election for the rule of law. “But the risk is more concrete, with a higher probability, than in any election in my lifetime.”</p><p><em>Read our story about </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/magazine/trump-justice-department-rivals.html" title=""><em>why legal experts are worried about a Trump presidency</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="link-24f4bb57">More on the election</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Melania Trump</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><ul><li><p>Melania Trump, in a new memoir, says she supports abortion rights, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/melania-trump-memoir-defends-abortion-rights" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Guardian reported</a>. “Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?” she wrote.</p></li><li><p>Tim Walz <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/walz-debate-campaign.html" title="">acknowledged misspeaking at the debate</a> about his time in Hong Kong and about meeting with victims of gun violence. “I need to be clearer,” he said.</p></li><li><p>At the debate, JD Vance seemed to retreat from his proposal to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/vance-obamacare-trump-aca.html" title="">separate healthy and sick people</a> in insurance markets, which could cause disruptions for people with pre-existing conditions</p></li><li><p>Trump is “joking around” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/lara-trump-donald-trump-harris-intellect-attacks.html" title="">when he calls Harris stupid</a>, the Republican Party chair — who is also Trump’s daughter-in-law — said.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-282c9dd5">Trump Jan. 6 Case</h2><ul><li><p>Jack Smith, the special counsel, revealed new evidence <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/trump-jan-6-case-jack-smith-evidence.html" title="">about Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election</a> in a legal brief.
