Trump used the presidential debate to spread debunked rumors that Haitians were stealing pets and eating them.</p><p>On Thursday, bomb threats led to the evacuation of Springfield City Hall, two schools and the state motor vehicle agency’s local facility. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mayor Rue said that the threats, which came by email, were a “hateful response to immigration in our town.”</p><p>“Obviously, the negative response and threats are very sad and hard to handle,” he said. “We want to move forward together, and it just makes it more difficult to do that when we have violent actions and threats.”</p><p>Even before the debate, the city had been drawing attention, stirred by Mr. Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, and others who sought to portray the influx of Haitians as a failure of the Biden administration’s immigration policies.</p><p>“It’s frustrating when national politicians, on the national stage, mischaracterize what is actually going on and misrepresent our community,” Mr. Rue said.</p><p>While the arrival of thousands of Haitian immigrants has strained schools and some government services, most of the Haitians are in the United States legally and many have filled jobs in local industry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But it was the death of 11-year-old Aiden Clark, killed last year when his school bus was struck by a minivan driven by a Haitian immigrant, that began fueling anger and anxiety, ultimately thrusting Springfield into a vitriolic national debate over immigration.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Vance referred to Aiden in a <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833505359513661762" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a>, saying that “a child was murdered by a Haitian migrant.”</p><p>Later that day, Aiden’s father, Nathan Clark, lashed out at Mr. Vance and others he said were exploiting his son’s death for political gain.</p><p>“My son was not murdered. He was accidentally killed by an immigrant from Haiti,” Mr. Clark, a teacher, said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/us/trump-vance-aiden-clark-springfield-ohio.html" title="">at a Springfield City Commission meeting</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“This tragedy is felt all over this community, the state and even the nation, but don’t spin this towards hate,” he continued.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Haitians have filled jobs in manufacturing and other sectors.

The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating — they’re eating the pets of the people that live there.”</p><p>Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, and other Republicans posted mocking videos with kittens that went viral. Elon Musk also joined the social media frenzy.</p><p>The Haitians have filled jobs in manufacturing, distribution and other sectors and been welcomed by many employers. But the volume and pace of arrivals has put pressure on housing, health care and schools in the city, which is between Columbus and Dayton and had nearly 60,000 residents in 2020, according to census figures that year.</p><p>Estimates of the number of Haitians who have arrived range from 12,000 to 20,000.</p><p>“We can’t deny that adding 25 to 30 percent to our population in a three-year period would overwhelm services,” Mr. Rue said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Gov. Mike DeWine announced this week that the state would provide Springfield with $2.5 million to ease strains on primary health care, and would deploy members of the state highway patrol to improve road safety. The mayor said that he was still hoping to receive federal assistance.</p><p>Some local residents have aired grievances about the newcomers at City Commission meetings, with several saying that the Haitians are “invading” their city and receiving benefits to the detriment of Americans. Some have also said Haitians have low IQs and uttered other racist tropes.</p><p>The video of Mr. Clark’s speech circulated widely in conservative media. Some outlets, such as <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/parents-of-aiden-clark-say-they-wish-son-was-killed-by-white-man-instead-of-haitian-because-gop-used-it-as-example-of-migrant-crime" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the far-right digital outlet The Post Millennial</a>, seized on Mr. Clark’s remark that he wished his son had been killed by a 60-year-old white man because it would have spared the family from “hate-spewing people.”</p><p><a href="https://1ec9ca31.streaklinks.com/CHgDCJd5ObDDrD9tYQKEwGfs/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theblaze.com%2Fnews%2Ffather-of-11-year-old-killed-in-road-accident-caused-by-haitian-wishes-he-d-been-killed-by-white-man" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Another site</a>, Blaze Media, which was founded by the former Fox News host Glenn Beck, took the same angle. It was shared on Telegram late Tuesday by the National Justice Party, <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/national-justice-party" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">characterized as a white-supremacist group</a> by the Anti-Defamation League, along with a threatening comment: “These parents should be executed.”</p><p>The post and threat were then re-shared by other Telegram users. The posts were <a href="https://theracket.news/p/we-deserve-better-a-haitian-perspective-from-springfield-ohio-immigration" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported by The Racket</a>, an online newsletter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Springfield’s mayor, Mr. Rue, said that he had received a spate of menacing phone calls.</p><p>Last month, Nazi sympathizers — masked men in matching red shirts, black pants and boots — waved swastika flags as they marched in downtown Springfield near a jazz festival. At least two of the men, who the authorities said were outsiders, carried rifles.</p><p>Among the targets of Thursday’s bomb threat was an elementary school that has a large Haitian student body. Apprehension has enveloped the Haitian community in Springfield this week, said Vilés Dorsainvil, executive director of the Haitian Community Health and Support Center.</p><p>Mr. Dorsainvil said that he had fielded many calls from families concerned for their children’s safety.</p><p>“People started panicking,” he said. “I tried to help them understand that it’s just politics.”</p><p>Mr. Vance’s campaign weighed in on the tensions on Thursday night. “Senator Vance condemns these threats and believes that those responsible should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” said Luke Schroeder, a spokesman for the vice-presidential nominee.</p><p>Haiti is engulfed in violence, political upheaval and a humanitarian crisis, which have led tens of thousands of Haitians to move to other countries, including Brazil, Chile and the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“At the end of the day, we are here,” Mr. Dorsanivil said. “We have been through a lot and are resilient people.”</p><p>On a Haitian WhatsApp chat group, Haitian leaders urged community members to “keep calm, stay informed, stay safe and stay connected.”</p><p>“Don’t let tension and fear make you make bad decisions,” said the message in Haitian Creole.</p><p>“Do not listen to rumors or unconfirmed information,” it advised them, according to a screenshot provided to The Times that was translated into English.</p><p>“I am feeling uncomfortable in this situation. I am asking myself what I should do,” said Jean Frantz, 35, the father of two children.</p><p>“They are spreading lies that I can’t believe,” he said. “We work, pay taxes, buy cars and respect the law.”</p><p>Mr. Rue said that his message to the Haitian community was one of sympathy. “I am sorry this is going on in our community and that they have to endure this type of hate,” he said.</p><p>Ken Bensinger<!-- --> and <!-- -->Christine Hauser<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Miriam Jordan reports from a grass roots perspective on immigrants and their impact on the demographics, society and economy of the United States.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/miriam-jordan">More about Miriam Jordan</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jd-vance">J.D.
