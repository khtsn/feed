There was no reason, the minister, Sarunas Birutis, said in a radio interview, to be “afraid that after watching a Christmas fairy tale we will become pro-Kremlin.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>His remarks prompted fury from ardent supporters of Ukraine and applause from lovers of Russian music, igniting a bitter debate, largely one between generations, about whether culture and politics can be separated at a time of war.</p><p>Many in the art world oppose banning works on the basis of their nationality, believing that culture has the power to unite and should not be contaminated by politics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vilnius, the capital.

But he added, “It never occurred to me as a minister to tell people what to watch or listen to.”</p><p>Despite a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/europe/putin-russia-lithuania-judge.html" title="">bloody crackdown by Soviet forces in Vilnius,</a> Lithuania’s capital, in January 1991, Mr. Kuolys did not pause performances of “The Nutcracker” or try to cancel Igor Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We fought Soviet power to get the freedom not to ban things,” said Mr. Kuolys, 62, now a professor of Lithuanian literature at Vilnius University.</p><p>Lithuania’s culture is so intertwined with Russia, he added — noting that Stravinsky’s family traced its roots to the country — that proscribing Russian artists and their works would “cause great damage to ourselves”</p><p>Simonas Kairys, the culture minister who pushed in 2022 for the quarantine from Russian influence embedded in music, insisted that he had never banned anything and only issued “recommendations” to the national opera house and other state-funded institutions, which promptly pulled “The Nutcracker” and other Russian works.</p><p>“They had a choice — there was no decree from me,” Mr. Kairys, 40, said. “They just had an understanding of the situation.” He added: “When you are at war, you have to choose the right side. There is no middle.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>During World War II, Britain’s National Gallery put on a series of concerts featuring German composers like Beethoven. The director of the gallery at the time said that this was to show that Britain’s fight was with Hitler and the Nazis, not with Germany as a nation or culture.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many in the art world oppose banning works on the basis of their nationality, believing that culture has the power to unite.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrej Vasilenko for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Fear of Russia and fury over its invasion of Ukraine, however, have led many in Lithuania and other countries with a long and bitter history of past Russia occupation to doubt that culture can be disentangled from politics.</p><p>“In Russia, it’s always been mixed,” said Arunas Gelunas, the director of the Lithuanian National Museum of Art and a proponent of pausing performances and exhibitions by Russian artists. “The Kremlin has been using classical culture to distract the eyes of the world from the atrocities that it is exercising today.”</p><p>Russia has created an image of itself as the pinnacle of sophisticated culture, an impression that is firmly embedded in the Western world, he added.</p><p>“Today, when Ukrainians are still being tortured and raped and killed as we speak, I would rather not go to see ‘The Nutcracker’ in the opera or elsewhere,” said Mr. Gelunas, who traveled to Ukraine to help evacuate 800 pieces of art from museums there to Lithuania.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ukrainian officials and activists who want to “decolonize” culture share that view, pushing for the exclusion of Russian performers, filmmakers and other artists from the West no matter what their political leanings. Some see all Russians and their cultural heritage as irredeemably tainted by imperial thinking, a view heavily influenced by post-colonial studies in American academia.</p><p>For lovers of “The Nutcracker,” a staple of the Christmas repertoire in Lithuania for generations, Tchaikovsky — who lived from 1840 to 1893 — has nothing to do with the Kremlin or Russian atrocities in Ukraine and should be spared from what they see as virtue signaling by politicians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Intermission at the national opera house in Vilnius.
