<p>In the first elimination match of the Home Ground, T1 faced off against Cubert Academy. The map of choice for this best-of-one was Sunset, and T1 ran a double-Controller composition against the Cubert Academy composition of double-Duelist. Both teams ran Sage to block off those tight chokes on both sites, and T1 won two retakes to win the pistol and the anti-eco before Cubert stopped the bonus conversion. <span data-ref-id="4">

<p><em>iZu gets four to stop an attack from Cubert Academy.</em></p>

<p>The plays across the T1 team, especially the unchecked flanks, were great as T1 took a 9-3 lead at the half.</p>

<p>Cubert won the second half pistol to start the potential comeback, but <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/485/stax">
		stax	</a>
</span> prevented the bonus round win to keep a five-round lead. That lead waned a little, but stax kept the momentum going for T1 as the team reached map point up 12-7 and closed it out the next round. T1 moved on to the second round of the lower bracket, while Cubert Academy is officially gone from the main event of Red Bull Home Ground 2025.</p>



<p>The sole map for this matchup between two VCT Americas teams was Haven, with C9 starting on the attack side. Both teams ran double-Controller, with C9 running Neon while G2 ran Yoru. C9 won the first pistol and antieco without much worry, but <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3993/jawgemo">
		jawgemo	</a>
</span> prevented the bonus round win. The slow pace from C9 led to some struggles from G2, with jawgemo as the sole standout on the defense side. The first half ended up 8-4 for C9, with G2 needing to improve on the attack side.</p>

<p>C9 won the second pistol on Haven to take a larger lead, but G2 pulled out the classic Stinger buy to convert an eco. That moment was a turning point, as G2 took that economic advantage to go on a run and tie the map 9-9, with jawgemo getting an ace and <span data-ref-id="9">

</span> stepping up in both calls and shots. </p>


<p><em>valyn ties the map for G2.</em></p>

<p>Even a late timeout proved to do little as G2 reached map and match point up 12-10, as C9 had two opportunities to take the map to overtime. It was <span data-ref-id="10">
