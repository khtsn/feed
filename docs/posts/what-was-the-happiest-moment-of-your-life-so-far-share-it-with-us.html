Our hope is to capture — through a wide range of perspectives — what happiness looks like across the human life span, and the many different forms it takes. If you’re interested in participating, please send a short <strong>video</strong> of yourself answering the following question:</p><h2 id="link-d94411c">What was the happiest moment of your life, so far? </h2><p>We are most interested in specific stories with a beginning, middle, and end — for example, a story about a family’s breakfast in a new apartment after a stretch of homelessness; a college student’s memory of an unforgettable nighttime hike with her friends; an octogenarian’s recollection of the first conversation he ever had with his wife some sixty years ago in a diner. Please keep submissions to under one minute long.</p><p>If your video is selected for potential inclusion in the project, we’ll reach out to follow up with you. You must provide contact information with your submission. We won’t publish your name or any part of your submission without contacting you first. And we won’t share your contact information outside the Times newsroom or use it for any reason other than to get in touch with you.</p><p>Please follow these instructions for your video:</p><ul><li><p>Film yourself talking directly to the camera, and send vertical videos only.</p></li><li><p>Wipe off the camera lens before filming.</p></li><li><p>Check that you are recording in “video” mode, not “slo-mo” or “cinematic.”</p></li><li><p>Avoid filming in low-light situations. If filming at night, stay near a light source.</p></li><li><p>Keep the light in front of you, so that your face is well lit.</p></li><li><p>Make sure the lens is not obstructed by your fingers or other objects in the frame.</p></li><li><p>Keep the camera steady and limit movement.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore The New York Times Magazine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Global War on ‘Gender Ideology’: </strong>President Trump is allying with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/magazine/gender-ideology-trump-orban.html">a movement that stretches to Hungary and Poland</a> — one that looks with skepticism not just on trans rights but on feminism itself.</p></li><li><p><strong>Denzel Washington on ‘The Interview’: </strong>The legendary actor discussed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/magazine/denzel-washington-interview.html">the prophecy that changed his life</a>, his Oscar snub and his upcoming role starring alongside a “complicated” Jake Gyllenhaal in “Othello” on Broadway.</p></li><li><p><strong>Confessions of a Ghost: </strong>Ten people explain why, instead of saying it’s over with their paramours, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/05/magazine/ghosting-dating.html">they decided to just disappear</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>When America Emptied Its Youth Prisons: </strong>Lessons from a radical 20-year experiment and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/magazine/juvenile-prison-crime-rates.html">quiet triumph of public policy</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Solution for New England’s Invasive Crabs</strong><strong>: </strong>America’s Northeastern coast has been overrun by crabs from Europe and Asia. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/magazine/invasive-crabs-new-england.html">Luckily, they’re delicious</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
