When I was in college, he asked me for a $30,000 pontoon boat.</p><p>And so, for much of my life, I didn’t particularly like the act of giving gifts. It felt dutiful.</p><p>But I’ve come around. Especially after I took a remote job — as a gifts editor, of all things! — I needed something to ground my relationships, despite the distance.</p><p>Gifting, I realized, is a tactile gesture of love and appreciation. It’s an authentic connection point where no digital analog exists: Dropping a cheap heart in a group chat pales in comparison with almost any IRL offering.</p><p>The act of selecting and giving a gift is really a vehicle for showing<span>  </span>loved ones how you feel about them. It can be quite beautiful and moving.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But it’s also hard to do it well. (Just ask my stepdad, who has given me the same fire blanket twice.) The holidays only exacerbate that stress.</p><p>In the rest of today’s newsletter, I’ll offer some easy-to-follow advice I’ve picked up over the years, share a few of my all-time favorite gifts and show you where to start with Wirecutter’s extensive gift guide coverage.</p><p>(And for more of our expert recommendations, sign up for Wirecutter’s weekly gifting newsletter, <a href="http://nytimes.com/newsletters?newsletter_signup=true&amp;product_code=WCGG" title="">The Gift</a>.)</p><h2 id="link-66680178">Consider secondary hobbies</h2><p>My colleague Samantha Schoech follows this handy rule of thumb: Think less about your recipients’ main hobbies because they are probably already getting themselves what they need to, say, ski or cycle. Instead, think about their secondary interests. Do they love bookstores, great coffee, tech gadgets, playing with makeup, planning trips? Those are the interests and hobbies to hit.</p><p>And if they’re truly single-minded with a hobby, think of your gift as a homage to that pastime, not a part of a go-to kit. A runner might like a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gifts-for-runners/#marathon-drinking" title="">pint glass etched with a recent marathon route</a> rather than a new pair of sneakers. A weekend gardener who already has a good trowel may appreciate a botanical paint-by-numbers kit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Here are a few gift lists for those with a particular passion:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gifts-for-travelers/" title="">Frequent travelers</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gifts-for-coffee-lovers/" title="">Coffee lovers</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/gifts-for-people-who-love-to-clean/" title="">People who love to clean</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gifts-for-gardeners/" title="">Gardeners</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gifts-for-foodies/" title="">Foodies</a></p></li></ul><h2 id="link-12d73489">Give an upgrade</h2><p>Another useful tip: Think of something your recipients have and find something even nicer, sturdier or more functional. Sure, they have a flashlight, but what about a rechargeable LED lantern <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gifts-under-50/#modern-light" title="">that looks like a candlestick</a>? They’ve already got a solid hammer, but a true D.I.Y.-er might appreciate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-hammer/#upgrade-pick-stiletto-10oz-trimbone-smooth-curve-titanium-hammer" title="">this exceptional $300 hammer</a>. Everyone has a phone charger, but do they have a credit-card-thin power bank in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-christmas-gift-ideas/#charging-on-the-fly" title="">a pretty metallic shade?</a></p><p>If you’re looking to treat your recipients to something they’d likely never buy themselves but might use daily, here’s where I’d start:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/gifts-that-last-forever/" title="">Gifts that will last forever</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-luxurious-gifts/" title="">Luxe gifts</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/aesthetic-gift-picks/" title="">Beautiful gifts</a></p></li></ul><h2 id="link-71bbeb3a">Surprise and delight</h2><p>A really great gift surprises the recipient. That can mean a lot of things: Maybe it’s something they’ve never seen before, or something they didn’t know they needed. A few of my favorite delights? A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-housewarming-gifts/#a-piscine-pitcher" title="">pitcher that looks like a fish</a>. Potato chips <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gifts-for-foodies/#superb-potato-chips" title="">in a paint can</a>. And this funny <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/gifts-for-remote-work-from-home/#work-friend" title="">little lazy duck lamp</a>, to name a few.</p><p>For more cheeky inspiration:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/white-elephant-ideas/" title="">White elephant gifts</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gifts-under-25/" title="">Gifts under $25</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gifts-for-adults-who-are-kids-at-heart/" title="">For grown-ups who don’t wanna grow up</a></p></li></ul><p>One last word of wisdom: Sometimes the thing your recipients are always giving others might be a sign of what they themselves would really love. A fire blanket might not be for me, but I know what my stepdad is getting this year.</p><h3 id="link-1439ed98"><span><strong>THE WEEK IN CULTURE</strong></span></h3><p>Film and TV</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Auli’i Cravalho</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sabrina Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><ul><li><p>The Disney movie “Moana” made Auli’i Cravalho a breakout star.
