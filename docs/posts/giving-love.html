    <h1>Giving Love</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>My dad used to hand-write specific, and often unrealistic, gift wish lists for his children to fulfill before every holiday. When I was in college, he asked me for a $30,000 pontoon boat.</p><p>And so, for much of my life, I didn’t particularly like the act of giving gifts. It felt dutiful.</p><p>But I’ve come around. Especially after I took a remote job — as a gifts editor, of all things! — I needed something to ground my relationships, despite the distance.</p><p>Gifting, I realized, is a tactile gesture of love and appreciation. It’s an authentic connection point where no digital analog exists: Dropping a cheap heart in a group chat pales in comparison with almost any IRL offering.</p><p>The act of selecting and giving a gift is really a vehicle for showing<span>  </span>loved ones how you feel about them. It can be quite beautiful and moving.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But it’s also hard to do it well. (Just ask my stepdad, who has given me the same fire blanket twice.) The holidays only exacerbate that stress.</p><p>In the rest of today’s newsletter, I’ll offer some easy-to-follow advice I’ve picked up over the years, share a few of my all-time favorite gifts and show you where to start with Wirecutter’s extensive gift guide coverage.</p><p>(And for more of our expert recommendations, sign up for Wirecutter’s weekly gifting newsletter, <a href="http://nytimes.com/newsletters?newsletter_signup=true&amp;product_code=WCGG" title="">The Gift</a>.)</p><h2 id="link-66680178">Consider secondary hobbies</h2><p>My colleague Samantha Schoech follows this handy rule of thumb: Think less about your recipients’ main hobbies because they are probably already getting themselves what they need to, say, ski or cycle. Instead, think about their secondary interests. Do they love bookstores, great coffee, tech gadgets, playing with makeup, planning trips? Those are the interests and hobbies to hit.</p><p>And if they’re truly single-minded with a hobby, think of your gift as a homage to that pastime, not a part of a go-to kit. A runner might like a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/best-gifts-for-runners/#marathon-drinking" title="">pint glass etched with a recent marathon route</a> rather than a new pair of sneakers. A weekend gardener who already has a good trowel may appreciate a botanical paint-by-numbers kit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Auli’i Cravalho</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sabrina Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><ul><li><p>The Disney movie “Moana” made Auli’i Cravalho a breakout star.

Based on tacos al pastor, his recipe features warm tortillas filled with shredded roast turkey bathed in a bold, chile-laden sauce sweetened with orange juice and agave. Then, everything is topped with a cranberry-pineapple salsa for color and zing. All out of turkey? You can make these with leftover vegetables, too.

Saquon Barkley of the Eagles leads the N.F.L. in rushing yards, with 1,392. The Ravens’ Derrick Henry is right behind him, with 1,325 yards. (No one else in the league has over 1,000 yards.) It’s been more than than a decade since anyone but a quarterback won the M.V.P. If either of these backs is going to break the streak, this could be the game that sets them apart. <em>Sunday at 4:25 p.m. Eastern on CBS</em></p></div></section></article></div>
