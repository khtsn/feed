Cuomo is making final preparations to run for mayor of New York City and could announce his candidacy as soon as this weekend, according to four people familiar with the planning.</p><p>Publicly, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, continues to guard his intentions closely, avoiding media interviews and unscripted public events. He has been conspicuously silent on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/eric-adams-indictment-timeline.html" title="">the scandal engulfing his potential opponent, Mayor Eric Adams</a>.</p><p>But behind the scenes, the former governor has taken increasingly assertive steps to line up a long-anticipated comeback attempt that would instantly reshape the race to unseat Mr. Adams in June’s Democratic primary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, is seeking re-election this year against a host of primary challengers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Wealthy donors have committed to host fund-raisers at Manhattan apartments as soon as next Tuesday. Mr. Cuomo has personally begun prodding additional Democrats to publicly back him — including the Queens borough president, Donovan Richards, and the Manhattan party chairman, Keith L.T. Wright — as he tries to extend a rollout of high-profile endorsements that began with one from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/nyregion/cuomo-mccall-mayor-nyc.html" title="">his former rival, H. Carl McCall</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And he is expected to tap the political director of the New York City carpenters union to take on a senior campaign role.</p><p>The moves reflect a growing confidence among Mr. Cuomo and his allies that they have a clear path to City Hall. Elected officials, labor bosses and business leaders who have spoken to him said Mr. Cuomo has framed a potential candidacy as an opportunity to “save” New York City from four years of scandal, unease about public safety and an emboldened President Trump.</p><p>Like other people familiar with his plans, many requested anonymity to detail private conversations with Mr. Cuomo.</p><p>“I have no doubt that he is going to run,” Kathryn Wylde, the chief of the Wall Street-backed Partnership for New York City, said after a recent sit-down with Mr. Cuomo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Many in the business community feel that he is the person who can best manage the city and the relationship with President Trump,” she added.</p><p>People involved in the potential Cuomo campaign have told associates that they are trying to line up a public launch in early March, most likely involving a scripted video.</p><p>But those who have known Mr. Cuomo for decades cautioned that it was still possible he would decide not to run. Like his father, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/mario-cuomo-new-york-governor-and-liberal-beacon-dies-at-82.html" title="">famously left two planes idling</a> on an Albany tarmac as he waffled over a run for president, Mr. Cuomo <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/cuomo-keeps-everyone-guessing/" title="">has never been quick</a> to reach decisions about his political future.</p><p>Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, declined to comment on the former governor’s intentions.</p><p>Those who have spoken with him in recent days, though, came away with the impression that Mr. Cuomo’s delay in entering the mayor’s race had more to do with strategy than indecision.</p><p>By waiting, Mr. Cuomo has shortened the window before the June 24 primary for his prospective opponents to build a case against him and for news media to scrutinize his record.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Cuomo, 67, could face attacks for a long list of past alleged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-resigns.html" title="">transgressions</a>, including accusations that he sexually harassed several state employees and covered up the number of Covid-related nursing home deaths. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing and spent years fighting in court and the public sphere to clear his name, notching some victories along the way.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Cuomo’s handling of the state’s Covid policy in nursing homes has been blamed for causing needless deaths.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Minchillo/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>While polls show Mr. Cuomo leading Mr. Adams and a field of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/nyregion/nyc-mayor-candidates-2025.html" title="">seven other Democratic rivals</a>, it remains to be seen whether New York City voters are willing to replace one scandal-plagued Democrat in City Hall with another. A pollster working for an anti-Cuomo group, United for a Brighter Tomorrow, argued in <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/21/reports-of-cuomos-rebirth-are-much-exaggerated/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an opinion essay</a> that Mr. Cuomo’s support could quickly erode once voters were reminded of his record.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo’s opponents have not waited to attack him. One of them, State Senator Zellnor Myrie, recently launched <a href="https://www.quietcuomo.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a website</a> counting the days since Mr. Cuomo had spoken publicly about Mr. Adams or Mr. Trump.</p><p>“In the past 35 days, when the city has seen funding for hospitals, schools and senior centers threatened; when our literal sovereignty has been in question,” Mr. Myrie said, “he has said nothing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A representative for Mr. Adams, who maintains that he can still win a second term, declined to comment. </p><p>Mr. Cuomo is relying on a tight circle of longtime advisers, including three who once served as his top aide in Albany. Steven M. Cohen has taken the lead putting together <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/nyregion/cuomo-super-pac-mayor.html" title="">a super PAC</a> to support Mr. Cuomo’s candidacy if he runs. William J. Mulrow is expected to serve in a senior role, such as campaign chairman. And Melissa DeRosa is said to be effectively running the campaign.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo is poised to bring on additional help, too. Kevin Elkins, the political director for the New York City carpenters union, has been in discussions to take on a senior role with the campaign, according to two people familiar with the matter. They cautioned personnel decisions had yet to be finalized, but Mr. Elkins’s involvement has been viewed as a sign that the influential labor group could back Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Elkins did not reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo, a prolific fund-raiser as governor, appears to be calling on old supporters for financial backing. </p><p>Charles Myers, the chairman of Signum Global Advisors and a prominent Democratic donor, is scheduled to host an event for Mr. Cuomo on March 4 at his Upper East Side apartment, according to an invitation obtained by The New York Times and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/19/andrew-cuomo-supporter-prepares-reception-likely-mayoral-bid-00205056" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported by Politico</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The invitation does not explicitly call the event a fund-raiser, and Mr. Myers did not respond to requests for comment. But it treats Mr. Cuomo as a likely candidate. Other donors said they were waiting to circulate invites until Mr. Cuomo entered the race.</p><p>“More than ever, NYC needs effective, fearless leadership to defend our city and those critical values,” Mr. Myers wrote in the invitation.</p><p>In the meantime, the former governor has been packing his schedule with breakfasts, lunches and calls with elected officials, many of whom represent key blocs of Jewish, Black and Latino voters.</p><p>He <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/24/us-news/rep-ritchie-torres-endorses-mr-tough-guy-andrew-cuomo-for-nyc-mayor-in-latest-blow-to-eric-adams/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">won the endorsement</a> on Monday of Representative Ritchie Torres, a Bronx Democrat considering a 2026 run for governor. Several other lawmakers who have spoken with Mr. Cuomo said it was clear he was fishing for their support, even if he did not outright ask for an endorsement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Ritchie Torres of New York endorsed Mr. Cuomo to be the city’s next mayor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“He told me he is considering running for mayor,” said Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, the chairwoman of the Brooklyn Democratic Party who is among the mayor’s strongest allies. “And that he would like to continue working with me.”</p><p>Others came away with the impression Mr. Cuomo was closer to an announcement.</p><p>“If you ask me, it sounds like he’s all the way in,” Assemblyman Brian Cunningham of Brooklyn said after a recent call from Mr. Cuomo.</p><p>Mr. Richards, the Queens borough president, and Mr. Wright, the Manhattan Democratic leader, have not stated their intentions. Both declined to comment further.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo and his allies appear to be trying to reach another important player in the race: Gov. Kathy Hochul. Ms. Hochul was once Mr. Cuomo’s lieutenant governor and succeeded him as governor. The two have made little secret of their mutual distrust.</p><p>Recently, intermediaries for Mr. Cuomo have tried to set up a conversation with Ms. Hochul to smooth over tensions between them, according to two people familiar with the outreach who were not authorized to discuss it. One of them said allies of Mr. Cuomo seemed interested in a nonaggression pact.</p><p>A spokesman for Ms. Hochul declined to comment. Mr. Azzopardi disputed that characterization.</p><p>“There was no reference of a ‘pact,’” he said. “If Governor Cuomo wants to speak to Governor Hochul, he will call her. And if Governor Hochul wants to speak to Governor Cuomo, she can call him.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
