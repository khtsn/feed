</span> 2-0 in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2225/soop-valorant-league" target="_blank">SOOP Valorant League</a> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425354/drx-vs-gen-g-soop-valorant-league-sf" target="_blank">semifinal</a>. They will next play <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/429948/nrg-reaches-soop-grand-final-with-2-1-over-mith" target="_blank">against NRG Esports</a> in the event&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425355/nrg-esports-vs-gen-g-soop-valorant-league-gf" target="_blank">grand final</a>, marking Gen.G&#39;s seventh final in 2024. DRX ends the tournament in the top four, reaching playoffs after <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/429708/soop-valorant-league-reaches-final-four" target="_blank">defeating Bilibili Gaming and Rapid Lofi</a> in groups. </p>

<p>This series is the tenth time both teams play each other, with eight of those matches taking place this year. Overall, DRX had the upper hand with five wins prior to this encounter, but Gen.G boasts a much better record when counting only VCT matches — four wins and two losses.</p>

<p>Gen.G opened their map, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425354/drx-vs-gen-g-soop-valorant-league-sf/?game=194169&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a>, with <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/9196/t3xture">
		t3xture	</a>
</span> taking over to win the pistol. He kept the pace up, leading his team to a six round winstreak. By round five, he had 13 eliminations, which set him up to finish the attack with a 1.54 rating. Eventually, DRX took their first round win, courtesy of  <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/28400/hyunmin">
		HYUNMIN	</a>
</span>&#39;s Neon, but Gen.G quickly adapted, reaching double digits in the first half with ease.</p>

</span> needed to win a 1v1 for DRX&#39;s third round. Now with a full buy, Gen.G was better able to control the final round, and Karon came out on top over MaKo in the Astra mirror, taking the 1v1 and sealing Pearl 13-3. </p>

<p>Gen.G executed a successful retake to win the first pistol round on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425354/drx-vs-gen-g-soop-valorant-league-sf/?game=194170&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>, DRX&#39;s selection. Their gun advantage let them win a second retake, but DRX&#39;s Neon-led double-sentinel composition applied enough pressure to put them in the lead. Gen.G tied the score at 3-3, but Hyunmin and <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/35013/flashback">
		Flashback	</a>
</span> helped their team stay ahead during the remainder of the half. Together, the duo found 7 first kills, while the entirety of Gen.G combined only had 5. </p>

		Munchkin	</a>
</span> earned a fourth point for his team after a 4K on B short, but was left in a 1v3 the next round after DRX&#39;s sentinel duo broke through Gen.G&#39;s defense. He was unable to clutch, which ended the half 8-4 in DRX&#39;s favor. </p>

<p>A Karon 3K helped Gen.G recover, narrowing the score gap with a pistol win. He showed off his Marshall skills in the anti-eco, and t3xture helped Gen.G take the next two rounds to tie the score. DRX&#39;s stalling abilities rewarded them with a ninth point, but Gen.G played the map well, drew out DRX&#39;s resources, and took advantage of their ultimate economy to continue scoring rounds. t3xture took up an attack Operator to break through DRX, finding three with the premium weapon and another with his Showstopper. With his bullet just milliseconds ahead of the sniper shot, yoman denied t3xture the ace, ending Bind 13-9 and sending DRX home.</p>

<p>Foxy9 mentioned conflicted feelings on defeating his former team. “I feel really happy, but it&#39;s a mix of emotions,” he said after the series. Despite this, he was confident in Gen.G. “My teammates have so much more potential than what we displayed today,” he said. “The team has helped me a lot, helped me grow.”</p>

<p>“It&#39;s going to be a 3-0. 13-8 first map, 13-5 second map, 13-3 third map. All clean games from Gen.G,” he said regarding their grand final match.</p>
