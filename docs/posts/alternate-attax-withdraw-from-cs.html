Later, the Ukrainian leader is expected to have talks with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Bellevue, the presidential palace.</p><p>Large sections of the government district in Berlin are expected to be cordoned off by the police on Wednesday, as was the case during previous visits by the Ukrainian president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Merz’s warm embrace of Mr. Zelensky stands in stark contrast to the initially cool relationship that Olaf Scholz, the previous German chancellor, had with the Ukrainian leader. Mr. Scholz did not visit Ukraine until a year after Russia invaded. But just three days after being sworn in this month, Mr. Merz traveled to Ukraine with his French and Polish counterparts.</p><p>Discussions between Mr. Merz and Mr. Zelensky are expected to focus on continued military assistance, especially as the United States, the biggest donor to Ukraine, appears ready to wind down its support. Of particular interest to the Ukrainian leader is the long-range <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/europe/zelensky-germany-trip.html" title="">Taurus missile system</a>, which Germany developed with Sweden. During the election campaign, Mr. Merz said he was open to exporting the Taurus system.</p><p>Mr. Merz has reiterated his continued support both for Ukraine and for using sanctions to force President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to agree to a cease-fire.</p><p>“In Ukraine, nothing less than the peace order of our entire continent is at stake,” Mr. Merz told lawmakers in his first speech in Parliament after assuming office earlier this month. “In this historic moment of decision, Europe must stand together more closely than ever before.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
