Jack Daniels whiskey beckons from the bar at British pubs. In France, Levis jeans are all about chic.</p><p>But in the tumult of President Trump’s trade war with Europe, many European consumers are starting to avoid U.S. products and services in what appears to be a decisive and potentially long-term shift away from buying American, according to a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2025/html/ecb.blog20250430~a1b1668cda.en.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new assessment</a> by the European Central Bank.</p><p>In April, Mr. Trump imposed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/economy/trump-tariffs.html" title="">10 percent blanket tariff</a> on America’s trading partners, and threatened “reciprocal tariffs” on many of those, including the European Union.

Such talk bewildered many Europeans and rattled E.U. leaders, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/europe/eu-tariffs-trump.html" title="">retaliated</a> with a 25 percent duty on many U.S. goods.</p><p>Both sides called a temporary truce after Mr. Trump abruptly reversed course and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-tariffs-stocks-china.html" title="">delayed tariffs until the summer</a>. But the 10 percent base-line tariff is still in place, and a trans-Atlantic trade war could easily flare again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And even if a trade deal is reached, Europe’s newfound wariness of its longtime ally will not easily be unwound. The E.C.B. study found that even if a mere 5 percent tax were placed on American products sold in Europe, Europeans would still be inclined to shun them. </p><p>What is new, the central bank said, is a “preference” among European consumers “to move away from U.S. products and brands altogether,” no matter what the cost. That was the case even for households that could bear the brunt of higher prices.</p><p>“Even though they could afford more expensive U.S. products and services, they consciously choose alternatives,” the bank said. “This suggests that consumers’ reactions may not just be a temporary response to tariff increases, but instead signal a possible long-term structural shift in consumer preferences away from U.S. products and brands.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Used Teslas for sale in Norway.
