It is expanding its business globally. And it is one of China’s most strategically important <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/business/catl-battery-china.html" title="">technology</a> companies.</p><p>But when Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd., or CATL, started selling shares for the first time in Hong Kong on Tuesday, surging 16 percent, American investors were largely shut out. It was the world’s biggest stock listing this year, according to the data provider Dealogic.</p><p>Tensions between China and the United States pushed CATL to shut U.S. onshore investors out of its share sale, the first outside the Chinese mainland, where it is listed in the city of Shenzhen.</p><p>That some of the world’s most active investors were absent from one of the most anticipated trading debuts so far this year underscored the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/us-china-tariffs-trade-war.html" title="">deepening rift</a> between the United States and China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>CATL has found itself caught in the crossfire as Washington and Beijing have lobbed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/business/china-us-trade-sanctions.html" title="">sanctions</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/illumina-china-unreliable-entities-list.html" title="">blacklists</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">tariffs</a> at each other. It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/business/us-chinese-military-companies-tencent-catl.html" title="">labeled</a> a Chinese military company by the Pentagon. U.S. lawmakers <a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/letters/letter-brian-moynihan-ceo-bank-america" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called on</a> its Wall Street bankers to back out of the Hong Kong listing. And it has been hit with tariffs.</p><p>The exclusion of American investors in Hong Kong’s splashiest stock sale of the year was a reversal from a decade ago when <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/alibaba-raises-21-8-billion-in-initial-public-offering/" title="">Alibaba</a>, the Chinese e-commerce giant, elicited cheers from traders as it went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. The company <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/alibaba-raises-21-8-billion-in-initial-public-offering/" title="">raised</a> $21.8 billion, delivering a big payday for Wall Street banks and minting mom-and-pop investors.</p><p>“We are headed toward full financial decoupling with China,” said Stephen Roach, an economist and a former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia based in Hong Kong. “Congress is driving the process of disengagement,” he said. The shares of Chinese companies that are traded in the United States could be the next thing to come under fire, he added.</p><p>The U.S. government has targeted Chinese companies as it moves to limit China’s access to American markets out of national security concerns, a policy that President Trump began in his first term and that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. continued.</p><p>Mr. Trump has accused China of exploiting American investors to finance its military and attempted to isolate China with colossal tariffs that were suspended only after global markets convulsed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>CATL, based in the southern China city of Ningde, supplies electric car batteries for General Motors, Tesla and more than a dozen global carmakers. Its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/business/catl-battery-china.html" title="">technological advances</a> have made lighter and cheaper batteries that can charge faster. The company said it would use the funds raised in Hong Kong to help with its expansion in Europe, where it is building a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automakers like BMW, Volkswagen and Stellantis.</p><p>In the United States, a Ford Motor battery project in Michigan that licenses CATL’s technology has drawn local and national <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/business/energy-environment/ford-battery-plants-loan.html" title="">political fire</a>. Lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation that would withdraw subsidies from U.S. companies that manufacture batteries using Chinese expertise.</p><p>Yet even as the battle between the two superpowers creates financial collateral damage, CATL <a href="https://www.iporesults.hkex.com.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2025/0519/2025051901257.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised</a> $4.6 billion ahead of its secondary listing in Hong Kong, more than any other public listing this year. The stock was sold for 263 Hong Kong dollars a share, or about $33.62. Among its biggest investors are Kuwait’s sovereign wealth fund and the American firm Oaktree Capital Management. Another major investor is Hillhouse Capital Management Group, which was founded by the billionaire investor Zhang Lei.</p><p>CATL moved to hive off American investors ahead of the listing as tensions between the United States and China spiked. It said last week that it had changed the share sale to what is known as a Reg S offering, which prevents the sale of stock to onshore U.S. investors and exempts it from having to make certain regulatory filings in the United States.</p><p>The company did not explain why it had changed the structure of its listing, but it has cited geopolitical tension as one of the risks to its business. “We face risks associated with changes in trade policies or tariff regulations,” CATL said in a regulatory filing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In response to the Pentagon’s designation of the company as having both military and commercial technology, CATL said it had “never engaged in any military-related businesses or activities” and had “proactively engaged with the Department of Defense to address the false designation.”</p><p>Most large American institutions will be able to trade in CATL shares if they invest through offshore accounts. But that would still leave a hole. Some 10 percent of American investors would have probably invested in its stock if not prevented from doing so, said Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese finance at the University of California, San Diego.</p><p>“I think that this is a major milestone,” Mr. Shih said, adding that it was likely the start of a broader trend. “This will apply to many Chinese hardware and even some software producers, thus cutting out U.S. investors from some potentially profitable opportunities.”</p><p>Jack Ewing<!-- --> contributed reporting from New York.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alexandra Stevenson is the Shanghai bureau chief for The Times, reporting on China’s economy and society.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
