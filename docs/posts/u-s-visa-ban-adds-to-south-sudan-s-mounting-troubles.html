The deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, said on <a href="https://x.com/DeputySecState/status/1908639420737343605" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a> that South Sudan had refused to accept the repatriation of one of its nationals.</p><p>The Trump administration has not said whether it would seek to deport South Sudanese nationals whose visas had been revoked. South Sudan’s government has not responded to the announcement of the visa ban, and a government spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>South Sudan sends relatively few travelers to the United States. Just 46 nonimmigrant visas were issued to its nationals in January, compared with more than 2,500 to people from neighboring Kenya, <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/Non-Immigrant-Statistics/MonthlyNIVIssuances/JANUARY%202025%20-%20NIV%20Issuances%20by%20Nationality%20and%20Visa%20Class.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to U.S. government data</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sunday Mass at a Catholic church in Juba last year. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The visa cancellations come amid deepening political rifts between President Salva Kiir and his vice president, Riek Machar. The schism threatens the fragile 2018 peace agreement ending a five-year civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people and displaced millions.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In recent months, the Sudanese military and opposition forces allied with Mr. Machar have clashed outside Juba, the capital, and in other parts of the country. In March, a U.N. helicopter evacuating wounded soldiers from Upper Nile State in the northeast was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/africa/un-helicopter-attack-south-sudan.html" title="">attacked</a>, resulting in the death of a general, several military officers and a crew member. The violence in the state has uprooted tens of thousands of people, some of whom have fled into Ethiopia, according to the United Nations.</p><p>Uganda’s government has deployed troops to South Sudan at the request of President Kiir, a move that incensed Mr. Machar and his allies. Regional diplomatic efforts to quell the discord have <a href="https://www.radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/south-sudan-government-disputes-odingas-remarks-on-dr-machars-status" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">failed so far</a>, raising fears of a potential collapse of the government.</p><p>U.S. aid cuts are also hurting efforts to rebuild after years of conflict. The United States <a href="https://www.foreignassistance.gov/cd/south%20sudan/2024/obligations/0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spent</a> $705 million on food, health, education and other programs in the country last year. But much of that funding has vanished since the Trump administration came to power, aid groups say, forcing them to scale back programs responding to floods, cholera outbreaks and food shortages.</p><p>“South Sudan is quickly becoming the forgotten crisis of the world,” Denish Ogenrwot, the advocacy lead for the aid agency Action Against Hunger, said by telephone from Juba.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, left, and its vice president, Riek Machar, in 2019.
