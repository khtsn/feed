The police, rescue workers and his family took part in the search, scanning a landscape of austere mountains and blankets of snow.</p><p>But as the days passed without sign of Mr. Benastick, hope began to fade. Temperatures plunged to below zero Fahrenheit. In winter, the park <a href="https://bcparks.ca/redfern-keily-park/#know-before-you-go" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warns</a> of avalanches. Year-round, it warns of bears. At some point, the official search was called off, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p><p>During the search, Mr. Benastick’s family spent weeks at the Buffalo Inn Pink Mountain, a hotel near the park, having nightly meetings in the hotel’s fireplace room, Michael Reid, the general manager, said in a phone interview. The family checked out before Mr. Benastick had been found, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Then, over a month after he was reported missing, two men heading to work down a trail spotted a man heading toward them, the police said in a statement.</p><p>The men recognized Mr. Benastick and took him to the hospital, where the authorities confirmed his identity, the police said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A GoFundMe page set up to help search for Sam Benastick, who was found Tuesday after being missing for weeks in the frigid Redfern-Keily park.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Finding Sam alive is the absolute best outcome,” said a police spokeswoman, Cpl. Madonna Saunderson, in the statement. “After all the time he was missing,” she added, the police had feared this “would not be the outcome.”</p><p>The sequence of events that led to Mr. Benastick going missing was not immediately clear. According to the police, Mr. Benastick said he had stayed in his car for a few days before walking to a creek on a mountain side and camping for another 10 to 15 days. He told the police that he had then moved into a valley and made camp in a dried-up creek.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The health care provider Northern Health said that he had been taken to a hospital and was “doing well.” Mr. Benastick would not provide comment at this time, it said in a statement.</p><p>Mr. Benastick began a 10-day camping trip in the park on Oct. 7 and his family reported him missing after he failed to check in, according to a GoFundMe page that appeared to be set up by his sister. The fund-raiser’s organizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Reid, the hotel manager, said that there had been jubilation when they heard the news that Mr. Benastick had been found.</p><p>“We all gave each other a hug, and we had tears in our eyes,” Mr. Reid said. “I’ve got three kids and five grandkids so I know what they were going through.”</p><p>Mr. Reid said Mr. Benastick was still in the hospital but that his family would be stopping by “on their way back.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eve Sampson is a reporter covering international news and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eve-sampson">More about Eve Sampson</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/royal-canadian-mounted-police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Exploring the Outdoors, One Step at a Time</h2><h3>Hiking is a great way to immerse yourself in nature and tune out the chaos of city life.
