The brothers themselves may make statements.</p><p>Eventually, the judge, Michael V. Jesic of Los Angeles Superior Court, will need to decide whether to impose a new sentence. If he reduces the brothers’ sentence to life with the possibility of parole, that would make them eligible to go before a parole board. (A parole hearing has already been scheduled for next month.) The judge could also reduce the murder conviction to manslaughter and allow the brothers to be released immediately. Or he could reject a new sentence altogether.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The new Los Angeles County district attorney, Nathan J. Hochman, who was elected on promises to be more tough on crime, is expected to argue against a lighter sentence. Judge Jesic has already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/arts/menendez-brothers-resentencing.html" title="">rejected multiple requests by Mr. Hochman to withdraw a resentencing petition</a> put forward by his Mr. Hochman’s predecessor.</p><p>The resentencing effort is just one of the several legal pathways that could lead to the brothers’ freedom. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California is also reviewing a clemency petition.</p><p>It was more than 35 years ago that Lyle and Erik Menendez — then 21 and 18 — walked into the den of their Beverly Hills mansion and fired more than a dozen shotgun rounds at their parents, killing them both.</p><p>In recent years, the brothers have been thrust back into the media spotlight thanks to the revelation of new evidence, an army of social media defenders and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/arts/television/menendez-brothers-netflix-monsters.html" title="">recent TV series</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/arts/television/menendez-brothers-netflix-takeaways.html" title="">documentary</a> examining the crime and their trials. All of that has led to the hearings this week.</p><p>Here’s what else to know about the case.</p><h2 id="link-46dd8fe9">There are three active legal paths that could allow the brothers to regain their freedom.</h2><p>The first, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/menendez-brothers-prison-sentence.html" title="">resentencing track</a>, was initiated by the former Los Angeles County district attorney, George Gascón, last fall. Separately, the court initiated its own resentencing petition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The second path is a clemency petition on the desk of Mr. Newsom, who has indicated that he is supportive of re-examining the case. The governor ordered the state’s parole board to assess whether the brothers would pose a threat to public safety if released.</p><p>The parole board hearings are scheduled for June 13.</p><p>The third path is a habeas corpus petition filed by the brothers’ lawyers, who claimed that newly unearthed evidence of sexual abuse by Jose Menendez, Lyle and Erik’s father, would have altered the outcome of their trial if it had been available at the time. This is considered the least likely path, and Mr. Hochman, the current district attorney, announced in February that he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/menendez-brothers-nathan-hochman-conviction.html" title="">opposed to a new trial</a>.</p><h2 id="link-5889efce">The new district attorney has said he will not support resentencing.</h2><p>Often, resentencing hearings are not adversarial proceedings because the district attorney’s office has already voiced its support.</p><p>In this case, the prosecutors will be arguing against resentencing the brothers, even though the office, under the previous district attorney, had initiated the process.</p><p>In October, Mr. Gascón, when he was still district attorney, asked a judge to resentence the Menendez brothers in a way that would make them eligible for parole.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While acknowledging that the brothers had committed “horrible acts,” Mr. Gascón said he believed they had engaged in “a journey of redemption and a journey of rehabilitation” while incarcerated. A lawyer for the brothers recently said their rehabilitation had been “exemplary” and highlighted that they had created programs, counseled and mentored others and pursued higher education behind bars.</p><p>On April 9, the new district attorney, Mr. Hochman, a former federal prosecutor, said that prosecutors were prepared to proceed with the court-initiated hearings on resentencing, but his office was asking that Mr. Gascón’s motion be withdrawn. That was rejected by Judge Jesic.</p><p>The brothers had also petitioned the governor to grant them clemency, a bid that Mr. Gascón supported. Mr. Hochman, in his public statements, has stressed that the governor could grant clemency at any time, regardless of what happens with resentencing.</p><p>As the brothers make their case to be released, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/us/lyle-erik-menendez-parole-prison-good-behavior.html" title="">portrait of their time in prison</a> has emerged of siblings who came to be regarded as model inmates.</p><p>But Mr. Hochman and his team have argued repeatedly that the brothers have not demonstrated that they have “full insight” into their crimes. The brothers, they argue, never renounced their claim that they killed their parents because they feared their parents would kill them first, which prosecutors maintain was a lie.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-232b8558">What were they convicted of?</h2><p>In 1996, the Menendez brothers were found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/21/us/menendez-brothers-guilty-of-killing-their-parents.html" title="">guilty of first-degree murder</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/us/menendez-brothers-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.html" title="">sentenced to life in prison without parole</a> for killing their parents, Jose, a music executive, and Mary Louise, a former beauty queen who went by Kitty.</p><p>It was their second trial. Two years earlier, a mistrial was declared after two separate juries (one for each brother) deadlocked over a verdict.</p><p>The trials proceeded quite differently.</p><p>In the first, defense lawyers claimed that the brothers had killed their parents after years of sexual, physical and emotional abuse by their father and that they feared for their lives. Their mother, they said, knew about the abuse but didn’t stop it.</p><p>Interviews with jurors after the mistrial revealed that some of them questioned how serious the abuse had been and to what extent it justified their actions.</p><p>In the second trial, which led to their convictions and in which the brothers were tried in front of a single jury, lawyers for the brothers were limited in what evidence could be presented.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The judge, Stanley M. Weisberg, prohibited their lawyers from using the “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-04-18-mn-55958-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abuse excuse</a>,” essentially leaving only two options for jurors: an acquittal or a murder conviction.

Milton Andersen, one of Kitty Menendez’s brothers, retained a lawyer to oppose the brothers’ release.
