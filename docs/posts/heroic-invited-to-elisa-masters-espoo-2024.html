    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Former President Barack Obama, the popular elder statesman of the Democratic Party, will stump for Vice President Kamala Harris in battleground states in the month before Election Day, beginning with a campaign stop next Thursday in Pittsburgh.</p><p>He is set to crisscross the country for events in battleground states in the final 27 days before the election.</p><p>Mr. Obama, the first Black president, headlined the second night of the Democratic nominating convention in August. He symbolically passed the torch to Ms. Harris — a daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants — as the inheritor of his political movement and made the case that Ms. Harris’s candidacy was an extension of his own.</p><p><a href="https://barackobama.medium.com/our-remarks-at-the-2024-democratic-national-convention-4b1f8a9dce8c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In his speech</a>, he said Ms. Harris “won’t be focused on her problems — she’ll be focused on yours. As president, she won’t just cater to her own supporters, punish those who refuse to kiss the ring or bend the knee. She’ll work on behalf of every American.”</p></div></div>
