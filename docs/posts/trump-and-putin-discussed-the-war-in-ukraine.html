    <h1>Trump and Putin Discussed the War in Ukraine</h1>

For Putin, today’s call marked the collapse of Western efforts to isolate him diplomatically after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p><p>Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said he had his own call later with Trump about “charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace.” However, the Ukrainians appear to have limited leverage.</p><p>Earlier today, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at a NATO meeting that it was an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/ukraine-war-hegseth-nato.html" title="">“unrealistic” objective for Ukraine to restore its borders</a> as they were before 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and backed a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Hegseth also said that the U.S. does not support Ukraine’s desire to join NATO as part of a realistic peace plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>In related news, </strong>the fiercest fighting of the war may now be in Russia, where Ukraine clings to a sliver of Kursk as a bargaining chip. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/kursk-russia-war-ukraine.html" title="">The Times interviewed Russian soldiers</a> near the front line.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Work to turn a church into an emergency shelter in Jackson, Miss., is on hold.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Imani Khayyam for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-54ca8964">Many grant recipients still have no funds and no answers</h2><p>After two courts ordered the Trump administration to end its freeze on more than $3 trillion in federal grants, some recipients regained access to the money they had been promised. They were the lucky ones. Many other funds — for school buses in Missouri, wildfire prevention in Montana, solar panels in Massachusetts — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/trump-federal-aid-freeze.html" title="">remain frozen</a>.</p><p>The administration has changed its rationale to align with the court rulings, saying it is now blocking specific projects rather than issuing a broad hold. But those details have not been communicated to the nonprofits that are counting on the funds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karl Russell</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-514fd6ef">Inflation increased more than expected</h2><p>Consumer prices <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/business/inflation-cpi-report-january.html" title="">rose 3 percent in January</a> compared with a year earlier, fueled in part by increases in food and energy prices.
