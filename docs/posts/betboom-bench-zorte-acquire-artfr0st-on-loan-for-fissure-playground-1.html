<p>DRX&#39;s announcement also revealed that a six-man roster not including Flashback would be traveling for the upcoming <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2449/esports-world-cup-2025" target="_blank">Esports World Cup</a>, and that a seven-man roster would compete in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2500/vct-2025-pacific-stage-2" target="_blank">Pacific Stage 2</a>.</p>

<p>Flashback&#39;s promotion is the third time he has joined DRX&#39;s main roster, as he has shifted to the team&#39;s academy roster twice before. He <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/477385/flashback-moves-back-down-to-drx-academy" target="_blank">moved to the academy roster</a> in the middle of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/champions-tour-2025-pacific-stage-1/group-stage" target="_blank">Pacific Stage 1</a> and while on the academy roster, did not compete for them.</p>

<p>DRX&#39;s statement revealed that Flashback had been dealing with mental health challenges, which ultimately led to his withdrawal from competition.</p>

<p>&#34;Initially, the team expressed frustration and discontent at Flashback&#39;s decision to step away from the team so abruptly,&#34; DRX&#39;s statement said. &#34;However, as the situation regarding his mental health soon became clear, DRX has taken the immediate steps to support his recovery and eventual return.&#34;</p>

<p>The statement from the organization revealed a May-June timeline in which Flashback attended regular therapy sessions and eventually earned back the trust of the team.</p>

<p>Flicker&#39;s move to the main squad from the academy ranks has been a long time in the making. Since joining in September 2023, he&#39;s spent nearly two years with DRX&#39;s second unit, dating back to when it was still &#34;DRX Prospects&#34;.</p>

<p>DRX&#39;s July 7 announcement comes on Flicker&#39;s 18th birthday, meaning he will be immediately eligible to play.</p>

<p>With DRX Academy entering competitive play in 2025, Flicker has played a wide range of agents, with Yoru, Sova, and Tejo being his most played. With an agent pool seemingly fitting the secondary Duelist and Initiator roles, Flicker&#39;s addition could help bring clarity to a DRX roster that has had issues with its agent pool this year.</p>

<p>After being one of the most successful teams in the world during the Tejo meta, DRX lifted its first VCT trophy of any kind with a monumental victory at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/vct-2025-pacific-kickoff" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a>. While they did face a Swiss Stage elimination at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025/swiss-stage" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>, DRX looked to defend their Pacific Crown back at home.</p>
