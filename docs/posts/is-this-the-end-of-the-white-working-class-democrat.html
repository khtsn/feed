Trump to victory, Democrats swore that this time, they would try to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/politics/harris-campaign-western-pennsylvania.html" title="">do better with that group</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Instead, the party’s staggering challenges with blue-collar voters have only worsened. Widespread frustration with high prices and alienation from Democrats have turned the party’s lawmakers in Trump territory into an ever-more-endangered species.</p><p>“When the change doesn’t show up, the hope for change turns into anger,” said Representative Matt Cartwright, a battle-tested Pennsylvania Democrat from the Scranton area who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/elections/pennsylvania-house-cartwright-bresnahan.html" title="">narrowly lost</a> this month. “The anger showed up.”</p><p>The new inroads Mr. Trump made this year with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/donald-trump-2024-campaign-coalition.html" title="">working-class voters of color</a>, particularly Latino ones, have alarmed Democrats. At the same time, the party’s Trump-era Achilles’ heel — its struggle to earn the trust of white working-class voters — was even starker this year, especially in the Industrial Midwest, where the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin all broke for Mr. Trump.</p><p>In many of those states’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/15/magazine/pennsylvania-luzerne-county-trump.html" title="">blue-collar counties</a>, Vice President Kamala Harris lost by greater margins than Mr. Biden did in 2020.</p><p>Certainly, a number of Democratic House and Senate candidates significantly outran Ms. Harris. She also contended with many political barriers Mr. Biden did not face four years ago, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/harris-trump-election-gender.html" title="">racism and sexism</a>, along with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/26/world/kamala-harris-100-days.html" title="">extraordinary challenge</a> of running a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/us/politics/kamala-harris-donald-trump-2024-campaign.html" title="">107-day campaign</a> after the unpopular president was forced out of the race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But she and other Democrats also faced a deepening, newly worrisome perception problem: a widespread belief among working-class Americans that the Democratic Party does not fully grasp their struggles — and in some cases, disdains them outright.</p><p>“This doesn’t have to be the end of white working-class Democrats,” said Justin Barasky, a Democratic strategist who was Mr. Brown’s 2018 campaign manager. “But it will be if we don’t start being more inclusive.”</p><h2 id="link-1a895c8b">Warring over words and culture</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In many rural and blue-collar areas across the country, Donald J.

Republicans effectively caricatured Democrats as overly liberal and “woke.” Democrats needed a stronger populist message. Misinformation thrived in a fractured news environment. The country was simply not ready to elect a woman, especially a woman of color.</p><p>There is some truth to each theory, according to Democrats who have thought deeply about politics in blue-collar America.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But one of the biggest problems, these Democrats say, is that voters in white working-class neighborhoods now see the party as unresponsive to their most pressing daily troubles.</p><p>Representative-elect Kristen McDonald Rivet, a Michigan Democrat, won a district that is home to many white working-class residents, even as Ms. Harris struggled in many counties there.</p><p>Ms. McDonald Rivet said that for many voters in her area, high costs were not just an inconvenience. They raised “fear in people, right, about their ability to make it,” she said.</p><p>To those voters, she said, litigating other subjects — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/politics/harris-trump-fascism.html" title="">whether Mr. Trump was a “fascist,”</a> for example, or the violence of the 2021 Capitol riot — simply felt less urgent.</p><p>“Those sorts of conversations don’t impact what is happening in their lives on a daily basis,” she said. “It comes down to, what is the price of a gallon of milk?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Frustration with the cost of living was not unique to one demographic or one state, noted Patrick Murray, who directs the polling institute at Monmouth University. But it made it harder for Ms. Harris to meet a Democratic goal of holding or improving on Mr. Biden’s 2020 margins in strongly pro-Trump territory.</p><p>“There’s no question that she did not make up ground,” Mr. Murray said. “Not only were they not going to win over Republican-leaning voters, but they were having a hard time getting out their own voters.”</p><p>To some extent, voters signaled in interviews this year, Mr. Trump benefited from nostalgia for the prepandemic era — while the chaos of his previous administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/us/politics/trump-presidency-election-voters.html" title="">receded for some.</a></p><p>“I don’t like the rhetoric from the Democrats,” said Jeff Markey, 66, a former airport technician from Wyoming, Mich., a more blue-collar city outside Grand Rapids. He said he had supported Democrats until Mr. Trump’s 2016 candidacy, and supported him again this year.</p><p>“I like how safe the country was when Trump was in, internationally and financially,” he added.</p><p>Senator John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat who <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/donuts-with-dems-event-held-beaver-county/4EF3JPS74VFXFO3NYQDU6F6UCA/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaigned for</a> Ms. Harris in conservative areas, also conceded that Republicans were sometimes effective at painting the Democratic Party as out of touch.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He cited a widely aired, anti-transgender <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/b6eed563-fb14-406f-af83-4c93086fa049/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump ad</a> that concluded: “Kamala’s for they/them. President Trump is for you.”</p><p>The ad was the “ultimate ear worm of this cycle,” Mr. Fetterman said. The last beat, he argued, could be interpreted by voters not just as anti-trans bigotry, which he deplored, but also as a subtler promise to help Americans economically.</p><p>“It’s reprehensible to weaponize and to pick on members of a marginalized community,” he said. But, he added, “I can understand why it was very effective.”</p><h2 id="link-5250109c">A pitch for populism</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.
