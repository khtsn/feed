Not that she had much choice: She couldn’t open her front door, no matter how hard she pushed against an estimated 50 inches of snow that had drifted over. She knew her S.U.V. was somewhere in her driveway, but she couldn’t tell exactly where.</p><p>“I’m just trying today to ignore the fact that I can’t get out of my house, and just be thankful for what I have in my house,” said Ms. Stolar, 33, an Erie native who said this storm was the worst that she could recall.</p><p>Parts of the upper Midwest and Northeast, particularly western New York and Pennsylvania, were bracing for more snow on Sunday after getting blanketed with more than two feet over the holiday weekend, with some parts getting more than three feet. The lake-effect snowstorm, which has already disrupted post-Thanksgiving travel and stranded dozens of vehicles on highways, threatened to bring the total to six feet of snow to some areas by Tuesday morning.</p><p>More than two million residents across Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York were under lake-effect snow warnings on Sunday morning, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/images/crh/dhs/wwa_population.png" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the National Weather Service</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Weather Service said snowfall on Saturday was heaviest along Interstate 90, which hugs Lake Erie from Buffalo through Pennsylvania and on to Cleveland. Erie and parts of northern Michigan, eastern Ohio and western New York received around 30 inches of snow or more, the agency said. National Guard troops were activated in New York and Pennsylvania.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/30/multimedia/30nat-snow/30nat-snow-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/30/multimedia/30nat-snow/30nat-snow-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/30/multimedia/30nat-snow/30nat-snow-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Deep snow piled on cars with a house in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/30/multimedia/30nat-snow/30nat-snow-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/30/multimedia/30nat-snow/30nat-snow-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/30/multimedia/30nat-snow/30nat-snow-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/30/multimedia/30nat-snow/30nat-snow-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/84d2f16a-8128-51ed-9cc6-1fc5b2c8e93c" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Snow accumulates on cars in Millcreek Township, Pa., on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kara Murphy for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some of the most dramatic scenes of the storm were out of Erie. Its normally lively downtown was deserted, as fast-falling snow trapped residents inside their homes. Motorists barred from Interstate 90 wound up stranded on two-lane highways, and truck owners towed cars out of ditches. Temporary shelters were set up for travelers who were stuck, where a few hundred people took refuge, according to Brenton Davis, the executive of Erie County, Pa.</p><p>Kevin Ricart, 33, who was visiting family in Erie from Chicago, had hoped to take his wife and their 2-year-old son to the Experience Children’s Museum downtown. But their plans were quickly derailed.</p><p>“Peach Street was a horror show,” Mr. Ricart said, referring to the city’s busy commercial corridor that stretches from downtown to a mall. “It was backed up as far as we could see, and a semi was stuck diagonally in the road. We just said ‘never mind’ and turned around.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The heavy snowfall was a lake-effect storm, caused by cold air pushing over the relatively warm waters of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, said Mitchell Gaines, lead meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Binghamton, N.Y. The storms pick up moisture over the lakes and then dump it when they hit colder land, typically engulfing relatively small areas with huge amounts of snow.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Whiteout conditions in Angola, N.Y., on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jalen Wright for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The State Police in New York rescued a heart transplant patient whose car had become stuck.</p><p>The patient, a 64-year-old woman, was driving with her husband to the Cleveland Clinic when they became stranded near Portland, N.Y., in severe snow. Troopers were able to rescue the couple and transport the woman to a nearby airport where she was flown to the hospital, the New York State Police <a href="https://troopers.ny.gov/news/troopers-transport-woman-winter-storm-heart-transplant" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>Towns across western New York were bracing for more snow, as Gov. Kathy Hochul, who declared a state of emergency on Friday in nearly a dozen counties, warned that the worst was yet to come in the state. The most significant snowfall in western New York was expected to last into Sunday.</p><p>Parts of Buffalo could receive up to <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=NYZ010&amp;warncounty=NYC029&amp;firewxzone=NYZ201&amp;local_place1=3%20Miles%20SE%20West%20Seneca%20NY&amp;product1=Hazardous+Weather+Outlook&amp;lat=42.8083&amp;lon=-78.7019" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">20 inches of snow</a> through Sunday, when the Bills host the San Francisco 49ers in nearby Orchard Park, N.Y. On Saturday, the storm prevented the delivery of the city’s daily paper, <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/lake-effect-storm-no-delivery-saturday-buffalo-news/article_0ea795e0-af29-11ef-81d7-2312e32e815f.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Buffalo News</a>, because of road closures and restrictions on commercial truck driving.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But not everyone was too concerned about the storm. Robert Warner, the manager of Cole’s, an Irish pub and restaurant in Buffalo, expected a snowy evening to be good for business.</p><p>“They bring people in, and then they don’t want to leave because they don’t want to go back outside,” he said of snowstorms.</p><p>“We’re getting, what, 10 inches? That’s not even going to faze us,” he added. “This is nothing.”</p><p>For at least one family, the snow even served as a tourist attraction. Donn Lentz, 43, made a spur-of-the-moment, two-hour drive from Beaver County, Pa., to Erie with his wife and two sons, 5 and 10, after hearing about the lake-effect snowstorm.</p><p>The family went sledding on Friday, and they were planning to go fishing for perch on Lake Erie on Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“The kids think it’s pretty wild,” Mr. Lentz said. “It’ll definitely be a memory for them.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Playing in the snow in Angola, N.Y.

Later in the week, another burst of Arctic air will hit western and central New York, but Michael Murphy, also a lead meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Binghamton, said it was too early to say how much more snow was coming.</p><p>In northeastern Ohio, forecasters expect another 12 to 18 inches by Tuesday. In the Erie area, snow will keep falling until Tuesday morning, for a total accumulation of four feet or more, Mr. Murphy said.</p><p>Arctic air is also expected to bring the coldest temperatures since mid-February to parts of the northern Great Plains into next week, the National Weather Service said, with some areas of North Dakota <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=976463107860766&amp;set=a.267232455450505" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recording wind chills</a> of negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

Stephanie Hunt, the owner of Copper Carriage, an antiques and home décor shop, was heartbroken at the postponement of a highly anticipated event featuring local vendors, restaurants and museums.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. Hunt had looked forward to welcoming customers to her cheerfully decorated shop. Instead, she spent the day at her downtown home, where neighbors came together to check on one another and coordinate grocery runs.</p><p>“It is pretty,” she said of the snow. “But it can be pretty at four inches, not four feet.”</p><p>Isabella Kwai<!-- -->, <!-- -->Kara Murphy<!-- -->, <!-- -->Alyce McFadden<!-- -->, <!-- -->Emmett Lindner<!-- -->, <!-- -->Cole Louison<!-- -->, <!-- -->Mike Ives<!-- --> and <!-- -->Daniel McGraw<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabelle Taft is a reporter covering national news and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their career.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>24</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Great Lakes Storm Hits Northeast and Midwest<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
