Grateful to be able to rise right now and speak. I just want to tell you what John Lewis said. It’s a quote so many people know. He said, ‘get in good trouble, necessary trouble.’ So tonight, I rise with the intention of getting in some good trouble. I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able. In just 71 days, the President of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for — from our highest offices, a sense of common decency. These are not normal times in America. And they should not be treated as such. John Lewis, so many heroes before us, would say that this is the time to stand up, to speak up. This is the time to get in some good trouble, to get into necessary trouble.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/01/multimedia/01trump-news-booker-speech-tbkc/01trump-news-booker-speech-tbkc-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, spoke for hours, criticizing the Trump administration’s policies on Social Security, education, health care and more.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-04-01T19:50:49-04:00"><span>April 1, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>7:50 p.m. ET</span></span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Senator Cory Booker, his voice still booming after more than a day spent on the Senate floor railing against the Trump administration, on Tuesday night surpassed Strom Thurmond for the longest Senate speech on record, in an act of astonishing stamina that he framed as a call to action.</p><p>Mr. Booker, a New Jersey Democrat and one-time presidential candidate, began his speech at 7 p.m. on Monday, vowing to speak as long as he was “physically able.” In a show of physical and oratorical endurance, he has lasted deep into Tuesday, assailing President Trump’s cuts to government agencies and crackdown on immigration.</p><p>At 7:19 p.m., 24 hours 19 minutes into his speech, Mr. Booker eclipsed Mr. Thurmond’s filibuster of a civil-rights bill in 1957. It was unclear for how much longer Mr. Booker might speak, though he said moments later that he would soon address “some of the biological urgencies I’m feeling.”</p><p>Cheers broke out in the chamber as Mr. Booker passed Mr. Thurmond. For a moment, Mr. Booker addressed the man he had eclipsed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“To hate him is wrong, and maybe my ego got too caught up that if I stood here, maybe, maybe, just maybe, I could break this record of the man who tried to stop the rights upon which I stand,” Mr. Booker said. “I’m not here though because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful.”</p><p>Earlier, at 4:20 p.m., Mr. Booker passed Senator Ted Cruz’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/us/politics/senate-budget-battle.html" title="">memorable</a> 21-hour-and-19-minute <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/us/politics/senate-budget-battle.html" title="">harangue</a> of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act in 2013. As the hours dragged on Tuesday and Mr. Booker kept speaking, tens of thousands followed along on livestreams, curious to see how long he might go.</p><p>Without bathroom breaks but with occasional pauses for encouraging questions from his fellow Democrats, Mr. Booker read from a binder of notes and waved a small copy of the U.S. Constitution. He gesticulated and roared. At times, he draped himself over his lectern.</p><p>His voice grew hoarse. But it remained strong.</p><p>He said the United States had reached a “moral moment” that required a stand against the Trump administration, which he said had brought the United States to a moment of “crisis” barely two months after the president returned to office.</p><p>“My voice is inadequate,” Mr. Booker said more than 19 hours into the speech. “My efforts today are inadequate to stop what they’re trying to do. But we the people are powerful.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>More than 67 years earlier, Mr. Thurmond set a record with a 24-hour-and-18-minute effort to block the passage of a civil-rights bill. The Senate’s <a href="https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/four_column_table/All_Night_Sessions.shtml#:~:text=During%20this%20session%2C%20Senator%20Wayne,MT)%20spoke%20for%20four%20hours" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">log of longest speeches</a> does not reach back to the founding of the nation, but Mr. Thurmond’s is the longest recorded.</p><p>Mr. Booker, who for weeks had contemplated delivering a marathon floor speech, had long been bothered that Mr. Thurmond, a segregationist from South Carolina, held the record, according to Mr. Booker’s office. Mr. Thurmond had sustained himself by sipping orange juice and munching on bits of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/us/politics/talking-filibuster-questions-answers.html" title="">beef and pumpernickel</a>; it was not clear if Mr. Booker had eaten anything on Tuesday, but two glasses of water rested on a desk in front of his lectern.</p><p>Unlike Mr. Thurmond’s speech, Mr. Booker’s was not a filibuster — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/us/politics/filibuster-senate-manchin-sinema.html" title="">a procedural tactic</a> that has been used to block legislation on many issues — because it did not come during a debate over a specific bill or nominee. But it did delay a planned vote on a Democratic-led bill to undo Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canada.</p><p>Mr. Booker paused from time to time to take encouraging questions from Democratic colleagues and for a midday prayer by the Senate chaplain. He divided his remarks into sections focused on aspects of the administration’s agenda, focusing on health care, education, immigration and national security.</p><p>He assailed what he said were Mr. Trump’s plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/upshot/trump-medicaid-tax-cuts.html" title="">cut funding for Medicaid</a> and other programs. The White House has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/fact-check-president-trump-will-always-protect-social-security-medicare/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied</a> that it plans to cut Medicaid benefits, but the president and his allies have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/business/trump-debt-tax-us.html" title="">attacked Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security</a> over what they claim is waste, fraud and abuse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Booker repeatedly drew on American history, comparing the moment facing the United States under Mr. Trump to the civil-rights movement and the fight for women’s suffrage.</p><p>He quoted from speeches by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/john-lewis-dead.html" title="">John Lewis</a>, the civil-rights hero and congressman, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/obituaries/john-mccain-dead.html" title="">John McCain</a>, the Republican senator from Arizona who broke with his party to defend Obamacare in 2017. At one point, Mr. Booker spent some 30 minutes reading an account by a Canadian citizen, Jasmine Mooney, detailing her detention in the United States by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/mooney-canadian-american-pie-actress-ice.html" title="">immigration enforcement</a> officers.</p><p>“We’re senators with all of this power, but in this democracy, the power of people is greater than the people in power,” Mr. Booker said, adding, “The civil rights movement wasn’t just won because of just a few Black folks that stood up.”</p><p>He called on a broad coalition of Americans to stand up to the Trump administration.</p><p>The White House dismissed Mr. Booker’s speech. A spokesman for the president, Harrison Fields, said Mr. Booker was seeking an “I am Spartacus” moment, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/nyregion/cory-booker-new-jersey.html" title="">referring to a comment by</a> the senator during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh that was mocked at the time as a bid to capture a viral moment.</p><p>“When will he realize he’s not Spartacus — he’s a spoof?” Mr. Fields said in a statement.</p><p>But in the U.S. Capitol, Mr. Booker was cheered on by his colleagues and staff. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority, told Mr. Booker that he was delivering a “tour de force.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It’s not only the amount of time that you have spent on the floor, what strength,” Mr. Schumer said, “but the brilliance of your indictment of this awful administration that is so destroying our democracy, that is taking so much away from working people.”</p><p>When fellow Democrats made their questions — offering interludes more than inquiries — Mr. Booker’s staff members jumped into action. Kleenex, for dabbing sweat from his brow, was replenished. A fresh binder, thick with printed material, was placed on the podium.</p><p>Representatives who had crossed the capitol from the House filtered in, drawn by the spectacle. They arrived, lingered, departed. Each bearing witness to the endurance test unfolding.</p><p>Throughout his speech, Mr. Booker attempted to frame his case as existing outside of run-of-the-mill Washington debates — as a call to action at a pivotal juncture.</p><p>“This is not right or left, it is right or wrong,” Mr. Booker said on Tuesday afternoon. “This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment. Where do you stand?”</p><p>Maya C.
