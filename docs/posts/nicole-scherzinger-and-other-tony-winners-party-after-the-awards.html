Soon, more than half a dozen stars were belting not just their own parts, but <em>every </em>part.</p><p>A cabaret moment is a familiar scene for any theater party, even on a night celebrating an unusual Broadway season. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It has been a banner year on the district’s 41 stages, thanks in large part to a flurry of shows with screen stars on the marquee: “Good Night, and Good Luck” (George Clooney), “The Picture of Dorian Gray” (Sarah Snook, who won a Tony Award for playing 26 different characters), “Othello” (Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal) and “Glengarry Glen Ross” (Bob Odenkirk, Bill Burr and Kieran Culkin), among others.</p><p>Many actors were making their Broadway debut.</p><p>“I’m so lucky to get to do it,” Sadie Sink, best known for her role as the tomboy Max in Netflix’s science fiction drama series “Stranger Things,” said at the MoMA party, celebrating her first nomination.</p><p>“I think that’s how you maintain your love for acting and challenge yourself in ways you maybe get a little spoiled with in the film and TV industry,” she added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div

Box office revenues have finally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/theater/broadway-grosses.html" title="">surpassed their prepandemic peak</a>, and the boost from high ticket prices has been a shot in the arm for an industry that is finally getting back on its feet.
