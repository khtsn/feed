    <h1>Inside the World of High School Mascots: Silly, Sweaty and Surprisingly Athletic</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Mackenzie Barnes has been a cheerleader since she was 10, so she’s used to being in front of crowds and getting fans excited for games. But last year, when Mackenzie, who is 15, became the mascot for her high school in Lancaster, Ohio, the job of making people cheer took on a new twist. Now, people are yelling <em>her</em> name.</p><p>Well … sort of. “Everyone is like, ‘Go see Gusto!’” Mackenzie says.</p><p>From high school sports to college programs to professional teams, mascots play a key role, bringing spectators into the fold of games. “A mascot gives the opportunity for connection,” says Jerome Bartlett, a mascot trainer and consultant who is based in Texas. “The purpose is to serve as a bridge between the fans in the stands and the players on the field, court,or ice.”</p><p>It’s hard work. But for the students who play school mascots, it’s also just … fun. “Being a mascot is like being a celebrity,” Bartlett says. “Everyone wants to see you. They are happy to see you. They want to take a photo with you and engage with you.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>To get a view from inside the foam heads, The New York Times for Kids tagged along with three high school mascots from around the United States on game day.

He watches TikToks of college mascots and goes to games to get ideas for dance moves and skits that he can do on the sidelines. Last summer, he even went to a mascot camp to learn insider tricks, like how to clean a sweat-soaked fuzzy costume. (He throws his suit into the washing machine and hangs it up to dry, but Buster’s foam head and feet need to be cleaned by hand.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Sure, it’s a lot of prep. Being a mascot is harder than it looks — especially in Texas, where wearing the suit can feel like walking in the desert with “a parka and a blanket on,” Jayden says.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jayden eats a pickle before every game because some research suggests that could help prevent muscle cramps.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eli Durst for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I’m in Texas, so the football games are crazy hot,” Jayden says. “Last year, we had games that were over 100 degrees.” Inside the suit, it’s even hotter.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eli Durst for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One of Jayden’s pranks is sneaking up to photographers and imitating them, holding up an imaginary camera and clicking.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eli Durst for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But it all comes together on game day: The band starts playing. The cheerleaders grab megaphones and jump up and down. The football players join in, pumping their helmets to the beat of the music. And Jayden’s there, too. “I like to grab a megaphone or two and do that with them.”</p><p>He hopes to be a college mascot and even a professional one someday. And he thinks more kids should give the job a try. “Kids might think it’s embarrassing,” he says. But that’s the beauty of the suit: “It’s anonymous,” he says. “Just let it all out.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p><h2 id="link-5824d559">Reggie the Raider</h2><h3 id="link-2e0d6dda"><span>Joshua Eigbe, 15</span></h3><h3 id="link-4e0ed04b"><span>St. Francis High School, Athol Springs, N.Y.</span></h3></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>When Joshua Eigbe started playing Reggie the Raider last fall, his school’s athletic trainer gave him two instructions: Have fun and make people happy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brandon Watson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The view from inside the Reggie costume is ... limited.

At games, he dances and waves (his go-to is the Griddy). He sometimes runs around playing tag with little kids. At open-house nights at school, he walks around popping his head into classrooms. Sometimes, he says, his cheeks hurt after games from smiling so much — even if nobody could see it.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p><h2 id="link-4d4d4ff5">Gusto the Gale</h2><h3 id="link-462b3f71"><span>Mackenzie Barnes, 15</span></h3><h3 id="link-642b7d4b"><span>Lancaster High School, Lancaster, Ohio</span></h3></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mackenzie Barnes, 15, started out as a junior-varsity cheerleader.

Or balance. “If someone comes up to me, I might bump into them,” she says.</p><p>Mackenzie started as a cheerleader in ninth grade, performing at junior-varsity football games on Saturdays. But then she learned that her school was looking for a new person to play Gusto, their yellow-and-blue, googly-eyed mascot, at Friday night football games. “I thought it would be cool to try,” she says.</p><p>She quickly discovered that performing dances inside a stiff, narrow tornado costume is tricky. “I can barely do the motions,” she says. She still grabs pompoms and performs routines — she just can’t lift her arms above her shoulders, or kick farther than a few inches. “I can do a small little jump in it, but not much, or you’ll fall,” she says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One perk of playing the school mascot: People are always happy to see you. “You’re walking around, hyping people up, waving,” Mackenzie says. “Everyone is like, ‘Go see Gusto!’ Or, ‘Oh, it’s Gusto!’ They’re screaming.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Kaiser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-35"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Most of Mackenzie’s classmates, besides those on the cheerleading team, don’t realize it’s her inside the Gusto suit. “It’s funny watching them try to figure it out,” she says.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Kaiser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-36"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I think of it as a job,” Mackenzie says. “You don’t get paid for it, but you’re walking into work and getting it done.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Kaiser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>But she finds ways to have fun with it. During a long speech at a school event, she started slowly spinning around like a tornado and cracking up the crowd. She has kept that spin move as part of her routine. And at every game, she makes sure to walk through the stands — with her cheerleader bodyguard — for high fives. (Well, <em>medium</em> fives.)</p><p>One of the best parts, she says, is interacting with the children she sees at games. “From the first time I did it, there were kids running up for hugs and pictures,” she says. “It was just nice seeing how big of a smile they had.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>MK</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>7</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>The Sweaty, Fuzzy, Fantastically Funny World of School Mascots<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
