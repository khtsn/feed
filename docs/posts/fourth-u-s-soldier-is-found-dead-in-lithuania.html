But the soldiers may have driven off the road and into a deep bog, and they appeared to have been trapped inside as the vehicle sank, according to an Army official in Europe. The U.S. Army is investigating the cause of the accident.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Rescue workers located the vehicle on March 26, but extracting it from the mud proved to be a daunting engineering challenge. Heavy equipment was brought in to dredge the bog, and divers, dogs, and drones — including one equipped with ground-penetrating radar — were deployed in the recovery effort.</p><p>The U.S. Army did not announce where the body of the fourth soldier had been found although a senior U.S. Army official in Europe said it was recovered near the M88. The soldiers had been training near Pabrade, a city in eastern Lithuania near the border with Belarus.</p><p>“I can’t say enough about the support our Lithuanian allies have provided us,” Gen.
