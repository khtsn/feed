Tightened environmental regulations turned the site into a money loser, and Inversand looked to close it.</p><p>Mantua had hoped that a developer would turn the pit into more suburban homes and shopping. But the Great Recession stalled those plans, and the quarry remained a hole in the ground.</p><p>The mining of marl had exposed prehistoric sediments that extend throughout this part of South Jersey, but are typically inconveniently buried more than 40 feet underground.</p><p>Dr. Lacovara, then at Drexel University in Philadelphia, had started visiting the site, which included a fossil-laden layer that appeared to coincide with the mass extinction 66 million years ago. Fossils of anything that died that day are scant within the extinction layer, because the conditions needed to preserve bones are rare.</p><p>“This is something that I personally and lots of other paleontologists have been looking for all around the world,” said Dr. Lacovara, adding that he had sought such a layer in southern Patagonia, the foothills of the Himalayas and elsewhere.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“And I found it behind the Lowe’s in New Jersey,” he said.</p><p>More than 100,000 fossils representing 100 species have been carefully excavated from the quarry and cataloged.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-10"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The quarry was dug in a part of New Jersey that was a shallow sea during the age of dinosaurs...</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>...and where sea creatures like the mosasaur swam.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Until the pandemic, the site opened once a year to the public for a community fossil dig, allowing people to collect fossils from sediments above the mass extinction layer.</p><p>Rowan University bought the site in 2015 for just under $2 million and lured Dr. Lacovara, who had graduated from the school when it was known as Glassboro State College, to join its faculty as the dean of the new School of Earth and Environment. Rowan also bought into Dr. Lacovara’s vision of building a museum.</p><p>“This is going to be a place to motivate young minds to become scientists,” Ali Houshmand, the president of Rowan, said in remarks at the start of the media tour.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Jean and Ric Edelman, founders of a financial advisory firm and also graduates of Glassboro State, contributed $25 million of the $75 million Rowan needed to build it.</p><p>“We immediately recognized that this had the potential to be a world-class destination,” Mr. Edelman said.</p><p>There is plenty of what one would expect to find in a dinosaur museum, which overlooks the fossil site in the former quarry. Near the ticket kiosks are skeletons of creatures that lived along the east coast of North America during the Cretaceous period. A mosasaur, a ferocious marine reptile, hangs from the ceiling, and a Dryptosaurus, a relative of T. rex, poses menacingly.</p><p>The museum highlights how some of the earliest dinosaur discoveries were made in New Jersey. The first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton — a duck-billed hadrosaur — was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/nyregion/dinosaur-site-is-made-a-landmark.html" title="Times article, Nov. 27, 1994.">dug up in a quarry</a> in Haddonfield in 1858.

That sense of “deep time” is meant to set up visitors for an understanding of how unnaturally quickly Earth’s climate is changing now.</p><p>Life-size re-creations of dinosaurs, big and not so big, fill the gallery. In the warmth of the late Cretaceous, sea levels were much higher and North America was a series of islands. In one, a big, angry plant-eater known as Astrodon stomps a juvenile meat-eater, Acrocanthosaurus, to death.</p><p>“We want to show the gritty underbelly of the dinosaur world,” Dr. Lacovara said.</p><p>The next gallery highlights the marine creatures that lived in the seas here, including sea turtles, sharks and saber-toothed salmon. This part of New Jersey was about 70 feet underwater and 15 to 30 miles offshore. “In this gallery, everything you see here is something that was found on the property,” Dr. Lacovara said.</p><p>That includes the fearsome mosasaurs.</p><p><strong>“</strong>I would say it’s a statistical near certainty that at some point in time, a mosasaur of this size was at that exact location,” Dr. Lacovara said, pointing to a re-creation of the creature.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Visitors then enter the Hall of Extinction and Hope. It shows the devastation that enveloped Earth after an asteroid struck the Gulf of Mexico off the Yucatán Peninsula, the fifth mass extinction in the planet’s history.</p><p>Then it turns to the present, which many other scientists describe as the sixth extinction as species struggle to adapt to the changes humans have made to the planet, including the destruction of habitats and global warming spurred by the rise in greenhouse gases released from the burning of fossil fuels.</p><p>One interactive exhibit shows the sharp rise in global temperatures over the past few centuries and allows a visitor to compare that curve with possible natural causes like sunspots, volcanic eruptions and cyclical changes in Earth’s orbit.</p><p>“None of those things explain the temperature variation,” Dr. Lacovara said.</p><p>But the simultaneous rise of temperature and greenhouse gases are “almost an exact correlation,” he said. “So at that point, you can draw your own conclusions.”</p><p>He said he wanted people to learn by examining the data themselves. “Not everybody is going to connect the dots,” Dr. Lacovara said, “but if they’re inclined to, our job is to help.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Louis Locona, at right, hands Kenneth Lacovara a fossil he had just dug up.

It expects to draw 200,000 visitors a year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>She said she was interested in hearing the reactions of visitors who are skeptical that the planet is undergoing rapid changes.</p><p>“When they come in and they learn the science, can they be convinced to consider something different?” Ms. Stoetzel said. “Maybe.”</p><p>For Dr. Lacovara, the message is simple. “You can’t love what you don’t know,” he said. “And we’re hoping to make people fall in love with this amazing planet that we have so that they take action to protect it.”</p><p>The museum’s learn-by-doing ethos will allow visitors to become paleontologists for a day. For an extra fee, from May through October, visitors will be able to dig through the quarry sands for fossils that they can take home.</p><p>The museum also includes fun flourishes. Take the elevator between its two floors, and you’ll hear a snippet of popular singers of the 1950s and 1960s like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/26/movies/dean-martin-pop-crooner-and-comic-actor-dies-at-78.html" title="">Dean Martin</a>, whose given name was Dino.

There is not a lot of ultraviolet light at night, and in mammals, the gene that encodes that receptor in the eye was co-opted by the olfactory system.</p><p>As a result, mammals tend to have a good sense of taste and smell but cannot see ultraviolet light.</p><p>“To us mammals, this looks like clear glass,” Dr. Lacovara said. “And I know this because the forklift truck driver who drove through one of these panes was a mammal.”</p><p>With the museum now open, Dr. Lacovara hopes to turn his attention toward proving that the mass death assemblage in the quarry pit indeed consists of animals killed in the planet-wide cataclysm that followed the asteroid strike.</p><p>That has been hard to settle, however, because creatures burrowing in the sea bottom churned up the sediments. As a result, the marker of the extinction — a layer containing substantial amounts of iridium, an element concentrated in asteroids and comets — is fuzzy.</p><p>“It’s almost like looking through a shower door at something,” Dr. Lacovara said.</p><p>He said he had all the data he needed, but work on the museum had not left him time to finish writing the papers.</p><p>“This has been all-consuming,” Dr. Lacovara said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A newly exposed, 66-million-year-old shark tooth lies in the dirt.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
