    <h1>Pentagon Appeals Court Upholds Plea Deals in Sept. 11 Case</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sept. 11 family members — both those opposing and those favoring the deals — were anxiously awaiting the panel’s decision before the judge’s trip to the war court at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, on Saturday for two weeks of hearings to separately examine the pleas of Mr. Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al Hawsawi.</p><p>Some have described the on-again, off-again nature of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/us/politics/sept-11-plea-process-families.html" title="">plea deal as agonizing</a>.</p><p>Absent an appeal, plea-taking proceedings at Guantánamo Bay in January would be a first step in a monthslong process that would potentially continue throughout 2025 with the selection of a military jury to hear the case, including victim testimony and any mitigating circumstances, and deliberate a sentence.</p><p>Rear Adm. Aaron C. Rugh, the chief prosecutor for military commissions, did not respond to a question Monday night about whether his team would ask the Justice Department to pursue the case further at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p><p>The plea deals were reached by Admiral Rugh’s prosecutors in more than two years of negotiations and were then approved by Susan K. Escallier, the official Mr. Austin put in charge of the military commissions.</p><p>Now those prosecutors will have to decide whether to seek to stop the pleas through a higher court of appeal. Mr. Austin’s decision to revoke the agreements has already prompted months of litigation.</p></div></div>
