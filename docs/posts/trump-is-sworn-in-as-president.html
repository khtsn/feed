His return to the White House for a second term caps a political comeback unlike any other in U.S. history. He was voted out of office, impeached, indicted and convicted of 34 felonies. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration.html" title="">Now, Trump is leading the country again</a>.</p><p>Cold weather in Washington caused the inauguration to be moved inside the Capitol Rotunda, the capacity of which narrowed the crowd <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration-attendees.html" title="">to several hundred V.I.P.s.</a> There, Trump delivered an inaugural speech vowing to save the U.S. from decline. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/20/us/trump-inauguration-speech-annotated.html" title="">Read an annotated version</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/20/us/politics/presidents-inaugural-address-speech.html" title="">see the words he used most</a>.</p><p>“The golden age of America begins right now,” Trump declared. “My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all these many betrayals that have taken place and give people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”</p><p>In his address, Trump largely dispensed with the broad unifying strokes that most presidents have turned to on the occasion. “One of the things that was striking about his speech was how much it was about him and his journey as much as it was about the country,” our chief White House correspondent Peter Baker told me. “He said that God saved him from an assassin’s bullet so he could save the country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump taking part in a signing ceremony at the Capitol. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Melina Mara</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-309cc450">Trump is planning big changes</h2><p>Just hours after taking office, Trump began to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/us/trump-executive-orders" title="">sign as many as 100 executive orders</a>, many designed to reverse Biden administration policies and to reshape the federal government to align with his own priorities.</p><p>Among them, Trump said he was planning to issue an order declaring a national emergency at the border, allowing the deployment of troops, and a national energy emergency, giving him the ability to speed up permits for pipelines.
