Hours later, the man was taken into custody in connection with the fatal attack while riding another F train.</p><p>Jessica Tisch, the police commissioner, said at a news conference on Sunday evening that the police apprehended someone they believe “carried out one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being, and it took the life of an innocent New Yorker.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Tisch said the officers who responded to the attack were patrolling the upper level of the station and went to investigate after they saw and smelled smoke just before 7:30 a.m.</p><p>Cameras on the subway car and body cameras on the responding officers caught images of the suspect during and after the attack, which they quickly circulated.</p><p>The man was taken into custody after three high schoolers called to report that they saw a man on an F train in Brooklyn who they believed appeared in photos shared by the police and that were posted by the news media.</p><p>When an officer met the students, the officer saw the man riding the F train and still wearing the same clothes from the time of the attack.</p><p>The officer radioed ahead to stop the train and keep the doors closed, which allowed the police to enter the subway car at Herald Square and take the man into custody, said Joseph Gulotta, the chief of transit for the Police Department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The man was found with a lighter, the police commissioner said. The man, who was not publicly identified, emigrated from Guatemala to the United States in 2018, Chief Gulotta said.</p><p>Additional details, such as what led up to the attack, were not immediately known. Investigators do not believe the man and the woman knew each other.</p><p>White police tape-lined the platform closest to the train as police officers and workers in hazardous material-like suits surveyed the damaged subway car on Sunday afternoon. Yellow tape also cordoned off each entrance to the platform.</p><p>David Johnson, 64, has slept in subways that turn around at the Coney Island station for about two years.</p><p>“The trains are getting more dangerous,” he said. While sleeping on a train in the station, he added, “I got hit in the head a couple of years back.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The same thing that makes the Coney Island station attractive for sleeping makes it likewise for crime: “It’s way out of the way,” Mr. Johnson said.</p><p>As for why a woman was targeted, Mr. Johnson shook his head and said it made no sense. “They pick on the weaker,” he said.</p><p>The attack on Sunday took place as subway safety has become a concern for riders and workers.</p><p>Also Sunday, at around 12:35 a.m., one person was killed and another injured in a stabbing on a southbound 7 train in Queens at the 61 St-Woodside station., according to the N.Y.P.D. A 26-year-old man, who has not been identified publicly, was taken into custody, according to the police.</p><p>Last month, a morning shooting on the Upper West Side interrupted transit service after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/nyregion/nyc-shooting-subway-delays.html" title="">a gunman fled into a nearby subway station.</a> Commuters had to take shelter on subway car floors, and trains were delayed citywide as the police searched for the man, who was later arrested.</p><p>In February, transit workers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/nyregion/subway-slashing-mta-protest.html" title="">stopped performing their duties</a> during the morning commute after an overnight slashing attack injured a conductor on an A train.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
