More cabinet members were expected to offer their resignations on Wednesday, and a new list of ministers was to be presented on Thursday.</p><p>“Our state institutions must be set up in such a way that Ukraine will achieve all the results we need — for all of us,” Mr. Zelensky said in an address to the nation on Tuesday night. “To do this, we need to strengthen some areas in the government — and personnel decisions have been prepared.”</p><p>The restructuring appears to be the most far-reaching shake-up of Mr. Zelensky’s administration since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, and it comes at a particularly precarious moment in the war, with Kyiv rushing reinforcements to its eastern front in an attempt to stabilize its defensive lines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia. He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.
