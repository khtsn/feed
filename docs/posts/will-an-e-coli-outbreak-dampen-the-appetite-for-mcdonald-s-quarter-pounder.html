Not for long, experts say, because hunger for the burger, which has been on the McDonald’s menu for over 50 years, will prevail in the end. The <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/quarter-pounder.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4-ounce patty</a> with slivered onions and pickles on a sesame seed bun is one of the chain’s most enduring items.</p><p>For now, you won’t find the Quarter Pounder in Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma.

It also has a leg up on the Big Mac because it’s less messy and can be eaten with just one hand — ideal for people on the go, Professor Hallman said.</p><p>“The Quarter Pounder is extremely important to the McDonald’s product line,” John A.

Jackson’s character, Jules Winnfield. “The Big Mac’s a Big Mac but they call it ‘le Big Mac.’”</p><p>There was even a <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/about-qp-fan-club.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quarter Pounder Fan Club</a>. Someone somewhere <a href="https://laurenacampora.fun/Quarter-Pounder-Fan-Club" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">owns a heart-shaped locket</a> with photographs of the burger inside and candles that smell like the Quarter Pounder’s ingredients.
