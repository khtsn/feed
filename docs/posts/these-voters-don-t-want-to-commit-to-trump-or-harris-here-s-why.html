They get more news from social media than most voters do. They worry about their economic security.</p><p>And they use phrases like “lesser of two evils” to describe the choice between former President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>These are the undecided, the unhappily committed and the uncertain voters who could make the difference in this tight presidential election.</p><p>Although most Americans are firmly in one camp or another, about 18 percent of likely voters nationwide have not definitively made up their minds, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/19/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html" title="">latest New York Times, Philadelphia Inquirer and Siena College poll</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A sliver of them are truly undecided; they do not know how they will actually vote. Others say they have made up their minds, but they acknowledge that their preference may not stick once their ballots are in hand.</p><p>The uncertainty and detachment of these voters can confound the campaigns. Some will change their minds, perhaps more than once, before Election Day. Others may not vote at all. Their indecision has drawn some scorn from partisans on either side.</p><p>A picture of them is emerging that helps explain, sometimes in contradictory ways, why they remain uncommitted. Their opinions, reflected in polling and interviews, suggest that longstanding voting patterns in the Democratic coalition are shifting in this election. And the undecideds are challenging old perceptions of how identity influences voting.</p><p>These voters are more likely than committed voters to be young, Black or Latino, and struggling financially. They ranked the economy as their No. 1 concern.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In any other recent election, many of the undecided and unhappy would have been natural Democratic voters. But their deep disillusionment with the last four years under President Biden is making that Democratic lean less of a sure thing. They say they trust Mr. Trump over Ms. Harris to handle the economy by a 40-percentage-point margin.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Uncommitted or unenthusiastic voters seem less affected by former President Donald Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Formula is expensive, clothing is expensive, diapers are expensive, rent is expensive,” said Viviana Christie, 23, a hair stylist and paramedic from Essex County, N.J., and the mother of twin six-month-old boys. “You name it. It’s all expensive.”</p><p>She blames Democrats for an economy that she described as “a wreck,” and said she now regrets voting for Mr. Biden in 2020.</p><p>Most unconvinced voters put the economy far above issues like abortion and immigration that motivate the bases of either party. But Ms. Christie, who is Hispanic, is also balancing other concerns. And her fear of losing access to health care — including the possibility that Republicans will enact a national abortion ban — is pushing Ms. Christie halfheartedly toward Ms. Harris.</p><p>Uncommitted or unenthusiastic voters also tend to be less affected by Mr. Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It’s not that they don’t care. In interviews, they said that they were bothered by his attacks on immigrants, including the false claims he made recently about Haitians, and by the tropes he uses about Black Americans.</p><p>They do not, however, consider that disqualifying. Asked whether Mr. Trump had offended them, most uncommitted voters said his insensitivity had not bothered them recently, the poll found. Committed voters, by contrast, were more likely to say that something he said lately had offended them.</p><p>Jayson Villarouel, a 22-year-old senior at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, said he was bothered by Mr. Trump’s whitewashing of the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Likewise with Mr. Trump’s race baiting. “That’s my biggest thing with Trump — he incites,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Villarouel, who is Black and plans to join the military after graduation, admires Ms. Harris’s restraint. “Harris, her strengths lie with keeping the country civil,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jayson Villarouel wants a strong leader, able to handle global threats.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Craine for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But he added that worrying about corrosive rhetoric when the world was going sideways seemed like a luxury the United States could not afford.</p><p>He said he was anxious about global tensions and the possibility that war could break out between the United States and China. “I think it’s the state of the world that’s just causing people to turn an eye to the ignorant stuff he says,” Mr. Villarouel said.</p><p>That is not an uncommon point of view. The Times/Inquirer/Siena poll found that voters nationally prefer the way Ms. Harris conducts herself over Mr. Trump, with 54 percent saying she had the temperament to be an effective president. But they also said they thought Mr. Trump was more respected by world leaders.</p><p>When Mr. Biden was the Democratic Party nominee, one factor that made the race especially fluid and unpredictable was the “double hater” — the voter who disliked both major presidential contenders. Around 15 percent of voters fell into that category at the time.</p><p>Today, just 6 percent of voters nationally say they feel that way. But among uncommitted voters, the dual antipathy remains higher, with 30 percent saying they dislike both Mr. Trump and Ms. Harris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Sammie Gay, a 40-year-old father of three from Lee County, Ala., said he voted for Mr. Biden in 2020 but feels alienated from both major political parties.</p><p>Mr. Gay said that Democrats seemed to have forgotten about Black families like his, while directing more attention toward other marginalized groups, like immigrants and L.G.B.T.Q. people.</p><p>“The Democratic Party as a whole seems to be against everything family,” he said. “Anything masculine, they seem to dislike that. They want to take that down.”</p><p>On the other hand, Republicans, Mr. Gay said, can seem downright hostile to Black people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many undecided voters use phrases like “lesser of two evils” to describe the choice between former President Donald J.

He said he would probably support Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, in November.</p><p>Dawson Harris, a self-employed 26-year-old from Oakland County, Mich., said he, too, did not trust either candidate.</p><p>“I feel like I’m going to lose either way, to be honest,” he said. His choice will be, he said, “the lesser of two evils.”</p><p>The vice president’s economic plans seemed to him to be pandering, while Mr. Trump’s could hurt the middle class, especially tariffs on foreign goods from countries like China.</p><p>“It sounds great: ‘We’re going to punish them,’” Mr. Harris said. “But it all comes back around on us.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He sarcastically dismissed Mr. Trump’s proposal to exclude tips from income tax, which the vice president also threw her support behind. “No taxes on tips? OK, sure.”</p><p>Mr. Harris said he would rather vote for a third party to register his disapproval with two-party rule. But since he lives in Michigan — a swing state that voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and Mr. Biden in 2020 — and believes strongly in maintaining Second Amendment protections for gun ownership, he reluctantly plans to vote for Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Villarouel, the Kennesaw State senior, said that this was the first presidential election he had followed closely. In 2020, when he was 18, he said, “I was kind of under a rock.”</p><p>In some ways, he said, he wished he could still be that blissfully unaware. “I kind of try to put off thinking about the election, even though November is coming up,” he said. “Damn, this is scary.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeremy W.
