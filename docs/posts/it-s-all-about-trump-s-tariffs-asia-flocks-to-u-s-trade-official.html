The heaviest duties were applied to imports from trading partners in Asia.</p><p>The main attraction at the meeting was Jamieson Greer, the United States Trade Representative and one of the two main negotiators who reached an agreement for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/china-us-tariffs.html" title="">temporary truce on tariffs with China</a> last weekend. He told reporters that he could not do interviews because his schedule was jam-packed with meetings with representatives from various nations.</p><p>Cheong Inkyo, South Korea’s minister of trade, said at a news briefing that many participating countries had originally planned to send vice ministers to the meeting but then changed their minds and sent ministers to push for meetings with Mr. Greer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>David Boling, a director of Japan and Asia trade at the Eurasia Group and a former U.S. trade negotiator, said most countries are eager to meet with American officials at meetings of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, but such discussions were even more critical this time because of the looming deadline on July 9.</p><p>“It’s all about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">Trump’s tariffs</a>,” said Mr. Boling. “All those trade ministers who come in, their number one goal is to get some sort of face time with Jamieson Greer.”</p><p>Last month, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on goods from dozens of countries that he claimed took advantage of the United States by running up trade surpluses.</p><p>A week later, after blowback in the financial markets, he suspended the tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations. He kept a 10 percent “base-line” tariff on all imports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In setting the reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump reserved some of the most punishing duties for longtime allies such as South Korea and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/nissan-kanda-japan-factory.html" title="">Japan</a> and countries in Southeast Asia like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/business/trump-tariffs-vietnam-factories.html" title="">Vietnam</a>, Thailand and Cambodia, which had become manufacturing alternatives to China.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="tariff-timeline-embed" data-id="100000010074956" data-source-id="100000010074956"><div slug="tariff-timeline-embed" data-sourceid="100000010074956" id="embed-id-100000010074956">

He said he explained the “Korean situation” and the challenges of holding trade talks ahead of an election on June 3.</p><p>Mr. Trump hit South Korea, a longtime U.S. ally, with a 25 percent tariff. Government officials in Seoul are trying to negotiate with the Trump administration at a delicate time in South Korean politics. Campaigning is beginning for what is expected to be a deeply <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/world/asia/south-korea-presidential-election-candidates.html" title="">divided and contentious election</a>, necessitated by the removal last month of former President <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/asia/south-korea-removes-impeached-president.html" title="">Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached</a> for his short-lived attempt to place the country under martial law.</p><p>Mr. Greer also met with the vice chairman of HD Hyundai, the heavy-industry arm of South Korea’s sprawling Hyundai conglomerate, to discuss opportunities for cooperation in shipbuilding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Both Seoul and Washington have said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/world/asia/skorea-trump-tariffs-ships.html" title="">Mr. Trump wants shipbuilding</a> to be part of a trade deal between the two countries. South Korean officials have called it an important negotiating card.</p><p>According to South Korean media reports, Mr. Greer also met with Li Chenggang, China’s trade envoy, who was part of the Chinese delegation Mr. Greer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent negotiated with last weekend.</p><p>Under the agreement, the United States reduced tariffs on Chinese imports to 30 percent from 145 percent, and China cut levies on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. The reprieve is set to expire in early August.</p><p>Trade <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/us-china-tariffs-trade-war.html" title="">tensions between the United States and China</a> — the world’s two largest economies — loomed large over the meeting. APEC slashed its economic outlook for the region from projections made two months earlier, before Mr. Trump announced the reciprocal tariffs, which affect more than half of APEC’s 21 members.</p><p>The group, which accounts for around half of global trade and about 60 percent of economic output, cut its forecast for growth this year to 2.6 percent from its previous projection of 3.3 percent. It cited “trade frictions” and “policy uncertainty.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Carlos Kuriyama, who leads economic and trade research at APEC, said that a reduction in trade with the United States would be difficult to overcome.</p><p>“The U.S. is the largest market and the largest economy, so it represents a very significant percentage of the global economy,” said Mr. Kuriyama. “It will be hard to find a way to replace all these opportunities<em>.”</em></p><p>Choe Sang-Hun<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Daisuke Wakabayashi is an Asia business correspondent for The Times based in Seoul, covering economic, corporate and geopolitical stories from the region.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>How Business Owners Are Pivoting: </strong>An easing in President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods gave businesses some breathing room. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/tariffs-small-business.html">Long-term planning, though, is still on pause</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Warnings From Walmart</strong><strong>:</strong> The retail giant, known for its low prices, reported another quarter of solid sales, but cautioned that Trump’s tariffs will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/walmart-earnings-tariffs-consumer.html">push the company to start raising prices</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Booming Business of Returned Products:</strong> As retailers slow down orders for foreign goods because of tariffs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/tariffs-returns-reverse-logistics.html">companies that recirculate overstocked or returned items</a> may help fill the gap.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skepticism of American Meat:</strong> Despite a provisional agreement, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/us-uk-trade-deal-agriculture.html">differences in food production</a> could make it difficult for Britain and the United States to reach a more comprehensive trade agreement, and for American farmers to materially increase their exports to Britain.</p></li><li><p><strong>China Readies for a Rocky Time: </strong>Even as China and the U.S. take steps to rein in their trade war, Beijing is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/asia/china-us-tariffs-security.html">preparing for a broader rivalry</a> with Washington to continue.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Company Welcoming Tariffs:</strong> Carvana, which sells used cars online, says President Trump’s tariffs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/business/economy/trump-tariffs-used-cars-carvana.html">could help business</a> by increasing demand for its vehicles.</p></li><li><p><strong>How Pandora Will Manage the Trade War:</strong> The Danish jewelry company said it was “battle ready,” with plans to raise prices and reroute shipments from the United States, but tariffs could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/business/trump-tariffs-pandora-jewelry.html">potentially cost it millions of dollars</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
