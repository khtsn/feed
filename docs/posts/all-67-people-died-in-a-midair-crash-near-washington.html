    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Rescue crews rushed into the Potomac River, just three miles from the White House, after a commercial jet carrying 64 people collided last night with an Army helicopter carrying three service members. By morning, officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/plane-crash-washington-dc" title="">determined that no one had survived</a>.</p><p>The incident was the first fatal crash involving a major U.S. airline in more than 15 years. The night was clear, and both aircraft were following standard flight paths, officials said. But roughly a minute after the helicopter crew told air traffic control that it could see the jet, the two aircraft collided. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/30/us/washington-dc-plane-crash-helicopter-maps-photos.html" title="">We mapped out the flight paths</a>.</p><p>Among the victims on the flight, a two-and-a-half-hour journey from Wichita, Kansas, were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/plane-crash-washington-dc#friends-returning-from-a-hunting-trip-were-among-the-passengers" title="">a group of friends</a> returning from a duck hunting trip and more than a dozen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/figure-skaters-dc-plane-crash.html" title="">figure skaters</a>, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/europe/russian-figure-skaters-dc-plane-crash-vadim-naumov-yevgeniya-shishkova.html" title="">two world champions</a> from Russia.</p><p>Emergency personnel pulled more than two dozen bodies from icy water, and federal transportation officials launched an investigation into the disaster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>An internal preliminary report, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/business/air-traffic-control-staffing-plane-crash.html" title="">reviewed by The Times</a>, found that staffing at the air traffic control tower was “not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic.” The controller who was handling helicopters was also instructing landing and departing planes, duties typically managed by two people.</p><p>Shortly before the crash, the jet’s pilots were asked to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/fatal-crash-runway.html?smid=url-share" title="">pivot their landing route</a> from one runway to another. A webcam <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/plane-crash-dc-helicopter-reagan-airport.html" title="">caught the moment of impact</a>.</p><p>In a news conference, President Trump largely blamed the Army helicopter crew for the crash, who, he said, “should’ve seen where they were going.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/trump-plane-crash-dei-faa-diversity.html" title="">The president also blamed the diversity policies of his Democratic predecessors</a>, arguing that standards for air traffic controllers had become too lax. When asked for evidence, Trump said: “I have common sense.”</p><p><strong>For more: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/washington-dc-plane-helicopter-crash-timeline.html" title="">Here’s a timeline</a> of the crash and the recovery effort.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-285e3f5a">Three high-profile Trump nominees faced tough questions</h2><p>Kash Patel, Trump’s pick to run the F.B.I., alternated between deference and defiance today during his Senate confirmation hearing.
