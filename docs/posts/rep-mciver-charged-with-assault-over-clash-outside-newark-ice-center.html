Now we will let the justice system work.”</p><p>She added that she had sought a resolution without bringing criminal charges, but that Ms. McIver had declined.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RepLaMonica/status/1924617694298378675/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Monday, Ms. McIver blamed federal law enforcement for instigating the clash, saying that “ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation.”</p><p>“The charges against me are purely political — they mischaracterize and distort my actions, and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Habba also announced that she had dismissed a misdemeanor charge for trespass against Ras J. Baraka, the Democratic mayor of Newark, whose arrest had precipitated the flare-up with federal agents after he sought to join the lawmakers on their tour of the detention center but was denied entry.</p><p>She said she had dismissed the charge “for the sake of moving forward.”</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Baraka welcomed the dropping of the charges but said he would “continue to advocate for the humane treatment of detainees” at the detention center, known as Delaney Hall, and ensure it complies with city code and regulations.</p><p>Ms. McIver and the two other lawmakers — Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez — have pushed back against the Trump administration’s contention that the legislators stormed into the detention center. The federal government’s narrative has also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/nyregion/newark-ice-protest-lawmakers-ras-baraka.html" title="">contradicted by video footage and by witnesses</a> who were at the scene.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The lawmakers visited the detention center on May 9 to conduct an oversight visit. They said that they were allowed inside to tour the 1,000-bed facility, which opened this month amid resistance from local officials who are opposed to President Trump’s deportation efforts.</p><p>Ms. McIver and the other lawmakers, as well as the mayor’s supporters, formed a physical circle around Mr. Baraka, video <a href="https://www.instagram.com/repbonnie/reel/DJcfBRhyxHv/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shows</a>, leading to jostling and a confusing scrum that the Trump administration has sought to cast as a violent mob attack on federal officers. Federal officials arrested Mr. Baraka and charged him with trespassing, a misdemeanor; Mr. Baraka had said he was being selectively prosecuted.</p><p>Both sides have pointed to videos from the chaotic scuffle — from recordings by protesters to footage from body cameras released by the Department of Homeland Security — to accuse each other of instigating the altercation, which did not appear to lead to any injuries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/16/us/politics/newark-arrest-footage-cover/newark-arrest-footage-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>NJ PBS/NJ Spotlight News, via X</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Footage from a body-worn camera <a href="https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1921217033825644967/video/2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared by Fox News</a> shows the lawmakers and a group of officers outside the facility’s fence.

The lawmaker, who is standing with her back against a car and is surrounded by officers in tactical gear, can be heard screaming at officers and saying, “Ma’am, he just assaulted me.”</p><p>After the incident, Ms. McIver said she had been shoved by officers from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.</p><p>In a joint <a href="https://x.com/AnthonyAdragna/status/1924631403599196527\" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Monday, the Democratic leadership of the House called the charges against Ms. McIver “extreme, morally bankrupt and lacks any basis in law or fact.”</p><p>Paul J. Fishman, a lawyer for Ms. McIver, called the decision to charge the congresswoman “spectacularly inappropriate.”</p><p>“As a member of Congress, she has the right and responsibility to see how ICE is treating detainees,” said Mr. Fishman, who previously served as U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey. “Rather than facilitating that inspection, ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a peaceful situation into chaos.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>After Mr. Baraka was taken into custody, the three lawmakers entered Delaney Hall and took the tour they had been waiting for.</p><p>Republicans have seized on the episode to portray Democrats as more interested in protecting the immigrants with criminal records they said are being held inside the facility than U.S. citizens.</p><p>In television interviews and on social media, Department of Homeland Security officials have for days accused the lawmakers of “storming” into the facility, suggesting last week that assault charges were looming. The agency shared a <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1921271072147546558" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> on X that it says shows Ms. McIver assaulting an ICE agent.</p><p>Representative Buddy Carter, a Republican from Georgia, introduced <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/13/congress/new-jersey-democrats-committees-buddy-carter-00345479" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a resolution seeking to strip</a> the lawmakers of their committee assignments in the House of Representatives this week.

But Mr. Baraka, who is running for governor of New Jersey, galvanized opposition against the detention center, arguing that it had opened without the proper city permits or inspections.</p><p>The controversy engulfing the facility drew the attention of the New Jersey lawmakers, who visited the facility on May 9 to inspect the conditions. The mayor tried to join the congressional delegation but was not allowed to do so.</p><p>He was initially allowed past the fence, according to <a href="https://x.com/rasjbaraka/status/1922643477944246706" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> he released last week that he said showed him being invited past the gates before he was arrested, seemingly contradicting accusations that he had barged into the facility without permission. He was then asked to leave multiple times and exited voluntarily, according to video footage and the mayor’s aides.</p><p>However, federal agents wearing face coverings and military fatigues appeared outside the gates to arrest the mayor, video shows, leading to a chaotic scene.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-16"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>New Jersey Mayor Arrested After Trying to Enter ICE Facility</h2><h4>Federal officials arrested Ras J.
