The team would make waves under their new purple banner when they upset the competition to take the crown of Europe&#39;s best. Their success would continue later in the year when they qualified for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/466/valorant-champions-tour-stage-3-masters-berlin" target="_blank">Masters Berlin</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/449/valorant-champions-2021" target="_blank">Champions 2021</a>. They would place a respectable top eight at Masters Berlin, but it was at Champions where they really made their name known.

<p>Acend managed to maintain their Champions winning roster for the following season, but were unable to reach the same heights. They would fall behind their regional competition and miss all three of the international events in 2022. Following this subpar season, Acend would not be selected as a partnership team for 2023, leaving their star-studded roster picked apart and forcing them to rebuild from the ground up.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1557/challengers-league-east-surge-split-2/playoffs-phase-2" target="_blank">2023 VCL East Surge</a>, the newly rebuilt Acend were dominant, winning both splits in 3-0 fashion to qualify themselves for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1590/champions-tour-2023-emea-ascension/playoffs" target="_blank">Ascension</a> and earn a shot at returning to the VCT stage. They would make it to the top three at the tournament before being <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/237655/acend-vs-gentle-mates-champions-tour-2023-emea-ascension-lbf" target="_blank">swept</a> by the eventual winners of <span data-ref-id="3">

<p>In their <a href="https://x.com/AcendClub/status/1835685812031365594/photo/2" target="_blank">announcement</a> statement, Acend cite the decline of the tier two scene as a primary reason for their departure. “The increasingly hostile ecosystem has simply made it untenable to responsibly run a team,” reads their statement.</p>
