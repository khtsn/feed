</span>, with either EMEA&#39;s first seed or the reigning champions destined to go home first.</p>

<p>These teams last matched up at the start of this year at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> in a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/448598/edward-gaming-vs-team-liquid-champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok-r1" target="_blank">2-0 victory</a> for EDG. Since then, both teams have had their share of ups, downs, and player swaps, but it was Liquid in the end who earned the right to continue their year with a narrow 2-1 win. </p>

<p>The match kicked off on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542209/team-liquid-vs-edward-gaming-valorant-champions-2025-elim-c/?game=233436&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Sunset</a>. Both teams continued to use the compositions they had shown in their respective regions, with Liquid playing Raze-Yoru and EDG opting into the Neon-Breach that had in part defined their Champions run last year. </p>

<p>Despite Liquid being the ones to pick the map, they were locked out from the start. EDG converted the first bonus round with an aggressive Judge 3K from <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> to take an early 4-0 lead. From there, a series of mishaps on the side of Liquid, including a bizarre lost Dimensional Drift for <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/14681/kamo">
		kamo	</a>
</span> in round 7, along with oppressive Operator play from ZmjjKK set into motion a 10-round win streak for the side of EDG.</p>


<p><em>ZmjjKK punishes Liquid with his signature Operator.</em></p>

<p><span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/309/patitek">
		paTiTek	</a>
</span> managed to win one attack round by using his Omen ultimate to teleport into the opponent&#39;s spawn, but it only delayed the inevitable as EDG won Sunset 13-3. ZmjjKK dominated throughout with 22 kills to 9 deaths and 210 ADR. </p>

<p>The next map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542209/team-liquid-vs-edward-gaming-valorant-champions-2025-elim-c/?game=233437&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a>, where EDG switched from Neon and Sage to Waylay and Astra after suffering a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542207/nrg-vs-edward-gaming-valorant-champions-2025-opening-c/?game=233430&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">10-2 comeback</a> at the hands of NRG last week. Even with the changeup, however, their defensive woes continued as a revived Liquid collected a 9-3 attack half off of strong mid lurks and site executes. <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/457/nats">
		nAts	</a>
</span> in particular wreaked havoc around the map on Cypher, at one point winning a 1v3 and ending the half with an unbelievable 22/4 K/D.</p>


<p><em>kamo keeps his team&#39;s momentum going with a smooth ace.</em></p>

<p>EDG extended the map in the second half with a pistol win and a couple of heavy ultimate rounds, but Liquid&#39;s blend of aggressive peeks into A Main and steadfast backsite holds on their defense gave them the rounds they needed to close out Abyss 13-6. Liquid&#39;s captain ended the map with 27 kills, 218 ADR, and a 1.94 rating.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542209/team-liquid-vs-edward-gaming-valorant-champions-2025-elim-c/?game=233438&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a> was the decider. This time, both teams made compositional adjustments, with Liquid moving to Raze-Yoru and EDG going for the rare Tejo pick. A chaotic opener set the tone for the rest of the map as both teams dropped anti-ecos within the first five rounds. EDG seized control for a moment, going up 5-3 and forcing a Liquid timeout, but a low buy win followed by a nAts 4K in rounds 9 and 10 made for an even 6-6 half. </p>

<p>EDG won the final pistol, making it a 5-1 pistol round record for them over the course of the series. This time dodging the eco, they seemed primed to claim victory, finding consistent first picks against Liquid&#39;s Duelists and forging ahead to a 10-7 lead. </p>

<p>Resilient as ever, Liquid held on against the odds, drawing the score first to 10-9 and then forcing overtime in the face of two match points for EDG. After finally finding their first match point at 14-13 with a crucial 3v5, they capitalized immediately, winning out Bind 15-13. While better-laid plans in midround situations ultimately won Liquid the day, nAts continued to lead from the front individually with a server-high 27 kills. </p>


<p><em>A perfect swing into Lamps by paTiTek and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/2168/trexx">
		trexx	</a>
</span> makes all the difference for Liquid in overtime.</em></p>

<p>With this result, the reigning world champions will be denied the chance of defending their Champions title, exiting the tournament winless after a turbulent year. On the other side, Liquid progress to the group <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542210/drx-vs-team-liquid-valorant-champions-2025-decider-c" target="_blank">decider</a> and will seek revenge against <span data-ref-id="7">
