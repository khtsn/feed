Mr. Carney on Wednesday characterized Mr. Trump’s trade actions as “illogical” and “unjustified.”</p><p>The drop in demand for Canadian goods in the midst of the tariff turmoil was greater than anticipated. Analysts surveyed by Reuters expected a deficit of 1.5 billion Canadian dollars in April.</p><p>Exports of cars and light trucks fell by 22.9 percent after the tariffs went into effect. That more than wiped out a 21 percent increase between November and March likely caused by manufacturers stockpiling vehicles in anticipation of tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump has said that he wants to return auto production in the United States by making producing vehicles in Canada too expensive.</p><p>Trade in auto and auto products between the two countries has been roughly balanced since they signed an auto-specific trade pact in 1965.</p><p>The tariffs have created havoc for the Canadian auto industry, which exports most of its production to the United States. Trade in autos and auto parts between the two countries has been roughly balanced for more than 50 years.</p><p>Stellantis has twice temporarily shut down an assembly plant in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/world/canada/trump-tariffs-ontario.html" title="">Windsor, Ontario</a>, that makes Chrysler minivans and Dodge muscle cars in response to the tariffs. It also indefinitely suspended production of an electric version of the Dodge Charger Daytona muscle car and stopped a $1 billion retooling to make a new Jeep model at another factory in Brampton, Ontario.</p><p>Honda suspended an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/americas/honda-trump-tariffs-us-canada.html" title="">$11 billion plan to make electric vehicles</a> and batteries in Ontario and shifted production of an S.U.V. model from its Canadian plant to the United States, though the company said that will not affect its overall Canadian output.</p><p>And General Motors cut a third shift at a pickup truck plant in Ontario.</p><p>Other factors contributed to the expanded deficit, including a rising Canadian dollar and a decline in the price of oil, Canada’s largest export by value to the United States.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ian Austen reports on Canada for The Times based in Ottawa.
