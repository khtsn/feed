Mr. Yoon’s office was not immediately available to comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Yoon is the first sitting president of South Korea to face a criminal investigation, and he now faces the possibility of being arrested while in office. The opposition has accused Mr. Yoon ​of committing insurrection when he sent the troops to the Assembly to block lawmakers from voting against military rule. If Mr. Yoon is arrested, it is unclear what would happen to his role as the country’s leader. The Constitution only states that when the president is “unable to perform his or her duties for any reason,” the prime minister ​will step in as an interim leader.</p><p>Some scholars say the only ways to incapacitate the president would be impeachment or his resignation. It is not clear if the opposition has enough support from lawmakers in the ruling People Power Party, or P.P.P., to pass an impeachment bill. Their first attempt failed on Saturday when the P.P.P. boycotted the vote, denying the quorum in parliament needed for the bill to pass.</p><p>On Wednesday, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo apologized for being unable to stop the president from declaring martial law. “I am truly sorry and feel a lot of guilt” he said at the National Assembly, bowing his head multiple times.</p><p>Large protests erupted following the imposition of martial law, with people calling for Mr. Yoon’s ouster and impeachment. Tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the National Assembly on Saturday as Mr. Yoon survived an impeachment motion after his party decided to not participate in the vote.</p><p>But the widespread anger over Mr. Yoon’s declaration of martial law is yet to subside, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-explained.html" title="">his future is uncertain</a>. His own party has said he is “excluded” from running state affairs. And while it saved Mr. Yoon from impeachment, it has said the plan is to give him an “orderly exit.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Kim Yong-hyun, Mr. Yoon’s former defense minister who was arrested on charges​ of being involved in insurrection, tried to kill himself late Tuesday, Shin Yong-hae, the justice ministry official in charge of correctional facilities, told a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday.</p><p>Mr. Kim was trying to end his life while in a jail restroom but gave up his attempt when wardens rushed to stop him, Mr. Shin said. Mr. Kim was in stable condition after the incident, Mr. Shin added.​</p><p>The chiefs of the national police agency and the Seoul metropolitan police were also detained by investigators on Wednesday for questioning over their roles in the six hours of martial law that rocked South Korea a week ago.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
