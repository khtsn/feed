The other image, apparently recorded through a window, shows the man walking on the street wearing the same mask, a black puffer jacket and a hood pulled over his head.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A second image appears to show the suspect standing outside the taxi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NYPD, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The police have said that the man caught a taxi around 7 a.m. Wednesday on the Upper West Side, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/05/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-brian-thompson-shooting-maps-photos.html" title="">about 15 minutes after</a> he shot Mr. Thompson.
