    <h1>NYPD Releases New Images of Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO Shooting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Police Department has released two new images of the man it believes fatally shot the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare, including one showing him in the back seat of a taxi on the day of the shooting.</p><p>The images were released late Saturday night as the frantic investigation continued to identify and track down the killer of Brian Thompson, 50, the health care executive gunned down outside the New York Hilton Midtown hotel in Manhattan on Wednesday.</p><p>One image, captured from the front of the cab, appears to show the unidentified suspect peering forward from the vehicleâ€™s back seat with his face partially obscured by a blue surgical mask, a dark hat and a black hood. The other image, apparently recorded through a window, shows the man walking on the street wearing the same mask, a black puffer jacket and a hood pulled over his head.</p></div></div>
