It was rich in nutrients, and it helped keep the sludge out of landfills.</p><p>But a growing body of research shows that this black sludge, made from the sewage that flows from homes and factories, can contain heavy concentrations of chemicals thought to increase the risk of certain types of cancer and to cause birth defects and developmental delays in children.</p><p>Known as “forever chemicals” because of their longevity, these toxic contaminants are now being detected, sometimes at high levels, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004313542101229X" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on farmland</a> <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es1039425" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">across the country</a>, including in Texas, Maine, Michigan, New York and Tennessee. In some cases the chemicals are suspected of sickening or killing livestock and are turning up in produce. Farmers are beginning to fear for their own health.</p><p>The national scale of farmland contamination by these chemicals — which are used in everything from microwave popcorn bags and firefighting gear to nonstick pans and stain-resistant carpets — is only now starting to become apparent. There are now lawsuits against providers of the fertilizer, as well as against the Environmental Protection Agency, alleging that the agency failed to regulate the chemicals, known as PFAS.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In Michigan, among the first states to investigate the chemicals in sludge fertilizer, officials shut down one farm where tests found particularly high concentrations in the soil and in cattle that grazed on the land. This year, the state prohibited the property from ever again being used for agriculture. Michigan hasn’t conducted widespread testing at other farms, partly out of concern for the economic effects on its agriculture industry.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/26/multimedia/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/26/multimedia/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/26/multimedia/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Interior of an empty barn, weeds peeking up through the floor." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/26/multimedia/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/26/multimedia/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/26/multimedia/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/26/multimedia/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh/00CLI-SLUDGE-FOOD-18-ckqh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A cattle barn in Michigan, now empty, after the land and the animals were found to be contaminated.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Elconin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One of the animals from the contaminated herd Michigan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Elconin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In 2022, Maine banned the use of sewage sludge on agricultural fields. It was the first state to do so and is the only state to systematically test farms for the chemicals. Investigators have found contamination on at least 68 of the more than 100 farms checked so far, with some 1,000 sites still to be tested.</p><p>“Investigating PFAS is like opening Pandora’s box,” said Nancy McBrady, deputy commissioner of Maine’s Department of Agriculture.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In Texas, several ranchers blamed the chemicals for the deaths of cattle, horses and catfish on their properties after sewage sludge was used as fertilizer on neighboring farmland. Levels of one PFAS chemical in surface water exceeded 1,300 parts per trillion, they say in a lawsuit filed this year against Synagro, the company that supplied the fertilizer. While not directly comparable, the E.P.A.’s drinking-water standard for two PFAS chemicals is 4 parts per trillion.</p><p>“We were so desperate to figure out what’s going on, what’s taking our cows from us,” said Tony Coleman, who raises cattle on a 315-acre ranch with his wife, Karen, and her mother, Patsy Schultz, in Johnson County, Texas.</p><p>“When we got the tests back, everything started to make sense,” Mr. Coleman said.</p><p>Synagro, which is owned by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said it was “vigorously contesting” the allegations. It said its preliminary study of PFAS levels where the sludge was applied showed numbers “drastically lower” than what the plaintiffs claimed, less than 4 parts per trillion in surface water, for example.</p><p>“Synagro does not generate PFAS or use them in our processes,” said Kip Cleverley, the company’s chief sustainability officer. “In other words, we are a passive receiver, as are our wastewater utility partners.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Everything started to make sense,” said Tony Coleman, seen here with his wife, Karen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>At the center of the crisis is the Environmental Protection Agency, which for decades has encouraged the use of sewage as fertilizer. The agency regulates pathogens and heavy metals in sewage fertilizer, but not PFAS, even as evidence has mounted of their health risks and of their presence in sewage.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The E.P.A. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas-biosolids" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is currently studying the risks</a> posed by PFAS in sludge fertilizer (which the industry calls biosolids) to determine if new rules are necessary.</p><p>The agency continues to promote its use on cropland, though elsewhere it has started to take action. In April, it ordered utilities to slash PFAS <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/climate/epa-pfas-drinking-water.html" title="">levels in drinking water</a> to near zero and designated two types of the chemical as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/climate/epa-pfas-superfund-cleanup.html" title="">hazardous substances</a> that must be cleaned up by polluters. The agency now says there is no safe level of PFAS for humans.</p><p>The government was working “to better understand the scope of farms that may have applied contaminated biosolids and develop targeted interventions to support farmers and protect the food supply,” the E.P.A. said in a statement.</p><p>Research has shown that PFAS can enter the human food chain from contaminated crops and livestock.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Texas field fertilized with biosolids from Synagro.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A watering hole on the Coleman farm.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>It’s difficult to know how much fertilizer sludge is used nationwide, and E.P.A. data is incomplete. The fertilizer <a href="https://www.biosolidsdata.org/data-downloads" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">industry say</a>s more than 2 million dry tons were used on 4.6 million acres of farmland in 2018. And it estimates that farmers have obtained permits to use sewage sludge on nearly 70 million acres, or about a fifth of all U.S. agricultural land.</p><p>Sewage sludge is also applied to landscaping, golf courses and forest land. And it has been used to fill up old mines.</p><p>“There’s clearly a need to test every place where biosolids were applied,” said Christopher Higgins, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. “And any industrial facility that is discharging waste to the municipal wastewater facilities probably should be tested.”</p><p>Scientists point out that sludge fertilizer has benefits. It contains plant nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. It helps reduce the use of fertilizers made from fossil fuels. It cuts down on the millions of tons of sludge that would otherwise be incinerated, releasing pollution, or would go to landfills, generating greenhouse gases as it decomposes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Yet all of the chemistry that society produces, and is exposed to, is in that sewage,” said Rolf Halden, professor of environmental biotechnology at Arizona State University, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389413001921" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">among the earliest</a> researchers to study PFAS in sewage sludge.</p><h2 id="link-1a62d60f">The smell of death</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A stillborn calf found contaminated with PFAS.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Dana Ames, an environmental crimes investigator at the Constable’s Office in Johnson County, cut her teeth working missing-person cases and grisly homicides. But her first encounter with sludge fertilizer still came as a rude shock.</p><p>A farmer had applied the sludge to his fields, and two neighboring ranchers lodged a complaint about the smell. She drove out to investigate.</p><p>“I rolled down the window and I literally almost projectile vomited in my vehicle,” she said. “I’m accustomed to smelling death. This was worse than death.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>That call led to a remarkable investigation, overseen by Ms. Ames, into PFAS contamination of the sludge being spread in her county. She obtained a sample of the fertilizer and found it contained 27 different types of PFAS, at least 13 of which matched the PFAS in the soil and water samples from the two ranches.</p><p>And when a calf was stillborn at the Coleman ranch, she rushed the carcass to a lab at Texas A&amp;M University.

Maine’s ban has only caused the state to truck more sewage out of state, because local landfills can’t accommodate it, said Janine Burke-Wells, executive director of the North East Biosolids &amp; Residuals Association, which represents producers.</p><p>She said regulators should focus on curbing the PFAS entering wastewater by banning use in consumer products or requiring industries to clean their effluent before sending it to treatment plants. “There’s not enough money in the world to take it out at the end,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Figuring out how to deal with this crisis is a challenge now facing many states.
