When asked whether he had any desire to repair his relationship with Mr. Musk, Mr. Trump said, “No.”</p><div><p>But this seemed unlikely to be the president’s final word on the matter.</p><p>Despite saying repeatedly over the past 24 hours that he is spending no time thinking about Mr. Musk, Mr. Trump has taken numerous phone calls and questions from reporters in which he has expounded on their relationship. On an Air Force One flight to New Jersey on Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump spent time in his cabin watching Fox News coverage of his feud with Mr. Musk, before walking to the back cabin to answer questions from reporters on the topic.</p><p>Mr. Trump has offered a range of views in his conversations over the past few days. In some, Mr. Trump has described Mr. Musk as somebody who has gone “crazy.” In others, he has expressed sympathy, as if Mr. Musk were a wayward son. He has told associates that Mr. Musk is out of his mind on drugs, but at other times he has said he wishes him well and has seemed to leave open the possibility of reconciliation. He has also dangled the threat of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/politics/trump-musk-spacex-contracts.html" title="">canceling contracts that Mr. Musk’s companies</a> have with the federal government.</p><p>Behind the scenes, people close to both men have tried to broker a détente and there have been some signs of de-escalation. Mr. Musk has deleted some of his most incendiary social media posts and Mr. Trump has been more restrained, by his standards, in his public criticisms of Mr. Musk.</p><p>Advisers to Mr. Trump say they think the relationship will never be the same again. But some forecast an eventual truce, albeit one based on the transactional aspect of their relationship, with both men recognizing their abilities to help and harm each other.</p><p>Mr. Trump has the power to boost or cripple Mr. Musk’s businesses, especially his rocket company SpaceX, which relies on federal contracts.</p><p>And Mr. Musk has his own leverage. He was given a window into Mr. Trump’s private world, and some of Mr. Trump’s advisers have expressed concern about him weaponizing those secrets. He is the biggest donor in Republican politics, has an outstanding promise of a $100 million donation to Mr. Trump’s outside groups, and owns the most powerful social media platform on the right.</p><p>Mr. Trump has a long history of reconciling with even his harshest critics. Mr. Musk’s cryptic accusation that Mr. Trump had links to a convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein, might seem to the uninitiated to be a bridge too far, but the senior ranks of the Trump administration government are filled with people who have made withering character assessments of Mr. Trump. They include his secretary of state, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/who-is-marco-rubio.html" title="">called him a con man</a>, and his vice president, who wondered whether he would be an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/us/politics/jd-vance-trump-criticism-car-seats.html" title="">American Hitler</a>.</p><p>In a podcast appearance with the comedian Theo Von, recorded on Thursday during the height of the Musk-Trump online war, Vice President JD Vance went relatively easy on the world’s richest man.</p><p>“Elon, he’s an incredible entrepreneur,” Mr. Vance said. “And look, man, I’m always going to be loyal to the president, and I hope that eventually Elon kind of comes back into the fold.”</p><p>Mr. Vance praised Mr. Musk’s work with the Department of Government Efficiency, empathized with his frustrations with the political process in Washington, and noted that “his businesses are being attacked nonstop.”</p><p>“I just think it’s a huge mistake for the world’s wealthiest man, I think one of the most transformational entrepreneurs ever, that’s Elon, to be at this war with the world’s most powerful man,” Mr. Vance said.</p><p>The vice president said Mr. Trump “has been very restrained, because the president doesn’t think that he needs to be in a blood feud with Elon Musk, and I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine.” Though Mr. Vance did note that might not be possible after Mr. Von showed him some of Mr. Musk’s more personal attacks on X, and he forcefully rejected Mr. Musk’s accusation that Mr. Trump had a nefarious relationship with Mr. Epstein.</p><p>Mr. Musk, who poured millions of dollars into the Trump campaign last year, spearheaded a massive government restructuring project in recent months, cutting thousands of federal jobs before he returned to running his businesses last week.</p><p>His vociferous opposition to the president’s bill, expressed on social media, touched off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/politics/trump-musk-split-nasa.html" title="">the two men’s dispute</a> on Thursday. But he has since removed his most incendiary social media posts about Mr. Trump, notably his accusation that the Trump administration was blocking the release of information about Mr. Epstein because the files somehow implicated the president, who had been a friend of Mr. Epstein’s for years before falling out with him. Mr. Musk did not provide evidence for the claim.</p><p>Another of Mr. Musk’s deleted posts was a vow that his company SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft, which NASA has used to transport crew to the International Space Station. That comment came in response to a post by Mr. Trump on Truth Social that he could save the government billions of dollars by canceling Mr. Musk’s federal contracts.</p><p>Mr. Trump was asked on the Air Force One flight to New Jersey on Friday how seriously he was considering canceling Mr. Musk’s contracts. He did not rule it out.</p><p>“He’s got a lot of money. He gets a lot of subsidy, so we’ll take a look at that,” Mr. Trump said. “Only if it’s fair for him and for the country, I would certainly think about it. But it has to be fair.”</p><p>On that same flight, he also avoided attacking Mr. Musk when pressed by reporters and said he wished him and his companies well.</p><p>But by Saturday morning, he was back to criticizing Mr. Musk.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2U1MGVmYmIzLTdlODQtNTYzYy04MjhlLWRjN2Q1N2ViMzllYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/07/us/trump-news#worldpride-parade-washington-dc" data-source-id="100000010212099"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-07T20:51:39.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 7, 2025, 4:51 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People walked past parade floats before the start of the WorldPride parade in Washington on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caroline Gutman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The beats from D.J.s thrummed. Brass bands boomed. Bars and restaurants bustled. Sequins, feathers and fans that opened with a thwack were everywhere.</p><p>And to organizers’ relief, a cold morning rain ceased just in time for Saturday’s WorldPride parade in Washington, D.C., making way for a sticky heat that seemed to rise off every surface. Soon, the air smelled like sunscreen.</p><div><p>Revelers and those trying to sell them things agreed the celebratory atmosphere was vital for the L.G.B.T.Q. community and the nation’s capital itself.</p><p>“This Pride is very much needed,” said Fred Rogers, 31, who lives in Fredericksburg, Va. “We all need a chance to show the world that we are still here, and we’re not going anywhere.”</p><p>Amid the joy and celebration, there was still an undercurrent of anger and worry. The parade route wound its way to less than a third of a mile from the White House, and President Trump’s moves to curb the rights of the L.G.B.T.Q. community <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/worldpride-parade-dc-trump.html" title="">weighed heavily</a> on some of the paradegoers and prompted other people not to attend at all.</p><p>Ryan Bos, executive director of the nonprofit Capitol Pride Alliance, which organizes the city’s annual Pride events, including this year’s global one, said in an interview Saturday that planners had originally expected three million attendees over the three-week WorldPride festival, but the actual turnout fell short of that. Many business owners said that while the crowds were roughly normal for the city’s annual Pride Parade, and the parade route itself was packed, attendance did not remotely live up to expectations for a festival that typically draws people from around the world.</p><p>It was not clear how many people ultimately attended the festival and parade, but Mr. Bos said many people outside the country, particularly those who are transgender, feared traveling to the United States and potentially being detained. He said others stayed away out of anger with the current administration.</p><p>“To see America rolling back human rights totally goes against the ideals of what America was founded on,” he said.</p><p>Fund-raising also fell short of expectations, with some corporate sponsors pulling out and others asking that their logos not be prominently displayed. Other companies, though, did send floats along the route bearing their logos and carrying their employees in matching T-shirts.</p><p>Floats for IKEA, Amazon, Hilton Hotels and J.P. Morgan Chase were spotted on the route, and executives from United Airlines said they were sponsoring 10 Pride parades around the world this year.</p><p>The president has issued executive orders that bar transgender people from serving in the military, restrict gender identities on travel documents and proclaim that it is U.S. policy to “recognize two sexes, male and female” that are “not changeable.”</p><p>He has tried to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, and many private companies have followed his lead. His administration is also considering removing the name of Harvey Milk from a naval ship, arguing the gay rights icon may not reflect the country’s “warrior ethos.”</p><p>All this makes it even more imperative for the entire L.G.B.T.Q. community to remain visible and proud, said Sister Sybil Liberties, a drag queen with the Washington, D.C., chapter of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a charity and protest group of queer people who dress like nuns.</p><p>It’s even more important “to people outside of D.C. in less diverse and less queer areas, especially young people, to see this display,” she said.</p><p>WorldPride, one of the world’s largest L.G.B.T.Q. festivals, takes place in different cities every two years, and Washington, D.C., was chosen before Mr. Trump was elected. It coincides with the 50th anniversary of the city’s first Pride parade.</p><p>Deacon Maccubbin, 82, organized that event in 1975 outside his gay bookstore, Lambda Rising. It drew about 2,000 attendees.</p><p>On Saturday, he served as one of the parade’s grand marshals and was overheard telling others not to worry that the trolley in which they were riding seemed to be running behind schedule. “We’re on gay time,” he assured them. “Everything will start a year late.”</p><p>After days of back-and-forth discussions, federal officials said Saturday before the parade started that they would reopen Dupont Circle Park, which sits at the center of the city’s historic L.G.B.T.Q. neighborhood. They had previously fenced it off, saying the blockade would prevent criminal behavior.</p><p>Mayor Muriel Bowser and the National Park Service issued a joint statement on Saturday saying they had worked overnight on an agreement to reopen the park and looked forward to “a safe and fun celebration in our nation’s capital.” The mayor was also planning a disco-themed party in the park for later in the day.</p><p>DaeLyn Saint-Surin, 24, traveled to Washington from Bermuda for her first-ever Pride parade away from home. She said the anti-gay stigma in Bermuda was intense, and she had been overcome with emotion several times already in the nation’s capital.</p><p>“I have never seen so many gay people living their lives so freely and openly,” she said. “This is really freeing.”</p><p>Karen Hanley<!-- -->, <!-- -->Claire Hogan<!-- -->, <!-- -->Steven Moity<!-- --> and <!-- -->Darren Sands<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZWM4MmM4ZTMtMTdhMi01ZjA5LWI1MDAtYmIzNDA3MjJkNjQz"><div id="ec82c8e3-17a2-5f09-b500-bb340722d643" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/07/us/trump-news#ec82c8e3-17a2-5f09-b500-bb340722d643"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-swan"><img alt="Jonathan Swan" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/22/reader-center/author-jonathan-swan/author-jonathan-swan-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/22/reader-center/author-jonathan-swan/author-jonathan-swan-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/22/reader-center/author-jonathan-swan/author-jonathan-swan-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-07T20:29:28.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 7, 2025, 4:29 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>A White House official tells us that President Trump will spend Sunday night at Camp David and return to Washington on Monday, after spending the weekend at his New Jersey club, Bedminster.

Law enforcement officials used rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades to disperse protesters. People were coughing, and one woman poured milk on herself after she was hit with pepper spray. The authorities also blocked off exits to prevent people from reaching the area.</p><div><p>The air was filled with smoke from the grenades and tear gas. José Luis Solache Jr., a state assembly member, said on social media that he was among those who were hit with tear gas.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Paramount, Calif., protesters squared off with federal immigration agents after at least two immigration raids took place on Saturday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Thayer/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The efforts to dismantle the protest appeared to work only in waves. After being tear-gassed, some demonstrators would retreat, pour milk on their faces to treat the burn and continue protesting.</p><p>One protester shouted: “Be brave! I know you’re scared, but so are undocumented families!”</p><p>Federal officials on Saturday warned protesters of the legal repercussions for interfering with immigration agents.</p><p>“A message to the LA rioters: you will not stop us or slow us down,” Kristi Noem, the U.S. homeland security secretary, <a href="https://x.com/sec_noem/status/1931456023493308787?s=46&amp;t=8H3FDbkvfJkXNtBv_SrGPg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in a social media post.</a> “And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”</p><p>Immigrant advocates said federal agents were in Paramount on Saturday to conduct a workplace raid at the Home Depot. But a Department of Homeland Security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that there were no immigration arrests there. The official said that agents from other federal agencies, including Border Patrol, the F.B.I. and the U.S. Marshals Service, came to help ICE in the Los Angeles region.</p><p>By afternoon, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, which said it was not involved in any federal operations, had ordered protesters to leave the area, declaring the demonstration an unlawful assembly. Officers threw flash-bang grenades at people who were defiant.</p><p>The standoff on Saturday followed a series of immigration raids that swept through Los Angeles on Friday, which resulted in chaos outside a federal building downtown where people detained in the raids were being processed. The protests, which drew scrutiny from White House officials, set the stage for continued tensions between federal authorities and Southern California residents and local officials who oppose the immigration operations.</p><p>In downtown Los Angeles on Friday, the streets swelled with protesters, and buildings and vehicles were vandalized with spray paint. Some people threw objects at federal agents, who then responded with flash-bang grenades. This week, agents arrested nearly 120 people, federal officials said. But processing those arrests was delayed because of the protests.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Saturday’s standoff followed a series of immigration raids that swept through Los Angeles on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Thayer/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>On Saturday, Trump administration officials denounced the city’s response to the Friday operations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, criticizing Los Angeles officials for not helping the federal agents as well as blaming Democrats for the unrest. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, called the protests a “violent insurrection.” </p><p>Officials with the Homeland Security Department took aim at those in the Los Angeles Police Department, saying that they had not responded in a timely fashion as protesters surrounded the federal building in the city.</p><p>“What took place in Los Angeles yesterday was appalling,” Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of ICE, said. He added that Los Angeles police officers had taken “over two hours” to respond to the unrest, “despite being called multiple times.” The Police Department has not responded publicly to Mr. Lyons’s remarks.</p><p>On Friday, Jim McDonnell, the chief of police, said that his agency was not involved in civil immigration enforcement. He noted that the Police Department has a decades-old policy that bars its officers from stopping residents for the sole purpose of determining their immigration status. It was unclear whether any protesters were arrested by the Los Angeles Police on Friday night.</p><p>California officials, including Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles and Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, condemned the raids. The governor took particular issue with the arrest on Friday of David Huerta, the president of the California chapter of the Service Employees International Union.</p><p>The U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, Bill Essayli, said Mr. Huerta was arrested and accused of obstructing federal agents conducting a raid by blocking their vehicle. Mr. Huerta is set to be arraigned on Monday, Mr. Essayli said.</p><p>This week’s operations came as ICE officers have been ramping up enforcement across the country. Mr. Miller, the White House official, recently told Fox News that ICE was aiming to arrest 3,000 immigrants a day. In the first 100 days of the Trump administration, officers arrested, on average, more than 600 immigrants daily. But those numbers have risen sharply this past week.</p><p>Since President Trump took office, demonstrators in California have been protesting ICE operations. So the response by protesters to the operations on Friday was not entirely surprising, said Chris Zepeda-Millán, an ethnic studies professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies mass immigrant movements in the United States.</p><p>“Arguably, the birthplace and central place of the modern-day undocumented immigrant rights movement is California, and Los Angeles in particular,” Mr. Zepeda-Millán said.</p><p>Hamed Aleaziz<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFhNmNmZDVlLWMwYWMtNTc2Mi1iYzViLTI1NWQyMmY4MmY2Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/07/us/trump-news#abrego-garcia-is-jailed-in-tennessee-awaiting-trial-on-human-trafficking-charges" data-source-id="100000010214106"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-07T18:34:59.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 7, 2025, 2:34 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protest in April at the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., during a hearing on the wrongful imprisonment of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the man at the center of a political maelstrom after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, was in a Tennessee jail on Saturday after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/politics/kilmar-abrego-garcia-us-criminal-charges.html?smid=url-share" title="">United States abruptly brought him</a> back to face new charges of transporting undocumented migrants.</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia made an initial appearance in federal court in Nashville late Friday, and the government asked a judge to keep him in custody without bail. He was detained in the Putnam County jail in Cookeville, Tenn., about 80 miles east of Nashville, his lawyers said. He is expected to return to federal court for an arraignment on June 13.</p><div><p>The sudden move by the Trump administration to bring Mr. Abrego Garcia back to the United States after months of fighting efforts to do so could end the most high-profile legal battle over the president’s authority to rapidly seize and deport undocumented immigrants without a hearing.</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers said that they welcomed their day in court and that the government’s decision undercut its efforts to keep him in El Salvador.</p><p>“It’s now up to our judicial system to see that Mr. Abrego Garcia receives the due process that the Constitution guarantees to all persons,” said Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Mr. Abrego Garcia.</p><p>In March, Mr. Abrego Garcia, a contractor from Maryland, was picked up in a Trump administration dragnet and deported along with several other men to a prison in El Salvador, even though an immigration judge had ruled he should not be sent there because he had reason to fear for his safety.</p><p>Now Mr. Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, faces more than just the accusation that he was in the country illegally. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/06/us/Abrego-Garcia-Indictment.html" title="">A 10-page indictment</a> — filed in the Federal District Court in Nashville in May and unsealed on Friday — accuses him not only of being a member of the violent street gang MS-13 but of being part of a ring that smuggled undocumented Latin American immigrants into the United States.</p><p>In court papers seeking his pretrial detention, prosecutors said Mr. Abrego Garcia had played “a significant role” in the conspiracy to smuggle immigrants, including unaccompanied minors. They added that smuggling immigrants was Mr. Abrego Garcia’s “primary source of income” and that he had transported about “50 undocumented aliens” each month for several years.</p><p>The indictment relies on five “confidential informants” who told investigators they were also part of the ring. Two of the informants told federal authorities that Mr. Abrego Garcia regularly picked up illegal immigrants in Houston and drove them to other parts of the country, starting in 2016.</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia is also accused in the indictment of smuggling weapons from Texas to Maryland and of abusing some of the female immigrants, though he is not charged in connection with those acts.</p><p>The smuggling charges stem from a traffic stop on Nov. 30, 2022, when Mr. Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding by the Tennessee Highway Patrol on Interstate 40 East, in Putnam County, the indictment said.</p><p>Officers determined that the Chevrolet Suburban he was driving had been altered with “an aftermarket third row of seats designed to carry additional passengers,” the indictment said. It also noted that there were “nine Hispanic males packed into the S.U.V.” and that none of them “had luggage or even tools consistent with construction work.”</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia, who had an expired license, told the officers that he and his passengers had been in St. Louis for the past two weeks doing construction work, according to the indictment. He was let off with a warning.</p><p>But a subsequent investigation, prosecutors said, revealed that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s cellphone and license plate reader data showed he had been in Texas that morning and nowhere near St. Louis for the previous weeks.</p><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>June 7, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this headline misstated the charges against Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.

Until now, however, the California High-Speed Rail Authority always had enough money in the bank to take incremental steps forward.</p><p>But over the last four years, the state has drawn down almost all of a $9 billion bond that voters approved in 2008. Losing the federal grants will put the project on a near starvation diet to complete even the limited, 171-mile initial segment in the Central Valley, linking Merced and Bakersfield, both of which are far from the state’s major population centers.</p><p>“I don’t think we are going to see electric trains running on track from Merced to Bakersfield for a long, long time,” said Louis Thompson, a railroad veteran who spent more than a decade as chairman of a state-appointed peer review panel for the rail project. “Not in 10 years with no federal money. This is reality, and reality is painful.”</p><p>If the Transportation Department moves forward with terminating the grants next month, as it has said it intends to do, it is likely that California will file suit to challenge the decision, a case that could drag on for years.</p><p>Even if the political landscape changes after President Trump leaves office and a future president delivers a new bundle of cash, it would take years from then to issue contracts for electrical systems and high-speed trains. Delivery and testing of those items would take years more.</p><p>State officials said this week that they would press on, relying on state funding as they have for most of the project’s history. At the slower pace required, the project becomes even more vulnerable to annual inflation, sending total costs higher.</p><p>The plan as originally envisioned called for deploying 220-mile-per-hour trains between the state’s two largest population centers at a cost of $33 billion by 2020.</p><p>Today, building the full system is a distant goal and could cost as much as $128 billion if it ever happens.</p><p>The initial segment in the Central Valley will cost up to $35 billion, more than the original estimate for the entire system. Even if the federal grant is not terminated, the initial segment would still have a funding shortfall of about $7 billion.</p><p>A lengthy compliance review by the Federal Railroad Administration this week made nine findings that the project was not complying with grant agreements, noting that it had failed to meet deadlines, incurred significant change orders and reported ridership estimates that exceeded what was likely. It said there was no “viable path” to completing the initial segment in the Central Valley by a 2033 deadline set under the grant.</p><p>In reviewing $1.6 billion in change orders on construction, the agency told state officials that “the sheer volume and frequency of these change orders shows waste through an inexcusable combination of poor planning, implementation, or mismanagement of contractors, insufficient legal authority and technical expertise, and other factors.”</p><p>The high-speed rail authority rejected the criticism and said the project would continue to move forward.</p><p>“The authority strongly disagrees with the F.R.A.’s conclusions, which are misguided and do not reflect the substantial progress made to deliver high-speed rail in California,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. “We remain firmly committed to completing the nation’s first true high-speed rail system connecting the major population centers in the state.”</p><p>Authority officials also sharply disagreed with analysts’ predictions of a possible 10-year delay. They said that they believed the state would ultimately be allowed to keep the federal grants and that they would be moving ahead with a plan to lay high-speed track within the next year.</p><p>They noted that Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed that the project continue to receive $1 billion annually from the state’s greenhouse gas program, although that money is already accounted for in the state’s current plans through 2030.</p><p>State authorities did not directly address, however, what delays the project might face if the state did, in fact, lose access to the federal money.</p><p>Many experts on the construction project said that while the state might be able to hobble along with construction under existing funding, it appeared highly unlikely that it would be able to deliver an operational train within the next decade. When the state adopted the plan for the scaled-back Central Valley system in 2019, it was supposed to start service by 2028.</p><p>In his first term, Mr. Trump terminated a $928 million grant to the project dating back to the Obama administration. California sued, but before the case went to trial, Joseph R. Biden Jr. became president and restored the grant. Still, the state had not been able to draw on the money because of milestones that had to be passed first. The funding Mr. Trump is seeking to terminate includes not only the $3.1 billion grant issued under Mr. Biden but that earlier $928 million in funding.</p><p>The authority has about $4 billion in cash on hand, mostly from its share of California’s greenhouse gas auction program. That is enough to make some progress in completing construction that is already underway along 119 miles of farmland, but hardly enough to begin operations.</p><p>“Having this money taken away could potentially mean that they won’t be able to continue to construct it, at least at anywhere near the pace and scale they’ve been at,” said Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, who has been a supporter of the high-speed rail project.</p><p>“If there is a big gap in funding, it is going to mean layoffs and stalling the project at a certain point,” he said.</p><p>Conservatives have long supported cuts to funding for California high-speed rail. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy last week called the project a “boondoggle.”</p><p>Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a deputy assistant secretary for research at the Transportation Department during Mr. Trump’s first term, said that the system, if it is ever built, had no hope of being profitable and that people were not likely to want to use it.</p><p>She noted the substantial decline in public transportation users since the coronavirus pandemic. “They prefer driving,” she said.</p><p>The California bullet train was originally expected to carry about 100 million passengers a year, but the estimate was later slashed by two-thirds. Estimated ridership on the mini system in the Central Valley was reduced by 25 percent in recent years.</p><p>But Mr. Elkind and other supporters have said the project could improve the quality of life in California and help drive the economy. “You’re just really greatly increasing mobility and connecting the economy, and in ways that no other mode of transport really could do as efficiently, and you’re doing it all in a very low-carbon way,” he said.</p><p>The state has 30 days to respond to the Trump administration’s notice. The rail authority said in its statement that it would “fully address and correct the record in our formal response to the F.R.A.’s notice.”</p><p>Legal analysts said that if the state sues, as Mr. Newsom promised, it is not clear that the state would prevail.</p><p>The Trump administration appears to have been careful to set up a legal basis for cutting the funding, making a lawsuit challenging, some analysts said.</p><p>But Eloise Pasachoff, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in federal grant law, noted that the proposed funding cut “comes against the backdrop of the Biden administration doing a review of the exact same project last year and awarding another $3 billion in federal grants.” California, she said, will most likely challenge the termination on many grounds, including that the administration was “arbitrary and capricious” in its decision to revoke the money.</p><p>It is not enough, she added, for the administration to assert that funding a high-speed rail system is not a policy priority. Such a decision should go back to Congress, she said.</p><p>David Freeman Engstrom, a law professor at Stanford University, said the longstanding political antagonism between California’s Democratic governor and Mr. Trump might have been a factor in the decision to pull the grant, but it was unlikely to form a basis for a successful legal challenge.</p><p>If California argues that the termination is “just an effort to get back at Governor Newsom, an enemy of the administration, I’m not sure that a court’s going to be willing to credit that argument here,” he said.</p><p>Still, he said, there appeared to be little doubt that the termination, apart from the legal issues, was seen in Washington as a way to “stick it” to Mr. Newsom.</p><p>“By returning to the high-speed rail issue, Trump is once again lifting up a powerful symbol that liberal California is the problem, not the solution, and needs to get its own house in order.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMmJkNzE3OTAtZGZjMy01NGQwLWEyYzUtNTQ4ZTEzZWYxM2M5"><div id="2bd71790-dfc3-54d0-a2c5-548e13ef13c9" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/07/us/trump-news#2bd71790-dfc3-54d0-a2c5-548e13ef13c9"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager"><img alt="Tyler Pager" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-07T17:10:52.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 7, 2025, 1:10 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>When asked if he was going to terminate any federal contracts with Musk’s companies, Trump said he would be allowed to but hadn’t “given it any thought.” On Thursday, though, the president had threatened to cut the federal contracts and tax subsidies for Musk’s businesses, which have received billions of dollars over the years. </p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMDM1NjRmNmQtNzU1Ni01N2Q0LThmYmQtNTYyZmZiYzYyYjU2"><div id="03564f6d-7556-57d4-8fbd-562ffbc62b56" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/07/us/trump-news#03564f6d-7556-57d4-8fbd-562ffbc62b56"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager"><img alt="Tyler Pager" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-07T17:08:51.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 7, 2025, 1:08 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Trump also said Musk would face “very serious consequences” if the tech billionaire gave money to Democratic candidates.

Under that truce, the United States reduced Mr. Trump’s tariff on Chinese imports to 30 percent from 145 percent, and China lowered its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent.</p><p>But in recent weeks, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/trump-china-trade.html" title="">tension between the two countries re</a>turned, tied to mineral exports to the United States, which China had recently halted. The Trump administration also proposed a plan to revoke visas for Chinese students associated with the Communist Party or studying in critical fields.</p><p>Mr. Bessent, who has been leading the negotiations with China for the United States, recently acknowledged that the talks had stalled and suggested that it would be up to the two leaders to get them back on track.</p><p>Then, last week, Mr. Trump said on social media that China had “violated” the agreement that was brokered in Switzerland. Beijing rejected that notion, accusing Washington of severely undermining the trade truce.</p><p>The back and forth continued this week when Mr. Trump wrote on social media on Wednesday that Mr. Xi was “VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH.”</p><p>A day later, however, Mr. Trump said that his 90-minute call with Mr. Xi had been productive.</p><p>“I just concluded a very good phone call with President Xi, of China, discussing some of the intricacies of our recently made, and agreed to, Trade Deal,” Mr. Trump said, adding that it “resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdkOTgwMGM3LWM4ZDAtNTM3OC1iNTEwLTZiODFiMTgxYmRiOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/07/us/trump-news#nws-weather-jobs-hiring-bill-congress" data-source-id="100000010212250"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones"><img alt="Judson Jones" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/17/reader-center/author-judson-jones/author-judson-jones-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/17/reader-center/author-judson-jones/author-judson-jones-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/17/reader-center/author-judson-jones/author-judson-jones-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-06T18:57:17.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 6, 2025, 2:57 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones" itemprop="name">Judson Jones</a></p><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Forecasters at a weather office in Oklahoma City, where severe storms and tornadoes are a regular feature of spring.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">William Widmer for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A bill introduced in the House of Representatives on Friday would make it harder to fire most employees of the National Weather Service and give the agency’s director the authority to hire new staff directly, months after it lost nearly 600 employees to layoffs and retirements as part of the Trump administration’s sweeping cuts to the federal work force.</p><p>The Weather Workforce Improvement Act would designate certain positions within the agency as critical to public safety. The bill’s sponsors say it would have protected meteorologists, as well as other roles within the agency, from the cuts this year.</p><div><p>Those jobs include the people who specialize in hurricane forecasts and issue warnings about tornadoes and flash floods, as well as the employees who physically maintain things like weather models or launch weather balloons.</p><p>“Weather forecasting is not partisan,” said Representative Mike Flood, Republican of Nebraska, one of the bill’s bipartisan sponsors. “Everyone supports the National Weather Service. Everyone relies on them, whether they realize it or not.”</p><p>The Weather Service has suffered from short staffing for years, long before the Trump administration’s cuts, but that became more severe this spring, as hundreds more employees began retiring or were forced out.</p><p>At the same time, the country has faced a nonstop pace of deadly and expensive weather disasters, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/californias-worst-wildfires-history.html" title="">California wildfires</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/weather/weather-tornado-warning-south.html" title="">several</a> tornado <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/us/tornado-destruction-kentucky.html" title="">outbreaks</a> and severe hailstorms. For the first time in the agency’s history, some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/weather/nws-cuts-kentucky-tornado.html" title="">forecasting offices</a> no longer had enough staff members to operate overnight, and others had to curtail the twice-daily launches of weather balloons, which collect data on atmospheric conditions that feed into forecast models.</p><p>The bill comes at the start of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/atlantic-hurricane-season-forecast-2025.html" title="">an Atlantic hurricane season that is predicted to bring more storms than usual</a>. Some observers have expressed concerns about understaffed offices and worker fatigue affecting forecasts.</p><p>Mr. Flood said he hoped granting the National Weather Service the authority to hire directly would ensure that shortages could be addressed more quickly than is possible in the current process, in which hiring runs through its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>NOAA declined to comment on the pending legislation.</p><p>The bill may pave the way for the agency’s director, Ken Graham, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/national-weather-service-cuts-trump.html" title="">implement a-planned</a> restructuring. Mr. Flood said he hoped the legislation would give Mr. Graham “some latitude” to modernize.</p><p>Also this week, NOAA said the Weather Service had been granted an exemption to Mr. Trump’s governmentwide hiring freeze, which would allow it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/weather/nws-job-cuts-weather-service-hiring.html#:~:text=Judson%20Jones%20is%20a%20meteorologist%20and%20reporter%20for%20The,forecasts%20and%20covers%20extreme%20weather." title="">to hire 126 people in positions around the country</a> in an effort to “stabilize” the agency. The Weather Service has also been shuffling forecasters and other employees between offices on short-term assignments to fill staffing gaps.</p><p>The bill’s other sponsors include Representative Frank Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, as well as Democratic Representatives Jared Moskowitz of Florida, Jimmy Panetta of California, and Eric Sorensen of Illinois. All represent states that have been hit by severe weather this year.</p><p>“Severe weather affects both blue states and red states, and ensuring Americans have access to reliable and accurate weather forecasting is something everyone should support regardless of their political affiliation,” said Mr. Sorensen, who is the only meteorologist in Congress. “I’m grateful for Congressman Flood’s partnership on bipartisan legislation that will help fully staff National Weather Service offices across the country during severe weather and hurricane season.”</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
