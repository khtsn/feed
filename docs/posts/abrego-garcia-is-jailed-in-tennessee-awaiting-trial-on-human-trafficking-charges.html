When asked whether he had any desire to repair his relationship with Mr. Musk, Mr. Trump said, “No.”</p><div><p>Mr. Musk, who poured millions of dollars into the Trump campaign last year, spearheaded a massive government restructuring project in recent months, cutting thousands of federal jobs before he returned to running his businesses last week. </p><p>Mr. Musk’s vociferous opposition to the president’s bill, expressed on social media, touched off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/politics/trump-musk-split-nasa.html" title="">the two men’s dispute</a> on Thursday. But he has since removed his most vicious social media posts about Mr. Trump, notably his accusation that the Trump administration was blocking the release of information about the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein because the files somehow implicated the president, who had been a friend of Mr. Epstein’s for years before falling out with him.</p><p>Another of Mr. Musk’s deleted posts was a vow that his company SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft, which NASA has used to transport crew to the International Space Station. That comment came in response to a post by Mr. Trump on Truth Social that he could save the government billions of dollars by canceling Mr. Musk’s federal contracts.</p><p>Mr. Trump was ask on an Air Force One flight to New Jersey on Friday how seriously he was considering canceling Mr. Musk’s contracts. Mr. Trump did not rule it out.</p><p>“He’s got a lot of money. He gets a lot of subsidy, so we’ll take a look at that,” Mr. Trump said. “Only if it’s fair for him and for the country, I would certainly think about it. But it has to be fair.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFhNmNmZDVlLWMwYWMtNTc2Mi1iYzViLTI1NWQyMmY4MmY2Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/07/us/trump-news#abrego-garcia-is-jailed-in-tennessee-awaiting-trial-on-human-trafficking-charges" data-source-id="100000010214106"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-07T18:34:59.255Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 7, 2025, 2:34 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protest in April at the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., during a hearing on the wrongful imprisonment of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the man at the center of a political maelstrom after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, was in a Tennessee jail on Saturday after the United States abruptly brought him back to face new charges of transporting undocumented migrants.</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia made an initial appearance in federal court in Nashville late Friday, and the government asked a judge to keep him in custody without bail. He was detained in the Putnam County jail in Cookeville, Tenn., about 80 miles east of Nashville, his lawyers said. He is expected to return to federal court for an arraignment on June 13.</p><div><p>The sudden move by the Trump administration to bring Mr. Abrego Garcia back to the United States after months of fighting efforts to do so could end the most high-profile legal battle over the president’s authority to rapidly seize and deport undocumented immigrants without a hearing.</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers said that they welcomed their day in court and that the government’s decision undercut its efforts to keep him in El Salvador.</p><p>“It’s now up to our judicial system to see that Mr. Abrego Garcia receives the due process that the Constitution guarantees to all persons,” said Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Mr. Abrego Garcia.</p><p>In March, Mr. Abrego Garcia, a contractor from Maryland, was picked up in a Trump administration dragnet and deported along with several other men to a prison in El Salvador, even though an immigration judge had ruled he should not be sent there because he had reason to fear for his safety.</p><p>Now Mr. Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, faces more than just the accusation that he was in the country illegally. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/06/us/Abrego-Garcia-Indictment.html" title="">A 10-page indictment</a> — filed in the Federal District Court in Nashville in May and unsealed on Friday — accuses him not only of being a member of the violent street gang MS-13 but of being part of a ring that smuggled undocumented Latin American immigrants into the United States.</p><p>In court papers seeking his pretrial detention, prosecutors said Mr. Abrego Garcia had played “a significant role” in the conspiracy to smuggle immigrants, including unaccompanied minors. They added that smuggling immigrants was Mr. Abrego Garcia’s “primary source of income” and that he had transported about “50 undocumented aliens” each month for several years.</p><p>The indictment relies on five “confidential informants” who told investigators they were also part of the ring. Two of the informants told federal authorities that Mr. Abrego Garcia regularly picked up illegal immigrants in Houston and drove them to other parts of the country, starting in 2016.</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia is also accused in the indictment of smuggling weapons from Texas to Maryland and of abusing some of the female immigrants, though he is not charged in connection with those acts.</p><p>The smuggling charges stem from a traffic stop on Nov. 30, 2022, when Mr. Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding by the Tennessee Highway Patrol on Interstate 40 East, in Putnam County, the indictment said.</p><p>Officers determined that the Chevrolet Suburban he was driving had been altered with “an aftermarket third row of seats designed to carry additional passengers,” the indictment said. It also noted that there were “nine Hispanic males packed into the S.U.V.” and that none of them “had luggage or even tools consistent with construction work.”</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia, who had an expired license, told the officers that he and his passengers had been in St. Louis for the past two weeks doing construction work, according to the indictment. He was let off with a warning.</p><p>But a subsequent investigation, prosecutors said, revealed that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s cellphone and license plate reader data showed he had been in Texas that morning and nowhere near St. Louis for the previous weeks.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMmJkNzE3OTAtZGZjMy01NGQwLWEyYzUtNTQ4ZTEzZWYxM2M5"><div id="2bd71790-dfc3-54d0-a2c5-548e13ef13c9" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/07/us/trump-news#2bd71790-dfc3-54d0-a2c5-548e13ef13c9"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager"><img alt="Tyler Pager" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-07T17:10:52.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 7, 2025, 1:10 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>When asked if he was going to terminate any federal contracts with Musk’s companies, Trump said he would be allowed to but hadn’t “given it any thought.” On Thursday, though, the president had threatened to cut the federal contracts and tax subsidies for Musk’s businesses, which have received billions of dollars over the years. </p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMDM1NjRmNmQtNzU1Ni01N2Q0LThmYmQtNTYyZmZiYzYyYjU2"><div id="03564f6d-7556-57d4-8fbd-562ffbc62b56" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/07/us/trump-news#03564f6d-7556-57d4-8fbd-562ffbc62b56"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager"><img alt="Tyler Pager" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-07T17:08:51.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 7, 2025, 1:08 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Trump also said Musk would face “very serious consequences” if the tech billionaire gave money to Democratic candidates.

But this year’s event will be much bigger, as Washington hosts the <a href="https://worldpridedc.org/events/parade/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WorldPride Parade</a>, which attracts visitors from around the world. Sydney hosted it last time, and Amsterdam is up next.</p><div><p>This year’s location was decided before the 2024 election that brought Donald J. Trump back to the White House, which sits less than half a mile from where the parade’s route will culminate on Saturday.</p><p>The parade is not expected to attract as many people as organizers had hoped, with some international L.G.B.T.Q. groups deciding not to participate. Momentum for the event began to slow shortly after Mr. Trump’s inauguration.</p><p>Mr. Trump has issued executive orders restricting gender identities on travel documents and barring transgender people from serving in the military. He has also pushed the federal government to end its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and many private companies have followed his lead.

In recent weeks, a supervisor in the federal prosecutor’s office in Nashville resigned over how the case was handled, these people said.</p><p>Ms. Bondi went on to level accusations against Mr. Abrego Garcia that were not included in the indictment, claiming that co-conspirators told investigators he had helped smuggle “minor children” and gang members during dozens of trips around the country. She linked him to more serious crimes, including murders and the abuse of women — even though he has only been charged in connection with smuggling.</p><p>She also claimed, without providing evidence, that his seemingly law-abiding life in Maryland as a contractor, father and husband was a cover for a criminal activities spanning nine years. Ms. Bondi, who spearheaded the administration’s public relations campaign to discredit him during the court battle, predicted he would be convicted and returned to El Salvador for imprisonment.</p><p>The attorney general declined to say when the Tennessee investigation into Mr. Abrego Garcia was opened. His indictment was filed more than two weeks ago, on May 21, and unsealed Friday after he arrived in the United States.</p><p>The deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said he believed the indictment was likely to render moot the lawsuit brought by Mr. Abrego Garcia’s family to force his release from Salvadoran custody.</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia made an initial appearance in federal court in Nashville later Friday, and the government moved to hold him in custody. He was detained in Putnam County jail outside the city and is expected to return to court on June 13.</p><p>Asked whether he had spoken directly with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador to take steps to free Mr. Abrego Garcia, Mr. Trump demurred. “I don’t want to say that. But he’s returned,” he said, adding: “And he should have never had to be returned. You take a look at what’s happened with him; you take a look at what they found in the grand jury and everywhere else.”</p><p>Mr. Bukele, who had previously said he would not release Mr. Abrego Garcia, said on social media on Friday, “We work with the Trump administration, and if they request the return of a gang member to face charges, of course we wouldn’t refuse.”</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers said they welcomed their day in court and pointed out that the government’s decision to return him to the United States undercut its longstanding efforts to keep him in El Salvador.</p><p>“Today’s action proves what we’ve known all along — that the administration had the ability to bring him back and just refused to do so,” said Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Mr. Abrego Garcia. “It’s now up to our judicial system to see that Mr. Abrego Garcia receives the due process that the Constitution guarantees to all persons.”</p><p>Ama Frimpong, the legal director for CASA, an immigrant rights group based in Maryland, described the mixed feelings of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura. She “is of course very happy that her husband is back on U.S. soil, at least as far as we know,” Ms. Frimpong said, “but of course, under very egregious and horrendous circumstances.”</p><p>Even though the Trump administration has repeatedly accused Mr. Abrego Garcia of belonging to MS-13 — which has been designated as a terrorist organization — a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled in April that the defendant had been deprived of his rights by being wrongly deported.</p><p>“The government asserts that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a member of MS-13,” the panel wrote. “Perhaps, but perhaps not. Regardless, he is still entitled to due process.”</p><p>Since the start of the case, administration officials have sought to depict Mr. Abrego Garcia, a metal worker who has lived illegally in the United States without criminal charges for years, as a member of MS-13. The charges filed against him on Friday accused him of belonging to the gang and taking part in a conspiracy to “transport thousands of undocumented aliens” across the United States.</p><p>In court papers seeking his pretrial detention, prosecutors said Mr. Abrego Garcia had been part of a trafficking conspiracy and had played “a significant role” in smuggling immigrants, including unaccompanied minors.</p><p>If convicted, Mr. Abrego Garcia could face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each person he transported, the papers said, a penalty that would go “well beyond the remainder of the defendant&#39;s life.”</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia had been in Salvadoran custody since March 15, when he was flown, along with scores of other migrants, into the hands of jailers at the so-called Terrorism Confinement Center, a notorious prison known as CECOT. He was later moved to another facility in El Salvador.</p><p>For nearly three months, his lawyers have been trying every legal strategy to enforce court orders demanding that the Trump administration “facilitate” his release from El Salvador.</p><p>From the beginning of the case, officials have acknowledged that Mr. Abrego Garcia was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/abrego-garcia-mistakenly-deported.html" title="">wrongfully expelled to El Salvador</a> in violation of a previous court order that expressly barred him being sent to the country. But the Justice Department, acting on behalf of the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, has not given an inch beyond that admission, saying only that if Mr. Abrego Garcia presented himself at the U.S. border, officials would “facilitate” his re-entry to the country.</p><p>Department lawyers have also spent weeks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/judges-trump-deportations-immigration.html" title="">stonewalling an effort by Judge Paula Xinis</a>, who is overseeing the case, to get answers to the question of what the White House has done, and planned to do, to seek Mr. Abrego Garcia’s freedom. The administration’s serial refusals to respond to inquiries about its own behavior in the case has so annoyed Judge Xinis that this week she allowed Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers to seek penalties against the government.</p><p>According to the indictment, the case against Mr. Abrego Garcia dated to Nov. 30, 2022, when he was stopped for speeding by the Tennessee Highway Patrol on Interstate 40 East, in Putnam County. Officers determined that the Chevrolet Suburban he was driving had been altered with “an aftermarket third row of seats designed to carry additional passengers,” the indictment said.</p><p>It also noted that there were “nine Hispanic males packed into the S.U.V.”</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia told the officers that he and his passengers had been in St. Louis for the past two weeks doing construction work, according to the indictment. But a subsequent investigation, prosecutors said, revealed that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s cellphone and license plate reader data showed that he had been in Texas that morning and nowhere near St. Louis for the past weeks.</p><p>Moreover, the indictment said, none of the people in the vehicle “had luggage or even tools consistent with construction work.”</p><p>Prosecutors said that the traffic stop in Tennessee was not the first time that Mr. Abrego Garcia had engaged in alleged immigrant smuggling, which they said was his “primary source of income.” They added that he had transported about “50 undocumented aliens” a month across the country for several years.</p><p>Jazmine Ulloa<!-- --> and <!-- -->Annie Correal<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2UyMGMxNjk3LTc2M2UtNTgwZC1iMjk1LTBkNjljOGI4ZDg2OA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/07/us/trump-news#us-china-trade-talks-london" data-source-id="100000010213046"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-rappeport"><img alt="Alan Rappeport" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-alan-rappeport/author-alan-rappeport-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-alan-rappeport/author-alan-rappeport-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-alan-rappeport/author-alan-rappeport-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-06T19:12:02.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 6, 2025, 3:12 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump earlier this year with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, center, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>President Trump said on Friday that the United States and China would begin their second round of economic talks on Monday in London, resuming negotiations over tariffs and global supplies of rare earth minerals that have begun to threaten global economic growth.</p><p>The American delegation will be led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer, the United States trade representative, Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social. It was not immediately clear who would represent China, but He Lifeng, China’s vice premier for economic policy, led the previous round of talks in Switzerland.</p><div><p>The talks come at a fragile moment for the global economy, which has been slowed by uncertainty and supply chain disruptions. The United States in April paused some of the tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on dozens of countries to provide time for trade negotiations.</p><p>Those levies, as well as steep import taxes on Chinese goods, were thrust into further uncertainty in late May, when a U.S. trade court deemed them illegal. The tariffs, however, currently remain in place while an appeal process unfolds. As the U.S. delegation meets in London, the Trump administration has a deadline to make its case to a federal appeals court for why the tariffs should continue.</p><p>The announcement of Monday’s talks came a day after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/world/asia/xi-trump-talks-china-us-trade.html" title="">Mr. Trump held a call</a> with Xi Jinping, China’s president, that was intended to break a deadlock that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/trump-china-trade.html" title="">threatened to derail a trade truce</a> that the countries reached in early May in Geneva. Under that truce, the United States reduced Mr. Trump’s tariff on Chinese imports to 30 percent from 145 percent, and China lowered its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent.</p><p>But in recent weeks, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/trump-china-trade.html" title="">tension between the two countries re</a>turned, tied to mineral exports to the United States, which China had recently halted. The Trump administration also proposed a plan to revoke visas for Chinese students associated with the Communist Party or studying in critical fields.</p><p>Mr. Bessent, who has been leading the negotiations with China for the United States, recently acknowledged that the talks had stalled and suggested that it would be up to the two leaders to get them back on track.</p><p>Then, last week, Mr. Trump said on social media that China had “violated” the agreement that was brokered in Switzerland. Beijing rejected that notion, accusing Washington of severely undermining the trade truce.</p><p>The back and forth continued this week when Mr. Trump wrote on social media on Wednesday that Mr. Xi was “VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH.”</p><p>A day later, however, Mr. Trump said that his 90-minute call with Mr. Xi had been productive.</p><p>“I just concluded a very good phone call with President Xi, of China, discussing some of the intricacies of our recently made, and agreed to, Trade Deal,” Mr. Trump said, adding that it “resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdkOTgwMGM3LWM4ZDAtNTM3OC1iNTEwLTZiODFiMTgxYmRiOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/07/us/trump-news#nws-weather-jobs-hiring-bill-congress" data-source-id="100000010212250"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones"><img alt="Judson Jones" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/17/reader-center/author-judson-jones/author-judson-jones-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/17/reader-center/author-judson-jones/author-judson-jones-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/17/reader-center/author-judson-jones/author-judson-jones-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-06T18:57:17.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 6, 2025, 2:57 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones" itemprop="name">Judson Jones</a></p><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Forecasters at a weather office in Oklahoma City, where severe storms and tornadoes are a regular feature of spring.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">William Widmer for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A bill introduced in the House of Representatives on Friday would make it harder to fire most employees of the National Weather Service and give the agency’s director the authority to hire new staff directly, months after it lost nearly 600 employees to layoffs and retirements as part of the Trump administration’s sweeping cuts to the federal work force.</p><p>The Weather Workforce Improvement Act would designate certain positions within the agency as critical to public safety. The bill’s sponsors say it would have protected meteorologists, as well as other roles within the agency, from the cuts this year.</p><div><p>Those jobs include the people who specialize in hurricane forecasts and issue warnings about tornadoes and flash floods, as well as the employees who physically maintain things like weather models or launch weather balloons.</p><p>“Weather forecasting is not partisan,” said Representative Mike Flood, Republican of Nebraska, one of the bill’s bipartisan sponsors. “Everyone supports the National Weather Service. Everyone relies on them, whether they realize it or not.”</p><p>The Weather Service has suffered from short staffing for years, long before the Trump administration’s cuts, but that became more severe this spring, as hundreds more employees began retiring or were forced out.</p><p>At the same time, the country has faced a nonstop pace of deadly and expensive weather disasters, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/californias-worst-wildfires-history.html" title="">California wildfires</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/weather/weather-tornado-warning-south.html" title="">several</a> tornado <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/us/tornado-destruction-kentucky.html" title="">outbreaks</a> and severe hailstorms. For the first time in the agency’s history, some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/weather/nws-cuts-kentucky-tornado.html" title="">forecasting offices</a> no longer had enough staff members to operate overnight, and others had to curtail the twice-daily launches of weather balloons, which collect data on atmospheric conditions that feed into forecast models.</p><p>The bill comes at the start of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/atlantic-hurricane-season-forecast-2025.html" title="">an Atlantic hurricane season that is predicted to bring more storms than usual</a>. Some observers have expressed concerns about understaffed offices and worker fatigue affecting forecasts.</p><p>Mr. Flood said he hoped granting the National Weather Service the authority to hire directly would ensure that shortages could be addressed more quickly than is possible in the current process, in which hiring runs through its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>NOAA declined to comment on the pending legislation.</p><p>The bill may pave the way for the agency’s director, Ken Graham, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/national-weather-service-cuts-trump.html" title="">implement a-planned</a> restructuring. Mr. Flood said he hoped the legislation would give Mr. Graham “some latitude” to modernize.</p><p>Also this week, NOAA said the Weather Service had been granted an exemption to Mr. Trump’s governmentwide hiring freeze, which would allow it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/weather/nws-job-cuts-weather-service-hiring.html#:~:text=Judson%20Jones%20is%20a%20meteorologist%20and%20reporter%20for%20The,forecasts%20and%20covers%20extreme%20weather." title="">to hire 126 people in positions around the country</a> in an effort to “stabilize” the agency.

All represent states that have been hit by severe weather this year.</p><p>“Severe weather affects both blue states and red states, and ensuring Americans have access to reliable and accurate weather forecasting is something everyone should support regardless of their political affiliation,” said Mr. Sorensen, who is the only meteorologist in Congress. “I’m grateful for Congressman Flood’s partnership on bipartisan legislation that will help fully staff National Weather Service offices across the country during severe weather and hurricane season.”</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
