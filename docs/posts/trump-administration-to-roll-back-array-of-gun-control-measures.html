One is a ban on so-called pistol braces used to convert handguns into rifle-like weapons, and the second is a rule requiring background checks on private gun sales.</p><p>The moves come at a moment of chaos at a largely leaderless and rudderless A.T.F., whose small work force has been partly redeployed to provide support for immigration raids around the country. Mr. Patel has spent most of his time running the F.B.I., and the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/trump-dea-atf.html" title="">has proposed merging the gun agency with the Drug Enforcement Administration</a>, a plan that has left the A.T.F.’s career leadership demoralized. That, however, is unlikely to take place anytime soon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>President Trump campaigned on curtailing gun regulation. In February, he signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/protecting-second-amendment-rights/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> directing the Justice Department “to examine all orders, regulations, guidance, plans” and other actions “to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.”</p><p>In late March, Ms. Bondi ordered the department’s civil rights division to open an investigation into the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-department-justice-announces-second-amendment-pattern-or-practice-investigation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">potential infringement of Second Amendment rights</a> by officials in Los Angeles County, repurposing an investigative unit that had been used to expose racial discrimination and police violence by local enforcement agencies.</p><p>The three new actions, while more than symbolic, were neither unexpected nor likely to have major effect immediately.</p><p>Enforcement of the zero-tolerance policy has waned somewhat since Mr. Trump was elected. And federal judges have already frozen all or part of the rule involving pistol braces as well as the regulation imposing background checks on a shadow market of weapons sold online, at gun shows and through private sellers.</p><p>Taken together, the new moves represent an abrupt U-turn from efforts by the Biden administration, led by the former A.T.F. director Steven M. Dettelbach, to stem the flood of unregulated semiautomatic handguns and rifles that have contributed to mass shootings and exacerbated the violent crime wave that peaked after the coronavirus pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This administration inherited a violent crime rate at a 50-year-low — less than three months later they are now looking to roll back popular gun safety policies that keep communities safe,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, the group founded by Michael Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor.</p><p>Emma Brown, executive director of the gun safety group Giffords, accused Mr. Trump of giving his “seal of approval” to “reckless dealers who are willing to sell guns to traffickers and criminals.”</p><p>Gun owners and manufacturers celebrated the decision.</p><p>The Biden administration “purposefully suffocated the firearm industry,” Lawrence G. Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade association for firearms manufacturers, said in a statement.</p><p>He added: “This reckless policy throttled small businesses and drove many to shut down by threatening crippling administrative costs to fight against penalties for minor errors and infractions.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/pamela-j-bondi">Pamela J Bondi</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Gun Violence in America</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>‘Ghost Guns’:</strong> The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/supreme-court-ghost-guns.html">upheld federal restrictions</a> aimed at curtailing access to kits that can be easily assembled into homemade, nearly untraceable firearms. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/what-are-ghost-guns.html">Here’s what you need to know about the weapons</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gun Conversion Devices: </strong>Alabama’s governor signed into law a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/alabama-bill-gun-conversion-devices-ban.html">ban on the conversion of pistols into fully automatic weapons</a>, a move that follows a year of widespread gun violence in the state.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hoping Barriers Can Reduce Bullets: </strong>Birmingham, Ala., which had a record year for homicides in 2024, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/us/gun-violence-prevention-birmingham.html">is trying to curb shootings by blocking streets</a>.
