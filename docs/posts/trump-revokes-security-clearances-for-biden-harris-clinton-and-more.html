    <h1>Trump Revokes Security Clearances for Biden, Harris, Clinton and More</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There were prominent characters from the first impeachment brought against Mr. Trump in 2019, when he was shown to have tried to strong-arm Ukraine into helping him dig up dirt on Mr. Biden. Names included in Friday’s memo: Fiona Hill, a top foreign policy expert who testified during the<span>  </span>impeachment hearings; Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/08/us/politics/alexander-vindman-ukraine-transcript.html" title="">also testified</a>; and Norman Eisen, a lawyer who oversaw that impeachment.</p><p>And there were the only two Republicans who served on the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.</p><p>“I also direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities from these individuals,” Mr. Trump’s memo stated. “This action includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President’s Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community by virtue of the named individuals’ previous tenure in the Congress.”</p><p>Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has used memos like the one he put out Friday to thwack at people who have tried to hold him accountable or who have otherwise crossed him. The memos have been wide-ranging in scope. Earlier this week, he put out one that pulled security protections for Mr. Biden’s adult children, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/trump-biden-hunter-ashley-secret-service.html" title="">Ashley and Hunter</a>.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Trump nixed security clearances for Antony J. Blinken, the former secretary of state, and Jake Sullivan, the former national security adviser (both of whom were named again in Friday’s memo).</p></div></div>
