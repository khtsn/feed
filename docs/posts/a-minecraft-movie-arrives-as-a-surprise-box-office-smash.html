The most recent example came over the weekend with “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review.html" title="">A Minecraft Movie</a>,” which was made in partnership with Warner Bros. The film was on track to sell an astounding $140 million in tickets in North America from Friday through Sunday, according to box office analysts.</p><p>Citing advance ticket sales and surveys that track consumer interest, analysts had projected a domestic opening weekend of closer to $80 million.</p><p>“A Minecraft Movie,” a PG-rated comedic fantasy starring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/movies/a-minecraft-movie-clip.html" title="">Jack Black and Jason Momoa</a> and based on the 2011 video game, also scored overseas, where it was expected to take in an additional $100 million or more, analysts said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The film cost $150 million to make, not including global marketing costs. Legendary, which is independently owned, covered 25 percent of the budget. Warner Bros. shouldered the balance. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_minecraft_movie" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reviews were mixed</a>.</p><p>Hollywood in general, and Warner Bros. in particular, badly needed a hit. Box office revenue in the United States and Canada fell 11 percent in the first three months of this year compared with the same period in 2024, in part because of major flops like “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/business/snow-white-movie-controversies.html" title="">Snow White</a>” (Disney) and “<a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/mickey-17-losing-75-million-theatrical-run-1236342659/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mickey 17</a>” (Warner Bros.). There were also other underperformers, including a pair of low-budget duds from the once-unstoppable Blumhouse horror studio.</p><p>Warner Bros. found a blockbuster in September with “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/movies/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-review.html" title="">Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</a>.” But its performance since then has been dismal, with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/business/warner-bros-david-zaslav.html" title="">gangster movie championed by David Zaslav</a>, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, flatlining last month. Several of the company’s coming films are seen as risks by theater owners and Warner Bros. Discovery investors, including “Sinners,” a $90 million original, R-rated horror thriller set in the 1930s. It arrives on April 18.</p><p>Mr. Zaslav has informally met with candidates to replace Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca, co-chairs of the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private process. The talks were earlier <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-30/warner-bros-ceo-meets-with-candidates-to-replace-studio-chiefs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> by Bloomberg.</p><p>Ms. Abdy and Mr. De Luca declined to comment. A spokesman for Warner Bros. Discovery said, “The rumor of an imminent leadership change at the studio is not accurate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Strong ticket sales for “A Minecraft Movie” could give the embattled executives some breathing room. Ms. Abdy and Mr. De Luca pushed the project into production and oversaw its completion. Warner Bros. also arranged for a major marketing partnership with McDonald’s that generated widespread conversation on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/technology/trump-tiktok-deadline-delay.html" title="">TikTok</a>, a platform that has become a crucial seat-filling tool for studios and theaters.</p><p>But much of the credit for “A Minecraft Movie” belongs to Legendary.</p><p>After struggling for years to come up with the right director, story, structure and tone, Warner Bros. brought on Legendary as a “Minecraft” partner in late 2019. In addition to financing, Legendary offered producing prowess.</p><p>Jared Hess, known for instilling films like “Nacho Libre” and “Napoleon Dynamite” with awkward humor, was hired to direct the movie. Mr. Momoa (“Aquaman”) and the madcap Mr. Black (“Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle”) joined the cast.</p><p>“A Minecraft Movie” is the third time that Legendary has turned challenging source material into broad-audience pay dirt. The company resuscitated King Kong in 2017, resulting in a trilogy that collected $1.6 billion worldwide. Legendary was also the force behind “Dune: Part One” (2021) and “Dune: Part Two” (2024), which took in $1.1 billion, a feat for films that rely on complex science-fiction lore. “Dune: Messiah” is scheduled for release next year.</p><p>Warner Bros. released and invested in the Kong movies (which also star Godzilla). Ditto the “Dune” franchise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“A Minecraft Movie” adds to a boom in game-based films. Other successes include Universal’s animated “Super Mario Bros. Movie” and Paramount’s “Sonic the Hedgehog” series. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/business/five-nights-at-freddys-box-office.html" title="">Five Nights at Freddy’s</a>” from Blumhouse and Universal was a surprise sensation in 2023.</p><p>According to PostTrak, a research service, about 43 percent of ticket buyers for “A Minecraft Movie” were ages 18 to 24. Children ages 13 to 17 made up 35 percent.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Brooks Barnes covers all things Hollywood.
