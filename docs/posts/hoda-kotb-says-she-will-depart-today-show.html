But, she told The Times, “it felt like the time to turn the page on what has been a dream book, a dream quarter-century.”</p><p>Her exit will create vacancies in two of the most coveted seats in television news. Ms. Kotb holds both an anchor chair for the flagship “Today” telecast, from 7 to 9 a.m., and a hosting position for its fourth hour at 10 a.m. The “Today” franchise remains a crucial driver of revenue for NBC.</p><p>It was the 10 a.m. hour where Ms. Kotb first hit it off with morning audiences. After being paired with her co-host, the formidable Kathie Lee Gifford, in 2008, Ms. Kotb gossiped and interviewed celebrities, but also spoke candidly about battling breast cancer and her resulting struggles with fertility. In 2017, Ms. Kotb, then in her 50s, adopted her first of two daughters, Haley.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford on the “Today” show in 2008.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Heidi Gutman/NBC, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Then, at a moment of crisis, NBC executives turned to Ms. Kotb for help.</p><p>In November 2017, the network abruptly fired the longtime “Today” star <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/business/media/nbc-matt-lauer.html" title="">Matt Lauer</a> after a subordinate accused him of sexual misconduct, sending shock waves through millions of American homes. Ms. Kotb was installed as an emergency substitute, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/business/media/today-show-ratings-matt-lauer.html" title="">viewers responded</a> positively to her rapport with the remaining “Today” anchor, Savannah Guthrie.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Weeks later, Ms. Kotb’s temporary role <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/media/hoda-kotb-today-matt-lauer.html" title="">became permanent</a>. </p><p>Ms. Guthrie, in an interview on Wednesday evening, called herself “super proud” and “super heartbroken” about Ms. Kotb’s pending departure. “It takes such guts to leave a place where you’re so comfortable, so beloved,” she said. “There’s nothing rash about this.”</p><p>Last year, Ms. Kotb shared that her younger daughter, Hope, whom she adopted in 2019, was <a href="https://www.today.com/parents/moms/hoda-kotb-shares-message-viewers-news-daughter-health-rcna73722" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hospitalized in intensive care</a> for an unspecified health matter. She has <a href="https://www.today.com/parents/hoda-kotb-daughter-hope-health-update-rcna142010" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">since said</a> that “things have stabilized.” In the interview, Ms. Kotb said Hope’s health “wasn’t a deciding factor” in her decision, but that she wanted to prioritize being involved in her children’s lives.</p><p>“I have a time pie in front of me,&#34; she said, “and I think my kids deserve a bigger slice of that pie.”</p><p>Jenna Bush Hager, who became Ms. Kotb’s 10 a.m. co-host in 2019, cried in an interview as she talked about Ms. Kotb’s decision.</p><p>“We talk often about how brave it is to make the choice to be there for your family and to give up something that we all love so much,” Ms. Hager said. “I think she realized she wants to wake up to those faces.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Replacing Ms. Kotb is a high-stakes matter for NBC executives, who did not immediately announce a successor. “Today” has a comfortable ratings lead over ABC and CBS among adults under the age of 54, the age bracket vital to advertisers. Over the last year, ABC’s “Good Morning America” continues to hold a lead in total viewers, but “Today” has won the key ratings demographic for 58 consecutive weeks, its biggest winning streak in more than three years.</p><p>In the interview, Ms. Kotb was asked if she ever imagined, when she started at “Today,” that she would remain a primary face of the show for nearly two decades.</p><p>“Oh, honey,” she replied. “There’s no way on God’s green earth I could have even dreamt something this spectacular.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hoda Kotb has been a fixture of NBC’s “Today” show for 17 years.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathan Congleton/NBC, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
