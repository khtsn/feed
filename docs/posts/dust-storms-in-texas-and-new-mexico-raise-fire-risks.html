Parts of the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma were under blowing dust warnings until early Wednesday.</p><p>The authorities in New Mexico <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/1EBhe4fjnz/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged people to avoid driving</a> through the severe dust storms that hit the state on Tuesday. Poor visibility because of the dust had led to dangerous driving conditions and some road closures, according to New Mexico’s Transportation Department.</p><p>The Weather Service’s bureau in Norman, Okla., said <a href="https://x.com/NWSNorman/status/1902157815428399474" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> that visibility would drop to half a mile or less, especially in southwest Oklahoma, on Tuesday night, making travel “extremely hazardous.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Severe weather and crashes led to the closure of a stretch of Highway 54, in the village of Ruidoso, N.M., about 65 miles west of Roswell, <a href="https://x.com/VillageRuidoso/status/1902135421603098818" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the authorities</a>.</p><p>More than 35,000 customers were without power in New Mexico and Texas on Tuesday night, according to PowerOutage.us, a tracking website.

The wind direction was expected to shift in some areas tonight in the southern Plains, which could create challenges for firefighters.</p><p>Damaging winds were also expected to pick up in Oklahoma and West Kansas.</p><p>In Texas, a fire near Borger in Hutchinson County broke out on Tuesday evening and quickly spread to 350 acres, prompting evacuation orders for some residents, according to officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Another fire in a largely agricultural area in northern Dallam County more than doubled, to about 15,000 acres, and was 50 percent contained by Tuesday night, according to the Texas A&amp;M Forest Service.
