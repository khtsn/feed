Parts of the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma were under blowing dust warnings until early Wednesday.</p><p>The authorities in New Mexico <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/1EBhe4fjnz/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged people to avoid driving</a> through the severe dust storms that hit the state on Tuesday. Poor visibility because of the dust had led to dangerous driving conditions and some road closures, according to New Mexico’s Transportation Department.</p><p>The Weather Service’s bureau in Norman, Okla., said <a href="https://x.com/NWSNorman/status/1902157815428399474" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> that visibility would drop to half a mile or less, especially in southwest Oklahoma, on Tuesday night, making travel “extremely hazardous.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Severe weather and crashes led to the closure of a stretch of Highway 54, in the village of Ruidoso, N.M., about 65 miles west of Roswell, <a href="https://x.com/VillageRuidoso/status/1902135421603098818" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the authorities</a>.</p><p>More than 35,000 customers were without power in New Mexico and Texas on Tuesday night, according to PowerOutage.us, a tracking website.
