But Mr. Trump has criticized India for its high tariffs, and India is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/asia/india-illegal-immigration-trump.html" title="">biggest source</a>, outside of Latin America, of unauthorized migrants in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>After arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Modi met Tulsi Gabbard on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-senate-confirmation-vote.html" title="">her first day</a> as Mr. Trump’s director of national intelligence. They discussed the relationship between the two countries, <a href="https://x.com/PMOIndia/status/1889850005110005874" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Modi’s office said</a>, without offering details.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/asia/modi-trump-white-house-visit.html" title="">India and the United States</a>, the world’s largest democracies, have grown closer in the face of an increasingly assertive mutual rival, China. India has traded more with the United States than it has with China, and spent billions on U.S. defense imports in recent years.</p><p>Despite their strong rapport, both Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump are strongmen with largely transactional views on foreign relations and an eye on what will please their bases.</p><p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump said India had gained an unfair trade advantage against the United States through high tariffs. And India, like basically all countries that do business with the United States, runs a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/business/trump-modi-tariffs-india.html" title="">trade surplus</a>. Last year, it shipped about $87 billion worth of goods and imported $42 billion, adding $46 billion to the U.S. trade deficit.</p><p>Mr. Trump views the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/business/economy/us-trade-deficit-2024-record.html" title="">U.S. trade deficit</a> as a sign of economic weakness. Economists say it is an indication of American consumers’ ability to spend on imports, backed by the strong U.S. economy. But Mr. Trump has made it a priority to try adjusting the trade imbalance by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/trump-tariffs-goal.html" title="">imposing tariffs</a>.</p><p>Mr. Modi may reveal new measures to ease friction on trade and immigration when he meets Mr. Trump on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Indian officials have said that companies have been in talks to buy more American energy supplies like liquefied natural gas. The two leaders could also discuss increased spending by India, the world’s largest arms importer, on U.S. defense equipment.</p><p>India has its limitations, including its own trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit amounts to less than 4 percent of its economy. The deficit in India, which relies on imports for most of its fuel needs, is worth between 8 and 12 percent in most years.</p><p>Mr. Modi has offered concessions, though some have been largely symbolic.</p><p>India recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/business/trump-komatsu.html" title="">reduced tariffs</a> on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which Mr. Trump had zeroed in on as a symbol of India’s misuse of tariffs. The reduction, though, had little effect on the company. India has also raised the prospect of lower duties on goods like bourbon and pecans, which are produced mainly in Republican states.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Indian Migrant Says Deportation Flight Was ‘Torture’</h2><h4>As India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, meets with President Trump, issues around immigration are likely to be a source of tension, including a U.S. military flight that returned shackled migrants to India.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>Harwinder Singh was on the first deportation flight from the U.S. to India, just weeks after President Donald Trump took office. Video of conditions on the military plane that carried them, shared by U.S. officials, sparked outrage among Indian lawmakers. Now, as India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, visits Washington, the incident is expected to resurface. Take all your stuff out of your bag and put it in front of you, O.K.? India accounts for the largest group of undocumented migrants to the U.S., other than Latin America. Singh said he and his fellow passengers were shackled and mistreated during the 40-hour intercontinental trip. Singh’s family has long struggled to make ends meet. Before his time in the U.S., Singh was a farmer, but that never made enough. He said he hoped to earn more in the U.S. and send it home. According to a Pew Research Center study, in 2022, there were approximately 700,000 undocumented Indians in the U.S., a number that has likely risen in recent years.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/world/asia/india-deport-cover/india-deport-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">As India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, meets with President Trump, issues around immigration are likely to be a source of tension, including a U.S. military flight that returned shackled migrants to India.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Modi has offered concessions on immigration, too, saying he would repatriate Indians deported from the United States, even as it caused an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/world/asia/india-deportation-trump-modi.html" title="">embarrassment</a> for him.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Just days before his trip to Washington, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/asia/migrants-deported-india-us.html" title="">arrival of more than 100 Indians</a> on a U.S. military plane caused a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/world/asia/india-deportation-trump-modi.html" title="">domestic backlash</a>.
