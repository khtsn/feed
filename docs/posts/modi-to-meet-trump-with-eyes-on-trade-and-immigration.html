And India, like basically all countries that do business with the United States, runs a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/business/trump-modi-tariffs-india.html" title="">trade surplus</a>.

The U.S. trade deficit amounts to less than 4 percent of its economy.

Video of conditions on the military plane that carried them, shared by U.S. officials, sparked outrage among Indian lawmakers. Now, as India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, visits Washington, the incident is expected to resurface. Take all your stuff out of your bag and put it in front of you, O.K.? India accounts for the largest group of undocumented migrants to the U.S., other than Latin America. Singh said he and his fellow passengers were shackled and mistreated during the 40-hour intercontinental trip. Singh’s family has long struggled to make ends meet. Before his time in the U.S., Singh was a farmer, but that never made enough. He said he hoped to earn more in the U.S. and send it home. According to a Pew Research Center study, in 2022, there were approximately 700,000 undocumented Indians in the U.S., a number that has likely risen in recent years.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/world/asia/india-deport-cover/india-deport-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">As India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, meets with President Trump, issues around immigration are likely to be a source of tension, including a U.S. military flight that returned shackled migrants to India.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Modi has offered concessions on immigration, too, saying he would repatriate Indians deported from the United States, even as it caused an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/world/asia/india-deportation-trump-modi.html" title="">embarrassment</a> for him.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Just days before his trip to Washington, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/asia/migrants-deported-india-us.html" title="">arrival of more than 100 Indians</a> on a U.S. military plane caused a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/world/asia/india-deportation-trump-modi.html" title="">domestic backlash</a>.
