But many of their claims were misleading or lacked context.</p><p>The agency, long a target for conservative critics who have questioned the value of foreign aid, has been subject to sharp upheaval in the last week. After freezing foreign aid for 90 days, the Trump administration said it would drastically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/usaid-job-cuts.html" title="">reduce the agency’s work force</a>, although a federal judge temporarily paused elements of the plan on Friday.</p><p>The speed and scale of the efforts to gut U.S.A.I.D. are part of a larger bid by Mr. Trump and his allies to cut costs across the federal government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is a fact-check of their claims about the agency.</p><p>What Was Said</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, center left, leaving a joint news conference with President Rodrigo Chaves of Costa Rica on Tuesday.

But that does not mean that 80 to 90 percent of funding was spent on “overhead and bureaucracy.” In fact, most of the agency’s funding is channeled through other recipients like American companies and charities as well as public international organizations.</p><p>For years, U.S.A.I.D. has tried to shift more resources to and engage more directly with local partners, but the agency continues to team up with nonlocal partners to carry out the bulk of its aid programs. Catholic Relief Services, for example, is a nonlocal partner that has received <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/recipient/2a706a17-b53d-3f3e-64c2-5b0166d343f1-R/latest" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of millions of dollars in funding</a> from the agency for charity work. By Mr. Rubio’s logic, such work would be considered “overhead.”</p><p>According to <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R48150" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2024 analysis by the Congressional Research Service</a>, about two-thirds of U.S.A.I.D.’s funding from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2022 went to project-based assistance, about 19 percent toward contributions to public international organizations like the World Food Program and the International Committee of the Red Cross and 1.9 percent in contributions to the budgets of foreign governments. About 7.7 percent was spent on administrative costs.</p><p>What Was Said</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, held up a document of U.S.A.I.D. spending notes during a press briefing on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><em>“And I would just say a strong message to Democrats who are out there pretending to be outraged about the long list of crap that this administration is cutting, federal waste and funding, like $2 million for sex changes in Guatemala, $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt, $20 million on a new Sesame Street show in Iraq, $4.5 million to combat disinformation in Kazakhstan.”</em></p><p><em>“Because if you look at the waste and abuse that has run through U.S.A.I.D. over the past several years, these are some of the insane priorities that that organization has been spending money on: $1.5 million to advance D.E.I. in Serbia’s workplaces, $70,000 for a production of a D.E.I. musical in Ireland, $47,000 for a transgender opera in Colombia, $32,000 for a transgender comic book in Peru.”</em></p><p><strong>This is exaggerated. </strong>Ms. Leavitt’s descriptions of the awards were largely inaccurate for five of the eight examples she listed.</p><p>She was correct that U.S.A.I.D. awarded a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250111020443/https://www.usaid.gov/iraq/fact-sheets/ahlan-simsim-iraq" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$20 million grant to Sesame Workshop</a> to produce a television show for young children called “Ahlan Simsim Iraq”; a <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72011523CA00001_7200/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$4.5 million grant</a> to “advance integrity and accountability in the information space and build societal resilience in the face of disinformation” in Kazakhstan; and <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72016922FA00001_7200" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a $1.5 million gran</a>t to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in Serbia.</p><p>But she omitted context or misstated key details in her descriptions of the five other grants.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72052024FA00001_7200/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2 million grant</a> was awarded to Asociación Lambda, a Guatemalan group, to “deliver gender-affirming health care, advocate for improved quality and access to services, and provide economic empowerment opportunities.” <a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/what-gender-affirming-care-your-questions-answered" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gender-affirming care</a> is an umbrella term that includes surgery as well as hormone therapy, counseling, hair removal and speech therapy; it is unclear how much of the $2 million, if any, specifically funded surgical interventions.
