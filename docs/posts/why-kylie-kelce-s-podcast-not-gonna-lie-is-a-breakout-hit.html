There was admiration and glee, both from fans of Ms. Kelce and detractors of Mr. Rogan.</p><p>But there was also some confusion: Kylie Kelce who?</p><p>“Which is very funny to me — I don’t need you to know who I am,” Ms. Kelce said in a rare interview at her home studio outside Philadelphia. In fact, she said, she prefers when people don’t.</p><p>Of course, some of her family members are household names. There is her husband, Jason Kelce, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5674496/2024/08/02/jason-kelce-philadelphia-eagles/" title="">former center</a> for the Philadelphia Eagles, soon-to-be <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/42538479/jason-kelce-host-late-night-show-espn-starting-jan-3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">late-night host</a> and one of the most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/style/jason-kelce-crying.html" title="">charismatic</a> stars in American sports. They are expecting their fourth daughter in April.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And there is her brother-in-law, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5706723/2024/08/20/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-chiefs-summer/" title="">Travis Kelce</a>, the tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs who has been dating the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/arts/music/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-timeline.html" title="">biggest pop star</a>. The brothers have their own hit video podcast, “New Heights,” which Amazon’s Wondery bought the advertising sales and distribution rights to in August for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5726238/2024/08/27/new-heights-travis-jason-kelce-wondery-amazon-deal/" title="">more than $100 million</a>.</p><p>But until now, Kylie Kelce has stayed mostly out of view, appearing only twice on “New Heights.” (Her first appearance, in 2023, remains the show’s most-viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvnXRqMRLSw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">episode</a>.) To listeners of her new show, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nglwithkylie" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Not Gonna Lie With Kylie Kelce</a>,” that is part of her appeal: In a world of people clawing their way into the spotlight, Ms. Kelce was dragged into fame, as she describes it.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
