</span>, and has removed the team from VCT Pacific.</p>

<p>Riot cited TALON&#39;s consistent failure to provide payments to players on time as well as an &#34;inability to demonstrate sufficient financial capacity&#34; as the primary reason for their removal. TALON was given extensions, and chances to demonstrate improvement, but were ultimately deemed unable to meet the standards to continue as a VCT partner.</p>

<p>TALON released their own <a href="https://x.com/TALON_VALORANT/status/1990655162709610982?s=20" target="_blank">statement</a>, corroborating their financial struggles as the reason for removal. As result of their removal, they will take a step back from Valorant esports for the time being.</p>

<p>The team that will replace TALON in VCT Pacific has not been decided yet, but Riot have selected a candidate teams from APAC to go through the competitive application process.</p>

<p>TALON&#39;s player roster, having been affected by their removal, have been allowed to explore other opportunities in VCT. These players include TALON&#39;s latest roster, which was:</p>

	<p>On a real note, there really isn&#39;t a better org than them in Pacific tier-2 so they are going to get the call right back up this time likely permanently, if I had a nickel everytime boom esports got saved by an org not paying players on time, I would have 2 nickels but it&#39;s still weird it happened twice</p>
