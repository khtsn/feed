</span>, and have removed the team from VCT Pacific.</p>

<p>Riot cited TALON&#39;s consistent failure to provide payments to players on time as well as an &#34;inability to demonstrate sufficient financial capacity&#34; as the primary reason for their removal. TALON was given extensions, and chances to demonstrate improvement, but were ultimately deemed unable to meet the standards to continue as a VCT partner.</p>

<p>TALON released their own <a href="https://x.com/TALON_VALORANT/status/1990655162709610982?s=20" target="_blank">statement</a>, corroborating their financial struggles as the reason for removal. As result of their removal, they will take a step back from Valorant esports for the time being.</p>

<p>The team that will replace TALON in VCT Pacific has not been decided yet, but Riot have selected a candidate teams from APAC to go through the competitive application process.</p>

<p>TALON&#39;s player roster, having been affected by their removal, have been allowed to explore other opportunities in VCT. These players include TALON&#39;s latest roster, which was:</p>

	<p>nah im trolling. But it is true that crws or someone else had to personally talk and convince primmie&#39;s parents to let him play/fly to KR to play for Talon. So i get the impression that they maybe didnt wanna let him be an esports player at first like most sane parents </p>
