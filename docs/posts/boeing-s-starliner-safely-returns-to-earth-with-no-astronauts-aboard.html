Starliner is now backing away from station and starting its return to Earth. Starliner’s thrusters will then complete two short firings to gradually increase the separation speed to help the spacecraft carefully move away from the orbiting lab.” “The vehicle is now about two meters away from the International Space Station. At the time of undocking, Starliner and the International Space Station were flying approximately 260 statute miles over central China.” “During this burn sequence, Starliner’s thrusters will perform a series of 12 short firings. The entire sequence takes about five minutes to complete and allows Starliner to quickly break out to outside the approach ellipsoid, or A.E. And about four minutes into the burn sequence, Starliner will exit the keep-out sphere, or the K.O.S.” “We have one more burn to go, but they have confirmed that Starliner has crossed the keep-out sphere, or the K.O.S., which is an imaginary 200-meter sphere centered on the International Space Station that helps flight controllers here on the ground monitor the arrival and departure of visiting vehicles.” “Station, Houston, Space to Ground 2, Starliner has exited the keep-out sphere.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/06/multimedia/06starliner-return-lkzf/06starliner-return-lkzf-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The two NASA astronauts who traveled on the spacecraft to the International Space Station remained there after NASA officials decided it would be safer for Starliner to return without crew aboard.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>NASA, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang"><img alt="Kenneth Chang" title="Kenneth Chang" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-kenneth-chang/author-kenneth-chang-thumbLarge-v3.png"/></a></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang" itemprop="name">Kenneth Chang</a></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="reading-time-module"><p><time datetime="2024-09-07T01:53:12-04:00"><span>Published <!-- -->Sept. 6, 2024</span><span>Updated <!-- -->Sept. 7, 2024, <span>1:53 a.m. ET</span></span></time></p></div></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Starliner has landed.</p><p>Boeing’s troubled spacecraft has finally come home, but the two NASA astronauts who traveled in it to the International Space Station in June remain in orbit.</p><p>Out of an abundance of caution, NASA officials decided not to put the astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, on Starliner for the return trip.

One did not work, but that does not pose a problem, because there are two redundant systems of six thrusters each. These are a separate set of thrusters from the ones on the service module.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The flight controllers also fired 10 of the service module thrusters, and those all worked as expected.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ0T-cZWh78" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NASA’s video coverage of the re-entry and landing</a> of Starliner is ongoing, and you can watch it in the video player above.</p><h2 id="link-21e8426">Undocking earlier this evening was a smooth affair.</h2><p>At 6:04 p.m. Eastern time, hooks that held Starliner tight to the space station retracted, and springs on the spacecraft pushed it away from the docking port. At that moment, it was about 260 miles above central China.</p><p>Then a series of thruster firings gently nudged Starliner up and over the space station.</p><p>“Starliner is now on a path back to Earth,” Anna Schneider, a NASA spokeswoman, said about 20 minutes after the vehicle undocked and reached a distance far enough away that space station flight controllers no longer needed to keep an eye on it. At the higher altitude, it is moving more slowly than the space station and the distance between them is growing quickly.</p><p>That was an uneventful beginning to the end of the mission, which launched in June, on a test flight that was the first time Starliner carried people to orbit. The flight was intended as a final shakedown before NASA certified the spacecraft for once-a-year missions taking astronauts to and from the space station.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The vehicle’s propulsion system experienced problems during its approach to the space station, including several balky thrusters and leaks of helium, a gas used to push propellant in the weightlessness of orbit. Although Starliner was able to dock successfully, the cause of the problems is still not fully understood, and NASA officials decided it would be safer for Starliner to return without anyone aboard.</p><h2 id="link-ddb3524">Why is Starliner traveling home with no astronauts aboard?</h2><p>The Starliner mission carried two NASA astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, to the space station.</p><p>Lingering uncertainty about the cause of the vehicle’s propulsion problems led to unease that there might be a more serious underlying issue. A catastrophic failure of Starliner’s propulsion system during the return trip could leave the spacecraft stranded in orbit or it could burn up during re-entry.</p><p>Boeing officials have said that they believe the weeks of analysis and ground tests show that Starliner could have safely taken Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore back to Earth. But NASA officials decided it would be less risky for the two astronauts to remain on the space station instead of returning to Earth in Starliner.</p><p>Before the undocking, Ms. Williams, who several years ago had given this vehicle the name Calypso, thanked the Boeing mission control team.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It is time to bring Calypso home,” she said. “We have your backs and you’ve got this. Bring her back to Earth. Good luck.”</p><p>In turn, Chloe Mehring, the flight director, thanked the astronauts, who have spent years preparing for this flight. “We remember every setback and every revelation with you,” Ms. Mehring said. “The teams on the ground have worked countless hours over the last few weeks, months, and, for a group of us, years to bring Calypso back, and we’re ready to that today.”</p><h2 id="link-7edc71ec">What happens to the astronauts now?</h2><p>The two Starliner astronauts will become full-fledged members of the space station crew. NASA calls each rotation of crew members an “expedition,” and Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore will now be part of Expedition 72.</p><p>Later this month, two other astronauts, Nick Hague of NASA and Aleksandr Gorbunov of Russia, are scheduled to launch to the space station in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, to also serve as part of Expedition 72. For Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore to have seats on the return trip to Earth next year, two other NASA astronauts who had been scheduled to serve on Expedition 72 — Zena Cardman and Stephanie Wilson — were bumped from the mission, known as Crew-9.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/boeing-company">Boeing Company</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/national-aeronautics-and-space-administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">What’s Up in Space and Astronomy</h2><h3>Keep track of things going on in our solar system and all around the universe.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/science/space-astronomy-events-2024.html">2024 event</a> that’s out of this world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2024/01/01/science/astronomy-space-calendar">our space and astronomy calendar</a>.</p></li><li><p>Leaving behind the two NASA astronauts it took to the International Space Station three months ago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/science/space/boeing-starliner-space-station-nasa.html">Boeing’s troubled Starliner spacecraft is set to begin</a> its return to Earth soon.</p></li><li><p>A speeding star is traveling through the Milky Way at around a million miles an hour.
