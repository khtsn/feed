Just want to see if — do you own a suit?” He added, “A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the office.”</p><p>The questions came from Brian Glenn, a correspondent for Real America’s Voice, a right-wing cable channel that has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/us/politics/heritage-foundation-2024-campaign-immigration.html" title="">spread conspiracy theories</a> about noncitizen voting and helped <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/24/steve-bannon-war-room-real-americas-voice/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">distribute</a> Stephen K. Bannon’s “War Room” podcast after Mr. Bannon was barred from YouTube, Spotify and other mainstream platforms.</p><p>Mr. Glenn’s outlet was selected to take a “secondary TV” role in the White House press pool alongside CNN on Friday — a position that did not exist before this week. That access was granted as the White House continued to block reporters from The Associated Press from attending, according to a schedule sent out by the White House, and as it began this week to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/media/trump-white-house-press.html" title="">handpick the pool reporters</a> who cover the president in small settings, such as the Oval Office meeting with Mr. Zelensky.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Pool reporters attend the events in a rotation traditionally organized by the White House Correspondents’ Association and share their observations with other outlets not present.</p><p>Mr. Glenn’s comments about Mr. Zelensky’s appearance echoed Mr. Trump’s on Friday as the Ukrainian leader stepped out of his car at the White House. “He’s all dressed up today,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoVAS_gGoVk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump told reporters</a>, indicating Mr. Zelensky’s attire.</p><p>Since the start of the war, Mr. Zelensky has regularly donned standard-issue field uniforms as a display of solidarity with his country’s armed forces. The criticism that he didn’t wear a suit drew immediate outcry online.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky received <a href="https://time.com/7263291/zelensky-trump-oval-office-showdown-us-ukraine-world-leaders-react/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an outpouring of support internationally</a> after the meeting, which had become adversarial long before Mr. Glenn’s questions.</p><p>Lawmakers and media critics were quick to point out that just this week, Elon Musk had appeared at a cabinet meeting wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words “tech support” under an overcoat. And when Mr. Musk spoke alongside Mr. Trump in the Oval Office last month, he appeared to be wearing a shirt that read “Occupy Mars.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Responding to the backlash, Mr. Glenn posted a lengthy personal <a href="https://x.com/brianglenntv/status/1895794255601234066" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Saturday morning expressing “extreme empathy for the people of Ukraine” but continuing to berate Mr. Zelensky.</p><p>He suggested in the post that the olive-green military fatigues that Mr. Zelensky often wears in meetings with other world leaders signaled respect, but that the black tactical sweater bearing his country’s coat of arms did not.</p><p>“For him, once again, to enter the highest office in the most powerful nation in the world, dressed as he did, reflects his inner disrespect for not only our country, the President and the US citizens that have made it possible for Ukraine to survive as long as they have to this point,” Mr. Glenn wrote.</p><p>On Friday, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is dating Mr. Glenn, <a href="https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1895559051813273718" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">applauded</a> the exchange on social media.</p><p>“I’m so proud of @brianglenntv for pointing out that Zelensky has so much disrespect for America that he can’t even wear a suit in the Oval Office when he comes to beg for money from our President,” she wrote.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Trump and Zelensky: </strong>A meeting between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine turned into an angry shouting match at the Oval Office. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-transcript.html">Here are the key excerpts</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Student Loan Affordable Repayment Plans:</strong> The Education Department has pulled down all applications for borrowers seeking to enroll in income-driven repayment programs. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/student-loan-repayment-plans.html">Here’s what to know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>National Weather Service: </strong>Cuts at the government agency responsible for issuing warnings, generating daily forecasts, advising local authorities and collecting the weather data that make these functions possible provoked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/weather/national-weather-serivce-cuts-trump-impact.html">swift condemnation from people in the field, some lawmakers and the public</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Security Administration</strong><strong>: </strong>The Social Security Administration, a crucial program that keeps millions of older Americans out of poverty, said that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/social-security-administration-job-cuts.html">reduce its head count by more than 12 percent</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Homeland Security and I.R.S.: </strong>The Department of Homeland Security has pushed the Internal Revenue Service to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/irs-immigrants-addresses.html">turn over the addresses of roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants</a> it is seeking to deport, according to three people familiar with the matter.
