A Secret Service agent spotted a man with a gun at Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla., yesterday and fired at him before the man could hit anyone. Trump was unharmed, and the police arrested a suspect.</p><p>In today’s newsletter, we’ll share what we know about the episode and the suspect.</p><h2 id="link-193df867">In the bushes</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pictures of evidence found at the fence of the golf course.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chandan Khanna/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Trump was golfing at his club in West Palm Beach yesterday afternoon with a few staff members and a longtime friend. A Secret Service agent traveling ahead of Trump noticed the barrel of a rifle sticking through a fence along the course. The agent quickly fired shots toward the gunman, the Palm Beach County sheriff said.</p><p>The gunman fled, and it’s not clear whether he fired any shots. He left behind an AK-style rifle with a scope; two backpacks filled with ceramic tile, which he had hung on a fence; and a video camera.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>A witness’s photo allowed the police to track the suspect as he drove up Interstate 95, and he was arrested a short time later. A law enforcement source identified him as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lily Boyce, Lazaro Gamio, Helmuth Rosales</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Not long after the shooting, Trump sent an email to supporters saying, “Before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!” People close to him said that he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/politics/trump-reaction-golf-shooting.html?smid=url-share" title="">shaken but upbeat</a>, and that he had joked about not getting to finish what had been a good round of golf.</p><p>President Biden said he was briefed on the attempted shooting. “I am relieved that the former president is unharmed,” Biden said. “As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country.”</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/16/us/trump-shooting-news/698e9348-9952-54a6-bbe2-940c7854c230?smid=url-share" title="">said she was “deeply disturbed”</a> by the assassination attempt.</p><h2 id="link-36bf94a6">The suspect</h2><p>Routh’s social media history shows a penchant for violent language and an obsession with the war in Ukraine. He wrote in 2022 that he was willing to fight and die to defend that country. The Times interviewed him in 2023 for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/25/world/europe/volunteers-us-ukraine-lies.html" title="">an article</a> about Americans volunteering to aid the war effort in Ukraine. Routh, who had no military experience, said he had traveled there after Russia’s invasion.
