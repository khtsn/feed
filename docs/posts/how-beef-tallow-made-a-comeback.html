But he isn’t using the animal fat for its taste.</p><p>Mr. Burgess, 36, who owns a small restaurant that serves tacos and street food in Middletown, R.I., said he felt a “moral and ethical obligation” to change his menu earlier this year. He came to that conclusion after reading that seed oils, like the canola oil he used to cook his fries and tortilla chips, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html" title="">carried potential harms</a>.</p><p>Tallow, he said, made for a healthier, more “natural” frying oil.</p><p>Beef tallow, a type of rendered fat, was a staple in America’s home and fast-food kitchens for much of the 20th century before falling out of favor because of its high levels of saturated fat. Now, it’s making a comeback.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369865301112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Fox News segment</a> on March 11, the health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., celebrated the Midwest-based food chain Steak ’n Shake for committing to frying its onion rings, chicken tenders and fries in 100 percent beef tallow. Upscale grocers stock products like tortilla chips and protein bars made with beef tallow. On social media, influencers <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@miarowee/video/7456911619562589486?lang=en&amp;q=cooking%20with%20beef%20tallow&amp;t=1741834499517" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">render beef tallow in their kitchens</a>, make <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@holistichealinglucy/video/7432246780873526546?lang=en&amp;q=beef%20tallow%20nutella&amp;t=1741835079189" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tallow chocolates</a> and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/style/beef-tallow-skin-products.html" title="">rub it on their faces</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But doctors and nutrition experts widely agree that using beef tallow in place of vegetable oil is misguided.</p><h2 id="link-11929f06">How we got here</h2><p>Fats like beef tallow (and its pork-based equivalent, lard) were once America’s go-to cooking oils, said Kevin Klatt, a nutrition scientist and dietitian at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>That started to shift after the introduction of refined vegetable oils in the early 1900s, which were cheaper to mass produce than tallow.</p><p>But it wasn’t until the 1980s and 1990s that fast-food chains pivoted to vegetable oils, largely because of new knowledge that diets high in saturated fats could increase the risk of heart disease.</p><p>McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s all <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/25/garden/eating-well-the-slimming-of-fat-fast-food.html" title="">eliminated beef tallow</a> from their fryers in 1990, cutting the saturated fats in their French fries by nearly half.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Today, McDonald’s prepares its fries, chicken nuggets and other fried menu items in a blend of three seed oils: canola, corn and soybean.</p><h2 id="link-2f93b5ae">The claims about beef tallow</h2><p>Mathaus Myga, 37, who owns a German takeout restaurant in Wisconsin, started frying his pork and chicken schnitzel in locally sourced beef tallow a year and a half ago.</p><p>He is proud that his restaurant appears on an app called Seed Oil Scout, which helps users locate seed-oil-free restaurants across the United States.</p><p>“I don’t want to sell anything that I wouldn’t personally eat,” said Mr. Myga, who has noticed an uptick in business — and positive customer reviews — since switching to beef tallow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>As with many restaurant owners, Mr. Myga cites various motivations for using beef tallow in place of canola oil. His schnitzel is juicier, he said, and he likes knowing that it’s cooked with a “natural,” less-processed ingredient. Many seed oil manufacturers, for instance, use chemicals to extract the oils from seeds, which isn’t necessary for rendering fat from beef.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Scott Semler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When Mr. Myga returns home after a day of frying with tallow, his two dogs lick his fingers.</p><p>“They would never do that with rapeseed oil,” Mr. Myga said, referring to a common vegetable oil. “These are animals that have natural instincts.”</p><p>Some <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@paulsaladinomd2/video/7289161819111902510" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">influencers also claim</a> that beef tallow is healthier than seed oils because it contains fat-soluble nutrients like vitamins D, E and K — and that you should avoid seed oils because they cause chronic inflammation and break down into dangerous components in extreme heat.</p><p>But cardiologists, nutrition scientists and dietitians say that many of those claims are misleading.</p><p>“People think, ‘Oh, let’s go back to the olden ways,’” said Adern Yu, a dietitian at the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif. “They think because it’s more natural, that it’s healthier. But what they forgot is that beef tallow is basically just purified fat.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-acecbc8">What the experts say</h2><p>Since the 1980s, federal health officials have urged Americans to limit how much saturated fat they consume because it can raise the levels of LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol, which in turn can increase the risk for heart attack and stroke.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/about-dietary-guidelines/previous-editions/2015-dietary-guidelines" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a>, experts recommend that no more than 10 percent of your daily calories (or no more than 20 grams if you consume 2,000 calories per day) come from saturated fats. One tablespoon of beef tallow contains 6.4 grams, while the same amount of canola oil has about one gram.</p><p>“Saturated fat is very dangerous,” said Dr. Martha Gulati, the director of preventive cardiology at the Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute in Los Angeles. As a doctor who treats patients trying to avoid heart disease, she said, she can’t get behind the “beef tallow is healthy” trend.</p><p>Even if you look at the vitamins beef tallow contains, Ms. Yu said, they’re not present at “significant” enough levels to make a big difference in your health.</p><p>Over many decades of research, scientists have found that people who favor sources of unsaturated fats (like vegetable oils) over saturated ones (like butter or lard) are more likely to have healthier hearts. That conclusion was echoed in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831265" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a study published earlier this month</a> that estimated that if people replaced 10 grams of butter per day with the same amount of plant oils, they would be 17 percent less likely to die from any cause — including cancer and heart disease.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The oils win by a lot,” said Marion Nestle, an emerita professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.</p><h2 id="link-49bd08a7">The return of tallow</h2><p>According to a spokesman for the Seed Oil Scout app, it has been downloaded 1.5 million times since 2024 — up from just 180,000 downloads in 2023.</p><p>But the “seed oils are poison” movement has been gaining steam since before Mr. Kennedy came into prominence, Dr. Nestle said.</p><p>Dr. Walter C. Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, traces it back to a handful of events beginning in the early 2000s.</p><p>In 2002, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0753332202002536" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a review study</a> raised the question of whether consuming foods with high levels of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids (a ratio typical of many seed oils) might increase inflammation in the body.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“But I’ve gone through these papers and there’s not a single shred of evidence that this is actually true,” Dr. Willett said. “This is all theoretical.”</p><p>Later on, especially throughout the 2010s, some scientists and people who champion the consumption of saturated fats from dairy and meat products questioned the link between saturated fat and heart disease. Some claimed that the American Heart Association — which <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.cir.23.1.133" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">played a major role</a> in shifting American diets away from animal fats and toward plant oils starting in the 1960s — was biased because it had been paid off by Procter &amp; Gamble, which made the soybean and palm oil blend Crisco, among other household products.</p><p>In a statement, the American Heart Association said it had “strict standards in place to protect against conflicts of interest,” and it denied any bias or influence from Procter &amp; Gamble. Though it did acknowledge receiving a $1.5 million donation from listeners of a radio program that was sponsored by the company.</p><p>Then, in 2016, scientists led by an investigator from the National Institutes of Health <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i1246" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published an analysis</a> of previously unpublished data gathered from Minnesota mental hospitals and nursing homes between 1968 and 1973. It concluded that patients with higher cholesterol levels (from diets rich in saturated animal fats) <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/a-decades-old-study-rediscovered-challenges-advice-on-saturated-fat/" title="">were no more likely to develop heart disease or die</a> than those with lower levels (from diets rich in unsaturated fats from corn oil).</p><p>But that study had a lot of limitations, including that it relied on decades-old records that may have lacked key information about the patients’ health — such as whether they smoked, took drugs or already had heart disease — which could have affected the results. Critics of the study also say that the participants weren’t followed for a long enough time for researchers to understand any effects on cardiovascular health.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Studies conducted that long ago weren’t always held to the same careful standards that govern scientific research today, Dr. Klatt said.</p><p>Dr. Christopher Ramsden, who led the 2016 study, does not think that we should be eating more saturated fat based on its results. Instead, his takeaway is that nutrition research can be messy, and that we should always be cautious when interpreting its findings.</p><p>And, he added, “there are so many nuances and complexities with these oils.” The term “plant oils” includes a wide range of products with very different nutrient compositions, he said. “Some of that’s been really oversimplified.”</p><p>Mr. Burgess, the restaurant owner in Rhode Island, calls himself “a taco guy, not a science guy.” He doesn’t pretend to know more than cardiologists or dietitians do. He also says his choice to replace seed oils with beef tallow has nothing to do with politics — and he’d like to keep it that way.</p><p>Still, Mr. Burgess feels confident that he is doing a service to his community by offering them tallow fries — so confident, in fact, that he’s been paying twice as much for beef fat as he used to pay for canola oil. Eventually, he said, he might need to adjust his menu prices to offset the cost. But he said he doesn’t want that to be a barrier for doing what he thinks is right.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Nutrition experts say that while the health risks of beef tallow are undeniable, debating the relative benefits of frying with seed oils versus beef tallow is the wrong way to think about the issue.</p><p>We know that eating fried food is bad for your health, regardless of which oil you use, Dr. Klatt said. “This is kind of a moot point,” he added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>March 20, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the nature of a $1.5 million payment the American Heart Association received.
