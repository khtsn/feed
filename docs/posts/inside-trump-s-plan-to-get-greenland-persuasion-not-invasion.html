But Mr. Trump has made clear his determination to control it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We need Greenland for national security and even international security, and we’re working with everybody involved to try and get it,” he said in an address to Congress last month.</p><p>“One way or the other, we’re going to get it,” Mr. Trump added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Denmark’s leaders and some residents are furious over President Trump’s talk of buying or seizing the island.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christian Klindt Soelbeck/Ritzau Scanpix Denmark, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The White House’s National Security Council has met several times to put Mr. Trump’s words into action, and recently sent specific instructions to multiple arms of the government, according to a U.S. official.</p><p>The plan’s full details are unclear. But despite Mr. Trump’s allusions to the possible use of force, the deliberations led by the security council never seriously considered military options, the official said.</p><p>The policy instead emphasizes persuasion over coercion, and features a public relations effort aimed at convincing Greenland’s population of 57,000 that they should ask to join the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s advisers have discussed using advertising and social media campaigns to sway public opinion on the island, according to another person briefed on the matter.</p><p>It may be an uphill battle. In an election last month, an opposition political party that favors quick independence and closer ties with the United States finished in second place but with just a quarter of the vote.</p><p>The U.S. messaging campaign will include an unlikely appeal to Greenlanders’ shared heritage with the native Inuit people of Alaska, nearly 2,500 miles away, the official said.</p><p>Greenland’s Inuit population is descended from people who migrated from Alaska hundreds of years ago, and the island’s official language is <a href="https://www.arctictoday.com/how-language-links-alaskas-arctic-to-greenland/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">derived from Inuit dialects</a> that originated in Arctic Canada.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Michael Waltz, the U.S. national security adviser, and his wife, Julia Nesheiwat, in Greenland last month.

And explaining a significant expenditure to American voters as Mr. Trump has tasked the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, with slashing the federal government by $1 trillion might be tough.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s interest in Greenland is not new: He was serious enough in his first term to charge national security officials with exploring the idea. But after he started discussing it publicly, Greenland officials balked and Mr. Trump did not pursue the idea, which was treated as a wild fantasy.</p><p>Since his second election last fall, Mr. Trump has renewed his desire with greater fervor. “Let’s get it done,” he has demanded of aides.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“President Trump believes Greenland is a strategically important location, and is confident Greenlanders would be better served protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region,” said the National Security Council spokesman, Brian Hughes.</p><p>Mr. Hughes noted that Mr. Waltz and Vice President JD Vance had recently visited Greenland and “laid out the important case for a partnership between Greenland and the United States to establish long-term peace at home and shared prosperity abroad.”</p><p>Some analysts say the idea of incorporating Greenland into the United States, or at least developing much closer ties with the island, is less absurd than it might sound.</p><p>That is largely because of climate change, which is thawing resource-rich areas and making them more commercially viable. Warmer temperatures have also opened new sea routes through the Arctic for commercial shipping — as well as for Chinese and Russian military vessels.</p><p>But Mr. Trump’s vows to control Greenland “one way or another” sound to much of the world like raw imperialism, along with his talk of retaking the Panama Canal and even annexing Canada. If the administration’s persuasion efforts fail, it seems quite possible that Mr. Trump will escalate his tactics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Several U.S. presidents have considered trying to acquire Greenland. The Truman administration, rattled by Nazi threats to the island during World War II, offered Denmark the equivalent of $1 billion for it in 1946.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark has condemned the Trump administration’s “pressure and threats.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Denmark has exercised varying forms of control over Greenland for centuries and accepted it as a part of its kingdom in 1953. Today, Greenland manages its own domestic affairs with a budget subsidized up to <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/seizing-greenland-worse-bad-deal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">60 percent by Denmark</a>, which also manages its defense and foreign policy. Many of Greenland’s leaders support independence, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/greenland-election.html" title="">but differ on how soon that should happen</a> and whether to move closer to the United States.</p><p>For their part, Denmark’s leaders are shocked and furious over Mr. Trump’s talk of buying or seizing the island, and they insist that Greenlanders must freely determine their own fate. During a visit to Greenland last week, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark condemned the Trump administration’s “pressure and threats,” saying that “you cannot annex another country.”</p><p>Amid Denmark’s fierce resistance, the Trump administration is turning to direct courtship of Greenlanders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Addressing the people of Greenland during his address to Congress, Mr. Trump said, “We strongly support your right to determine your own future and, if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.”</p><p>“We will keep you safe,” he said. “We will make you rich.”</p><p>Mr. Vance struck a similar note on March 28 during a visit to a U.S. military base on the island.</p><p>Speaking to reporters there, Mr. Vance predicted that Greenlanders would “choose, through self-determination, to become independent of Denmark, and then we’re going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vice President JD Vance predicted during a visit to Greenland that the island would choose “to become independent of Denmark.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Jim Watson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Mr. Trump and his senior officials have not yet publicly drawn connections between Greenland’s Inuit population and American Inuit in Alaska, as envisioned in the plan approved by the National Security Council.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>But that dynamic was noted in December by Robert O’Brien, who served as one of Mr. Trump’s first-term national security advisers.</p><p>Denmark, Mr. O’Brien said in an interview with Fox News, “can let us buy Greenland from it, and Greenland can become part of Alaska. I mean, the native people in Greenland are very closely related to the people of Alaska, and we’ll make it a part of Alaska.”</p><p>It is unclear how powerfully that message will resonate on the island. While Alaskans share in the profits of their state’s oil wealth in the form of annual checks to residents, its Inuit people endure disproportionate poverty and poor health.</p><p>Danish leaders argue that the U.S. pressure campaign is already damaging America’s post-World War II alliance with Denmark.</p><p>“We have looked up to you,” Ms. Frederiksen said of the United States during her visit to Greenland this month. “You have inspired us. You have stood guard over the free world.”</p><p>“But,” she added, “when you demand to take over a part of the kingdom’s territory — when we are subjected to pressure and threats — what are we to think of the country we have admired for so many years?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Crowley covers the State Department and U.S. foreign policy for The Times.
