<p><strong>What was the biggest issue that affected the team during that middle stretch of the series? When did it happen specifically and how much did that affect the team&#39;s subsequent showings at the latter stages of the series?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>alecks: &#34;I mean this this happened a lot this year, but we win the first map but on the second map, we overcompensate by being too careful or too aggressive. I think this time we were too careful. I think we can take a little bit more risk. I think we try to reduce risk because we just don&#39;t want to want to lose. The side effect of that is you become too readable and you become too careful. Momentum is with EDG, they came with a comp that they&#39;ve never played before, even though we did some research on it, it&#39;s still hard to play against.&#34;</p>

<p><strong>This year Paper Rex has had lots of ups and downs. What would you say is the biggest thing you&#39;ve learned from this 2024 season?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>d4v41: &#34;I think a lot of teams are getting much better compared to last year. I think last year it was easier to read and punish teams with traps and stuff, but I think this year people are getting so much smarter.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>On Lotus, we saw you take two quick timeouts within five rounds. What was the thought process behind the back-to-back timeouts?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>alecks: &#34;We were just trying to calm down. The first time, I was trying to figure out what we can do about the A site. I think I told them the wrong thing, I think we should&#39;ve played a little more defensive, but I told them to try and fight them. That pretty much cost us the game.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Given this is given the fact that this is the sixth time PRX has faced EDG, what were some of the challenges that EDG threw upon Paper Rex for today&#39;s match, and how did it affect the team&#39;s showing today?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>f0rsakeN: &#34;I would say last time we were crazier than them, but now I think they just became crazier than us. On Lotus, their comp is so strong. They got us in terms of prep and stuff, and we just couldn&#39;t handle it well. I think overall EDG are a really strong team, they come from a strong region. I can&#39;t say anything, but they did well today.&#34;</p>
