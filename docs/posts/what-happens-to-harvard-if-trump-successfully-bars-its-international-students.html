			<p>I don&#39;t think that comparison is very fair. ScreaM didn&#39;t just have one bad tournament, he had an entire year in which he was bad. Yeah, sure, while IGLing, but that was also self inflicted.</p>
<p>Aspas played two series at this event, where he was obviously really really bad, and yeah probably worse than ScreaM ever was. But like, get real, nobody was calling ScreaM washed after Lock in. People were calling him washed when KC were playing like the worst team in the world for an entire season, and he was not really doing much individually either.</p>
<p>Plus aspas has just shown himself to be a much more complete Valorant player at multiple international events, has had way more success with his teams, and has also shown consistently good performances across three different teams, all three of which by the way were complete dogshit without him. </p>
<p>Just to explain what I mean by complete Valorant player: ScreaM is really good mechanically, I don&#39;t think anyone would seriously argue against that. Maybe even with potential to be the best in the world at just shooting gun. But can you remember a single piece of util from ScreaM, like ever? (Okay, I can remember a certain molly, so let&#39;s say a single <em>good</em> piece of util) </p>
<p>He&#39;s been shining at just shooting, but that&#39;s just not good enough to be considered a good Valorant player in the Lord&#39;s year of 2025. Aspas has not just been aim diffing people, but also using his util well and reading situations well. ScreaM&#39;s mechanics were good enough in 2021 when Reyna was still meta, and he was fine on Jett, but nowadays, you need more than that, and he&#39;s never really shown anything particularly impressive (hence, washed).</p>		</div></div>
