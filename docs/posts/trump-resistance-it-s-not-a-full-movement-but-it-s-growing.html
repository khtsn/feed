Corporations and executives rushed to curry favor. Even some Democrats made overtures to Mr. Trump, as he and his allies boasted that they had popular opinion on their side.</p><p>But just over 100 days into his second term, seeds of dissent to Mr. Trump’s agenda, governing style and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-100-days-president-power-law.html" title="">expansion of executive power</a> have grown in fits and starts across the country. The opposition is sturdier than it once appeared.</p><p>Demonstrations have increased in size and frequency. Town halls have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/republicans-congress-town-halls-trump.html" title="">unruly</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/nyregion/mike-lawler-town-hall-trump.html" title="">combative</a>, pushing many Republican lawmakers to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/gop-town-hall.html" title="">avoid facing voters</a> altogether. And collective efforts by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/university-leaders-letter-trump.html" title="">universities</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/unions-cities-nonprofits-sue-block-trump-workforce-cuts-2025-04-29/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nonprofit groups</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/business/economy/government-union-trump-musk.html" title="">unions</a> and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/law-firms-perkins-coie-trump.html" title="">some law firms</a> have slowly started to push back against the administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“There is a momentum developing,” said Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat who first ran for office in 2018 because of his revulsion to Mr. Trump’s first term. “Now, I feel like there are people standing up and speaking out and taking up and seeing that this is the right thing to do, that it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”</p><p>A national movement has not yet flowered: The opposition lacks a leader, a central message or shared goals beyond a rejection of Mr. Trump. Even as some Democrats become more aggressive, their <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/16/politics/cnn-poll-democrats/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deeply unpopular</a> party is struggling to articulate a unified line of attack — or much of a strategy at all, apart from hoping the president’s approval ratings continue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls.html" title="">to fall</a>.</p><p>Vanita Gupta, who was associate attorney general during the Biden administration, said Democrats in Congress were largely following, rather than leading, the opposition to Mr. Trump.</p><p>“There was a feeling of despair early on that he had all the levers and nobody was standing up, but that momentum has changed,” she said. “People may not understand what members of Congress are doing, but lawyers, advocates and regular people are challenging the administration.”</p><p>Still, many of Mr. Trump’s opponents worry that what is happening is not nearly enough to stop what they fear is a slide toward authoritarianism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We seem to be facing the destruction of the United States,” said Jason Stanley, a Yale professor and an expert on fascism. “I don’t see anyone articulating that this is an attack on what it means to be American, on the very idea of America, and it’s an emergency.”</p><h2 id="link-5da7ba9d">Combat in the Courts</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Over 350 lawsuits have been filed against Mr. Trump’s agenda, with several cases already reaching the Supreme Court.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump is still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/28/us/trump-100-days-actions.html" title="">barreling ahead</a>. He has reshaped foreign and domestic policy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-defy-courts.html" title="">threatened open defiance</a> of the courts, ripped apart the federal government and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-biden-law-firms-revenge.html" title="">retaliated</a> against perceived enemies.</p><p>White House aides dismissed the opposition against him as coming from Democrats and “superficial paid ‘detractors.’”</p><p>“They are losing everywhere, and they will never match the organic enthusiasm behind his movement,” said Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman. “While Democrats throw attacks at the wall to see what sticks, President Trump is quickly delivering on his campaign promises with over 140 executive orders to date.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Those orders are being met with a historic flood of lawsuits, more than 350 in all. As of this week, at least 123 court rulings <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/trump-administration-lawsuits.html" title="">have paused some of the administration’s moves</a>, according to a New York Times analysis.</p><p>“You’re seeing the courts really hold as a front line in the rule of law,” said Skye Perryman, the chief executive of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/democracy-forward-trump-administration.html" title="">Democracy Forward</a>, a liberal-leaning legal group that has filed 59 challenges to the Trump administration. </p><p>The plaintiffs, Ms. Perryman said, include public school districts, religious groups, small-business owners, doctors and even Republicans fired by the president. The pushback, she said, “is transcending typical politics.”</p><p>Beyond the courts, Mr. Trump’s opponents have limited options. Republicans control Congress and have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-republicans-congress-power.html" title="">abandoned their role</a> as a check on Mr. Trump. Democrats have full power over just 15 state governments, versus 23 for Republicans.</p><p>Unlike in Mr. Trump’s first term, he is now using his official powers to reach deep into American life and culture, targeting universities, law firms, nonprofit groups and broadcast networks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>His divide-and-conquer strategy has won key successes: Some targets, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/law-firms-deals-trump.html" title="">top law firms</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html" title="">Columbia University</a>, have given in to his demands. Others, like the Democratic fund-raising platform ActBlue, have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/actblue-democrat-fundraising-resignations.html" title="">consumed by chaos</a>.</p><p>But sectors that fear being targeted have begun pursuing a more collective approach. Nonprofit groups and charitable foundations have formed organizations to share best practices for legal defense and protecting their finances. More than 400 higher education leaders have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/us/trump-university-presidents.html" title="">signed a letter</a> condemning “political interference” in universities.</p><p>“The people who are going to lead the next steps in the resistance movement and opposition to Trump are not the ones trying to get the band back together from 2017,” said Cole Leiter, the executive director of Americans Against Government Censorship, a new group of progressive organizations and labor unions opposing Mr. Trump. “We are setting up new coalitions.”</p><p>Colleges grew much more willing to oppose Mr. Trump openly after Harvard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/harvard-lawsuit-trump-administration.html" title="">sued his administration</a>, according to Michael S. Roth, the president of Wesleyan University.</p><p>“At first, I think everybody was pretty shocked at the scale and the rapidity of this assault on basic American freedoms,” he said. “Now, I think people don’t want to be left off that list. They don’t want be seen as collaborators with authoritarianism.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-61444132">A Newly Skeptical Public</h2><p>Mr. Trump’s aggressive pursuit of his agenda has come at a political cost.</p><p>Polls show that his approval rating is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/27/trump-poll-approval-rating-100-days/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">historically low for a president</a> so early in a term, with majorities of voters saying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-poll-approval.html" title="">he has “gone too far”</a> and is overreaching with his powers. Some of the frustration is also economic: His ever-shifting tariffs have raised expectations of a recession and tanked consumer confidence.
