In September, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/europe/france-husband-rape-drug-trial-mazan.html" title="">51 men went on trial in nearby Avignon</a>, most charged with the aggravated rape of Ms. Pelicot, 71.</p><p>Some 15 of the defendants, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/europe/france-rape-trial-dominique-pelicot.html" title="">Dominique Pelicot, Ms. Pelicot’s ex-husband</a>, have pleaded guilty. The rest have said they had sex with her but contest the rape charges. Most argue they were lured into the couple’s bedroom by her husband, with a promise of a threesome, and were led to believe she was pretending to sleep or was sleeping as part of the couple’s sex fantasy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The trial has rattled the country, raising profound and disturbing questions about relations between men and women, and the prevalence of rape.</p><p>No place has been as shaken as Mazan, 21 miles northeast of Avignon, with a population of 6,300.</p><p>Here, the story is not just horrifying; it feels oppressively personal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Pelicot, center, with her lawyers, outside of the courthouse in Avignon, France, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christophe Simon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It’s not on the other side of the world,” said Elisabeth Koenig, 72, who lives a few blocks from the couple’s former home, which she used to pass regularly walking her dog. “It’s at my home that this happened. It feels a bit like it’s in our family.”</p><p>A few weeks ago, she drove to Avignon with her granddaughter, to spend the day in the courthouse watching the trial. She left “red as a poppy” with fury, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It’s a catastrophe,” she said. She said she imagined the horror of learning of a family member’s “harming my children or my grandchildren like that.” Ms. Koenig added, “It feels personal, this story.”</p><p>About 30 percent of Mazan’s residents are retired, drawn by the mild temperatures, quaint village feel and access to big-city amenities and culture nearby. That’s what drew the Pelicots in 2013, when they moved from the Paris area soon after Ms. Pelicot retired from her management job at a large French company.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>They rented a pretty, pale yellow bungalow on a cul-de-sac, with a pool and lush garden, where their children and grandchildren gathered for long summer vacations together. It was just a 15- minute walk from the historic part of town, with its shops and cafes.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Musicians playing this month at a Saturday market in Mazan.

But many dismissed them as exaggerated, or even simply impossible. This is a small town, where everyone is separated by no more than two degrees, not a big city, where horrible things happen, many thought.</p><p>“We imagined it could happen elsewhere but not here,” said Anne Pinna, 57, who joined with some 500 people at a recent march from the town to a nearby horse farm, which had organized the event in support of Ms. Pelicot and other victims of rape and violence. “We are a village of families.”</p><p>Only three of the defendants, including Mr. Pelicot, were from Mazan. Most of the rest lived within a 40-miles radius — close enough that many locals know one or two.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“I’ve cut ties,” Ms. Pinna said of one man she knew. “I find it so disgusting, I don’t even want to hear what he says. There is no excuse.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>About 500 people marching this month in support of Ms. Pelicot in Mazan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>During the police investigation, the suspect list grew to 83. But the police were only able to identify and track down just over 50.</p><p>The rest were never found, stirring an uneasy suspicion in the stomachs of many in town.</p><p>“I admit that when I’m at the post office or elsewhere, I say to myself, ‘Well, this guy, I wonder if he went to see Madame Pelicot,’” said Ms. Koenig, a retired manager.</p><p>At the Saturday market in front of City Hall recently, Frédérique Imbs tucked the leeks she had just bought into her bag and looked up, past the musicians playing guitar and bass in the distance. “How can people get to that place?” she asked, before adding, “Maybe even one of those men in front of us.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The trial and its daily revelations have also caused political upheaval in Mazan.</p><p>In a clumsy attempt to protect the town’s reputation, Mayor Louis Bonnet t<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvpd7zyprdo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">old the BBC</a> last month that “it would have been much worse” if Mr. Pelicot “had killed his wife,” adding that she would be able to rebuild her life, because she was not dead.</p><p>The interview drew a backlash, and he <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VilleMazan/posts/pfbid05PLqRUa7zqxKkuHicGSgeWDCjapq8c5C9D2LLzj1sRRnB4fMzsA6mXBiKYu2R9qVl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later apologized</a>, saying he had been besieged by journalists, many looking to smear the town, he said, and “in the relentless media pressure” had chosen the wrong words. Still, the reaction was swift.</p><p>“As an elected official, and above all as a woman, I cannot understand his comments in any way, much less tolerate them,” said Eve Gallas, among the opposition councilors calling for the mayor to resign. “I have the impression that he never sought to support Madame Pelicot and her family.”</p><p>In the face of the criticism, Mr. Bonnet recently took some time off, offering no date for returning to work. A month after the BBC article, he has put out a new statement doubling down on his comments about journalists and adding that Ms. Pelicot should be respected for her courage and that all of Mazan supported her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The courthouse in Avignon was often surrounded by Ms. Pelicot’s supporters during the trial.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Many are upset that their hometown is now linked to this terrible story, and that the national newspapers have sections on their home pages about the “Mazan rapes.”</p><p>“There are other repercussions that will endure,” said Christophe Simonini, a local apiarist and olive farmer, selling olive oil and honey at the Saturday market.</p><p>At the recent march in support of Ms. Pelicot, through an idyllic landscape of vineyards and olive trees, many in the crowd echoed the shock and horror that have pervaded the country watching this trial, as well as a budding hope that it would somehow herald a profound societal change for France.</p><p>Near the back of the march, two friends carrying white roses said they didn’t know Ms. Pelicot before she packed up in a hurry and left the house that had become a crime scene, and the town, forever.</p><p>But they spoke about her as if they knew her. They said they admired her for her dignity and for her courage to allow an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/world/europe/france-rape-trial-pelicot-testimony.html" title="">open trial</a> as a public service. She was a grandmother, as they are. And she came from Mazan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“I hope she is really supported after the trial,” said Anne Chartier, 66, a retired midwife. “She will need to rebuild herself.”</p><p>Her friend Dany Baychère, 76, concurred: “She might collapse, the poor thing. She is being offered flowers and applauded in court. But afterwards, there will be an emptiness.”</p><p>She added, “It will not be easy for her.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A local feminist group putting up a sign in support of Ms. Pelicot in Avignon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Ségolène Le Stradic<!-- --> contributed reporting from Paris.</p></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>4</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>‘It Feels Personal’: A Town’s Rape Trial Hits Painfully Close to Home<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
