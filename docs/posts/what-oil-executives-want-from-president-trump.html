Tariffs are making essential materials like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/energy-environment/trump-oil-steel-tariffs.html" title="">steel pipe more expensive</a> while also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/business/inflation-consumer-sentiment.html" title="">rattling consumer confidence</a>.</p><p>Oil prices have fallen around 14 percent since just before Mr. Trump took office, to less than $67 a barrel. Peter Navarro, a senior White House aide, has talked about the benefits of oil that sells for just $50 a barrel. At such prices, companies operating in wide swaths of the American oil patch would lose money drilling new wells.</p><p>Here are some of the industry’s priorities:</p><h2 id="link-54022da5">Tariffs</h2><p>U.S. refineries buy oil from Canada and Mexico, transform it into fuels like gasoline, then export those more valuable products. These trade ties were formed over decades and would be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/business/energy-environment/trump-tariffs-canada-oil.html" title="">difficult and expensive to untangle</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump announced 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico with a lower, 10 percent rate for Canadian energy products. But this month he delayed the implementation of those tariffs on most goods, including energy imported under a North American trade agreement Mr. Trump negotiated during his first term. That reprieve is set to end in early April.</p><p>The 25 percent tariff on imported steel that took effect earlier this month is also a big concern for executives. The metal is used in everything from pipelines to wells, and it is getting more expensive because of the tariff. Some executives remain hopeful that they will able to secure exemptions, though Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/economy/trump-tariffs-exceptions.html" title="">rebuffed that idea</a>.</p><h2 id="link-6a9ffeb0">Permitting Reform</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chris Wright, right, the secretary of energy, giving a speech at the CERAWeek by S&amp;P Global conference in Houston last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kaylee Greenlee/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Energy companies are pushing Mr. Trump and Congress to ease permitting rules to make it easier to build transmission lines, pipelines and other infrastructure. Many companies want to make it more difficult for states to block proposed projects and for environmentalists and others to tie them up in court.</p><p><strong>“</strong>If you want more energy in the United States and you want more investment in the United States, we’ve got to be able to build things again. I’ve heard that repeatedly,” Chris Wright, the new U.S. energy secretary, said last week, summarizing feedback from executives he met at the CERAWeek by S&amp;P Global conference in Houston. “My answer is: Give me specifics. What permit? What was the thing?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-1ccacc83">Tax Credits</h2><p>Some oil and gas companies want to preserve clean energy tax credits for producing hydrogen and renewable fuels, as well as capturing and storing carbon dioxide, the leading cause of climate change.</p><p>Vicki Hollub, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, a large U.S. oil company that has been building a carbon capture plant in West Texas, is pushing to preserve federal incentives for removing the greenhouse gas from the air. That tax credit is known as 45Q based on its place in the tax code.</p><p>“To accelerate the technology at the pace that the U.S. needs it to accelerate to start having a positive impact on our energy independence, we need 45Q to happen and to stay in place,” Ms. Hollub said at CERAWeek.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Rebecca F.
