    <h1>Trump Administration Cites Alien Enemies Act as It Plans New Extraditions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the announcement on Monday, the administration again criticized the judge who issued that order, James E. Boasberg. “We would have already removed these violent gang members to Chile to face justice were it not for the nationwide injunction imposed by a single judge,” said Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general. He added, “We hope common sense and justice will prevail.”</p><p>The extradition announcement comes as courts are wrestling with President Trump’s invocation of the law this month to send more than 100 Venezuelans to a giant prison complex in El Salvador. Civil rights groups have challenged the deportations, saying the men did not receive due process, and contest the accusation that they are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.</p><p>In invoking the 1798 law meant to expel invaders, the Trump administration has argued that the gang acts in coordination with Venezuela’s ruling party and is therefore subject to summary arrest and deportation. Civil rights groups have argued in court that the administration is misusing the law and violating immigrants’ rights.</p><p>The Justice Department said one of the men was currently in a Texas prison and wanted in Chile for extortion, kidnapping resulting in homicide and criminal association. The other two men, who are wanted on kidnapping charges, were in U.S. custody, officials said.</p></div></div>
