    <h1>Israel Says It Killed Local Hamas Commander in West Bank</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Israeli military said on Tuesday that its forces had killed a Hamas military commander in the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank as it expanded on a series of raids that have displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians.</p><p>Israeli soldiers killed Aysar al-Saadi, the head of a local group of Hamas militants, in a shootout, the Israeli military said in a statement. The raid took place as Israeli forces “expanded the counterterrorism operation&#34; in the northern West Bank “to additional areas in Jenin,” the military said.</p><p>Hamas mourned Mr. al-Saadi’s death, calling him a commander in its armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades. It was unclear how far his killing would go to subdue the militants: The Israeli military said late last year that its forces had killed one of his predecessors, Waseem Hazem, only to see the groups persist.</p><p>In late January, Israel launched a major operation targeting Palestinian militants, storming neighborhoods in cities like Jenin and Tulkarm. About 40,000 Palestinians have fled their homes, <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/official-statements/large-scale-forced-displacement-west-bank-impacts-40000-people" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the United Nations</a>, often to nearby towns and villages where they have been sheltering for weeks, in the largest wave of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/world/middleeast/west-bank-palestinian-displacement.html" title="">displacement in the territory in decades</a>.</p></div></div>
