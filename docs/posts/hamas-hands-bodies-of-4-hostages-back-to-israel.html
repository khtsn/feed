    <h1>Hamas Hands Bodies of 4 Hostages Back to Israel</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hamas said on Thursday it had handed over the bodies of four Israelis abducted during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel — including a woman and her two young children — in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>Large crowds had gathered near the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis to watch the choreographed handoff staged by Hamas. Rifle-toting gunmen were deployed around a stage on which four black coffins — each bearing the image of a deceased hostage — had been placed.</p><p>Officials with the International Committee for the Red Cross placed the coffins in waiting white vehicles. The Israeli government later confirmed that the Red Cross had brought them to waiting Israeli forces inside Gaza.</p><p>Miles away, Israelis watched the scene in horror and dismay.</p><p>The four dead hostages had been identified by Hamas as Shiri Bibas, 32, her redheaded young children Ariel, 4, and Kfir, nine months old; and Oded Lifshitz, 84. The bodies are expected to undergo forensic testing in Israel to confirm their identities.</p></div></div>
