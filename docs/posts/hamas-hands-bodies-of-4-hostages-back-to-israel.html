Triumphant music thumped in the background.</p><p>Miles away, Israelis watched the scene unfold in horror and anguish, a sharp contrast to the catharsis evoked by the recent releases of hostages who had survived their ordeal. Israel’s leaders had vowed to topple Hamas and bring home the roughly 250 hostages the militant group and its allies abducted during the 2023 attack.</p><p>But Mr. Netanyahu has also been criticized by many Israelis for not agreeing to a cease-fire sooner that might have saved some of the captives who died in Gaza. Hamas’s shows of force during the exchanges over the past few weeks have also revealed that the group is very much still in power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Israel and Hamas are now in the final weeks of a 42-day cease-fire that began in late January. As part of the truce, Hamas agreed to turn over 25 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for more than 1,500 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hamas’s shows of force during the hostage and prisoner exchanges over the past few weeks have revealed that the group is very much still in power in Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In exchange for the bodies, Israel is expected to free women and minors from Gaza who were detained during the war, mostly without formal charges.</p><p>Two Israeli officials said the detainees were slated to be freed on Saturday, in part to allow time for Israel to conduct forensic testing and identify the bodies. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>On Thursday, as rain trickled down in Gaza, officials with the International Committee of the Red Cross — which has served as the go-between during the exchanges — placed the four coffins in white vehicles. Israel later confirmed they had brought the boxes to Israeli forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Hamas identified the four as Shiri Bibas, 32 at the time of her abduction, her redheaded young children Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9 months old when they were captured; and Oded Lifshitz, 83 when he was taken hostage. All four were abducted during Hamas’s Oct. 7 surprise attack — the deadliest day in Israeli history — in which roughly 1,200 people were killed.</p><p>Israel’s relentless campaign against Hamas in Gaza quickly followed, killing tens of thousands of Palestinians and leaving much of the enclave in ruins. Hamas has said the four hostages were also killed in Israeli airstrikes, which Israeli officials have yet to confirm.</p><p>Isaac Herzog, the Israeli president, said “there are no words” for the agony roiling the Israeli public.</p><p>“Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters,” Mr. Herzog <a href="https://x.com/Isaac_Herzog/status/1892489046342955237" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>. “On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The captives were kidnapped by Palestinian militants from Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities during the Hamas-led attack. Roughly a quarter of the village’s 400-odd residents were either killed or taken hostage during the assault.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The four bodies that Hamas said it released are expected to undergo forensic testing in Israel to confirm their identities.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Among the abducted were Ms. Bibas, her husband, Yarden Bibas, and their children, Ariel and Kfir. In footage from the scene that is now seared into Israel’s national memory, a terrified Ms. Bibas — covered with a blanket — could be seen clutching the two children to her chest. </p><p>In November 2023, Hamas published a statement announcing the deaths of Ms. Bibas and the two children. The group also published a propaganda video featuring a sobbing Mr. Bibas responding to the news. Human rights groups <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/10/gaza-hostage-videos-outrage-personal-dignity" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have said</a> such videos amount to a war crime.</p><p>Mr. Lifshitz, a retired journalist and peace activist, was taken alongside his wife, Yocheved Lifshitz. Hamas later freed her for what it said were “humanitarian reasons” but declined to release her husband. Before the war, Mr. Lifshitz had volunteered to drive Gazans seeking medical treatment in Israel to hospitals.</p><p>Both Israelis and Palestinians have seen emotional homecomings in recent weeks. Israeli hostages have reunited with their families after many months in Hamas’s warren of underground tunnels. Palestinian prisoners — some convicted of militancy, others detained without charge — have embraced loved ones outside of Israeli prisons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>On Saturday, Hamas is expected to free the last six living hostages in the first phase of the cease-fire with Israel in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, including some serving life sentences for attacks against Israelis. The remains of four more hostages will be released the next weekend.</p><p>But the future of the truce after its first stage — which is set to expire in early March — is still shrouded in uncertainty.</p><p>Israel and Hamas have not agreed on terms to extend the agreement into a new phase that would conclusively end the war, free the remaining living hostages, and see a full withdrawal of Israeli forces. This week, the Qatari government — which is brokering the talks alongside Egypt and the United States — said negotiations on the matter had yet to formally begin.</p><p>President Trump has pressured both sides to clinch such a deal. But Israel has refused to countenance any Hamas control in Gaza going forward, while Hamas has shown little appetite for disbanding its battalions of armed fighters or sending its Gaza leaders into exile.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
