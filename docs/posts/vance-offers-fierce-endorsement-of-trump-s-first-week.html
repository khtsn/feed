While he harshly criticized the agency’s response to wildfires in California and to hurricanes in North Carolina, he said that FEMA had been hamstrung by “bureaucratic red tape and garbage” and that the proposal was mainly intended to “encourage us to reform the way that we deliver emergency response.”</p><p>For the most part, though, there was little space between Mr. Vance’s views and the president’s.</p><p>When pressed about how aggressively <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/trump-immigrants-deportation.html" title="">deportation campaigns</a> should unfold, Mr. Vance showed little appetite for restrictions, appearing to support Mr. Trump’s decision to end a longstanding policy that prevented immigration agents from entering schools and churches to arrest people.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
