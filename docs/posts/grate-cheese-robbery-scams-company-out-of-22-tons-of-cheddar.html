But theft? I mean, that just doesn’t happen.”</p><p>It all started in July. That’s when Neal’s Yard Dairy, a leading London cheese retailer, said that it had received a major order from what appeared to be a “legitimate wholesale distributor for a major French retailer.”</p><p>The company turned to Mr. Holden’s dairy farm and to two other cheese producers — Westcombe Dairy and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBl8KVKIDMS/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trethowan Brothers</a> — to fill the order, which, at 22 metric tons, was more than one could provide alone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Holden said that he was initially flattered. A French chain wanted to buy that much British cheese? And Cheddar, such a quintessentially British variety?</p><p>“We’d been going around, proudly, saying: ‘Guess what, a French supermarket is buying our cheese,’” Mr. Holden said, chuckling.</p><p>“We never thought that would happen,” he continued. “Well, turns out, it hasn’t.”</p><p>Neal’s Yard sent the cheese off in two shipments in September — and payment was due on Oct. 7, according to a partner in the company, David Lockwood. When the money had not come through a week later, Mr. Lockwood said, Neal’s Yard tried to chase up the payment but got no response.</p><p>“Basically, our contacts became uncontactable,” said Mr. Lockwood, who declined to share the correspondence with The New York Times.</p><p>The company went to the police in London on Oct. 21, “when we were certain we’d been scammed,” Mr. Lockwood added in a text message.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed that it had received a report about “the theft of a large quantity of cheese” from a company in Southwark, a borough in the southeastern part of the British capital where Neal’s Yard has a warehouse.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cutting and packing Cheddar at a dairy in Evercreech, southern England, last year. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeremie Souteyrat for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Criminals have <a href="https://www.cheeseprofessor.com/blog/5-top-cheese-heists" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hit the dairy industry</a> before. In 2015, the Italian police arrested a gang accused of stealing about <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/italian-police-busted-thieves-nabbing-875000-cheese-180956771/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$875,000 worth of Parmigiano-Reggiano</a>. The following year, thieves in Wisconsin stole a trailer with about <a href="https://www.nbc26.com/news/20000-pounds-of-cheese-stolen-in-oak-creek" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$46,000 of cheese</a>. More recently, thieves made off with about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/world/europe/cheese-theft-netherlands.html" title="">$23,000 of cheese</a> in the Netherlands.</p><p>But while “this kind of thing does happen in Italy a bit more,” said Patrick McGuigan, a British food writer who has written <a href="https://www.patrickmcguigan.com/books" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two books about cheese</a>, he added, “in the U.K., it’s very, very rare.”</p><p>Not unprecedented, though. In a cheese heist in Britain in 1998, thieves reportedly <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/183794.stm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made off with six tons of champion Cheddar</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Offloading the stolen cheese could prove difficult, Mr. McGuigan said. “It’s a bit like, you know, if you steal a Van Gogh painting, it’s quite hard to sell it, because everybody knows it’s a Van Gogh painting,” he explained.</p><p>The police are investigating the latest case. No arrests have been made. For now, the industry is urging vigilance. Jamie Oliver, a British celebrity chef, warned cheese enthusiasts to be “wary of suspiciously large quantities of premium Cheddar on the black market.”</p><p>“Remember, if the deal seems too gouda to be true, it probably is,” he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBjSklvMh8o/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on Instagram</a>. “Let’s find these cheese stealers.”</p><p>The cheese producers were mourning the loss on several levels.</p><p>“I feel like I knew each one individually,” said Todd Trethowan of the lost wheels of Cheddar his farm provided. “To think that it had gone missing, and that waste of effort, it was a blow.”</p><p>Mr. Lockwood said that Neal’s Yard had honored its payments to the three cheese makers. There are also the additional costs of the lost labor, packing and shipping.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He said that he did not think his company would recoup much from insurance. “Remember, we loaded it onto the truck,” he said. “We were scammed.”</p><p>But Mr. Lockwood said that the company was also trying to learn from the experience — and maybe look for a silver lining.</p><p>“It’d be a great action comedy,” he said. “Maybe we can sell the rights and get some of the money back.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
