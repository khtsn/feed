Staffed by Mr. Musk’s young aides, DOGE has bulldozed through federal agencies.</p><p>In its 52 days, the Trump administration has dealt crippling blows to several departments, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/irs-job-cuts.html" title="">Internal Revenue Service</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/agency-for-international-development" title="">U.S. Agency for International Development</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/us/politics/veterans-affairs-doge-cuts.html" title="">the Department of Veterans Affairs</a>.
