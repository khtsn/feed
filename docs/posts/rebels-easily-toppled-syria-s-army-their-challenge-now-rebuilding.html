The assault was over in a day when the Syrian soldiers retreated, said Abu Muhammad, a rebel fighter guarding the base.</p><p>The government soldiers left behind a filthy jumble of army life: clothes, blankets, gas masks and helmets, and empty tin cans. Living conditions were primitive, with no windows or doors — instead, sacks or sheets of tin roofing were fixed over openings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The base reflected the opportunity for a new government borne out of a well-prepared military campaign, bringing together different rebel groups, whose success surprised even its own fighters.

the Islamic State extremist group, which operates in parts of central Syria; and remnants of Mr. al-Assad’s security forces who have shown signs of resistance.</p><p>While the rebels are taking over security of the country and its borders, they are inheriting a devastated military infrastructure that will be hard to capitalize on or rebuild.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fighters for the Syrian National Army, which helped liberate the town of Tel Rifaat from Mr. al-Assad’s forces, warming themselves by a wood stove outside a makeshift military base in the town.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abu Muhammad, a grizzled rebel fighter who was guarding the tank base.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>A 10-day journey along the path of the rebels’ advance by a reporter and a photographer for The New York Times and a Syrian translator showed that the Syrian Army they defeated — and are now replacing — was so ill-equipped and demoralized that its soldiers had laid down their arms or fled in panic.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The rebels breached defenses that had held strong for years, encircling and assaulting military garrisons often without much of a fight. The tank base, which fell on the second day of the operation, was decrepit, its windowless buildings barricaded with a makeshift protection of tractor tires and metal drums filled with earth.</p><p>On other bases and checkpoints near the former front line, Syrian soldiers clearly lacked resources. They had dug a makeshift bunker inside a farm building, heaping rubble on top of sheets of corrugated iron to provide protection from shelling, and had patched up shell holes in the walls with a mixture of mud and straw.</p><p>“We started the operation thinking we would take only one village, and we took all of Syria,” said a Hayat Tahrir al-Sham fighter, Abu Aisha, with a wide grin.</p><p>The 24-year-old was hanging out with a fellow fighter, Abu Hamza, 25, in the central park of the city of Hama, lending his assault rifle to local youths to pose with it for photographs. Both men said they had been training and fighting since they were 15 and would readily join the national army.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The guardhouse of an abandoned Syrian military base near Aleppo, now occupied by Syrian rebel forces.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers who fled left behind a jumble of army life: clothes, blankets, helmets and empty tin cans.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Some of the fighting during the rebel offensive was intense. Abu Aisha said his commander and deputy commander were killed at a main intersection in the first days of the operation. Others were killed and wounded in airstrikes.</p><p>But rebel fighters said that they had encountered weaker resistance than in previous years of fighting. Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias on the ground, which in the past had provided much of the glue that held the Assad regime together, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-bashar-al-assad.html" title="">had been reduced in recent months</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-rebels-control.html" title="">Aleppo fell to the rebels on Nov. 30</a> after just three days of fighting.</p><p>A fabled city centered around an ancient citadel, Aleppo was the site of grueling fighting when the 2011 peaceful uprising spiraled into civil war. It had taken Mr. al-Assad four years to wrest control of the city from the rebels in 2016, and then only with the help of Iranian militias and Russian troops. Its sudden fall stunned the Syrian leadership.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The main square in Aleppo.

Few of them showed signs of fighting, such as being burned in explosions or bearing bloodstains from casualties.</p><p>There were some indications of panic. An armored personnel carrier had smashed into the corner of a house in a village, and a tank lay upside down where it that had crashed into a trench.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>As the rebels advanced, two soldiers, Mahmoud, 23, and his brother Mamdur, 26, serving in separate Syrian Army bases, prepared to desert.

He had wanted to continue his studies but was ordered into the military, where he received a salary of $10 a month. His brother was forced to stay in the army for five and a half years, he said.</p><p>The soldiers were happy to be home. The police officer was wary of the new group in charge.</p><p>But the rebel commander, Mr. al-Nahar, was optimistic.
