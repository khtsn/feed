The tank base, which fell on the second day of the operation, was decrepit, its windowless buildings barricaded with a makeshift protection of tractor tires and metal drums filled with earth.</p><p>On other bases and checkpoints near the former front line, Syrian soldiers clearly lacked resources. They had dug a makeshift bunker inside a farm building, heaping rubble on top of sheets of corrugated iron to provide protection from shelling, and had patched up shell holes in the walls with a mixture of mud and straw.</p><p>“We started the operation thinking we would take only one village, and we took all of Syria,” said a Hayat Tahrir al-Sham fighter, Abu Aisha, with a wide grin.</p><p>The 24-year-old was hanging out with a fellow fighter, Abu Hamza, 25, in the central park of the city of Hama, lending his assault rifle to local youths to pose with it for photographs.

Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias on the ground, which in the past had provided much of the glue that held the Assad regime together, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-bashar-al-assad.html" title="">had been reduced in recent months</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-rebels-control.html" title="">Aleppo fell to the rebels on Nov. 30</a> after just three days of fighting.</p><p>A fabled city centered around an ancient citadel, Aleppo was the site of grueling fighting when the 2011 peaceful uprising spiraled into civil war. It had taken Mr. al-Assad four years to wrest control of the city from the rebels in 2016, and then only with the help of Iranian militias and Russian troops.

Few of them showed signs of fighting, such as being burned in explosions or bearing bloodstains from casualties.</p><p>There were some indications of panic.

He had wanted to continue his studies but was ordered into the military, where he received a salary of $10 a month.
