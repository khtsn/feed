    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“In fact, when he filed Friday, our staff spent the entire weekend working to verify his signatures,” Mr. Thacker said. “He only needed about 42,000, and he got over 118,000.”</p><p>Those signatures, however, could be problematic. As The New York Times reported this week, two people familiar with the campaign’s operations said the signatures had been collected by a super PAC backing Mr. Kennedy, rather than the campaign itself. Federal law limits coordination between campaigns and outside organizations, and the move would most likely have opened the campaign up to legal complaints.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy began his presidential campaign last year as a Democrat, challenging President Biden. He later embarked on an independent campaign that unnerved both major parties, which feared that he would siphon critical support from their candidate.</p><p>In recent weeks, as his campaign’s money ran low, Mr. Kennedy’s support in national polls, once in the low double digits, plunged to about 5 percent. It was nowhere near sufficient to have a shot at victory, but still enough to potentially affect the results of the election, depending on his numbers in key swing states.</p><p>Simply trying to get his name on the ballot in states across the country has been an expensive and complicated effort. Mr. Kennedy’s campaign has spent millions of dollars on signature-gathering firms and other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/us/politics/rfk-jr-fundraising-ballot-access.html" title="">ballot-access expenses, largely bankrolled</a> by his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, a Silicon Valley investor who was once married to the Google co-founder Sergey Brin.</p></div></div>
