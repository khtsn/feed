In his leaked messages, Mr. Hegseth strongly criticized European nations describing them as “freeloading” and “pathetic.” </p><p>Typhoon jets using precision guided bombs took part in the mission on Tuesday, the ministry said in a statement. The target was “a cluster of buildings, used by the Houthis to manufacture drones of the type used to attack ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, located some 15 miles south of Sana,” the statement added, referring to the Yemeni capital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The ministry gave no details about potential casualties or damage, but said that there had been careful planning to reduce risk to civilians or nonmilitary infrastructure.</p><p>“The strike was conducted after dark, when the likelihood of any civilians being in the area was reduced yet further,” the statement added.</p><p>Since the fall of 2023, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/houthi-yemen-red-sea-attacks.html" title="">the Houthis have repeatedly attacked</a> commercial and naval ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in a campaign that they say is in solidarity with Palestinians under bombardment in Gaza.</p><p>Britain previously had taken part in joint strikes on Houthi targets ordered by former President Joseph R.
