The Israeli military issued fresh evacuation warnings just after dawn on Friday, and missiles began landing soon afterward — leveling at least one high-rise residential building that had been identified in the warnings, and sending a thick dust cloud through the surrounding streets.</p><p>There were no immediate reports of casualties. Most residents fled the Dahiya weeks ago when Israel’s bombing campaign began.</p><p>There were also signs that Israel’s ground invasion was broadening and that its troops were battling Hezbollah fighters deeper inside Lebanese territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Israeli military said in a statement on Thursday that its commandos were conducting ground operations against “several new enemy targets” in Lebanon. A senior Lebanese security official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters, said on Thursday that Israeli ground forces were operating around the town of Chamaa, roughly three miles from the border.</p><p>Hezbollah also said overnight that it had attacked Israeli soldiers near Tayr Harfa, a town immediately south of Chamaa that it had described earlier as part of its “secondary line” of defense, and where clashes had not been previously reported. On Friday, the group said it had fired rockets at Israeli troops on the outskirts of Talloussah, another town where fighting was not known to have occurred.</p><p>A widening Israeli offensive would undermine U.S. diplomatic efforts to stem the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-hezbollah.html" title="">The Biden administration has renewed a push</a> to contain the fighting after repeated rounds of shuttle diplomacy over the past year failed.</p><p>Although Israel’s military leadership had originally hoped to conduct a more limited ground operation that focused solely on the first line of Lebanese villages along Israel’s northern border, they have decided to slightly expand that range, Amir Avivi, a retired Israeli brigadier general, said in an interview. The reason, he said, was that Israeli military officials realized that they needed to do more to clear out Hezbollah’s military installations, and believed that a broader offensive could force the armed group into making a diplomatic settlement on terms more favorable to Israel, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“There’s an understanding that we need to ramp up the pressure and clear out a greater area, and that’s what they’re doing” General Avivi said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke rises after an Israeli airstrike in the Dahiya, south of Beirut, Lebanon, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hussein Malla/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But there has been no indication in public that Hezbollah or its patron, Iran, are willing to acquiesce to Israel’s demands, which include a withdrawal of the group from areas near the Israel-Lebanon border. While Hezbollah’s leaders and weapon stockpiles have been hard-hit, the group still poses a formidable threat, firing scores of rockets and drones into Israel daily and killing six Israeli soldiers on Wednesday in southern Lebanon.</p><p>A prominent Iranian official, Ali Larijani, met on Friday with Lebanese officials in Beirut to discuss cease-fire efforts, the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon said. Hezbollah is Iran’s most powerful regional proxy, and any diplomatic settlement would almost certainly be contingent on Tehran’s approval.</p><p>Asked to comment on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-hands-lebanon-draft-truce-proposal-two-political-sources-2024-11-14/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> that U.S. officials had given the Lebanese government a draft cease-fire proposal, Mr. Larijani, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said that his visit was not intended to “undermine” U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, according to Lebanon’s state-run news agency.</p><p>“We want to solve the problem,” said Mr. Larijani.</p><p>Earlier this month, Hezbollah’s new leader, Naim Qassem, called the U.S.-led efforts to stem the conflict with Israel futile, saying that the only way to end the war was “on the battlefield.” Still, he did not reject the potential for negotiations on suitable terms, noting that Israel must first end its offensive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We are ready for a long war,” he warned.</p><p>Efforts to reach a cease-fire are further complicated by the fact that, even if Hezbollah does agree to disarm in southern Lebanon, it is unclear how such an agreement would be enforced, or by whom. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/us-diplomacy-israel-lebanon.html" title="">U.N. resolution that ended the last major conflict in 2006</a> also called for Hezbollah to disarm along the border, but it has been considered a failure in the years since.</p><p>Israel has also insisted that any cease-fire deal preserve its right to attack Hezbollah again should the militant group violate the terms of a truce, a stance that both the Lebanese government and Hezbollah strongly oppose.</p><p>Israel began an intensified <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-lebanon-invasion-map.html" title="">military campaign</a> against Hezbollah in September, nearly a year after the group began firing rockets into Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli offensive has set off a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-displaced-hezbollah.html" title="">displacing nearly a quarter of the population</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/middleeast/lebanon-hospitals-israel-offensive.html" title="">buckling the country’s health system</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, the United States said it was opposed to Israel’s intensifying bombing campaign in the Dahiya. Asked at a regular news briefing about the latest Israeli strikes, a State Department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said, “We do not want to see these kinds of operations in Beirut, especially as it relates to densely populated areas.”</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Jerusalem.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
