The Israeli military issued new evacuation warnings just after dawn on Friday, and missiles began landing soon afterward, leveling at least one high-rise residential building that had been identified in the warnings and sending a thick dust cloud through the surrounding streets.</p><p>There were no immediate reports of casualties. Most residents fled the Dahiya weeks ago, when Israel’s bombing campaign began.</p><p>There were also signs that Israel’s ground invasion was broadening and that its troops were battling Hezbollah fighters deeper inside Lebanese territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Israeli military said on Thursday that its commandos were conducting ground operations against “several new enemy targets” in Lebanon. A senior Lebanese security official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters, said Israeli ground forces were operating around the town of Chamaa, roughly three miles from the border.</p><p>Hezbollah also said overnight that it had attacked Israeli soldiers near Tayr Harfa, a town south of Chamaa that it described as part of its “secondary line” of defense and where clashes had not been previously reported. On Friday, the group said it had fired rockets at Israeli troops on the outskirts of Talloussah, another town where fighting had not been previously reported.</p><p>A widening Israeli offensive would undermine U.S. diplomatic efforts to stem the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-hezbollah.html" title="">The Biden administration has renewed a push</a> to contain the fighting after rounds of shuttle diplomacy over the past year failed.</p><p>Although Israel’s military leaders originally hoped to conduct a limited ground operation that focused solely on the first line of Lebanese villages along Israel’s northern border, they decided to slightly expand that range, Amir Avivi, a retired Israeli brigadier general, said in an interview.</p><p>The reason, he said, was that Israeli military officials realized they needed to do more to clear out Hezbollah’s military installations and believed that a broader offensive could force the group into making a diplomatic settlement on terms favorable to Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“There’s an understanding that we need to ramp up the pressure and clear out a greater area, and that’s what they’re doing” Mr. Avivi said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An Israeli airstrike in the Dahiya, south of Beirut, Lebanon, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hussein Malla/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But there has been no public indication that Hezbollah or its patron, Iran, are willing to acquiesce to Israel’s demands, which include the group’s withdrawal from areas near the Israel-Lebanon border. While Hezbollah’s leaders and weapon stockpiles have been hit hard, the group still poses a formidable threat, firing rockets and drones into Israel daily and killing six Israeli soldiers on Wednesday in southern Lebanon.</p><p>A prominent Iranian official, Ali Larijani, met on Friday with Lebanese officials in Beirut to discuss cease-fire efforts, the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon said. Hezbollah is Iran’s most powerful regional proxy, and any diplomatic settlement would almost certainly be contingent on Tehran’s approval.</p><p>Asked to comment on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-hands-lebanon-draft-truce-proposal-two-political-sources-2024-11-14/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> that U.S. officials had given the Lebanese government a draft cease-fire proposal, Mr. Larijani, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said his visit was not intended to “undermine” U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, Lebanon’s state-run news agency reported.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We want to solve the problem,” Mr. Larijani said.</p><p>This month, Hezbollah’s leader, Naim Qassem, called the U.S.-led efforts to stem the conflict with Israel futile, saying that the only way to end the war was “on the battlefield.” Still, he did not reject the potential for negotiations on suitable terms, noting that Israel must first end its offensive.</p><p>“We are ready for a long war,” he warned.</p><p>Cease-fire efforts are further complicated by the fact that, even if Hezbollah agrees to disarm in southern Lebanon, it is unclear how such an agreement would be enforced and by whom. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/us-diplomacy-israel-lebanon.html" title="">U.N. resolution that ended the last major conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, in 2006</a>, also called for the group to disarm along the border, but it has been considered a failure.</p><p>Israel has also insisted that any cease-fire deal preserve its right to attack Hezbollah again should the group violate the terms of a truce, a stance that the Lebanese government and Hezbollah strongly oppose.</p><p>Israel began an intensified <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-lebanon-invasion-map.html" title="">military campaign</a> against Hezbollah in September, nearly a year after the group began firing rockets into Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli offensive set off a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-displaced-hezbollah.html" title="">displacing nearly a quarter of the population</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/middleeast/lebanon-hospitals-israel-offensive.html" title="">buckling the country’s health system</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, the United States said it was opposed to Israel’s bombing campaign in the Dahiya. Asked at a news briefing about the latest Israeli strikes, a State Department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said, “We do not want to see these kinds of operations in Beirut, especially as it relates to densely populated areas.”</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Jerusalem.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Euan Ward is a reporter contributing to The Times from Beirut.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward">More about Euan Ward</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump’s Middle East Picks:</strong> President-elect Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/huckabee-israel-witkoff-middle-east-us.html">emerging team</a> in the Middle East appears poised to push U.S. foreign policy into even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/israel-trump-administration.html">tighter accord with Israel’s far-right government</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Netanyahu’s Corruption Trial:</strong> An Israeli court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-trial.html">rejected a request</a> by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to delay testifying at his corruption trial, ruling that he must take the stand in December even as the country is at war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israel Strikes Humanitarian Zone in Gaza:</strong><strong> </strong>The Israeli military said it had been targeting a loaded weapons launcher in the area, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/world/middleeast/israel-airstrike-humanitarian-zone-gaza.html">where thousands of displaced people are sheltering in a tent camp</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leaked Documents:</strong> A C.I.A. official has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/israel-iran-leak.html">charged with disclosing classified documents</a> that appeared to show Israel’s plans to retaliate against Iran, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hostage Video:</strong> A militant group in Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/gaza-israeli-hostage-video-troufanov.html">released a video showing Sasha Troufanov</a>, an Israeli Russian dual citizen who has been held hostage since the Hamas-led attack on Israel 13 months ago.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Arms to Israel:</strong> The State Department said that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/israel-weapons-gaza-aid.html">did not plan to decrease weapons aid to Israel</a>, as a 30-day deadline passed without the country substantially improving the humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
