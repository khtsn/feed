    <h1>Israel Pounds Area Near Beirut Amid Signs of a Widening Offensive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The escalating violence threatens to undermine U.S. diplomatic efforts to stem the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-hezbollah.html" title="">The Biden administration has renewed a push</a> to contain the fighting after repeated rounds of shuttle diplomacy over the past year failed.</p><p>A prominent Iranian official, Ali Larijani, met on Friday with Lebanese officials in Beirut to discuss cease-fire efforts, the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon said. Hezbollah is Iran’s most powerful regional proxy, and any diplomatic settlement would almost certainly be contingent on Tehran’s approval. </p><p>Israel began an intensified <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-lebanon-invasion-map.html" title="">military campaign</a> against Hezbollah in September, nearly a year after the group began firing rockets into Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli offensive has set off a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-displaced-hezbollah.html" title="">displacing nearly a quarter of the population</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/middleeast/lebanon-hospitals-israel-offensive.html" title="">buckling the country’s health system</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, the United States said it was opposed to Israel’s intensifying bombing campaign in the Dahiya. Asked at a regular news briefing about the latest Israeli strikes, a State Department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said, “We do not want to see these kinds of operations in Beirut, especially as it relates to densely populated areas.”</p></div></div>
