The official overseeing the Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles internal ethics investigations, was also removed from that role, though he was placed on administrative leave, these people said.</p><p>The removals follow a pattern that has helped fuel turmoil and alarm inside the Justice Department, where many of the most senior, nonpartisan officials have been reassigned or forced out as the new administration seeks to take control of the agency and reshape it with an emphasis on loyalty to President Trump.</p><p>Two Justice Department spokesmen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Attorney General Pam Bondi has vowed to end what she calls the “weaponization” of the department, claiming without much explanation or evidence that prosecutors improperly pursued criminal cases against Mr. Trump during the Biden administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Critics of the Trump administration’s recent personnel changes inside the Justice Department argue that they will significantly weaken the authority of career law enforcement officials, and instead empower pro-Trump partisans to pursue the president’s goal of punishing his perceived enemies.</p><p>One of the senior lawyers dismissed Friday was surprised to find officials in their office who had been sent to tell them they had been dismissed, these people said.</p><p>The department has already fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on cases involving the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by Trump supporters at the Capitol, and forced out senior F.B.I. executives.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>William K.
