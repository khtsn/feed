The figure is the amount for a federal grant awarded to the city in the 2024 fiscal year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/fact-check-trump-immigration-economy-doge-fraud.html" title="">not the amount paid to one hotel.</a></p><p>He cited $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma, using the former name for Myanmar. That was a 2024 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250131220447/https://www.usaid.gov/philippines/press-releases/mar-05-2024-us-philippines-partner-provide-higher-education-opportunities-burmese-youth" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initiative</a> the United States Agency for International Development started after the 2021 military coup in the Southeast Asian country. </p><p>The scholarships funded Burmese students studying at universities in the Philippines and online at the University of Arizona. Though the total award was $45 million over five years, about $17 million had been obligated when the Department of Government Efficiency canceled the <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_72048223C00001_7200_-NONE-_-NONE-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">program</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump also mentioned “$42 million for social and behavioral change in Uganda,” likely referring to a <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72061720CA00005_7200" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$38 million contract</a> awarded to Johns Hopkins University in 2020 to improve health outcomes in the country. Behaviors listed in the award included the correct use of mosquito nets and medicines to treat H.I.V. infections. When the Department of Government Efficiency canceled the contract in March, most of the money, about $36 million, had already been spent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The “$40 million for social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants” Mr. Trump noted referred to a <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_72051422F00005_7200_72051421D00008_7200" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contract</a> to help Venezuelans who migrated to Colombia.</p><p>He again <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/05/us/trump-speech-congress/1-9-billion-to-recently-created-decarbonization-of-homes-committee-headed-up-and-we-know-shes-involved-just-at-the-last-moment-t?smid=url-share" title="">overstated</a> the link between a $1.9 billion environmental grant and Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia. A coalition of five groups received the grant, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, to decarbonize houses in low-income neighborhoods. Ms. Abrams served for one year as a senior adviser to one of the groups, and did not lead the organization.</p><p>Mr. Trump also again cited “$20 million for Arab Sesame Street in the Middle East,” adding wrongly that “nobody knows what that’s all about.” The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250111020443/https://www.usaid.gov/iraq/fact-sheets/ahlan-simsim-iraq" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">award to Sesame Workshop</a> was not to create a program, but to tailor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/us/politics/doge-sesame-street-fraud.html" title="">an existing children’s show</a> called “Ahlan Simsim” for local audiences, as well as to establish educational material for training and use in child care centers. Thousands of Iraqi children viewed the programming and participated in the training.</p><p>And he again described a body of research grants as “$8 million for making mice transgender.” In March, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/yes-biden-spent-millions-on-transgender-animal-experiments/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a list</a> of about $8.3 million in research grants that aimed to study the efficacy of different medications on transgender people through experiments with mice receiving different hormones. None of the studies specifically sought to “make mice transgender.”</p><p>What Was Said</p><p><em>“So, I think the judge just ruled against New York Times for their lies about the Russiagate hoax, and that they might have to give back that Pulitzer Prize.”</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>False. </strong>Mr. Musk dismissed new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/elon-musk-drugs-children-trump.html" title="">reporting by The New York Times on his drug use and tumultuous personal life</a> by incorrectly describing a legal proceeding and the circumstances of a lawsuit.</p><p>The court in question did not, as Mr. Musk suggested, rule that The New York Times “lied” in its reporting about Russia. The New York Times is not a litigant in the lawsuit.</p><p>In 2021, Mr. Trump demanded that the board that awards the Pulitzer Prizes revoke its awards to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. When the board refused, Mr. Trump <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/3775079-trump-sues-pulitzer-board-for-defamation-in-defending-winning-russia-collusion-stories/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued it for defamation.</a></p><p>In 2024, a state judge in Florida rejected the board’s move to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/business/media/trump-libel-suit-pulitzer-board.html" title="">dismiss the lawsuit.</a> The board later tried to pause proceedings, arguing that because Mr. Trump was the president, the lawsuit could prompt a constitutional conflict. But a state court ruled this week that the lawsuit could proceed.</p><p>What Was Said</p><p><em>“It’s an unbelievable bill. It cuts your deficits.”</em></p><p><strong>False. </strong>The Congressional Budget Office and a number of independent analysts have estimated that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/house-gop-tax-bill-trump.html" title="">Republican domestic policy bill</a>, passed by the House this month, would balloon federal deficits by more than $1 trillion, even when economic growth is factored in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Congressional Budget Office estimated an increase in the deficit of <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-05/61422-Reconciliation-Distributional-Analysis.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$3.8 trillion</a>; the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/breaking-down-one-big-beautiful-bill" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$3.1 trillion</a>, including interest; the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2025/5/23/house-reconciliation-bill-budget-economic-and-distributional-effects-may-22-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2.8 trillion</a>; and the Tax Foundation estimated <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tax-cuts-2025-budget-reconciliation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1.7 trillion</a> when factoring in economic growth.</p><p>“Quite the opposite, this would be an incredibly large deficit increaser, adding $3 trillion to our nation’s borrowing and $5 trillion if the expiring policies are extended,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Linda Qiu is a reporter who specializes in fact-checking statements made by politicians and public figures.
