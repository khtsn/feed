She was transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Louisiana, where she remained for more than three months.</p><p>At the end of the hearing on Wednesday, Judge Reiss said that “what happened in this case was extraordinary and novel,” and that if she did not take action in the case “there will be no determination” that Ms. Petrova’s rights had been violated.</p><p>“Bail is necessary to make the habeas remedy effective in this case,” she said.</p><p>However, it is unclear when the government will allow Ms. Petrova’s release on bail, or whether it will pursue its plan to deport her to Russia. The case has attracted high-level attention from officials in the Trump administration, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/health/detained-russian-scientist-harvard.html" title="">took an unusual step</a> earlier this month, after Judge Reiss indicated she planned to release Ms. Petrova.</p><p>Hours after that hearing, the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/science/petrova-scientist-harvard-russia-charges.html" title="">unsealed felony smuggling charges</a> against Ms. Petrova based on her failure to declare the scientific samples, and Ms. Petrova was arrested and transferred to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service in Louisiana, where she remains. The government also issued a detainer on immigration charges, suggesting she would not go free if granted bail in the criminal case.</p><p>Ms. Petrova’s next opportunity for release will come after she is transferred to Massachusetts to face the smuggling charges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Petrova, 31, the graduate of an elite Russian physics and technology institute, was recruited in 2023 to work at a laboratory at Harvard Medical School studying the earliest stages of cell development. The Kirschner Lab, where she worked, is exploring ways to repair damage to cells that lead to diseases like cancer.</p><p>Ms. Petrova has admitted that she failed to declare the samples. Her lawyer has argued that this would ordinarily be treated as a minor infraction, punishable with a fine. When Ms. Petrova told the customs officer that she had fled Russia for political reasons and faced arrest if she returned there, she was transferred to ICE custody to wait an asylum hearing, a process that can take months or years.</p><p>In response to questions, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday that Ms. Petrova “was lawfully detained after lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.”</p><p>“Messages found on her phone revealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them,” the spokesperson said. “She knowingly broke the law and took deliberate steps to evade it.”</p><p>Announcing the criminal charges, Leah B. Foley, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said Ms. Petrova’s academic credentials and Harvard affiliation did not shelter her from the law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The rule of law does not have a carve-out for educated individuals with pedigree,” she said.</p><p>In Wednesday’s hearing, a lawyer for the government argued that Ms. Petrova’s case was no longer under Judge Reiss’s jurisdiction, and that it should be heard by an immigration court in Louisiana.</p><p>Judge Reiss said, however, that the immigration court would not consider violations of Ms. Petrova’s constitutional rights, or whether the customs officer had acted improperly in stripping her of her visa.</p><p>“If this court doesn’t decide it, nobody will be deciding those issues,” she said.</p><p>She concluded that the officer had, in fact, acted improperly, and that it was important to establish that. “The circumstances of this case are capable of repetition, not only in Ms. Petrova’s case, but in other cases as well,” she said.</p><p>This is the most recent in a series of decisions by federal courts in Vermont challenging President Trump’s immigration policy.</p><p>On April 30, Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford ordered the release of Mohsen Mahdawi, a student organizer at Columbia University who was detained by immigration authorities during an interview for his naturalization.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On May 9, Rumeysa Ozturk, a doctoral student at Tufts University, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/us/tufts-rumeysa-ozturk-release.html" title="">was released from detention</a> on the orders of a judge who said her detention could chill “the speech of the millions and millions of individuals in this country who are not citizens.”</p><p>Judge Reiss asked whether the government would detain Ms. Petrova again on immigration charges if she was granted bail in the Massachusetts criminal case.</p><p>Jeffrey M. Hartman, an attorney representing the Department of Justice, said he did not expect that to happen.</p><p>“My understanding of the Ozturk and Mahdawi cases is that the government has not re-detained those non-citizens, and I would expect the government to adhere to the same course of action,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ellen Barry is a reporter covering mental health for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
