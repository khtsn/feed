There was no sign of her cat, named Pepper, Trooper Limani said.</p><p>The discovery ended about four days of intensive searching that at one point involved more than 140 people, including firefighters from 25 fire departments, Trooper Limani said. Timothy Carson, the Westmoreland County coroner, said it would most likely be several weeks before his office determined the cause and manner of Ms. Pollard’s death.</p><p>“It’s a very, very sad case,” Mr. Carson said.</p><p>“We pretty much had every E.M.S. and volunteer fire department to help in the search,” he added. “At times, it was deemed too dangerous. They had to watch where they were digging.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The authorities had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/us/pennsylvania-woman-sinkhole-missing-cat.html" title="">said on Wednesday that Ms. Pollard was presumed dead</a> because there had been no signs of life after two days of rescue efforts. But the confirmation from the authorities that she had died devastated those who knew her.</p><p>“I am more happy that they found her, but not in the condition we were hoping for,” Ms. Pollard’s son, Axel Hayes, said in an interview. “We were hoping she had maybe fallen and hit her head and was maybe unconscious or in a coma and that it wouldn’t come to this.”</p><p>Mr. Hayes said his mother — who had a husband, Kenny, and a 5-year-old granddaughter — was “always happy, always loving and kind.” She often took in stray cats, he said, and at point had about 10 that she took care of. </p><p>Stacey Reid-Donahue said she had worked with Ms. Pollard at a Walmart in Greensburg, Pa., from 1993 to 1999 and described her as a “wonderful person.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“People that came in there knew Liz, and she was just that happy-go-lucky lady,” Ms. Reid-Donahue said. “Liz was a wonderful mother, wife and grandmother and she took her grandchild everywhere.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A friend who said she had worked with Ms. Pollard at a Walmart described her as a “happy-go-lucky lady.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pennsylvania State Police</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The authorities went looking for Ms. Pollard early on Tuesday morning after her relatives called the police to report that she was missing hours after she had gone to look for Pepper.</p><p>The authorities initially searched for Ms. Pollard in the woods and other places, and then found a sinkhole near her car, with her granddaughter inside. When the authorities placed a camera in the hole, they saw a “modern” shoe that most likely was not a remnant of coal mining operations.</p><p>The sinkhole, which was about 30 feet deep, is in Marguerite, an unincorporated old coal mining community in Unity Township, about 40 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. It can be common for sinkholes to open up because of the old mines, Chief John Bacha of the Pleasant Unity Volunteer Fire Department said.</p><p>Trooper Limani said that a former mine stretches for miles under the community and that it has been abandoned for about 75 years.<span>  </span></p><p>Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> and <!-- -->Alain Delaquérière<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
