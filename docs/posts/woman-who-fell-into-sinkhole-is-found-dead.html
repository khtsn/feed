There was no sign of her cat, Trooper Limani said.</p><p>The discovery ended about four days of intensive searching that at one point involved more than 140 people, Trooper Limani said. Timothy Carson, the Westmoreland County coroner, said it would most likely be several weeks before his office determined the cause and manner of Ms. Pollard’s death.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A friend who said she had worked with Ms. Pollard at a Walmart described her as a “happy-go-lucky lady.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pennsylvania State Police</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“It’s a very, very sad case,” Mr. Carson said.</p><p>“We pretty much had every E.M.S. and volunteer fire department to help in the search,” he added. “At times, it was deemed too dangerous. They had to watch where they were digging.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The authorities had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/us/pennsylvania-woman-sinkhole-missing-cat.html" title="">said on Wednesday that Ms. Pollard was presumed dead</a> because there had been no signs of life after two days of rescue efforts.</p><p>But the confirmation from the authorities that Ms. Pollard had died devastated those who knew her.</p><p>A friend, Stacey Reid-Donahue, said she had worked with Ms. Pollard at a Walmart in Greensburg, Pa., from 1993 to 1999 and described her as a “wonderful person.”</p><p>“People that came in there knew Liz, and she was just that happy-go-lucky lady,” Ms. Reid-Donahue said.</p><p>Ms. Pollard and her husband, Kenny, had two grown children, one of whom recently died, and at least one grandchild, Ms. Reid-Donahue said. “Liz was a wonderful mother, wife and grandmother and she took her grandchild everywhere,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Earlier this week, Ms. Pollard’s son, Axel Hayes, told <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-sinkhole-search-missing-woman-cat-46045d7dfdf7dc39a57487d9d56f4031#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a> that she was “a great person overall, a great mother” who at one point had about 10 cats.</p><p>“Every cat that she’s ever come in contact with, she has a close bond with them,” Mr. Hayes said.</p><p>The authorities went looking for Ms. Pollard early on Tuesday morning after her relatives called the police to report that she was missing hours after she had gone to look for her cat, which The A.P. said is named Pepper.</p><p>The authorities initially searched for Ms. Pollard in the woods and other places, and then found a sinkhole near her car, with her 5-year-old granddaughter inside. When the authorities placed a camera in the hole, they saw a “modern” shoe that most likely was not a remnant of coal mining operations.</p><p>The sinkhole, which was about 30 feet deep, is in Marguerite, an unincorporated old coal mining community in Unity Township, about 40 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. It can be common for sinkholes to open up because of the old mines, Chief John Bacha of the Pleasant Unity Volunteer Fire Department said.</p><p>Trooper Limani said that a former mine stretches for miles under the community and that it has been abandoned for about 75 years.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
