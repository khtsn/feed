    <h1>Inching Toward a Fusion Energy Future</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In 1952, a machine with a funny name and a funny shape was zapped to life in the mountains of New Mexico. The Perhapsatron, a doughnut-shaped glass tube surrounded by magnets, was one of the world’s first nuclear fusion devices. Its name reflected the feelings of its creator, James Tuck, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory: “Perhaps it will work and perhaps it won’t.”</p><p>For a long time, that’s how fusion was. Perhaps we could use the process that powers the sun to produce clean, abundant energy on Earth. Perhaps it would help us move past fossil fuels and global warming. Perhaps, or perhaps not.</p><p>Recently, though, in talking with dozens of people across the fusion world — start-up founders, investors, scientists at government labs — I’ve been hearing many fewer perhapses. There’s a confidence that commercial fusion is at last within striking distance, a prospect that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/15/climate/fusion-energy.html" title="">I explored recently for The Times</a>.</p><p>Michl Binderbauer, chief executive of the fusion company TAE Technologies, summarized where we are on the mountain: “The fog has cleared. We know where the peak is. We obviously have a journey still. We think we know how to ascend the last steps.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>What cleared the fog? You may have heard about a couple recent breakthroughs, like when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/science/nuclear-fusion-energy-breakthrough.html" title="">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California</a> produced more fusion energy than the energy in the incoming laser beams for a tiny moment in 2022. Behind those are advances on several fronts: Better computer modeling, to design better reactors. Better technology and better materials, to push the limits of what we can build.</p><p>But also, more people and more companies are putting in the work, and there’s more money, to construct prototypes and test out ideas — “blood, sweat and tears,” as Ben Levitt, vice president of research and development at the fusion start-up Zap Energy, put it.</p><p>Let’s be clear: Nobody has achieved the really big breakthrough yet, namely, a machine that generates more fusion energy than it takes to run, and in a way that can work in a commercial power plant. A handful of companies, including Commonwealth Fusion Systems and General Fusion, say they’re close.</p><p>Even after their technology gets to that point, there’s plenty more they’ll need to do before their reactors can become safe, reliable, affordable providers of electricity. Price in particular is a question mark.</p><p>“I don’t think anyone knows enough about the economics of their plants to give you a number that’s not disingenuous right now,” said Benj Conway, Zap’s president and co-founder.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>One reason it’s so hard to make predictions about the fusion age is that we’re still not sure what the best fusion device will even look like. A tokamak, the doughnut-shaped machine Commonwealth is building? A giant laser, like Livermore Lab’s? Or one of the many other shapes and concepts that other start-ups are working on?</p><p>Each type of device has its own alluring pluses and dismaying minuses. But given how expensive these machines are to build, there simply isn’t enough money out there to pursue them all in equal measure. “There is a need, I think, for things to focus,” said Richard Buttery, director of the DIII-D National Fusion Facility in San Diego.</p><p>In Europe and China, governments are working more narrowly to develop a particular kind of reactor. “The advantage of that is that they are steaming ahead,” Buttery told me. The disadvantage, he said, is they might end up missing out on the approach that proves most effective, the one that really changes the world — once, of course, it gets past all the perhapses.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/15/climate/fusion-energy.html" title="">Read the full article</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>More coverage of nuclear power</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/climate/cop29-climate-nuclear-power.html" title="">Nuclear Power Was Once Shunned at Climate Talks.

It is taking the form of procedural objections that have blocked almost every set of talks, whether on carbon markets, decarbonization, or scientific research. Saudi diplomats have blocked negotiating texts, some of which were years in the making, from being allowed to move forward and, in at least one case, flatly refused to join meetings. <em>— Lisa Friedman</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/climate/saudi-arabia-obstruction-fossil-fuels.html" title="">Read the full article</a></strong>.</p><h2 id="link-77274629">More coverage from COP29:</h2><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/climate/cop29-climate-summit-final-stretch.html" title="">Negotiators are still far apart</a></strong>: As nations try to agree on a plan to provide potentially trillions of dollars to developing countries suffering from the effects of climate change, divisions remain over how much money should be made available, what kind of financing efforts should count toward the overall goal and how recipient countries should gain access to the funds. <em>— David Gelles and Brad Plumer</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/climate/democrats-cop29-baku-climate.html" title="">A global fund for climate disasters</a></strong>: A long-awaited fund designed to help lower-income countries respond to natural disasters is finally taking shape.
