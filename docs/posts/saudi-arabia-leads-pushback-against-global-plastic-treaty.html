The Saudis and their allies have also said they oppose any treaty that would start to list and phase out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/climate/plastic-chemicals-exposure.html" title="">chemicals present in plastic</a> that are thought to be harmful to health.</p><p>In closed-door negotiations late Saturday, Saudi Arabia, along with other nations, was pushing to delete entire paragraphs from the treaty text on who should finance the costs of implementing the agreement, according to a delegate with direct knowledge of the proceedings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Saudi delegates had argued in their submissions to the negotiations that tackling supply “penalizes industries without addressing the actual issue of plastic pollution.”</p><p>Delegates and observers have said that throughout the talks, the Saudis have insisted on unanimity for every decision and have raised frequent objections over procedure, slowing down progress.</p><p>When a Brazilian delegate who coleads a critical subgroup suggested that negotiators hold informal discussions over lunch to make up for lost time, for example, the Saudi delegate insisted that the Brazilian did not have a mandate to call for lunchtime talks, according to multiple<strong> </strong>people with knowledge of the exchange.</p><p>The Saudi delegation did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The slow pace has prompted rare public rebukes by delegates in Busan, where negotiations are in the final stretch. The U.N.-led talks, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/climate/global-plastics-recycling-treaty.html" title="">which kicked off in 2022</a>, are scheduled to end on Sunday.</p><p>“We have seen countries trying to delay negotiation. This is unacceptable,” José Ramón Reyes López, a delegate for the Dominican Republic, said at a midweek session.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mauricio Cabrera Leal, Colombia’s vice minister of environment, said a number of parties were delaying discussions. They are “leading us down a path which will not enable us to reach constructive agreement,” he said.</p><p>Neither Mr. Leal nor Mr. López specified which countries. Still, delegates aligned with the Saudis quickly responded.</p><p>Salman Alajmi, a delegate from Kuwait, said they had “gathered here in good faith” and were “fully committed” to an ambitious plastic treaty. But he said members of his bloc were “the ones being labeled as the blockers of the process when it is evidently the other way around.”</p><p>“We shouldn’t sacrifice the inclusiveness and the durability and the soundness of this agreement, just because we are pressed for time,” said Abdulrahman Al Gwaiz, a delegate from Saudi Arabia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The fight over the future of plastics comes at a time when crude oil demand is expected to peak and then slow as the rise of electric cars starts to reduce demand for fuel.

They say that to solve plastic pollution, the world needs to make less plastic, and they have emphasized that the talks have a mandate to address plastic’s full cycle, from production to disposal.</p><p>They point to the nearly <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/global-plastics-outlook_de747aef-en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">half a billion tons of plastic the world produces each year</a>, and the fact that only an estimated <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2022/02/plastic-pollution-is-growing-relentlessly-as-waste-management-and-recycling-fall-short.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">9 percent</a> of plastic waste generated globally is recycled. Researchers have estimated that <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26132/reckoning-with-the-us-role-in-global-ocean-plastic-waste" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one garbage truck’s worth</a> of plastic enters the ocean every minute.</p><p>In announcing the proposal, Juan Carlos Monterrey, the head of the delegation for Panama, urged nations “that have not moved a centimeter” to cross the bridge to an agreement.</p><p>The coalition seeking to set limits on plastic production now includes fossil fuel-producing nations like Canada and Norway. It has been led by developing nations, particularly Rwanda, which in 2008 became one of the first countries in the world to <a href="https://www.undp.org/blog/umuganda-rwandas-audacity-hope-end-plastic-pollution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ban single-use plastic bags and bottles</a>.

It still offered a binary choice: a global target to reduce plastic production, or no production curbs at all.</p><p>As delegates faced down the final hours, some raised the possibility that the talks would be suspended until a later date. Others were tentatively exploring moving the negotiations outside of a U.N. forum and away from oil-producing nations, one observer said. A third potential outcome would be a compromise that did little to address plastic pollution, they said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hiroko Tabuchi covers pollution and the environment for The Times.
