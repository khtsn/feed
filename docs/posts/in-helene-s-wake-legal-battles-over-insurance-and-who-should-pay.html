As of Tuesday, the group had still not heard from all of its staff members.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Despite the challenges, her team’s disaster response was up and running. The group of five lawyers and seven paralegals was coordinating with the American Bar Association <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/young_lawyers/about/initiatives/disaster-legal-services/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Young Lawyers Division’s Disaster Legal Services</a> unit.</p><p>Amanda Brown, a New Orleans lawyer who volunteers as program director, said that when she joined the legal services group in 2016, it “stood up” seven or eight projects a year. Now that number has more than doubled as storms become more frequent and more severe.</p><p>“Every year is a ‘record-setting’” one, she said, the “most in program history.”</p><p>It’s a milestone that no one celebrates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The bar association pairs lawyers who work on a pro bono basis with disaster victims. While groups like Legal Aid focus on low-income clients, lawyers who work for private firms often agree to help people who are above the poverty threshold but still in need of assistance, she said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>They’re on the forefront of an increasingly critical field: disaster law.</p><p>Kim Bart Mullikin, senior director of the North Carolina Bar Foundation, said the community of “disaster legal services responders” had grown dramatically in the past decade, with lawyers in states frequently hit by extreme weather sharing expertise with colleagues across the country.</p><p>“No one wants to have to recreate the wheel when we’re in the middle of crisis,” she said.</p><p>Her group is also involved in recruiting volunteers for the Helene response. She said she had been overwhelmed with applicants even before the official call went out to the state bar association’s membership. “There is so much desire to help,” she added.</p><p>Some of those offers came from out-of-state lawyers, who will be allowed to represent indigent clients affected by Helene under a temporary order, known as a “Katrina order,” issued Tuesday by the North Carolina Supreme Court.</p><p>Local lawyers are preparing for their crash course in the language of Federal Emergency Management Agency applications and the like, too. Jackie Kiger, executive director of Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit based in Asheville, N.C., was only able to confirm that all of her 119 staff members were safe on Wednesday, because phone networks were down.</p><p>Her organization has several offices across western North Carolina that sustained significant damage and remained closed, while staff members were scrambling to take care of themselves and their families. “Devastating doesn’t really explain how hard this is,” she said. “We know that this is a very long process for recovery.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Peter Dennis runs the Fort Myers, Fla., office of Florida Rural Legal Services. That area was spared a direct hit by Helene but saw <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/weather/helene-fort-myers-beach-floods.html" title="">major flooding</a> from the storm surge.</p><p>He said that his clients include many retirees who are particularly at risk of falling for scams and fraud in the wake of a traumatizing event.</p><p>His office still has three lawyers dedicated to legal issues related to Hurricane Ian, which hit the Fort Myers area two years ago. They include people who say they were defrauded by supposed contractors who showed up in the wake of the storm and had victims sign over their insurance benefits, then disappeared without completing the work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fort Myers Beach, Fla., in 2022, after Hurricane Ian struck.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johnny Milano for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>In worst-case scenarios, the cascade of events set off by a storm can culminate in foreclosure, eviction and even homelessness.<span>  </span>“I think what can really break down an individual’s will can be the prolonged nature of the effects of a hurricane,” Mr. Dennis said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>People in manufactured homes, which are not built to withstand powerful storms, are also facing major challenges, he said. After Ian, the building codes became more strict, which raised costs for the owners of mobile-home lots, and created incentives to simply sell to developers.</p><p>“It was a dream for a lot of people to be able to retire into a community with manufactured homes and a shuffleboard court and live out your time in sunny Florida,” Mr. Dennis said. In some places, “those days are over.”</p><p>His organization encourages people to prepare for disasters, including making sure they have the deed to their home and other important papers stored somewhere safe.</p><p>“I cannot believe that we were at the two-year anniversary of Ian and here we are, the people who have suffered so much and may have gotten those grants and gotten help to rebuild, and now have been hit again,” he said. “And they don’t know what’s going to happen in the future.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karen Zraick covers legal affairs for the Climate desk and the courtroom clashes playing out over climate and environmental policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karen-zraick">More about Karen Zraick</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
