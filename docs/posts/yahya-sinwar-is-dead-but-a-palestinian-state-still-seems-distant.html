In Gaza, there has been death and destruction on a devastating scale. There is a lack of a clear and solid Palestinian leadership. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-war.html" title="">Israel is grappling with its own trauma</a> over the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7.</p><p>President Biden is hoping Mr. Sinwar’s death can bring about a temporary cease-fire in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages, while producing a path toward negotiations on the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel — the so-called two-state solution. But it is unclear who can speak for Hamas now in Gaza, or even if the group really knows where all the hostages are or how many remain alive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has vowed to continue the war against Hamas as he prosecutes another conflict against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and also to retaliate against Iran. Since Oct. 7, he has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of a two-state solution, and the stability of his coalition government is dependent on far-right ministers who oppose a Palestinian state of any kind.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yahya Sinwar, center, in Gaza City last year.

The Palestinian Authority that was established under the accords was meant to be an interim body exercising limited Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it was ousted from Gaza by Hamas in 2007, controls only a part of the West Bank, and is seen by Palestinians as corrupt and ineffective.</p><p>In recent years, amid cycles of violence, hopes of a two-state solution had receded. After Oct. 7 and Israel’s devastating response in Gaza, the issue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/world/middleeast/israel-palestine-two-state-solution.html" title="">has again been pressed</a> by the United States and Europe, as well as some countries in the Middle East, as the best way of achieving a sustainable and secure peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Saudi Arabia, for one, insists that any recognition of Israel hinges on a credible pathway toward a viable and independent Palestinian state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But even if Mr. Netanyahu were to change tack, analysts say, the fragmented and weak Palestinian leadership would be a serious impediment to progress on the issue.</p><p>Any agreement would require a broad-based Palestinian leadership, including the agreement of Hamas, to advocate and support the idea, said Mouin Rabbani, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies, based in Doha. “But the Palestinian Authority has more or less forfeited any legitimacy it might have had. And I expect Hamas now will adopt an even more radical line.”</p><p>The insistence by the United States and European nations on continuing to press for a two-state solution ignored that vacuum in Palestinian leadership and the radicalizing impact of the Gazan war on Palestinian politics, he said.</p><p>The “two-state solution is a fig leaf that allows the U.S. and Europe to pretend they’re serious about solving the issue without recognizing the changes in the reality on the ground that contradict the possibility of attaining that goal,” Mr. Rabbani said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians searching for victims in the rubble of a destroyed house in central Gaza on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohammed Saber/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Complicating the issue is the rapid growth of Israeli settlements <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/magazine/west-bank-palestinians-settlers.html" title="">in the occupied West Bank</a>, as well as intensified raids in the territory by Israel following the Oct. 7 attack.</p><p>“No one who lives in the occupied territory, especially the West Bank, would believe in a two-state solution,” said Ali Jarbawi, a political science professor at Birzeit University in the West Bank</p><p>Right now, he said, “the most difficult thing in the world is to be a moderate Palestinian.”</p><p>The greatest impact of the death of Mr. Sinwar and the weakening of Hamas may be on Palestinian politics.</p><p>Mr. Jarbawi said that when he talked to Hamas officials, they were aware the organization had suffered a severe blow and would require many years to recover. They also acknowledged that Hamas could not rule Gaza on its own.</p><p>But Hamas can still obstruct any arrangement it dislikes, he noted. “It doesn’t take more than one person and one pistol,” Mr. Jarbawi said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Israeli, American, Saudi, Egyptian and Gulf officials have been discussing trying to install Salam Fayyad, 72, as prime minister to run the reconstruction of Gaza once the fighting ends.
