It wasn’t until he entered the league in 1993 that he had access to game film, and he tried to replicate great kickers like Morten Andersen, who played 25 seasons and made seven Pro Bowls. (Andersen’s long-kick success rate was 48 percent, which today would be below the league average.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Husted said that by the time he left the league, his kicking form was “completely different.” He focused much more on getting power from his entire body rather than just his legs.</p><p>That increased power is a big contributor to accuracy.</p><p>Long field goals used to frequently fall short of the goal posts. So far this year, just three attempts of 50 or more yards have been marked as “short” in the official play-by-play data.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="blatt-fg-short" data-id="100000009742426" data-source-id="100000009742426"><div slug="blatt-fg-short" data-sourceid="100000009742426" id="embed-id-100000009742426">
