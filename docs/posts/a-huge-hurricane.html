    <h1>A Huge Hurricane</h1>

It swallowed parts of Florida in a nine-foot storm surge, lashed the region with heavy rain and has cut power for millions of people. It is now in Georgia, where it is weakening to a tropical storm. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/24/weather/helene-map-path-tracker.html" title="">You can track it here</a>.</p><p>Helene is the most powerful hurricane ever to strike Florida’s Big Bend region, where the state’s long peninsula curves to meet its Panhandle. The storm is huge, and it is expected to damage much of the southeast. President Biden approved disaster declarations for Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina, in addition to Florida and Georgia.</p><p>Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, said that one person had died from the storm but that there would likely be others. Brian Kemp, Georgia’s governor, said that a tornado there had killed two people, and one person died in North Carolina.</p><p>The damage from Helene’s record storm surge will come into view as the sun rises soon.

The National Weather Service office in Tallahassee reported that a surge of up to 10 feet was moving mobile homes around in Steinhatchee, a coastal community near where the storm made landfall. In Cedar Key at midnight, tide levels were at nine feet, more than two feet above the previous record.</p><p>Biden is encouraging people across the region to shelter from the storm, which he called “catastrophic.”</p><p>Here’s what we know:</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hurricane Helene arriving in Tampa, Fla.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Craine for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><ul><li><p><strong>A big reach: </strong>Helene is expected to douse people from the southern tip of Florida all the way to North Carolina. Officials predicted landslides across southern Appalachia and warned of damage in parts of South Carolina nearly 400 miles from Florida’s coast.</p></li><li><p><strong>Power outages: </strong>More people are losing power, and widespread damage to the grid could cause outages that last days, if not weeks. More than 2.2 million customers were without power in the region early Friday. A majority of them, 1.2 million, were in Florida. More people are losing power in Georgia and South Carolina, too.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scenes from Florida</strong>: Along the Gulf Coast, waves slammed bridges and slapped into partially submerged buildings. Falling trees knocked down power lines. The National Weather Service urged people in Tallahassee to “TAKE COVER NOW!” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/hurricane-helene-florida-photos-videos.html" title="">See photos</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A storm-related death:</strong> A 4-year-old girl was killed in a car crash in Catawba County, N.C., according to officials. She was riding in a car that veered over a roadway’s centerline and crashed into oncoming traffic in the rain.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-79da9259">More on the storm</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eric Adams</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Todd Heisler/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><ul><li><p>Federal prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-graft-charges.html" title="">charged New York City’s mayor</a>, Eric Adams, with bribery, conspiracy, fraud and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations.</p></li><li><p>Adams spent years accepting free airline tickets, lavish overseas accommodation and illegal campaign donations from Turkey, prosecutors said.
