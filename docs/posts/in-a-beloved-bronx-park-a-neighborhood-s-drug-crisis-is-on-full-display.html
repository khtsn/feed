It not only afforded him an escape from his family’s small, scorching apartment, but also kept him away from the drugs, riots, crime and poverty that choked the surrounding neighborhood.</p><p><a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/st-marys-park/history" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">St. Mary’s Park</a>, the largest in the South Bronx, was for decades a refuge for many residents in one of New York City’s most impoverished areas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="CardDeckBlock-1"><div data-testid="cardDeck"><section aria-label="Gallery" data-testid="Gallery"><div><ol><li><figure><figcaption><p><span>1953</span></p></figcaption></figure><span>Robert Walker/The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><figcaption><p><span>1975</span></p></figcaption></figure><span>Neal Boenzi/The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><figcaption><p><span>1987</span></p></figcaption></figure><span>Pran Dith/The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><figcaption><p><span>1991</span></p></figcaption></figure><span>Keith Meyers/The New York Times</span></li></ol></div><nav><span></span></nav></section></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But as the city’s homelessness and opioid crises worsened in recent years, it became something else: a place where people shoot up and nod off under stately oak trees, and where the grass and rocks are littered with needles and broken glass.</p><p>Residents see the transformation of St. Mary’s as emblematic of the persistent poverty, drug problems and neglect that plague the South Bronx. They worry that the state of the park helps perpetuate the damaging stigmas surrounding the area as it seeks to fend off gentrification.</p><p>The community has sought help from the city and state for years, but residents say they have yet to see solutions that work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-4"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Martin Rogers, 70, has fond memories of playing at St. Mary’s as a child.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many residents steer clear of the park, worried about stumbling over discarded needles or other drug paraphernalia.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“What’s happening in St. Mary’s Park is a symptom of what’s happening in the broader South Bronx,” said Carmen Santiago, who lives nearby and advocates cleaning up the park. “The situation is just a perfect storm.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Santiago, 61, an Army veteran and retired construction manager, walks the length of St. Mary’s picking up litter week after week. On a recent day, she entered at East 149th Street and St. Ann’s Avenue and headed up a grassy hill toward a rocky peak, dodging needles, shards of glass and human feces with each step.</p><p>Atop the hill, an empty blue pouch labeled “Overdose Rescue Kit” dangled from a tree, flapping in the wind. The ground beneath it was covered with naloxone containers, needle caps and trash.</p><p>“Seniors don’t come here anymore and walk around,” Ms. Santiago said. “My mom is 85, and she’s like, ‘I’m not going there.’”</p><p>In the back of Ms. Santiago’s mind was her nephew, whom she described as a middle-aged man who has struggled with substance abuse. Friends have spotted him using drugs in the park and a few blocks away at the Third Avenue Hub, a busy commercial corridor lined with stores and public transportation stops.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Each time she steps outside, Ms. Santiago said, she hopes she won’t find her nephew’s dead body.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Police officers at the 40th Precinct, which covers the Port Morris, Mott Haven and Melrose neighborhoods, have described the Hub as a central location where people buy drugs, score free syringes and steal from stores. If they overdose, they are just blocks away from a hospital.</p><p>In February, Mayor Eric Adams announced that the city’s <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/patrol/community-link.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Community Link program</a>, which creates local coalitions among community leaders, law enforcement and city agencies to address chronic quality-of-life problems, would begin work at the Hub. The program has also focused on six other neighborhoods since 2023.</p><p>Camille Joseph Varlack, the deputy mayor for administration, said the area’s “systemic challenges” made it a good candidate for the program. She said her office had held monthly meetings with local stakeholders to track the effort’s progress.</p><p>“I think the local feedback has been incredibly positive,” she said. “Our goal is to ultimately empower our community stakeholders so that when we do pull back the city resources, perhaps to go to another area that is similarly challenged, they’ve got points of connectivity we’ve created.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/11/nyregion/11st-marys-park-mtkj4/st-marys-park-mtkj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/11/nyregion/11st-marys-park-mtkj4/st-marys-park-mtkj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/11/nyregion/11st-marys-park-mtkj4/st-marys-park-mtkj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A black-and-white photo of a city intersection lined with businesses, with pedestrians, cyclists and cars going by." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/11/nyregion/11st-marys-park-mtkj4/st-marys-park-mtkj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/11/nyregion/11st-marys-park-mtkj4/st-marys-park-mtkj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/11/nyregion/11st-marys-park-mtkj4/st-marys-park-mtkj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/11/nyregion/11st-marys-park-mtkj4/st-marys-park-mtkj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="100vw" uri="nyt://image/b70d7201-ee29-5200-9054-19907fef3c2f" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Third Avenue Hub, a commercial area that is also the site of drug deals, has been a focus of city government intervention in the South Bronx.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cleanup crews with OnPoint NYC, a nonprofit that runs overdose prevention centers, make regular rounds in the park and other drug-use hot spots.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The city’s parks department has said that cleaning up St. Mary’s Park is a priority.</p><p>In recent years, the department has spent about $50 million to improve the park’s amphitheater, recreation center, restrooms, dog run and playgrounds, according to Gregg McQueen, a spokesman.
