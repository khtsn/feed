    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Who would not want to award a blue ribbon to Boujee the golden retriever, with her boundless enthusiasm and ineffable talent for maintaining her dignity while clamoring for attention? One swoosh of her magnificent tail and it’s easy to see why this blond bombshell is the top-ranked golden competing at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, with judging to begin on Monday.</p><p>Although Boujee spent 2024 making friends and winning shows, she has little (or no, if history is any guide) chance of beating the other 2,500 entrants vying for Westminster’s coveted best in show award. In the 117 years that the award has been given, golden retrievers have won exactly zero times. (Wire fox terriers, for some reason, <a href="https://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/conformation-records/best-in-show-winners/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have won more often than anyone else — 15 times.</a>)</p><p>This might seem unfair, given that goldens are, along with Labrador retrievers and French bulldogs, consistently the most popular dogs in the United States. (Neither of those breeds has ever won Westminster, either.) Even with the mysterious calculus of shows — dogs are judged not by how fabulous they are, but by how closely they adhere to the supposed Platonic ideal of their breed — it would seem to follow that sometime in the last century, there has existed a golden retriever whose golden retriever-ness exceeded, say, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/21/sports/wasabi-westminster-best-in-show.html" title="">Peke-iness of a Pekingese</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/09/multimedia/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/09/multimedia/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/09/multimedia/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A golden retriever is seen on a grass field with a person standing in front of her." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/09/multimedia/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/09/multimedia/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/09/multimedia/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/09/multimedia/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp/09WESTMINSTER-PREVIEW-GOLDEN-RETRIEVERS-02-bgvp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/2f857430-deb0-541d-bf59-b0f9693b7fc9" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In a sign of how hard it is for golden retrievers to win at Westminster, Boujee is the top-ranked dog of her breed in the show but is ranked 77th overall by the American Kennel Club.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Apparently not. (Pekingese, who to the untrained eye look less like dogs than majestic ambulatory hairpieces, have won six times.) The logic of these things is mysterious, even to dog experts.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I did not answer your question, because I’m not sure I or any one else can,” said Barbara Pepper, chairwoman of the judges’ education committee at the Golden Retriever Club of America. “It’s one of those questions that can’t be answered.”</p><p>Boujee, whose full name is GCHG Skyline’s Bad &amp; Boujee, after a song by the hip-hop group Migos, certainly didn’t seem fussed about the inscrutable nature of dog show judging when she welcomed a visitor recently to the home of her handlers, Ryan and Rachel Tepera, in suburban Conroe, Texas. She was golden.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Rushing to the door with her entourage — Siren, a 12-year-old long coat Chihuahua, and Weston, a 20-month-old human toddler — she greeted the arrival of a stranger as if it were the most exciting thing ever to happen in her two years of existence. She then zoomed outside to see what was up. (Nothing, it turned out.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As everyone repaired to the sofa, a wave of humans and dogs moving in tandem, Boujee intuited that the attention was shifting away from her immediate physical needs and leaped onto Mr. Tepera’s lap, planting her front paws on his chest so that her head loomed above his, both noble and aggrieved.</p><p>Boujee had quite a year in 2024, winning four best in show awards and earning the coveted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=8944157398981676" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">top golden</a> title at the Golden Retriever Club of America’s competition in October. Her fiercest golden competitor, Cake (official name: <a href="http://www.contigogoldens.com/cake.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GCHG Contigo’s I Like Big Bundt’s and I Cannot Lie</a>; his litter’s names had a baked-goods theme), has amassed more points against other breeds than Boujee but is not competing at Westminster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ryan Tepera, who shares handler duties with his wife, Rachel, said posing for judges came naturally to Boujee</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The collection of ribbons at the Tepera’s house in Texas is impressive. But Boujee’s breed has never captured the ribbon for winning best in show at Westminster.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Being a winning golden gets you only so far, alas: Boujee is ranked just 77th in the American Kennel Club’s <a href="https://caninechronicle.com/new-statistics/?type=top20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of the top dogs</a> in the country, based on overall points amassed. According to this metric, the dogs to beat are a giant schnauzer named Monty and a German shepherd named Mercedes, both of whom reached <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/2024-westminster-group-winners/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Westminster finals</a> last year.</p><p>Even as a tiny fluffy show-off of a puppy, the only female in a seven-dog litter, Boujee seemed destined for something more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“She was probably only 3 weeks old, but she would stand so beautifully and pose with her tail out,” Mr. Tepera said, describing how Boujee seemed instinctively to “stack” — that is, stand with her feet, body and tail in perfect show-ring alignment. “She was always saying, ‘Look at me.’”</p><p>(Boujee’s mom, Kendoll, whose official name is Summits C’mon Barbie, Let’s Go Party) gave birth to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10231316937079831&amp;set=pcb.10231316964520517" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four new puppies</a> at the end of January. It’s unclear whether they’re bound for stardom — they can barely open their eyes — but Weston, the Teperas’ toddler, appears to believe that he is a member of their litter. “I don’t know if he thinks he’s a dog,” Mr. Tepera said, “but we have noticed that sometimes he barks.”)</p><p>While some dogs have complicated inner lives and mixed feelings about fame, Boujee relishes attention, her splendiferous feathery tail wagging with increasing velocity as her fans’ excitement grows. “She’s a very proud dog — ‘You’re looking at me?’” Mr. Tepera said. “Maybe she’s a little vain.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Tepera’s interest in dog shows began when he saw the Westminster show on TV. He adopted a retired show beagle and trained himself to be a handler.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Golden retrievers came into being in 19th-century Scotland when a fellow named <a href="https://www.marjoribanks.net/lord-tweedmouths-golden-retrievers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sir Dudley Marjoribanks</a> — he later became the first Baron Tweedmouth, but that is another story — bred a wavy-coated retriever with a Tweed water spaniel. They were conceived as “gentlemen’s gun dogs” who could segue seamlessly from fetching birds and waterfowl to “lying by your feet at the fire,” Michael Faulkner, a longtime golden retriever breeder and veteran Westminster judge, said. (An obsession with tennis balls came later.)</p><p>“They’re bred to be calm and steadfast — never frenetic, never hyper,” Mr. Faulkner said — more Owen Wilson than Jim Carrey. This can cause confusion when judges unschooled in the ways of goldens fall into the trap of rewarding “fast, flashy movements and behavior” in the ring.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“Here’s the thing with goldens,” said Ms. Pepper from the Golden Retriever Club of America. “They are a moderate breed. The dog that flies around the ring with a lot of reach and drive and is kicking his rear end out behind him — there are a lot of people who love that, but that is not correct for the breed. A dog like that would wear himself out if he ran around in the field that way all day.”</p><p>Another potential pitfall is that unlike some dogs whose breed standards — written lists of traits — are fairly narrow, <a href="https://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/GoldenRetriever.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">golden standards</a> allow for a <a href="https://www.dailypaws.com/living-with-pets/pet-compatibility/types-of-golden-retrievers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wide variation in appearance</a>. The dogs can be large or not-so large. Their <a href="https://www.mygoldenretrieverpuppies.com/blog/golden-retriever-colors" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coats can be the color of a bowl of cream, the color of a light sheaf of wheat or the color of a dark piece of caramel.</a></p><p>“Here’s another thing with goldens,” Ms. Pepper said. “We have a huge range of styles. You can have multiple dogs that technically meet the standard and do not necessarily look the same. When you walk up to a golden ring, they won’t all look like cookie-cutter dogs.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Boujee, who lives in South Carolina and trains in Texas, loves swimming and playing, just like any other golden retriever.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-20"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Unlike other show dogs, standards for golden retrievers allow for a wide variation in appearance.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Boujee’s mom, Kendoll, had a litter of new puppies in January.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>During her downtime, Boujee lives in Lancaster, S.C., with her co-owner, Courtney Higgins. Her busy itinerary includes swimming, fetching, hanging out, accompanying people on bicycle rides and getting her hair washed. Her favorite toy is a stuffed sloth that Ms. Higgins called “weird, nasty and zombie-looking” but that Boujee carts around with a laser-sharp intensity reflecting its nonnegotiable importance to her emotional well-being.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“She’s had it since she was a baby,” Ms. Higgins said — in the same way that a child might always have the “same” goldfish, not realizing that the one in the tank is really Goldfish.4, a simulacrum of the original. (Because overused sloths can become raggedy and drool-covered, Ms. Higgins has a collection of emergency backups.)</p><p>For Mr. Tepera, 33, Boujee is the pinnacle of a journey that began in his early years on a Texas livestock ranch managed by his father. As a boy, he showed goats at 4-H events, his pockets stuffed with goat chow.</p><p>The family moved to Arkansas and left the goats behind. But then Mr. Tepera turned on the TV, saw a broadcast of Westminster and told his parents that it was now his life’s dream to become a dog handler. He made his case in a PowerPoint presentation accompanied by a lot of pleading. “They thought I was crazy,” he recalled.</p><p>With money earned washing cars and mowing lawns, Mr. Tepera bought a retired show beagle named Mary Kate and practiced show-walking in a fake competition ring he constructed from hoses in the backyard. Soon, they were competing in junior showmanship classes, and Mr. Tepera was working as an apprentice to professional handlers. “There’s no dog-show college, so that’s the only way to learn,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>No one seems able to pin down exactly why best in show has always eluded golden retrievers, but the debate does not seem to affect Boujee’s mood.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Even majoring in political science at Texas A&amp;M, where his roommate was also a junior dog handler, did not deter him from his goal. “My parents were very supportive, though their mind boggled,” he said. “They still don’t entirely get it.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>He shows many breeds of dogs on behalf of their owners, but goldens are his favorite. “They’re the best breed,” he said. “They’re friendly, they’re reliable, they’re trustworthy and they’re playful. You can run with them, hike with them and swim with them. They’re affectionate and they’re beautiful. I love their golden hair.”</p><p>Maybe that contributes to the perennial golden problem in dog shows. Are they perceived as Everydogs, too popular, too versatile, too biddable, too goofy — even kind of basic? On social-media dating forums, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ryrhvs/golden_retriever_energy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“golden retriever energy”</a> seems to refer to friendly, low-maintenance men who, while they’ll happily go along with your plans, perhaps suffer from having no plans of their own.</p><p>Don’t tell that to Boujee, who, possibly exhausted from all these hypotheticals, was taking a nap under the table. Maybe she will make history at Westminster. “She’s a once-in-a-lifetime dog,” Ms. Higgins said. “Maybe this is the year.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sarah Lyall is a writer at large for The Times, writing news, features and analysis across a wide range of sections.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>ST</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>4</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Dreaming of Best in Show, Despite History’s Odds<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
