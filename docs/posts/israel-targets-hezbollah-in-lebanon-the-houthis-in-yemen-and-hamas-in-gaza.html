At the same time, the military’s war against Hamas in Gaza continues, and movements by the Israeli army along its northern border over the weekend suggested preparations for a possible ground invasion of Lebanon.</p><p>“The I.D.F. is determined to continue operating at any distance — near or far — against all threats to the citizens of the state of Israel,” the Israeli military said Sunday.</p><p>The strikes over the weekend came after a spate of attacks by Israel’s military and intelligence forces, including operations that turned pagers and walkie-talkies into bombs that killed or maimed Hezbollah militants, and a bombing on Friday that killed Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The operations were part of a broader strategy, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday, to create a new balance of power in the Mideast in which Israel’s status is unquestioned.</p><p>“Our foes and friends view Israel again for what it is: a strong, determined and powerful state,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A billboard showing Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader, in Tehran, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The recent attacks appeared to strengthen Mr. Netanyahu’s hand both militarily and politically. After nearly a year of war in Gaza, Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition had grown increasingly fragile at home and isolated abroad. But he appeared to gain political ground Sunday as he welcomed Gideon Saar, a former justice minister and a past critic, who joined his governing coalition.</p><p>“In recent days, the government led by Netanyahu has shown a commendable resolve,” Mr. Saar said Sunday. “The I.D.F. has operated perfectly.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Though Israel’s military operations on Sunday were wide in scope, they were limited in intensity compared to attacks last week, when Israel bombed a densely populated neighborhood near Beirut that leveled buildings and killed Mr. Nasrallah. The Hezbollah leader was considered by many the most famous and important militia figure in Iran’s “axis of resistance” against Israel.</p><p>Iran-backed militias fired missiles at Israel, with Houthi militants in Yemen launching a ballistic missile. The Houthi missile was shot down before reaching Israeli airspace, according to Israel’s military.</p><p>Israel’s military operation targeting Yemen involved dozens of Israeli fighter jets and refueling and reconnaissance aircraft, the I.D.F. said. The jets attacked power plants and a seaport that the Israeli military said were used to transfer weapons from Iran into the region. </p><p>At least four people were killed in Hodeidah, Yemen, including a port worker and three engineers at the Al-Hali power station, and at least 33 people were injured, according to Al-Masirah, the Houthi-run television channel. Rescue teams were still searching for people in the rubble of the power station, according to an eyewitness, and the death toll could rise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke rising over in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, Yemen, after strikes on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Nasruddin Amer, a Houthi spokesman, said in a post on X that oil depots at Yemen’s ports in Ras al-Issa and Hodeidah had been emptied of their petroleum in advance. He warned the strikes would not prevent further missile attacks on Israel.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“We’re at war with the Zionist enemy and our operations will not stop,” Mr. Amer said in a text message.</p><p>Destroying port infrastructure could have major consequences for Yemen, where 4.5 million people have fled their homes after nine years of civil war.</p><p>“Over half of Yemen’s population is dependent on humanitarian aid,” and much of it flows in through ports in the country’s north, said Niku Jafarnia, a researcher for Human Rights Watch focusing on Yemen.</p><p>“The humanitarian importance&#34; of the ports “cannot be understated,” Ms. Jafarnia said.</p><p>Israel also launched attacks on dozens of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on Sunday, targeting rocket launchers and buildings that it said were used for storing weapons. A strike on Saturday killed more members of Hezbollah’s senior leadership, Israel’s military said, including Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of the group’s central council.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The strikes killed at least 100 people and injured more than 350 others, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatant and civilian casualties.</p><p>The attacks between Israel and its foes across three theaters — Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen — heightened fears of a wider war, possibly involving Iran itself.</p><p>John F. Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, acknowledged the civilian casualties in the Israeli bombing that killed Mr. Nasrallah and reiterated that the White House wants a cease-fire and a diplomatic solution rather than an all-out war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced people seeking refuge at Martyrs’ Square in Beirut on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on CNN that he worries the failure by Iran’s proxies to defend themselves from Israel’s military might pressure Iran’s leadership to abandon negotiations seeking to loosen sanctions that have crippled its economy, and instead restart its nuclear weapons program.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“What I fear is they’ll break out toward a nuclear weapon thinking that that’s their insurance policy” to counter the recent setbacks among Tehran’s proxies, Senator Graham said.</p><p>Informed of Israel’s attacks in Lebanon on Sunday, Pope Francis was captured on video covering his eyes with his hand. Then he issued a strongly worded statement about the disproportionate use of force.</p><p>“When there is something disproportionate, you can see a tendency to dominate that goes beyond morality,” Francis said.</p><p>The Israeli military strikes stoked civil unrest in other countries. Amid the chaos, inmates at two prisons in Lebanon revolted over the weekend, the country’s state-run news agency reported. More than 130 prisoners escaped one of the facilities and were arrested Sunday.</p><p>Protesters in Pakistan gathered Sunday and chanted “Death to Israel,” “Down with the U.S.” and “Long live Nasrallah.” The demonstration in the southern city of Karachi began peacefully, but grew violent as the protest neared the American consulate. Several police officers and protesters were injured.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Matthew Mpoke Bigg<!-- -->, <!-- -->Charlie Savage<!-- -->, <!-- -->Minho Kim<!-- -->, <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- -->, <!-- -->Anushka Patil<!-- -->, <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ismaeel Naar<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>8</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Israel Hits Yemeni Port While Extending Raids On Lebanon and Gaza<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
