Last year, 337 couples exchanged vows there, and even more were expected to do so on Friday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In Chicago, despite a Friday forecast calling for a chance of flurries and a high temperature of only 24 degrees, the Circuit Court of Cook County was preparing for a Valentine’s rush.</p><p>The court performs about 60 weddings in a typical week, but around Christmas and Valentine’s Day, the number grows to 200 to 300. With Valentine’s Day landing on a Friday this year, the court was expecting even more.</p><p>To accommodate the surge, six judges were ready to perform ceremonies, twice as many as on a typical day, Circuit Judge Diann K. Marsalek said. Ceremonies are performed in offices and courtrooms, some of which were decorated for Valentine’s Day. </p><p>Judge Marsalek said that couples are attracted to the flexibility and ease of a courthouse wedding.</p><p>“They can start celebrating immediately,” she said.</p><p>San Francisco was also preparing for a deluge of lovebirds. Diane Rea, the city clerk, said that more than 250 appointments had been scheduled for Friday, with ceremonies to be performed in eight locations across four floors of City Hall. (A typical weekday brings in about 28 wedding appointments.) Mayor Daniel Lurie was to be among the city’s 25 officiants.</p><p>Ms. Rea said she was expecting “joyful chaos.”</p><p>“It’s definitely not an intimate moment when you do it on one of these days,” Ms. Rea said. But, she added, “it’s fun to be among a lot of people doing the same thing for the same reason. Particularly in this moment, we’re all yearning for those feelings.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>That was the case in Lower Manhattan on Friday morning, when dozens of couples lined up to say “I Do.” </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Manhattan Marriage Bureau said it expected to perform 75 wedding ceremonies on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jose and Lauren Oceguera arriving at the Louis J.

They knew they wanted to get married on Valentine’s Day and set a calendar reminder for the day it opened up on the city’s reservation website.</p><p>“We grew up here, fell in love here, thought it would be a magical moment,” Ms. Goulart said.
