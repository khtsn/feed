		<p>Following the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2682/vct-2026-americas-kickoff" target="_blank">VCT Americas Kickoff</a> Middle Final, an on-stage draw for the VCT Americas Stage 1 groups was held.</p>

<p>The region&#39;s 12 teams were split into six different pots based on their Kickoff standings, with teams finishing 1st and 2nd, 3rd and 4th, etc. placed into the same pot. Teams from the pots were drawn into Group Alpha and Group Omega.</p>

<p>The draw was as follows:</p>









<p>The draw brings forth some interesting matchups, placing Kickoff&#39;s middle finalists into the same group in G2 and MIBR, while also placing ENVY&#39;s <span data-ref-id="12">

		Demon1	</a>
</span> into a group with two of his former teams. In Group Omega, recently crowned Kickoff champions FURIA will go up against two of <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/796/eeiu">

</span>&#39;s former teams in NRG and 100T, while the <span data-ref-id="14">

</span> Derby looks set to continue.</p>

<p>The draw also sorted the region&#39;s five South American teams and seven North American teams fairly even, with Group Alpha comprising of a 2 NA, 3 SA split and Group Omega with 3 NA and 2 SA teams.</p>

<p>Stage 1 is slated to start on April 10, just under one month after play at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2760/valorant-masters-santiago-2026" target="_blank">Masters Santiago</a> concludes.</p>

	<p>100T being in the same stage 1 group as Sen is inevitable at this point</p>

	

	
	
</div></div><div><div data-post-id="6197501" id="5">

	
	
	<p>I think we can confidently say that LOUD and EG are not qualifying for playoffs</p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="6197503" id="6">

	
	
	<p>is it even known that kru have had the visas sorted for stage 1? otherwise i can see eg winning against them and going as 4th seed</p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="6197740" id="8">

</div><div><div><div data-post-id="6198357" id="15">

	
	
	<p>11th or 12th is basically the same. LOUD is also in the other group so they can be last together</p>
