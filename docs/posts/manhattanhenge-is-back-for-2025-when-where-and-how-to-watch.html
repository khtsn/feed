Nicknamed Manhattanhenge, the event attracts more people each year, some gathering in crowds so dense they block the streets.</p><p>“I think of it as astronomy in your face,” Jackie Faherty, an astronomer at the American Museum of Natural History who <a href="https://www.amnh.org/research/hayden-planetarium/manhattanhenge" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">computes the dates for Manhattanhenge each year</a>, said in an interview in 2024. “It’s like a huge science party that will occur in the city.”</p><p>The event’s popularity most likely goes beyond an interest in science, Dr. Faherty added: People love a good photo op, and Manhattanhenge delivers.</p><h2 id="link-65ccd096">When is Manhattanhenge?</h2><p>This year, Manhattanhenge’s first night occurs on Wednesday, May 28. More opportunities to see it will occur Thursday, May 29, then again on July 11 and 12.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>According to the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/research/hayden-planetarium/manhattanhenge" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Museum of Natural History</a>, Manhattanhenge will reach its fullest effect at 8:13 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, and then again at 8:12 on Thursday.</p><p>If you miss it this week, or the weather gets in the way, it will be back on July 11 and 12.</p><p>The sunset will appear different on consecutive days. On May 28, the top half of the sun will align with the city grid, but the next day, the full sun will be visible. Later in the summer, this pattern reverses: Viewers will see a full sun on July 11, and the top half of the sun on July 12.</p><h2 id="link-78a82f72">Will clouds get in the way?</h2><p>The skies over New York City are expected to be cloudy on both Wednesday and Thursday.</p><p>A nearly 100 percent chance of cloud cover is likely to obscure Manhattanhenge on Wednesday. There is also rain in the forecast.</p><p>But Manhattanhenge can sometimes be seen through breaks in the clouds. Clouds can even make the spectacle more dramatic and beautiful.</p><p>Breaks are more likely to occur on Thursday. The storm system is predicted to move out of the area Thursday evening with a second more potent one behind it. When that break occurs will determine your odds on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It’s a matter of how much clearing happens between that first system and the next system,” said Matt Wunsch, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</p><p>July is likely to offer a better chance of seeing Manhattanhenge as clear skies are more common in the city in summer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The view from Long Island City in Queens on May 28, 2024.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-557b98f9">Why should I see it?</h2><p>Like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/08/us/total-solar-eclipse-photos.html" title="">last year’s solar eclipse</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/world/europe/aurora-northern-lights-solar-storm-photos.html" title="">sun’s dancing aurora</a>, Manhattanhenge is another instance of our home star bringing people together.</p><p>Sunsets are one of the easiest ways to embrace “the wonder of the cosmos,” Dr. Faherty said, adding that each one is distinct. “You never know how the light is going to look or feel as it is setting, or what the atmosphere around you will be like.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Longer days, warmer weather and the school year winding down in New York City make Manhattanhenge “just that extra notch up,” she said. “The whole thing is just a nice, relaxing summer party and celebration of astronomy.”</p><h2 id="link-793c0365">Why does Manhattanhenge happen?</h2><p>The sun setting perfectly between New York’s urban canyons results from the geometry of the sun and Earth.</p><p>The sun sets in a different location every day because Earth is tilted on its axis as it orbits the sun, Dr. Faherty said. In the spring, she explained, if you watched the sun looking west from the same spot, you’d notice that the place where it sets moved a little north relative to the horizon each day.</p><p>After the summer solstice, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2025/science/astronomy-space-calendar-events" title="">which occurs on June 20 this year</a>, the sun starts inching back south. “It pingpongs between solstices,” Dr. Faherty said. “And that’s because we’re going around the sun, like doing loops around a track.”</p><p>That’s also why there are two chances to see Manhattanhenge, in May and in July; the dates occur on either side of the summer solstice. Between these dates, viewers can still catch the sun emerging from behind the city’s skyscrapers as it sets, though it will appear at different heights in the sky.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It’s a season of “epic sunsets in New York City,” Dr. Faherty said.</p><h2 id="link-4b17c1c">How did Manhattanhenge start?</h2><p>In the 1800s, city planners designed New York City as a grid: Its avenues run roughly north to south, and its cross streets are laid out at 90-degree angles, running approximately east to west.</p><p>As long as this grid has existed, people have likely noticed the phenomenon, Dr. Faherty said.</p><p>The earliest mention of this effect that Dr. Faherty has been able to track down is a <a href="https://neildegrassetyson.com/photos/1997-04-an-astrophysicists-manhattan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1997 comic strip</a> published in Natural History magazine. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium, coined the name “Manhattanhenge” in 2002, inspired by the ancient <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/science/stonehenge-archaeology-wales-parker-pearson.html" title="">Stonehenge monument</a> in England.</p><p>Since then, excitement surrounding the event has grown every year. “People caught on and it lit like wildfire,” Dr. Faherty said.</p><h2 id="link-7dee3da7">Where can I see Manhattanhenge?</h2><p>Among the most popular places to watch this special sunset is the Tudor City overpass, a pedestrian walkway above 42nd Street. The vantage point offers a good view of the Chrysler Building.</p><p>Another favored location for photographers is the Park Avenue Viaduct a few avenues west, near Grand Central Station. But pedestrians aren’t allowed up there, and police will likely show up to clear any gathering crowds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But any street running east to west in Manhattan with good visibility of New Jersey is fair game. For the best views (and photos), Dr. Faherty recommends finding a wide road framed by notable city structures.</p><p>On 34th Street, you’ll see the Empire State Building; elsewhere on 42nd Street, you might be able to position Times Square in your frame. Wide roads like 14th Street, 23rd Street and 57th Street are also popular. Uptown on 145th Street and Hunters Point in Queens offer unconventional views.</p><p>“You have to be in the middle of the street to fully appreciate it,” Dr. Faherty said, so keep safety in mind when picking a spot.</p><h2 id="link-7da9a907">Does the effect ever occur at sunrise?</h2><p>A similar effect occurs at sunrise in November and January, roughly six months after the Manhattanhenge sunset dates. Dr. Faherty calls this Reverse Manhattanhenge.</p><p>But the dates for Reverse Manhattanhenge are more difficult to calculate, she said, because the sun rises to the east over the city’s other boroughs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens — they’re big, they have a lot of topography to them,” Dr. Faherty said. “There’s a lot more things that get in the way.”</p><p>That adds challenges to determining when there will be a clear view of the rising sun. And because the weather isn’t as good, Reverse Manhattanhenge tends to draw a smaller crowd.</p><p>Amy Graff<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katrina Miller is a science reporter for The Times based in Chicago.
