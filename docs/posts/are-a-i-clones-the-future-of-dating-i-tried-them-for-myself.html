Some even fear it will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/10/technology/ai-humanity.html" title="">destroy humanity</a>. But can it fix my dating life?</p><p>A growing number of companies believe the answer is yes. As chatbots like ChatGPT improve, their use in our personal and even romantic lives is becoming more common. So much so, some executives in the dating app industry have begun pitching a future in which people can create A.I. clones of themselves that date other clones and relay the results back to their human counterparts.</p><p>Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder of the dating app Bumble, called them ‚Äúdating concierges.‚Äù George Arison, the chief executive of Grindr, referred to them as ‚Äúduplicates.‚Äù Internally, some companies are using another term, Mr. Arison said in an interview: ‚Äúsynthetics.‚Äù</p><p>For a lot of people, this idea probably sounds like a dystopian nightmare, something out of an episode of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5710978/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlack Mirror.‚Äù</a> But as a single 26-year-old living in San Francisco, I was intrigued by the idea, so I set out to try the A.I. dating route myself.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>My strategy included a combination of A.I. apps, websites and subscription services that all promised to improve my dating experience. Some resembled regular dating apps, while others were third-party platforms or coaching services.</p><p>The most popular dating apps have yet to make their A.I. clones available to the public, but a group of smaller start-ups have. To create my clones, most of these apps had me train an A.I. bot through conversation, as if I were texting a close friend. Eventually, the bots personalized their speech and mannerisms to imitate my own, a sort of EliGPT. Then they looked for love.</p><p>The first app I tried, Ice, let me create an A.I. clone trained on the usual dating interests, like hobbies and personality traits. It needed a visual element, too. For that, I spent $45 on a service called <a href="https://www.aragon.ai/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aragon.ai</a> to generate A.I. dating app photos that I uploaded to my profile page.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-3"><div><figcaption><span>Eli Tan‚Äôs A.I.-generated clones.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Ice allowed real users to have conversations with other people‚Äôs clones, and their own clones to have conversations with other real people. (You can tell if you are chatting with a bot or not.) It also let me upload voice memos so that my clone could imitate my voice in conversation.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>I found most of the conversations pretty dry, like talking to a customer service chatbot trained on millennial dating speak. My clone did, however, do a pretty good job of (eerily) imitating my voice, and it held conversations about my favorite bars and restaurants better than I expected.</p><p>But conversations about foods like pizza or mozzarella sticks were a tripwire for my clone‚Äôs embarrassing catchphrases, which didn‚Äôt go over very well with the real humans (I assume) it was trying to chat with.</p><blockquote><p>Eli‚Äôs clone: If you could only eat one snack for the rest of your life, what would it be?</p><p>Rachel: Mozzarella sticks</p><p>Eli‚Äôs clone: Crunchy cheesy bliss!!! What is it about mozzarella sticks that makes your heart skip a beat?</p><p>Rachel: Lol‚Ä¶it gives pizza vibes but with much more cheese. What‚Äôs your go to?</p><p>Eli‚Äôs clone: Expensive cheese and bread all the way! There‚Äôs something about the richness that makes my heart sing. What‚Äôs your fave pizza topping, btw?</p><p>Rachel: Pepperoni. And what do you mean expensive cheese?</p><p>Eli‚Äôs clone: Pepperoni perfection!</p></blockquote><p>The second app I tried, Volar, took a different approach to matchmaking: Clones talked to each other on ‚Äúfirst dates,‚Äù which I could check in on. While my energy for responding to messages on dating apps is fleeting, my clone could message hundreds of profiles a week on its own.</p><p>Once I let my Volar clone go off into the app‚Äôs dating pool, I was surprised by how it took on mannerisms of its own. It had favorite coffee shops and hobbies different from the ones I trained it on. It loved emojis and expressed a deep interest in the Beatles, always looking to introduce its dates to a little-known album called ‚ÄúAbbey Road.‚Äù</p><blockquote><p>Eli‚Äôs clone: Hey there! üòä If you could only listen to one album for the rest of your life, what would it be?</p><p>Another clone: Hey Eli! Hmm I‚Äôd probably say anything by Fleetwood Mac. How about you?</p><p>Eli‚Äôs clone: Solid choice! üòÑ I‚Äôd probably go with Abbey Road by the Beatles. There‚Äôs just something about it. Are you a fan of festivals?</p><p>Another clone: Absolutely! The experience of live music is just‚Ä¶magical.</p><p>Eli‚Äôs clone: Outside of music, I love exploring parks and hiking trails.</p><p>Another clone: Ever been to one that‚Äôs left you in awe?</p><p>Eli‚Äôs clone: Land‚Äôs End is my favorite spot for a clear-your-mind type walk. The views are unbeatable.</p></blockquote><p>My clone even picked up on my curiosity as a reporter, one time asking a date if it had heard of any good stories for me to write about. Other times, it turned my job against me: When asked if I had read any good books recently, for instance, it responded that I didn‚Äôt read books, only articles about tech.</p><p>To correct the record, I retrained my clone on a few of my favorite novels. But this seemed to have an unintended consequence of causing my clone to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/ai-chatbots-hallucination.html" title="">hallucinate</a> a recent trip I never took, possibly inspired by the writer Haruki Murakami.</p><blockquote><p>Another clone: What‚Äôs your favorite coffee shop you‚Äôve been to?</p><p>Eli‚Äôs clone: Hmm probably Blue Bottle. Big coffee fan here. Ever been to SF? Lots of fun spots!</p><p>Another clone: I haven‚Äôt been to SF yet, but it‚Äôs definitely on my travel list!</p><p>Eli‚Äôs clone: I love to travel, most recently to Japan!</p></blockquote><p>These ‚Äúfirst dates‚Äù between clones rarely helped me understand the human on the other end, and I was disappointed at how formal the conversations felt.</p><p>While my clone-to-clone romance came up short, I found another genre of dating clones I thought might be helpful: A.I. coaches that could help craft messages or give feedback on my profile.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Steve Dean, an online dating consultant who helps clients use apps like Hinge and Tinder, said he believed that A.I. could one day replace 80 percent of his job. While these chatbots aren‚Äôt yet at the level of human coaches, they‚Äôre undoubtedly being used by thousands of people every day as a cheaper and more accessible option, Mr. Dean said.</p><p>The first A.I. coaching app I tried was <a href="https://amori.app/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amori</a>, which let me choose from a menu of A.I. coaches that could provide any dating advice I asked of them. A subscription costs $6.99 a week or $69.99 for a year.</p><p>Amori‚Äôs coaches had their own personalities, together forming a gang of confidants that could help me analyze my dating miscues. There was Christie the Blunt Bestie, who gives ‚Äúsassy, frank advice that‚Äôs straight to the point.‚Äù Ethan the Wingman, who will give ‚Äúspot-on dating tips and make it all a good time.‚Äù Tabitha the Wise Aunt, whose wisdom ‚Äúfeels like learning and getting a hug at once.‚Äù And Sonya the Love Scholar, who has a ‚ÄúPh.D. in the science of dating.‚Äù</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-9"><div><figcaption><span>Eli‚Äôs A.I. dating coaches, clockwise from top left: Christie the Blunt Bestie, Ethan the Wingman, Tabitha the Wise Aunt and Sonya the Love Scholar. </span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Amori let me upload my iMessage and WhatsApp data for conversations with specific people, which my coach then analyzed. In this case, I asked Christie for feedback on texts I had sent to someone I had been hoping to ask out on a date.</p><blockquote><p>Eli: Do you think she might like me romantically, or more as a friend?</p><p>Christie: Watch for signs: does she engage with you often, share personal things, or flirt a bit? Or are her messages more like ‚Äúpal vibes?‚Äù</p><p>Eli: I don‚Äôt know, you tell me. I feel like it‚Äôs a mix of both.</p><p>Christie: She‚Äôs responding positively and appreciating your insights. Doesn‚Äôt scream romance, but it‚Äôs definitely more than ‚Äúhey, buddy!&#34; Not fireworks yet, but there‚Äôs potential.</p><p>Eli: What can I do to get the fireworks going?</p><p>Christie: Start by being a little flirty ‚Äî compliment her in a not-so-obvious way, like mentioning how passionate she seems about her work.</p><p>Eli: Can you help me craft a message to send?</p><p>Christie: Absolutely! How about: ‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôve been thinking about that discussion we had on your documentary ‚Äî it really left an impression on me. How about continuing the chat over coffee sometime?‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>The insights weren‚Äôt terrible, but I wanted to try out the same conversation with a different coach, Ethan, to see if he had any additional advice.</p><blockquote><p>Eli: Ethan, what‚Äôs up my wingman.</p><p>Ethan: Eli, my main man! If it isn‚Äôt the dating legend himself. How‚Äôs everything going on your end?</p><p>Eli: Can you help me with this convo? Trying to feel out if she might like me romantically, or more as a friend. What do you think?</p><p>Ethan: There are definitely undertones of romance. She hinted that running into you the other day was a highlight, sounds pretty telling to me! Keep playing it cool.</p><p>Eli: Can you help me craft a message to send?</p><p>Ethan: ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve really enjoyed chatting with you and would love to continue our conversation over some coffee (or something stronger) sometime. How about we pick a day this week üéâ?‚Äù</p><p>Eli: Way too much, how about something shorter and more direct?</p><p>Ethan: ‚ÄúHey! want to grab a coffee or drink this week? It‚Äôd be fun to hang out in person! ‚òï üçπ‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>I found some of Amori‚Äôs advice or messages passable, but rarely was it better than anything I could have come up with on my own.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The most popular of these A.I. coaching apps is <a href="https://rizz.app/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rizz</a>, which has about 1.5 million monthly users and is meant to be paired with normal dating apps like Hinge. To use Rizz, you can upload screenshots of conversations from those apps and ask it to generate three types of replies to the other person: Genuine üåπ, Rizz ‚ö° or NSFW üòà. A premium subscription costs $9.99 a week.</p><p>‚ÄúThis has always been a thing in dating, sending screenshots to friends, asking for advice,‚Äù Roman Khaves, a co-founder of Rizz, said in an interview. ‚ÄúSo we thought: What if we build a wingman that‚Äôs there for you 24/7?‚Äù</p><p>Dating apps like Hinge give you the option to add prompts to your profile that people can respond to when you match. On my profile, the one people most respond to is: What‚Äôs your go-to karaoke song?</p><p>For over a month, I used Rizz to come up with responses for answers I got to that question, and stuck to whatever reply it generated for me. Here are a few of them:</p><blockquote><p>Match #1: I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm not much of a karaoke fan‚Ä¶</p><p>Rizz ‚ö°: If karaoke isn‚Äôt your thing, how about a duet over coffee instead?</p><p>Match #2: My go to song is Material Girl by Madonna what about you?</p><p>Rizz ‚ö°: Classic choice! Mine‚Äôs gotta be ‚ÄúShallow,‚Äù but only if you promise to be my karaoke partner üé§</p><p>Match #3: Know any good karaoke bars in the city?</p><p>Rizz ‚ö°: I‚Äôve heard great things about that one downtown!</p></blockquote><p>The answers were more serviceable than I expected, and bad enough to maybe even come off as jokes. I managed to go on a few real dates with the help of Rizz‚Äôs A.I. suggestions, but I was usually embarrassed to tell my dates I used A.I. to generate messages.</p><p>By the end of my experiment, I found that A.I. had done little to improve my dating life. While dating app executives are correct that their products can often feel frustrating and time-consuming, another issue is that they feel impersonal. Solving those problems using artificial intelligence feels, to me, like a move in the wrong direction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>For the A.I. companies, the early results have been mixed: Volar shut down in September after it was unable to raise more money, and Ice has since closed its app to the public.</p><p>Arriving early to a date at a bar I had chosen with the help of Anthropic‚Äôs Claude, a regular chatbot, I realized that no matter how effective my A.I. clones were, I would still be the one standing there, by my human self. I didn‚Äôt have an earpiece feeding me lines, and I wasn‚Äôt going to pull out my phone every five minutes to ask Christie or Ethan how the date was going.</p><p>Afterward, I grabbed a slice at Detroit Square Pizza, one of my clone‚Äôs favorite spots, before heading home for the night. A.I. hadn‚Äôt fixed my dating life, but standing in the street as I bit into my slice, the full moon overhead, I had found something else: crunchy, cheesy bliss.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eli Tan is a reporter covering the technology industry and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eli-tan">More about Eli Tan</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span>¬†</span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Are A.I.
