On Wednesday, the group said that if prisoners were not freed, it would kill five hostages for every hour that passed after the ultimatum expired.</p><p>Pakistani officials said that at least 30 militants had been killed in the continuing rescue operation, and that hostages were being held at three separate locations. Mr. Chaudhry said that about 70 to 80 militants had been involved in the attack. Among the hostages who have been rescued, it was unclear whether they were freed as a result of military action or were released by the militants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rescued passengers in Quetta, Pakistan, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Chaudhry said that other hostages had been taken into nearby mountains.</p><p>Independent verification of events remains difficult because the hijacking took place in an isolated region with practically no cell or internet connectivity, restricting the reach of journalists. So far, information has come solely from security officials and the B.L.A. The Pakistani military, which is mainly conducting the rescue operation, has not issued an official statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The train was traveling from Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, to Peshawar.
