Gunmen opened fire, forced the train to halt and took hostages.</p><p>On Wednesday night, Pakistan’s military said that security forces had carried out a rescue operation that secured the hostages’ release and left 33 militants dead.</p><p>Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, the army’s spokesman, told a local broadcaster, <a href="https://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/872861-33-terrorists-killed-25-martyred-in-jaffar-express-operation-ispr-dg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dunya News</a>, that at least 21 passengers had died in the separatists’ assault on the train. He said that no hostages had been killed in the security forces’ rescue operation. The military’s account could not be independently verified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>General Sharif said that four paramilitary soldiers affiliated with the government had died when militants ambushed them near a checkpoint. He provided no details on casualties among other security forces. Some passengers, he said, fled in different directions during the chaos and were being accounted for.</p><p>The B.L.A. insisted that it was still holding more than 100 hostages and claimed to have killed dozens of soldiers. That account, too, could not be confirmed. The hijacking took place in an area with little or no cell or internet service, making it difficult to gather independent information.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rescued passengers in Quetta, Pakistan, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The train was traveling on Tuesday from Quetta, the capital of Balochistan Province, to Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, with scheduled stops in several cities, including Lahore and Rawalpindi, near Islamabad.</p><p>Noman Ahmed, a steelworker originally from Gujranwala district in Punjab Province, was aboard the ill-fated train, hoping to return home for Eid with his family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>About 100 miles from Quetta, his journey took a terrifying turn. “When we heard the blast, we dropped to the floor and locked the carriage door, hoping to escape the gunfire,” Mr. Ahmed said in a telephone interview.</p><p>Moments later, a militant appeared. “He ordered everyone out, threatening to blow up the carriage with a rocket launcher,” Mr. Ahmed said.</p><p>The gunmen separated women and the elderly from the rest of the passengers, who were forced to move toward a nearby hillside, Mr. Ahmed said. Some injured passengers remained inside the train, he said.</p><p>“They ordered them to come out,” Mr. Ahmed said. “When they didn’t, the gunmen went in and shot them all.”</p><p>As night fell, the militants began moving hostages in groups of 10 or 12. At dawn, five captives made a daring escape, Mr. Ahmed said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“When the militants entered the train, we ran,” he said. “We ran nearly five miles before reaching a paramilitary checkpoint, where soldiers opened fire on the militants chasing us.”</p><p>“I escaped with my family’s prayers,” Mr. Ahmed added. “I thank God but grieve for those innocent lives lost.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Another passenger on the train, Muhammad Ashraf, said that after the militants had taken all of the passengers hostage, they later released parties traveling with women and children.</p><p>Mr. Ashraf was among a group of 80 passengers who were freed on Tuesday night. He said he had reached a railway station after walking for hours along the tracks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He also recounted harrowing scenes on the train. “When the train was attacked, everyone threw themselves to the floor, using luggage and sacks to shield themselves from the bullets,” Mr. Ashraf said by phone after reaching Quetta. “Screams were echoing everywhere.”</p><p>Balochistan, a large and sparsely populated province that borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long been plagued by separatist violence and insurgent activity. The province is also home to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/world/asia/pakistan-china-attacks.html" title="">major China-led projects</a>, including a strategic port.</p><p>Ethnic separatist groups have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/world/asia/pakistan-baluchistan-violence.html" title="">regained momentum</a>, increasingly attacking security forces and Chinese citizens involved in projects under the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s infrastructure investment program. The separatists accuse Pakistan’s government of allowing China to extract the region’s wealth.</p><p>The B.L.A. has long sought a separate homeland for the Baloch people, arguing that they have been left behind economically and that they would find greater prosperity with more political control.</p><p>Experts say that separatist groups have become increasingly emboldened and sophisticated in their operations, now incorporating tactics such as suicide bombings. That approach was previously associated primarily with Islamist militants, such as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or T.T.P., and the regional Islamic State affiliate, ISIS-K, operating in northwestern Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>A <a href="https://www.visionofhumanity.org/maps/global-terrorism-index/#/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">global terrorism index</a> published by the Institute for Economics and Peace, an international think tank, ranked Pakistan as one of the countries most affected by terrorism last year, second only to Burkina Faso in Africa.</p><p>Along with the T.T.P. and ISIS-K, the Baloch Liberation Army has solidified its position among the 10 deadliest global terrorist organizations on the index, posing a significant challenge to the Pakistani government’s counterterrorism efforts.</p><p>“The ability of the B.L.A. to hijack a train with such precision suggests an advanced intelligence-gathering network and strategic planning,” said Dost Muhammad Barrech, an academic at the University of Balochistan in Quetta.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An injured man in Mach on Wednesday after the train hijacking.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Naseer Ahmed/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Just last week, an alliance of separatist groups, including the B.L.A., announced plans to intensify attacks on Pakistani security forces, infrastructure and Chinese interests in the region.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The B.L.A. has repeatedly targeted Chinese nationals, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/asia/pakistan-chinese-workers.html" title="">a deadly bombing last year</a> near Karachi’s international airport, highlighting the ongoing threat to China’s presence in Pakistan.</p><p>The Jaffar Express has been a frequent target of B.L.A. attacks, primarily because many lower-ranking military personnel and law enforcement officers use it to travel to their hometowns in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province. Baloch separatist groups say that Punjab has an unfair dominance in the central government and the military, fueling tensions in Balochistan.</p><p>In November, passengers waiting for the train were targeted when the B.L.A. carried out one of Pakistan’s deadliest terrorist attacks: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/world/asia/pakistan-suicide-bombing.html" title="">a suicide bombing at Quetta’s busy railway station</a>. The blast killed at least 25 people, including security personnel.</p><p>The Jaffar Express service had resumed only in October after a two-month suspension. In August, B.L.A. militants had blown up sections of the railway tracks, including a colonial-era bridge.</p><p>In the same area, B.L.A. militants have forcibly removed passengers from buses and killed them after identifying them as being from Punjab. Just last month, seven laborers were killed in such an attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“The government was aware that the train is often targeted, yet they still allowed people to travel without adequate security,” said Syed Mustafa, whose mother had been on the train en route to Lahore to attend a wedding. “This is a government failure.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A train at a railway station in Quetta on Wednesday that was carrying empty coffins to the siege site.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>4</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Death Threat  By Militants  In Train Crisis  In Pakistan<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
