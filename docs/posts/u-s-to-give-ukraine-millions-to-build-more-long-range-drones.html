But it has long resisted giving money directly to Ukraine for weapons, instead portraying its support for Kyiv in the war as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/us/pentagon-ammunition-ukraine-russia.html" title="">a way</a> to support American companies and minimize the potential for corruption. U.S. military aid packages to Ukraine have shrunk recently, partly because of concerns about dwindling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/politics/us-weapons-israel-ukraine.html" title="">Pentagon stockpiles</a>.</p><p>In April, <a href="https://thedefensepost.com/2024/09/16/ukraine-locally-howitzers-denmark/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Denmark</a> became the first country to join a Ukrainian campaign called Manufacturing Freedom, which aims to raise $10 billion for the production of Ukrainian weapons. The Danish government agreed to give about $28.5 million to buy weapons from Ukrainian manufacturers. Canada and the <a href="https://mspu.gov.ua/en/news/the-netherlands-and-ukraine-agreed-to-cooperate-on-financial-support-for-ukrainian-arms-manufacturers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Netherlands</a> later signed on.</p><p>More than two and a half years into the war, Mr. Zelensky is trying to reinvigorate Western support in whatever way he can. Russia continues to advance in the east of Ukraine and now occupies about 20 percent of the country despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/politics/russia-casualties-ukraine-war.html" title="">record Russian troop casualties</a> in September, more than 1,200 a day.</p><p>For weeks, Mr. Zelensky has been promoting what he calls a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/europe/zelensky-ukraine-victory-plan-russia.html" title="">victory plan</a>,” visiting the United States and Europe to try to persuade Western leaders to send more weapons and to give Ukraine more of a chance to negotiate with Russia from a position of strength.</p><p>But, so far, no one has signed on to that plan, which relies largely on increased Western support, and Mr. Zelensky’s visits were overshadowed by the war in the Middle East, Hurricane Milton and the looming U.S. election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky told journalists on Monday that U.S. officials were evaluating his plan, but said he did not expect any decision until after the Nov. 5 election. He also said the majority of Ukraine’s NATO allies wanted to invite Ukraine formally to join the military alliance, but a few, including the United States and Germany, were more cautious. Russia has pushed strongly against NATO membership for Ukraine.</p><p>Drones have been crucial for Ukraine’s long-range capabilities, especially while the country has been waiting for the West to sign off on long-range missiles.</p><p>Ukraine’s defense minister, Rustem Umerov, said on Monday that Ukraine had invested more than $4 billion in its defense industry. Appearing alongside the U.S. defense secretary, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/europe/austin-kyiv-ukraine.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Lloyd J. Austin III, in Kyiv</a>, he said that long-range drones could hit targets more than 1,000 miles away and that they had already destroyed more than 200 military facilities in Russia.</p><p>“Our drones have become a real threat to the enemy,” said Mr. Umerov. But he said his country still needed investment from international allies.</p><p>Western officials recently praised Ukrainian drone attacks against ammunition depots near Toropets, a town in western Russia, in late September. The officials said it was one of the best examples of Ukraine’s successfully attacking Russian ammunition dumps, fuel bunkers, command posts and Moscow’s overall ability to supply its forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The officials said the Ukrainian one-way attack drones had hit a series of depots storing Russian ammunition, bombs and missiles, as well as ammunition purchased from North Korea. The first strike, on Sept. 18, was so large it caused an explosion that registered 2.7 on the Richter scale and ignited fires covering an area almost four miles wide.</p><p>Overall, the strikes over several days destroyed an estimated 100,000 tons of ammunition — the largest loss of Russian and North Korean-supplied ammunition since the war started, the officials said.</p><p>On Friday in Brussels, Mr. Austin said that the Ukrainians had used Ukrainian long-range drones to take out “a number of strategic-level ammunition supply points, which has had an impact on the battlefield.” He also said Ukraine could produce those drones in great numbers at a small fraction of the cost of a precision-guided missile and that they “have proven to be very effective and accurate.”</p><p>Lara Jakes<!-- -->, <!-- -->Anastasia Kuznietsova<!-- --> and <!-- -->Oleksandr Chubko<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kim Barker is a Times reporter writing in-depth stories about national issues.<span> </span></p></div><div><p>Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt">More about Eric Schmitt</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>BRICS Summit:</strong> President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who is hosting a gathering of the so-called BRICS group that includes China and India, is hoping to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/europe/russia-china-brics.html">use the meeting as a counterweight to the West</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unwavering Support:</strong> President Biden urged Germany and other Western allies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/world/europe/biden-us-germany-ukraine-war-nato-russia.html">not to waver in their support for Ukraine</a>, using what may be his final trip to Europe as president to bolster the grueling fight against Russia’s invasion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump Blames Zelensky:</strong> Donald Trump blamed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for Russia’s invasion of his country in a podcast interview, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/politics/trump-zelensky-putin-ukraine-war.html">inverting the facts of the largest military action</a> in Europe since the Second World War.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Verify Our Reporting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Our team of visual journalists analyzes satellite images, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/insider/verifying-images-of-the-war-in-ukraine.html">photographs</a>, videos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/28/world/europe/reskin-russian-radio-ukraine-war.html">radio transmissions</a> to independently confirm troop movements and other details.</p></li><li><p>We monitor and authenticate reports on social media, corroborating these with eyewitness accounts and interviews. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html">Read more about our reporting efforts</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
