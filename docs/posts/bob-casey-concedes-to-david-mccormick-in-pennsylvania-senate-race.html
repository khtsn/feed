As Republicans looked to add Pennsylvania to their win column after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/republicans-senate-control.html" title="">seizing control of the Senate</a>, the post-election period <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/us/pennsylvania-election-ballots-recount.html" title="">set off a legal battle</a> between the two sides.</p><p>“This race was one of the closest in our commonwealth’s history,” Mr. Casey said in a statement. “I am grateful to the thousands of people who worked to make sure every eligible vote cast could be counted.”</p><p>In his second time running for Senate in Pennsylvania, Mr. McCormick channeled the sour national mood into a victory over a well-established incumbent in a top battleground state. Republicans will now hold a 53-to-47 advantage in the Senate in addition to narrowly controlling the House, giving President-elect Donald J. Trump more flexibility to pursue his agenda.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Perhaps no electoral outcome this year better illustrates the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/democrats-white-working-class-harris.html" title="">Democratic Party’s challenges with white working-class voters</a> than Mr. Casey’s defeat.</p><p>Mr. Casey, a mild-mannered Scranton native and longtime <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/10/08/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-campaign-event-in-support-of-senator-bob-casey-bryn-mawr-pa/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">close ally of President Biden’s</a> — as well as an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/world/americas/28iht-28campaign.3.11504262.html" title="">early supporter</a> of former President Barack Obama’s — is the son of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/31/us/former-gov-robert-p-casey-dies-at-68-pennsylvania-democrat-opposed-abortion.html" title="">popular former governor</a> of Pennsylvania. His family name has long been synonymous with conservative Democrats even as those voters have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/democrats-white-working-class-harris.html" title="">shifted hard against the party</a> in the Trump era.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Casey’s loss was all the more surprising because he had been seen as one of his party’s strongest incumbents, and Democrats in several other tough races — in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/elections/michigan-senate-slotkin-rogers.html" title="">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/tammy-baldwin-eric-hovde-wisconsin-senate.html" title="">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/us/politics/nevada-senate-election-rosen-brown.html" title="">Nevada</a> — managed to prevail.</p><p>He ran as a populist, lashing big corporations for what he called “<a href="https://bobcasey.com/issue/lowering-costs-and-fighting-greedflation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">greedflation</a>” and promising to fight for middle- and working-class Americans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But he faced gale-force headwinds as the presidential race reached its conclusion, and Pennsylvania proved especially difficult for the Democratic Party in federal races this year. Mr. Trump won the state, and Republicans flipped two House seats.</p><p>Mr. McCormick, a West Point graduate who lost the G.O.P. Senate primary race in 2022, found his footing in seeking to tie Mr. Casey to Vice President Kamala Harris. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwLqOA-phiY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He zeroed in</a> on her past support for banning fracking, even though she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-positions.html" title="">no longer holds that view</a> and Mr. Casey <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/16/dave-mccormick/pennsylvania-sen-bob-casey-has-never-called-for-ba/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opposes fracking bans</a>.</p><p>Mr. McCormick, whose wife, Dina Powell McCormick, served in Mr. Trump’s administration, did not shy away from appearing with the former president. But he also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nikki-haley-pennsylvania-voters-emotional-elect-trump-rcna178112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">held events</a> with more traditional Republicans, like Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and presidential candidate. And he tried to make inroads in the moderate Philadelphia suburbs that have recoiled from the Trump-led Republican Party.</p><p>In a statement on Thursday, Mr. McCormick said Mr. Casey had “dedicated his career to bettering our commonwealth,” and he thanked the Casey family before sounding a triumphant note.</p><p>“I am so honored to represent every single citizen in Pennsylvania in the United States Senate and will fight for you every day,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Casey is beloved among many Pennsylvania Democrats, and he won his previous Senate bids by significant margins: 13 percentage points in 2018, nine points in 2012 and 17 percentage points in 2006. That year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/us/politics/08penn.html" title="">he ousted Senator Rick Santorum</a>, a Republican, running at the time as a socially conservative Democrat, though he later moderated those views.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, a Pennsylvania institution, had long been seen by Republicans as a tough opponent.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It feels like an end of an era,” said former Representative Patrick Murphy, a Pennsylvania Democrat. “He’s been an incredible champion for working families, so it’s definitely a solemn moment.”</p><p>Throughout this year’s race, Democrats believed Mr. McCormick had significant political liabilities.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bobcaseyjr/reel/DAr6Ya3tr1J/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">They used</a> conservative positions that he had taken during his 2022 primary against him, especially on abortion rights, an issue he tried to mitigate by emphasizing his opposition to a national abortion ban.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Democrats also cast him as a rich man who was out of touch with the needs of working people.
