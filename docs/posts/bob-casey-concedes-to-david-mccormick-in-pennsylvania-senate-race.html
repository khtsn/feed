As Republicans looked to add Pennsylvania to their win column after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/republicans-senate-control.html" title="">seizing control of the Senate</a>, the post-election period <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/us/pennsylvania-election-ballots-recount.html" title="">set off a legal battle</a> between the two sides.</p><p>“This race was one of the closest in our commonwealth’s history,” Mr. Casey said in a statement. “I am grateful to the thousands of people who worked to make sure every eligible vote cast could be counted.”</p><p>In his second time running for Senate in Pennsylvania, Mr. McCormick channeled the sour national mood into what appears to be a stunning victory over a well-established incumbent in a top battleground state. Republicans are now set to hold a 53-to-47 advantage in the Senate in addition to narrowly controlling the House, giving President-elect Donald J. Trump more flexibility to pursue his agenda.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Casey’s apparent loss was all the more surprising because he had been seen as one of his party’s strongest incumbents, and Democrats in several other tough races — in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/elections/michigan-senate-slotkin-rogers.html" title="">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/tammy-baldwin-eric-hovde-wisconsin-senate.html" title="">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/us/politics/nevada-senate-election-rosen-brown.html" title="">Nevada</a> — managed to prevail.</p><p>He ran as a populist, lashing big corporations for what he called “<a href="https://bobcasey.com/issue/lowering-costs-and-fighting-greedflation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">greedflation</a>” and promising to fight for middle- and working-class Americans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But he faced gale-force headwinds as the presidential race reached its conclusion, and Pennsylvania proved especially difficult for the Democratic Party in federal races this year. Mr. Trump won the state, and Republicans flipped two House seats.</p><p>Mr. McCormick, a West Point graduate who lost the G.O.P. Senate primary race in 2022, found his footing in seeking to tie Mr. Casey to Vice President Kamala Harris. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwLqOA-phiY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He zeroed in</a> on her past support for banning fracking, even though she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-positions.html" title="">no longer holds that view</a> and Mr. Casey <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/16/dave-mccormick/pennsylvania-sen-bob-casey-has-never-called-for-ba/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opposes fracking bans</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. McCormick, a West Point graduate and former hedge fund executive, channeled the sour national mood into what appears set to be a stunning victory over a well-established incumbent.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. McCormick, whose wife, Dina Powell McCormick, served in Mr. Trump’s administration, did not shy away from appearing with the former president.

And he tried to make inroads in the moderate Philadelphia suburbs that have recoiled from the Trump-led Republican Party.</p><p>In a statement on Thursday, Mr. McCormick said Mr. Casey had “dedicated his career to bettering our commonwealth,” and he thanked the Casey family before sounding a triumphant note.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I am so honored to represent every single citizen in Pennsylvania in the United States Senate and will fight for you every day,” he said.</p><p>Throughout the race, Democrats believed Mr. McCormick had significant political liabilities.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bobcaseyjr/reel/DAr6Ya3tr1J/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">They used</a> conservative positions that he had taken during his 2022 primary against him, especially on abortion rights, an issue he tried to mitigate by emphasizing his opposition to a national abortion ban.</p><p>Democrats also cast him as a rich man who was out of touch with the needs of working people.
