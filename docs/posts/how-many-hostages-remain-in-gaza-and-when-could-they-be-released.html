about 250 people were taken into Gaza as hostages, including citizens of Israel, the United States, Britain, Mexico, Thailand and other countries.</p><p>Among the captives were the bodies of 37 people killed in the attack, Israeli officials said. Now, about 100 hostages, living and dead, are still being held in the enclave, officials say.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas.html?smid=url-share" title="">cease-fire deal</a> announced on Wednesday between Israel and Hamas would begin with an initial phase lasting six weeks, and involve the release of 33 hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas.html?smid=url-share" title="">agreement</a> requires Hamas to release three female hostages on Day 1, four more on Day 7 and 26 more over the next five weeks, according to a copy of the document obtained by The New York Times.
