    <h1>Missouri Voters Pass Measure to Protect Abortion Rights and End Ban</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>And Missouri has an especially strong tradition of anti-abortion activism. The current ban, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature, prohibits abortion except to save a woman’s life or to prevent substantial impairment to her physical health, with no exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or fatal fetal anomalies.</p><p>Abortion rights groups worried that the state was more conservative than Michigan and Ohio, where voters passed similar amendments in 2022 and 2023. And Republicans fought bitterly in court to try to stop the measure from going before voters. But abortion rights groups found unexpected popular support, turning in more than twice the number of signatures they needed to put the measure on the ballot, and setting a state record for the most signatures collected in a single day.</p><p>As with those in most other states, the amendment in Missouri allows the state to restrict abortion after fetal viability, the point in pregnancy when a fetus can survive outside the uterus “without extraordinary medical measures.” </p><p>Abortion rights groups have said that the amendment would take effect 30 days after it passed, and that they would then need to go to court to ask that the state’s ban be officially overturned as unconstitutional.</p></div></div>
