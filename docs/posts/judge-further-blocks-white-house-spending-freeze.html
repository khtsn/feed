AliKhan of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, came hours after the Justice Department told a federal judge in Rhode Island who issued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/trump-freeze-blocked.html" title="">a similar order on Friday</a> that the government interpreted his order as applying to all spending nationally, not just to funds for the states that brought that case</p><p>Together, the signals from federal judges amounted to a two-fisted rebuke of the move by the budget office as an overreach that likely lacked legitimate authority.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Trump administration’s “actions in this case potentially run roughshod over a ‘bulwark of the Constitution’ by interfering with Congress’s appropriation of federal funds,” Judge AliKahn wrote in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.276842/gov.uscourts.dcd.276842.30.0_3.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 30-page opinion</a>, adding, “Because the funding freeze threatens the lifeline that keeps countless organizations operational, plaintiffs have met their burden of showing irreparable harm.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While the order issued in the Rhode Island case left ambiguous whether the judge meant it to apply to just the states that brought the case or to all of as much as $3 trillion in funds affected by the freeze order, Judge AliKhan’s order explicitly applied to all federal grants, loans and other spending to which it had been subject.</p><p>Judge AliKhan, a Biden appointee, had signaled hours earlier where she was leaning at the end of a nearly 90-minute hearing, saying she wanted to file the order before an earlier administrative stay expired at 5 p.m. The case before her was brought by charities and other nongovernmental organizations that rely at least in part on federal grants to operate.</p><p>The order was the latest turn in a fast-moving set of events since the Trump administration issued the spending freeze last week, paralyzing groups around the country and prompting chaos. After the legal challenges were filed, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/trump-federal-freeze-funding-news?smid=url-share#federal-freeze-grants" title="">said it had rescinded the O.M.B. memo</a> and asked judges to dismiss the lawsuits as moot.</p><p>But the plaintiffs have presented evidence that the blanket freeze imposed by the memo appears to remain in effect regardless.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Wednesday, the White House press secretary declared on social media that the retraction of the memo “is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze.” The plaintiffs in the case before Judge AliKhan presented statements from various grant recipients over the weekend that they remained unable to retrieve the funds they had been awarded through an online portal.</p><p>The Trump administration has portrayed the spending freeze as an effort to make sure that grants and loans do not violate executive orders Mr. Trump separately issued shortly after taking office in which he sought to end several policies he dislikes, like diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p><p>The case is not challenging those orders themselves. But the plaintiffs have argued that the O.M.B. memo went further, in part by barring nebulous concepts not found in Mr. Trump’s orders, like “wokeness” and in part by requiring a blanket freeze.</p><p>Daniel Schwei, a lawyer for the Justice Department, argued that there was no need for any order because, he said, the government interpreted the one by the judge in Rhode Island as covering the entire landscape.</p><p>But Kevin Friedl, a lawyer for the plaintiffs who works for the advocacy group Democracy Forward, argued that the order in the Rhode Island case could be lifted at any time, so his clients needed additional relief.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Also calling the order “consequential and ill-considered,” he argued that they were being harmed through various means, from a chilling of First Amendment rights to specific problems keeping their doors open without the funds they had been awarded.</p><p>The litigation is complicated by a lack of clarity about the continued block on funding even after the O.M.B. withdrew the memo.</p><p>Mr. Schwei argued that if they were instead doing it because of Mr. Trump’s executive orders or as decisions they made for themselves, it would be improper for the judge to use the lawsuit to intervene. Mr. Friedl urged the judge, however, to recognize the “reality” that the freeze was implemented soon after the O.M.B. memo came down.</p><p>Mr. Friedl also asked the judge to require, as part of the order, that O.M.B. tell all recipients of its original memo that the freeze had been blocked and that they should roll back any steps they had already taken to carry it out. Her final order did just that.</p><p>Mr. Schwei had objected to that idea, saying such an order would be “extraordinarily broad” since it would encompass numerous agencies who were not party to the litigation. He asked her to limit any such order to those particular people or groups.</p><p>“They are requesting this court superintend all federal financial assistance,” he said, and referring to the part of the Constitution that gives Mr. Trump the power to oversee the executive branch, he called the request both an “extraordinary and an overly broad intrusion on agency authority and the president’s Article II authority.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>20</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Federal Judge Says She Will Further Block White House Spending Freeze<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tariffs:</strong> President Trump’s move to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/trump-tariffs-global-economic-order.html">threatening to fracture a world economic order</a> that once revolved around a U.S. economy that prized open investment and free markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> Elon Musk said that Trump believes the U.S. Agency for International Development <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-usaid-agency.html">should be shut down</a>, adding to the questions over the administration’s plans for the agency.</p></li><li><p><strong>DOGE:</strong> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent gave Musk’s representatives at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html">access to the federal payment system</a>, a powerful tool to monitor and potentially limit government spending.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/trump-venezuela-temporary-protected-status.html">ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Venezuelans</a> in the United States, leaving the population vulnerable to potential deportation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Government Web Pages:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/upshot/trump-government-websites-missing-pages.html">More than 8,000 web pages</a> across more than a dozen U.S. government websites have been taken down, as federal agencies rush to heed Trump’s orders targeting diversity initiatives and “gender ideology.”</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
