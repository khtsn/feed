</span> 2-0 to clinch their spot in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> playoffs.</p>

<p>The match, a direct rematch of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> grand final, was the first time two Korean teams have ever met at an international event. It&#39;s also the third time the two sides have met in 2025, a stark contrast to the 2024 season when they only played once.</p>

<p>The win is T1&#39;s <strong>first-ever</strong> over DRX. In five meetings all time, DRX had never lost to them. With the result, T1 also advances to the playoffs of an international event for the first time in the organization&#39;s history.</p>

<p>DRX banned Lotus, a map that T1 has been undefeated on in 2025, while T1 banned Abyss, a map that DRX has not lost on in its last seven outings in VCT play. DRX picked Fracture, a map they beat T1 on twice at Pacific Kickoff, and T1 picked Pearl, a map DRX has played just once this season. That left the series decider to be Haven.</p>

<p>To open the series, <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span> played on Vyse, a pick that&#39;s had polarizing outcomes for the T1 Sentinel player. On Fracture, he dispelled any worries about the pick, picking up a match-high 28 kills, six of which were first kills. Meanwhile, Duelist teammate <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span> picked up nine first kills of his own. </p>

<p>The map came down to the wire, with a less-than-ideal DRX attack half seeing them pick up just six rounds and having their work cut out for them. In the end, aggressive site takes and excellent control of the map saw T1 take the upper hand and steal the opposing map pick.</p>


<p><em>Fracture is T1&#39;s thanks to great five-on-five play.</em></p>

<p>Despite going up against <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/1916/free1ng">
		free1ng	</a>
</span>&#39;s Tejo, Meteor stuck with his usual pick of Killjoy on Pearl. That pick, which gives T1 a significant amount of post-plant utility, appeared to pay dividends. Rocksteady control of the map, combined with his teammates shooting sharp on the day, made for an 8-4 halftime advantage after finishing on defense of the traditionally attack-sided Pearl.</p>


<p><em>Momentum-shifting clutch from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/29833/izu">
		iZu	</a>
</span>.</em></p>

<p>To open their attack half, T1 picked up the pistol round, their third of the series, anti-eco, and bonus. From there, it was smooth sailing as T1 easily cruised to close out the map 13-4. </p>

<p>The map was utterly dominated by T1. At one point, former DRX man BuZz stood up on the stage, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/valorant/clip/FreezingYummyOxRitzMitz-_M5zdVSmMcRjKpDi" target="_blank">shouting</a>, &#34;Who&#39;s the best team in Korea now?&#34; towards a pair of former teammates.</p>

<p>&#34;I&#39;m happy about this win. I wanted to win even more after losing to DRX twice, which I think makes me even happier,&#34; BuZz said. Still, going up against his former team does invoke some emotions from him. &#34;When we lost to them I was sad but also happy for them. Winning now is a good feeling, but eliminating them does bring some mixed emotions.&#34;</p>

<p>BuZz isn&#39;t the only former DRX player now in T1&#39;s ranks. In-game leader <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/485/stax">
		stax	</a>
</span> also made the switch, albeit a little earlier, having changed teams before <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2005/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-2/regular-season" target="_blank">Pacific Stage 2</a> in 2025.</p>

<p>&#34;I always had that confidence that we can beat DRX, I have faith in our roster,&#34; stax said. &#34;It&#39;s just a little bit frustrating that it took us so long to do it.&#34;</p>

<p>T1 flex player iZu recorded a map-high 20 kills on Pearl, with no other player having more than 15. He ended the series with a server-high rating of 1.34, while Meteor&#39;s 42 kills were topped by nobody.</p>

<p>T1 moves onto the playoffs as a 2-1 team, meaning they will be matched up against one of <span data-ref-id="7">
