		<p>Paper Rex has defeated Trace Esports 3-0 in the Radiant Asia lower final. They will next play against DFM in the grand final, a rematch of the upper final. Trace has been eliminated from the tournament, finishing in third place after taking out DRX earlier in the bracket. </p>

<p>The match began on Split, with Paper Rex taking a quick 13-5 on their first map pick. Paper Rex then won Ascent 13-4, winning the mirror match in dominant fashion. A closer Sunset followed, but the Southeast Asian squad recovered to win the map 13-11 and take the series 3-0.</p>

<p>Paper Rex will now need to face off against an undefeated DFM, who came out on top 2-0 in their previous upper final matchup. </p>
