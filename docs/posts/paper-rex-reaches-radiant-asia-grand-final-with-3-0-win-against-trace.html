In <a href="https://wck.org/en-us/news/gaza-air-strike-november" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a>, the aid group said that it “had no knowledge that any individual in the vehicle had alleged ties” to the Hamas-led attack.</p><p> “To the best of our knowledge, no WCK team members are affiliated with Hamas,” the spokeswoman, Linda Roth, said in an email.</p><p> The Israeli military declined to comment on the two other workers World Central Kitchen reported were killed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The aid group said it was pausing operations in Gaza, where a dire humanitarian crisis is unfolding for some two million people. The organization took a similar action in April, after seven of its workers were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/world/middleeast/world-central-kitchen-workers-strike-gaza.html" title="">killed in an Israeli airstrike</a>.</p><p>The Israeli military <a href="https://x.com/IDF/status/1862866906329260236" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Saturday that the person it targeted in the latest strike had taken part in the Oct. 7 attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz, an Israeli village near the Gaza border where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/world/middleeast/nir-oz-israel-hostages.html" title="">dozens of people were abducted</a>. He had been monitored by Israeli “intelligence for a while and was struck following credible information regarding his real-time location,” the military said.</p><p>It added that it had targeted “a civilian unmarked vehicle, and its movement on the route was not coordinated for transporting of aid.”</p><p>Ms. Roth said that the vehicle was not branded, and that the aid group was investigating the situation.</p><p>COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for coordinating aid deliveries into Gaza, <a href="https://x.com/cogatonline/status/1862889109477298526" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said it had demanded</a> that World Central Kitchen investigate its hiring practices after the strike on the vehicle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The aid group said it thoroughly vetted its workers. “All World Central Kitchen contractors are queried against the U.S. government’s OFAC list,” Ms. Roth said, referring to a U.S. Treasury list of people, institutions and countries considered national security threats. “Staff employees undergo additional background checks.”</p><p>The strike and the accusation that followed threatened to reignite tensions between Israeli officials and humanitarian leaders, who have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-us-israel.html" title="">criticized each other</a> over a year of war and worsening conditions in Gaza. Relief groups have accused Israel of allowing too few supplies into the territory and hindering the flow of aid; Israeli officials say they do not restrict the amount of aid that can enter Gaza and argue that aid agencies should be doing more.</p><p>Aid workers operating in Gaza also face the dangers of the ongoing war and widespread lawlessness in the territory. A large convoy of trucks was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-convoy-looted-unrwa-israel.html" title="">“violently looted” in Gaza</a> this month, according to the main U.N. agency that helps Palestinians, known as UNRWA.</p><p>The Israeli attack on the contractors associated with World Central Kitchen, a disaster relief organization founded by the celebrity chef José Andrés, left the group once again to grapple with the loss of its workers in the Gaza war zone.</p><p>In early April, the group suspended work in Gaza and across the region after the airstrike that killed seven of its workers. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After an investigation, the Israeli military called that attack a “grave mistake&#34; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/05/world/middleeast/israel-military-world-central-kitchen-strike.html" title="">cited a series of failures</a>, including a breakdown in communication and violations of the military’s operating procedures.</p><p>The aid group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/28/world/middleeast/world-central-kitchen-gaza-aid.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">resumed operations a few weeks later</a> with local Palestinian employees, and it remains one of several aid providers that have operated in the territory, which faces a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/gaza-malnourished-famine-warnings.html" title="">high risk of famine</a> and crises of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/middleeast/gaza-civilians-deaths-israel-war.html" title="">mass displacement</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/world/middleeast/gaza-war-hepatitis-polio.html" title="">disease</a> under conditions of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/middleeast/gaza-displaced-winter-tents.html" title="">wintry weather</a> and continued fighting.</p><p>In March, World Central Kitchen became the first group in nearly 20 years to deliver aid to Gaza by sea, briefly using a makeshift jetty fashioned from rubble. The U.S. military also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/us/politics/gaza-pier-aid.html" title="">attempted to use a temporary pier</a> to get aid into Gaza, but shut down the project this summer because of rough seas.</p><p>Israel has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/world/middleeast/unrwa-oct-7-attack.html" title="">accused a handful of UNRWA employees</a> of participating in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks. U.N. investigators in August cleared 10 employees of the agency, which says it submits its employees’ information to Israel, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/world/middleeast/unrwa-oct-7-attack.html" title="">fired nine other workers</a> because of possible involvement.</p><p>Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations criticized the investigation, and in October the Israeli lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/middleeast/israel-unrwa-ban-gaza.html" title="">passed two laws that could threaten its work</a> by barring operations in the country.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>10</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Israel Says Food Aid Worker Whom It Killed Took Part in Oct. 7 Attack   <span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
