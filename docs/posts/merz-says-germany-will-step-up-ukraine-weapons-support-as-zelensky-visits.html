The value was roughly 5 billion euros, or about $5.7 billion, it said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky was visiting Berlin in a bid to secure more assistance from Europe’s industrial powerhouse, and holding his third meeting with Mr. Merz since the German leader took office this month. His trip came as both Moscow and Ukraine race to expand their arsenals to fight a war that is set to drag into a fourth straight summer.</p><p>The meetings between Mr. Merz and Mr. Zelensky underscores the chancellor’s efforts to reestablish German leadership among European allies in the face of weakening U.S. commitments to NATO, and the importance his country will play in sustaining the Ukrainian war effort.</p><p>Germans themselves have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/europe/germany-ukraine-aid-scholz.html" title="">generally divided</a> on whether the country should keep supporting Ukraine. While some feel the defense of Ukraine is important for European security, many in the east and many far-right voters support Russia or fear provoking it.</p><p>The German economy is also in crisis, which has put pressure on German governments. But a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/europe/germany-debt-brake.html" title="">move in March</a> to loosen borrowing limits on the government — freeing it to spend more on defense and infrastructure — could bolster Mr. Merz’s efforts to send more aid to Ukraine without forcing him to make budget cuts elsewhere.</p><p>At the news briefing, Mr. Zelensky said he felt that Ukraine should be invited to a NATO summit that is set to take place in The Hague this summer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“If Ukraine is not present at the NATO summit,” he said, “it will be a victory not over Ukraine, but over NATO — a victory for Putin.” He did not say if he and Mr. Merz had discussed the issue, and said it was up to NATO to make that decision.</p><p>Before traveling to Germany, Mr. Zelensky had said that securing financing to expand Ukraine’s domestic arms production will be a central goal.</p><p>“We need financial support,” Mr. Zelensky told reporters on Tuesday at a briefing in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. “That’s the biggest issue — not technology limits or lack of long-range weapons. It’s about money.”</p><p>In his <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vzhe-sotni-ukrayinskih-kompanij-dayut-rezultati-dlya-sil-obo-98085" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tuesday evening address</a> to the nation, Mr. Zelensky listed the equipment his country needed: “Attack drones, interceptors, cruise missiles, Ukrainian ballistic systems — these are the key elements. We must manufacture all of them.”</p><p>After years traveling the world in search of weapons to help his nation battle a far larger enemy, Mr. Zelensky said at the briefing on Tuesday that Kyiv now needed some $30 billion in annual financing to fund its domestic arms production at full capacity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Wednesday lashed out at Mr. Merz’s promise of more military aid to Ukraine. “Germany is sliding down the same slope that it has already been moving down a couple of times in the last century, toward its collapse,” Mr. Lavrov said in an interview with Russian state television. “I hope that responsible politicians in this country will finally draw the right conclusions and stop this madness,” he added.</p><p>With neither side able to achieve major breakthroughs on the front for more than two years and Russia once again on the offensive, the arms race takes on ever greater importance, said Seth G. Jones, a former Defense Department official who closely tracks the war.</p><p>“In wars of attrition, victory has frequently gone to the side with the more productive defense industrial base,” he said.</p><p>The industrial dimension of the war, Mr. Jones noted, is also to a great extent a proxy war.</p><p>“On one side is the Ukrainian defense industrial base, with aid from Europe and the United States,” he said. “On the other side is the Russian industrial base, with aid from China, Iran and North Korea.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>A key variable in the year ahead, he said, will be whether both sides can maintain their foreign industrial assistance.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>With the Trump administration so far unwilling to approve new military assistance for Ukraine and European allies struggling to fill the void, expanding sanctions, Mr. Zelensky said Tuesday, is “a crucial step” in slowing Russian forces down.</p><p>Still, he insisted that Moscow cannot afford to wage war indefinitely.</p><p>“Multiple intelligence analyses agree: We all hope that by June 2026, the war will be over,” he said. “But even now, sanctions are affecting the Russian economy.”</p><p>Mr. Zelensky arrived at the chancellery in a motorcade of black limousines, escorted by police officers on motorcycles. Wearing a black suit and a button-down shirt, he was greeted by Mr. Merz, and then a German military band played the national anthems of both countries.</p><p>Mr. Merz has supported expanded sanctions to force President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to agree to a cease-fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>At the moment, Russia’s military industrial complex continues to expand, and the Kremlin is able to replenish its forces at a far faster rate than Ukraine.</p><p>In recent months, Mr. Zelensky said at the briefing Tuesday, Russia has been able to recruit 40,000 to 50,000 new soldiers, while Ukraine is mobilizing 25,000 to 27,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tanks displayed during the Victory Day parade in Moscow this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The White House has so far resisted taking any steps to pressure Moscow, maintaining that it would undermine diplomacy. After Russia’s most recent bombardments — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kyiv.html" title="">some of the largest of the war</a> — President Trump lashed out at Mr. Putin, saying he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/us/politics/trump-putin.html" title="">had gone “crazy.”</a></p><p>Mr. Trump expressed renewed frustration with the Russian leader on Tuesday, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114580564427808609" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writing on social media</a> that “if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Still, Mr. Trump gave no indication of what steps he was willing to take to pressure the Kremlin and has made it clear that he expects Europe to take the lead in supporting Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Merz’s warm embrace of Mr. Zelensky stands in stark contrast to the initially cool relationship that Olaf Scholz, the previous German chancellor, had with the Ukrainian leader. Mr. Scholz did not visit Ukraine until a year after Russia invaded. But just three days after being sworn in this month, Mr. Merz traveled to Ukraine.</p><p>While both Russian and Ukraine are ramping up arms production, they are also locked in a ferocious campaign to degrade each other’s military industrial complex through both overt and covert actions.</p><p>The Russian Ministry of Defense reported on Wednesday that it had shot down nearly 300 Ukrainian drones in an overnight attack aimed at military-industrial targets. The Ukrainian Air Force said the latest Russian bombardment before dawn on Wednesday featured 88 drones, five ballistic missiles and a cruise missile.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said that even as Kyiv stands ready to continue negotiations in almost any format, the only way to achieve peace is to raise the cost of war for the Kremlin.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky told the reporters Tuesday that he remained ready for a direct meeting with Mr. Putin, or a meeting with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. “If Putin only wants a tri-party format, that’s fine too. I see no problem with formats; the key is substance.”</p><p>Nataliya Vasilyeva<!-- --> and <!-- -->Alina Lobzina<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
