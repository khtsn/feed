</span>2-0.</p>

<p>The two-map series was played out on Icebox and Abyss. Icebox was Leviátan&#39;s map pick, while Abyss was G2&#39;s pick. </p>

<p>Leviátan won Icebox 16-14, and then ran away with Abyss 13-5.</p>

<p>Icebox is one of Leviátan&#39;s best maps this year. Entering Thursday, they were 12-3 on the map, but two of those three losses came against G2. </p>

<p>G2 came out with the zero-duelist team comp that they&#39;ve often played on Icebox this year, which puts <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/8402/icy">

</span> on Gekko and <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/7873/leaf">
		leaf	</a>
</span> on Killjoy. </p>

<p>G2&#39;s in-game leader <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/3885/valyn">
		valyn	</a>
</span> orchestrated a fantastic start to the opening rounds of the map, pushing and pulling at the Leviátan players to bring them to a 5-1 lead early on.</p>

<p>A moment of heroism from Leviátan IGL <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/8549/kingg">
		kiNgg	</a>
</span>, with his team down 3-6, helped level the playing field for his side, despite him being detained by icy&#39;s Gekko Thrash.</p>


<p><em>kiNgg and tex hold down B main.</em></p>

<p>G2&#39;s attack-side game plan of avoiding the gun barrel of <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/8480/aspas">
		aspas	</a>
</span> was successful. The duelist finished with just one operator kill on the map. </p>

<p>Facing an 8-4 deficit at halftime, the reigning Americas champions had their work cut out.</p>

<p>When the teams switched sides, the keys were put into kiNgg&#39;s hands. Leviátan continued to play well in the gun rounds, despite falling victim to two G2 thrifty rounds. </p>

<p>The map was razor-thin, with very little separating the two teams. G2 claimed four defensive rounds after their opponents came out with a hot 7-1 start to the half, bringing the two teams to 12-12.</p>

<p>The last time these two teams went into overtime on Icebox, G2 prevailed 14-12.</p>

<p>The trend of this match being attack-sided continued into overtime. In round 29, with the teams knotted at 14 apiece, Leviátan clinched a close round, giving them an upper hand to clinch the map 16-14.</p>

<p>After a shaky showing on their map pick, the Americas champions dominated G2 on their own pick. </p>


<p><em>An early 4K from LEV kiNgg helped set the tone for a Leviátan win.</em></p>

<p>Leviátan owns a 66 percent win rate on the defense side of Abyss, and that percentage stayed put, with the half ending 8-4 in their advantage.</p>

<p>On the map, the play of <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/619/c0m">
		C0M	</a>
</span> and kiNgg locked down the A site on defense. Both players finished at the top of the team&#39;s leaderboard, with 20 and 19 kills, respectively.</p>

<p>After Leviátan won their opening pistol round on the attacking half, all five of G2&#39;s players <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/BreakableImpartialOilRuleFive-gHkzBDsJh5CDwMdb" target="_blank">ran off of the map</a>. The puzzling decision didn&#39;t pay off, as Leviátan converted their following bonus round to go up 11-4. </p>

<p>From that point forward, Leviátan was cruising. Despite duelist aspas only finding one first blood across both maps, his supporting cast shone through, guiding the team to a 13-5 victory and a 2-0 series sweep.</p>

<p>G2 head coach <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/52/joshrt">
		JoshRT	</a>
</span> chalked his team&#39;s performance on Abyss to being a byproduct of the Icebox result.</p>

<p>“We lost a close one. I could tell the nerves were a little high. Going into the next game, we tried to mentally reset, and you just forget a few things,” he said.</p>

<p>No members of G2 finished Abyss with more kills than deaths. </p>

<p>“[Leviátan] is such a good team that they&#39;ll capitalize and they&#39;ll punish you for making those mistakes,” he went on to say.</p>

</span>, elaborated after the match that it was a fun one.</p>

<p>“It feels amazing to beat them, not gonna lie,” tex said following the match. “They&#39;re my old team so of course there&#39;s always a little rivalry there. Not only are they my friends, but they&#39;re a good team so it&#39;s like beating my friends and a good team. It feels amazing.”</p>

<p>He spoke on the friendship he still holds with many members of them, from joking with each other in the lobby to friendly trash talk before matches.</p>

<p>“But it&#39;s never easy. Well, Abyss was kind of easy – for them, not for me,” tex said, motioning to his teammates sitting beside him. He finished the map 5-15.</p>
