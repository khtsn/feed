Big banks, responding to pressure campaigns from activists, had announced they were going to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/business/jp-morgan-prisons.html" title="">stop issuing new loans to the companies.</a> The newly elected president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., had vowed on the campaign trail to end contracts with the companies.</p><p>The industry’s time in the wilderness turned out to be short lived.</p><p>Despite Mr. Biden’s pronouncements, most federal contracts with private detention companies remained untouched. The banking giants Bank of America and Wells Fargo over the past two years have softened their policy statements to allow financing again for detention companies in some circumstances, after some Republican-led states passed laws aimed at forbidding the blacklisting of certain industries.</p><p>And that was before President Trump took office, having promised repeatedly during the campaign that he would swiftly rid the country of millions of undocumented immigrants. The process <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/trump-immigration-deportations-arrests.html" title="">will necessitate detaining</a> immigrants for weeks or months as they await a ruling from an immigration judge or transportation out of the country — with private companies standing to gain.</p><p>On Wednesday, CoreCivic announced it was reopening a shuttered family detention center in Dilley, Texas, that holds up to 2,400 children and parents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the earliest weeks of the second Trump presidency, immigrant detention has already started to swell.
