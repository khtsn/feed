The invasion was in response to months of rocket attacks by the Iranian-backed militants in support of the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, which kicked off a year of back-and-forth attacks. Israel said its goal was to clear the border area of Hezbollah fighters, weapons and tunnels.</p><p>Under the proposal, the Lebanese Army — which is not a combatant in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict — would fill the vacuum in southern Lebanon. United Nations peacekeepers who monitored an earlier truce would also be present. But many questions about the proposal remain unanswered, including how the Lebanese army would exert authority over the powerful militants.</p><p>In the past two months, Israeli forces have advanced several miles into many parts of southern Lebanon’s border area, raiding many towns and villages with a strong Hezbollah presence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="lebanon-israeli-advances-map" data-id="100000009846024" data-source-id="100000009846024"><div slug="lebanon-israeli-advances-map" data-sourceid="100000009846024" id="embed-id-100000009846024">
