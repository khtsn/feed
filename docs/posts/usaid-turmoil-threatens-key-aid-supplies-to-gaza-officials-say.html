The team that organizes emergency aid supplies in dozens of crisis zones around the world each year, of which Gaza was just one, is down to just 70 staff members from more than 1,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This is expected to slow or prevent the delivery of food packages to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, as well as tents, mattresses, blankets, hygiene kits and medical treatment, according to three officials and an aid worker. All four people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.</p><p>While the aid agency does not operate inside Gaza, it has provided roughly $1 billion in aid to international aid groups on the ground since the war began in October 2023 — about a third of the total aid response, <a href="https://fts.unocha.org/countries/171/summary/2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the United Nations</a>. Hundreds of millions of dollars have yet to be disbursed and now may never be transferred to United Nations agencies and other major aid organizations, three officials said.</p><p>“They’re making an already fragile cease-fire more fragile,” said Dave Harden, a former U.S.A.I.D. mission director for Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. “Lifesaving aid to Gaza is going to be disrupted.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A U.S. soldier inspecting aid supplies last year before they were moved to a ship at the port of Larnaca, Cyprus, bound for the enclave.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Petros Karadjias/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The State Department, which oversees the aid agency, declined to comment. The agency’s director in Jerusalem referred reporters to the U.S.A.I.D. press department, which did not respond to requests for comment. It was unclear if it was still operational.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The World Food Program, the International Organization for Migration and the International Medical Corps, all of which distribute aid or run projects in Gaza funded by U.S.A.I.D., also declined to comment. </p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-marco-rubio-with-rich-edson-of-fox-news/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a television interview</a> this week that the moves were “not about getting rid of foreign aid,” but an attempt to prevent “rank insubordination” by uncooperative workers.</p><p>The Trump administration says the agency wastes taxpayers’ money on costly and unfocused overseas programs that do little for the American people.</p><p>Mr. Rubio <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368274875112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that</a> agency employees “take taxpayer money and they spend it as a global charity irrespective of whether it is in the national interest.”</p><p>Officials interviewed for this article said that the aid to Gaza was a clear example of how the agency’s work was helping to further President Trump’s stated foreign policy goals. He has repeatedly called for an extension of the cease-fire, which is partly dependent on the smooth flow of aid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The virtual collapse of U.S.A.I.D. is expected to remove a key form of oversight over that aid delivery. The agency is set to lay off officials who monitor the distribution of supplies within the territory, three officials said, making it harder for the United States to assess who controls and receives the aid within areas run by Hamas.</p><p>It is also likely to sideline officials who previously coordinated between the Israeli military, the Egyptian government, the United Nations and private aid groups, helping various parties to troubleshoot problems in the supply chain and prevent soldiers from mistakenly firing on aid convoys. An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, confirmed the importance of the aid agency’s coordination role and said it was unclear which institution would step in to fill it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Carrying flour in Gaza.
