Kennedy, was not among the many people poring over the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/18/us/jfk-mlk-rfk-assassination-files" title="">new trove of government files</a> about Kennedy’s assassination when it was released on Tuesday. Instead, Mr. Schlossberg was on social media criticizing President Trump, Republican lawmakers and the news media over the handling of the files.</p><p>Mr. Schlossberg, 32, the son of the president’s daughter, Caroline Kennedy, and an outspoken voice in Democratic politics, has long been a critic of the Trump administration and its policies. During last year’s election cycle, he made a series of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/politics/rfk-jr-jack-schlossberg.html" title="">comedic TikTok posts</a> that mocked Republican candidates, as well as his second cousin, Robert Kennedy Jr.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/politics/rfk-jr-jack-schlossberg.html" title="">,</a> who was then running for president as an independent. But the unsealing of 64,000 pages of files about his grandfather’s assassination, under an executive order from President Trump, made the political personal.</p><p>In a series of posts on X that were fiery even by Mr. Schlossberg’s standards, he said that the Trump administration did not give anyone in President Kennedy’s family a “heads up” before the documents were released. <a href="https://x.com/JBKSchlossberg/status/1902151213694505313" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“A total surprise, and not shocker!!” he wrote.</a></p><p>The Trump administration did not immediately reply to a request for comment about Mr. Schlossberg’s assertion that the Kennedys had not been advised on the release ahead of time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Beyond his own online thread about the files, Mr. Schlossberg also took issue with a post on X from Mike Lee, the senior senator from Utah and a Republican, who asked the question, “Why did it take so long to release the JFK files?” Mr. Schlossberg responded, “You really care about JFK’s legacy? You’re dismantling it.”</p><p>Mr. Schlossberg, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/style/jack-schlossberg-vogue-correspondent.html" title="">hired last July as political correspondent for Vogue</a>, was also critical of the news media’s extensive coverage of the decades-old documents. Standing in front of a wall-mounted TV tuned to CNN, in which the political correspondent Harry Enten and the anchor Erin Burnett were discussing the J.F.K. files as breaking news, <a href="https://x.com/JBKSchlossberg/status/1902149454591095016" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Schlossberg said in a video post</a>, “There’s so much actual news. Why are you covering this? … Stop.”</p><p>Mr. Schlossberg saved his harshest criticism for President Trump. He said that Mr. Trump has an “obsession” with his grandfather’s death but not his life or his policies. For instance, Mr. Schlossberg noted that the U.S. Agency for International Development, or U.S.A.I.D, the agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/us/politics/usaid-funding-trump-fact-check.html" title="">the Trump administration has recently dismantled through job cuts</a> and the freezing of foreign aid, was created by President Kennedy, in 1961.</p><p>Reached on Wednesday, Mr. Schlossberg declined to comment beyond what he had said on social media.</p><p>The American public has long had a fascination with the Kennedy assassination. In 1992, after the Oliver Stone film “JFK” led to a surge of interest (and conspiracy theories), Congress passed a law directing the National Archives and Records Administration to gather in one place all known U.S. government records relating to the Kennedy assassination. The law required all documents to be released within 25 years. About 99 percent of the known Kennedy papers have since been publicly disclosed, according to the National Archives.</p><p>For Mr. Schlossberg, the assassination of his grandfather is both a national tragedy and an ongoing distraction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“For decades, conspiracies surrounding his death have shifted focus away from the important lessons of his life and the critical issues of the moment,” Mr. Schlossberg once wrote. “They continue to do so today.”</p><p>Mr. Schlossberg didn’t write those words on X yesterday, but <a href="https://time.com/5003919/jfk-assassination-files-conspiracy-distraction/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Time magazine</a> — in 2017.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Deportations:</strong> The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-venezuela-deportations-doj-court-order.html">asked a federal judge to dissolve the orders he put in place</a> barring it from deporting suspected members of a Venezuelan street gang from the country under a rarely invoked wartime statute called the Alien Enemies Act.</p></li><li><p><strong>Medical Research at Columbia:</strong> Dozens of medical and scientific studies are ending or at risk of ending, leaving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/nyregion/columbia-research-grants-trump.html">researchers scrambling to find alternative funding</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Military Academies:</strong> President Trump moved to stack the boards overseeing U.S. military service academies with conservative activists and political allies, including Michael T.
