Each of the militant groups Israel is concurrently fighting is backed by Iran. The indirectness was always by design: Despite being regional rivals, each <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/iran-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">wanted to avoid</a> what was sure to be a costly, existential direct confrontation.</p><p>Now, with Israel planning a retaliatory attack after Iran’s ballistic missile barrage of unprecedented scale and scope on Oct. 1, a war seems more likely, alarming the international community and countries in the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is why a war is so concerning.</p><h3 id="link-27cfd574"><span>Israel and Iran have two of the region’s most formidable militaries.</span></h3><p>Israel has one of the world’s most technologically advanced militaries and is among the <a href="https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/2404_fs_milex_2023.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">top military spenders</a> globally as a share of gross domestic product. Israel’s arms industry produces weapons at such a high capacity that last year it produced enough to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/world/middleeast/israel-weapons-stockpiles.html" title="">export a record amount</a> despite its war in Gaza, according to researchers. Israel is also heavily backed by the United States, which has supplied more than 29,000 guided bombs, artillery rockets and assorted missiles since 2009.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Iranian Revolutionary Guard members march at a parade in Tehran last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Iran’s armed forces are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/world/middleeast/iran-israel-military-weapons.html" title="">among the largest in the Middle East,</a> with at least 580,000 active-duty personnel and about 200,000 reservists, <a href="https://www.iiss.org/en/publications/the-military-balance/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to an assessment</a> last year by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Iran has made the development of precision and long-range missiles a priority for decades and has amassed one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region. The country also has a sizable inventory of drones, with ranges of up to 1,550 miles and the ability to fly low to evade radar.</p><h3 id="link-2af46e94"><span>A war could draw in the U.S. and Gulf States.</span></h3><p>A spiraling conflict between Iran and Israel, one of the United States’ closest allies, could pull U.S. forces positioned throughout the region into the fray. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, <a href="https://x.com/araghchi/status/1847386184806527435" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a social media post</a> that “anybody with knowledge or understanding” of Israel’s plans to attack Iran should be held accountable. President Biden has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/politics/us-intelligence-israel-iran.html" title="">indicated</a> that he is aware of Israel’s plans.</p><p>Senior Pentagon officials have been debating whether the increased U.S. military presence, intended to avert a wider war, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/troops-mideast-israel-war.html" title="">has been inflaming</a> the regional conflict by emboldening Israel. The Defense Department said in late September that it was sending a few thousand <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-deploys-troops-middle-east.html" title="">additional U.S. troops</a> to the region, to bolster the 40,000 who are in place. This month, the United States sent Israel an advanced missile defense system known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, with about 100 American troops to help operate it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit deployed last year in Guam during a multinational joint military exercise.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

Iran’s mission to the United Nations warned in a statement this month that “should any country render assistance to the aggressor, it shall likewise be deemed an accomplice and a legitimate target.”</p><h3 id="link-545decdf"><span>The economic fallout could be devastating.</span></h3><p>Israel has told the United States that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/middleeast/israel-iran-oil-nuclear-sites-retaliation.html" title="">will not attack Iran’s nuclear or oil facilities</a> in its expected attack. Even so, that assurance does not preclude Israel from taking aim at Iran’s oil installations in any future rounds of escalation, and the fallout could be immensely destabilizing for the global economy.</p><p>Though highly unlikely, an Israeli strike on Iran’s oil facilities could prompt Iran or its proxies to target refineries in Saudi Arabia or the U.A.E. Another remote scenario that analysts fear is Iran threatening the passage of tankers through the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/07/business/economy/iran-strait-of-hormuz-tankers.html" title="">Strait of Hormuz</a>, through which oil produced in the Persian Gulf is shipped to the world.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/business/middle-east-conflict-economic-risks.html" title="">A shock to the global oil supply</a> could lead to surging gas prices, dampen hiring and investment and push economies toward recession. The reverberations would be particularly damaging for poorer nations that depend on imported oil.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mural in Palestine Square in Tehran on Wednesday shows photos of hostages in Gaza.
