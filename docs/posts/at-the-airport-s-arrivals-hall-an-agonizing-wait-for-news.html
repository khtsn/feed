It was landing at Muan International Airport in the country’s southwest when it crashed around 9 a.m. local time. Footage of the accident shows a white-and-orange plane speeding down a runway on its belly until it overshoots the runway, hitting a barrier and exploding into an orange fireball.</p><div><p>Two crew members were rescued from the aircraft’s tail section, but by Sunday evening, the other people on board had all been confirmed dead. Officials were investigating what caused the tragedy, including why the plane’s landing gear appeared to have malfunctioned, whether birds had struck the jet, or if bad weather had been a factor.</p><p>The airport in Muan had warned the plane’s pilots about a potential bird strike as they were landing, said Ju Jong-wan, a director of aviation policy at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The plane issued a mayday alert shortly afterward, then crash-landed, he added, saying later that the plane’s black boxes — which could help determine the cause of the crash — have been recovered.</p><p>Jeju Air flight 7C2216 had 175 passengers and six crew members on board. Hundreds of people — grandparents, parents and children — packed the Muan airport <a href="#at-the-airports-arrivals-hall-an-agonizing-wait-for-news" title="">waiting anxiously</a> for news about their loved ones.</p><p>More than 1,500 people were deployed to help search the wreckage. As investigators worked to identify the bodies, officials posted lists in the airport of the names that had been confirmed and collected DNA from relatives.</p><p>Lee Jeong-hyeon, an official in charge of search and rescue operations at the scene, said the plane had broken into so many pieces that only its tail was identifiable.</p><p>“We could not recognize the rest of the fuselage,” he said.</p><p><strong>Here’s what else to know about the crash:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Photos from the South Korean news agency Yonhap showed a tail section of the plane separated and engulfed in orange flames with black smoke billowing up. The plane appears to have hit a concrete wall, according to the photos.</p></li><li><p>The crash of the Jeju Air jet was most likely the deadliest worldwide since that of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/world/asia/boeing-737-max-lion-air-crash.html" title="">Lion Air Flight</a> 610 in 2018, when all 189 people on board died as the plane plunged into the Java Sea. It also was the worst involving a South Korean airline since 1997, when a Korean Air jet slammed into a hill in the U.S. territory of Guam, killing 229 of the 254 people on board.</p></li><li><p>Jeju Air apologized for the crash in a brief statement. The crash on Sunday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/asia/south-korea-plane-crash-jeju-air-safety.html" title="">appears to have been the first fatal one for the airline</a>, a low-cost South Korean carrier that was established in 2005 and flies to dozens of countries in Asia.</p></li><li><p>Thailand’s Foreign Ministry confirmed that two Thai citizens were among the dead.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>South Korea has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment-yoon-explained.html" title="">dealing with a political crisis</a> at the highest levels. President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached this month after a short-lived martial law decree shocked and angered the nation, wrote on social media on Sunday that he was devastated by the accident. South Korea’s <a href="#south-korea-president-political-crisis" title="">acting president</a>, Choi Sang-mok, said the country would observe a weeklong period of mourning.</p></li></ul><p>Yan Zhuang<!-- --> and <!-- -->Sui-Lee Wee<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="51" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZWRjZDJmODYtYzVhNC01YTdlLWJlYTUtZmE3N2Y2MTJjMzli"><div id="edcd2f86-c5a4-5a7e-bea5-fa77f612c39b" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/28/world/south-korea-plane-crash#edcd2f86-c5a4-5a7e-bea5-fa77f612c39b"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni"><img alt="Ephrat Livni" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-29T16:47:24.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 29, 2024, 11:47 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>A team from the United States will assist South Korean aviation authorities with their investigation of the crash, according to a statement from the National Transportation Safety Board on Sunday.

The Lion Air plane crashed shortly after takeoff from the Indonesian capital, killing all 189 people onboard.</p><div><p>South Korea suffered some of the worst plane crashes in the 1980s and 1990s before tightening its protocols as its airline industry grew. Globally, airline safety improved after the International Civil Aviation Organization <a href="https://www.icao.int/safety/CMAForum/Pages/background.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced</a> stricter universal guidelines in 1999, according to Keith Tonkin, an aviation expert. South Korea not only met those guidelines but has achieved some of the <a href="#south-korea-plane-crash-jeju-air-safety" title="">highest air travel safety scores</a> since.</p><p>South Korea has <a href="https://www.icao.int/safety/scripts/USOAP-Results.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scored above</a> the global average in the universal safety audit. In the latest figures, South Korea scored 98.59 percent for safety and 98.57 percent for security for its compliance with international safety standards, according to <a href="https://www.molit.go.kr/english/USR/WPGE0201/m_36861/LST.jsp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">figures published</a> by the country’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. Jeju Air was among the airlines that received the highest safety rating.</p><p>“That’s very difficult to achieve,” Mr. Tonkin, a managing director of Aviation Projects, an aviation consulting company in Australia, said, referring to South Korea’s safety record. “It takes very significant diligence and effort.”</p><p>Alongside the international guidelines, South Korea’s Office of Civil Aviation also established strict <a href="http://koca.go.kr/koca/forwardPage.do;jsessionid=525E7C3F49B1B36A0810C03A7E7B7481?pageUrl=policies" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">safety protocols</a>. It was part of the government’s stated <a href="https://www.molit.go.kr/english/USR/WPGE0201/m_36861/LST.jsp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">goal</a> to “lead the Pan Pacific region as an aviation powerhouse.”</p><p>The crash at Muan International Airport on Sunday was the worst aviation accident involving a South Korean passenger airline since 1997, when a Korean Air jet slammed into a hill in Guam, a U.S. territory in the western Pacific. The cause of that crash, which killed 229 of the 254 people on board, was pilot error, officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/09/world/evidence-in-crash-on-guam-is-reported-to-indicate-pilot-error.html" title="">said at the time</a>. In 1993, an Asiana Airlines Boeing 737-500 also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/27/world/south-korean-plane-crashes-in-a-storm-66-reported-killed.html" title="">crashed into a mountain</a>, killing 66 of the 110 people on board.</p><p>The previous decade saw even more tragedy. In July 1989, a Korean Air flight en route from Seoul <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/28/world/75-die-in-libya-in-korean-dc-10-crash.html" title="">crashed</a> after it missed the runway at the Tripoli airport in Libya. The plane’s manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas Corporation, said at the time that poor visibility and heavy fog probably led to the DC-10 jetliner crashing into nearby homes and cars. At least 75 people were killed, including four on the ground.</p><p>Two years earlier, in November 1987, a Korean Air Boeing 707 jetliner crashed in the jungle near the border of Thailand and Myanmar, killing 115 people. At the time, Korean Air <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/01/world/korea-suspects-bomb-downed-jet.html" title="">said the crash</a> was probably the result of a terrorist attack.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="47" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOThmZWUyYjYtNWY0ZS01NDk3LTg5YzgtMWU5NWUxYWQzZDMz"><div id="98fee2b6-5f4e-5497-89c8-1e95e1ad3d33" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/28/world/south-korea-plane-crash#98fee2b6-5f4e-5497-89c8-1e95e1ad3d33"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sui-lee-wee"><img alt="Sui-Lee WEE" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-sui-lee-wee/author-sui-lee-wee-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-sui-lee-wee/author-sui-lee-wee-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-sui-lee-wee/author-sui-lee-wee-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-29T12:43:17.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 29, 2024, 7:43 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The two Thai passengers on board the plane were among the fatalities, according to Thailand’s foreign ministry. </p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="46" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvY2Y5MzI2NWEtMzJiOC01OWYxLWFlYTUtNTYxMDk5NGYxZDM4"><div id="cf93265a-32b8-59f1-aea5-5610994f1d38" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/28/world/south-korea-plane-crash#cf93265a-32b8-59f1-aea5-5610994f1d38"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon"><img alt="John Yoon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/09/reader-center/author-john-yoon/author-john-yoon-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/09/reader-center/author-john-yoon/author-john-yoon-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/09/reader-center/author-john-yoon/author-john-yoon-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-29T12:18:58.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 29, 2024, 7:18 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The official death toll is 179, fire officials confirmed at the Muan airport.

About 15 percent, or 4,400, are Boeing 737-800s. The plane belongs to the company’s Next-Generation 737 family of jets, the precursor to the more modern 737 Max, which was involved in two fatal accidents more than five years ago that led to a global grounding of the Max fleet.</p><div><p>Nearly 200 airlines use the 737-800, according to Cirium, including five in South Korea: Jeju Air, T’way Air, Jin air, Eastar Jet and Korean Air. The plane is popular in Asia, Europe and North America, and Boeing has delivered about 5,000 to customers since 1998.</p><p>“The plane in question is very safe and has a good safety record,” said Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of engineering at the University of Southern California who has studied the safety history of the Boeing 737 line.</p><p>The age of the global fleet of 737-800 planes ranges from about 5 years old to more than 27 years old. A well-maintained passenger jet can fly 20 to 30 years or even longer. According to the flight tracking website Flightradar24, the plane that crashed was 15 years old. Ryanair in Europe was the first airline to operate the aircraft, which was leased to Jeju Air in 2017 by SMBC Aviation Capital, according to Cirium.</p><p>Officials said they were investigating the cause of the crash, including the possibility that a bird strike led to a landing gear malfunction.</p><p>Boeing <a href="https://x.com/boeing/status/1873240531771285768" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement on Sunday that it was in contact with Jeju Air and was ready to help the airline.</p><p>Bird strikes are not uncommon in aviation. In some cases, they have resulted in cracked windshields. Some airports deploy falcons and take other measures to keep their skies clear of birds. Muan International Airport, where the crash occurred, uses measures such as playing audio of distress calls to disperse birds as well as shooting them, according to the Korean Office of Civil Aviation.</p><p>Mr. Meshkati said that the landing gear of the 737-800 line is well designed and has a history of reliability, though poor upkeep could result in it not deploying correctly. “Maintenance is really one of the most important causes of aviation accidents,” he said.</p><p>But Mr. Meshkati and other aviation experts cautioned against rushing to judgment about such incidents. Crashes are often caused by multiple factors, which can take years to uncover through in-depth investigations.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="31" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNmZkODA3YzAtZjU2Ny01Nzc1LWIxMzAtNzMzNGI4OWM5OWVj"><div id="6fd807c0-f567-5775-b130-7334b89c99ec" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/28/world/south-korea-plane-crash#6fd807c0-f567-5775-b130-7334b89c99ec"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/choe-sang-hun"><img alt="Choe Sang-Hun" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-choe-sang-hun/author-choe-sang-hun-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-choe-sang-hun/author-choe-sang-hun-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-choe-sang-hun/author-choe-sang-hun-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-29T08:04:21.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 29, 2024, 3:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The official death toll is 127, according to the National Fire Agency.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="30" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZjk1ZDg5MWYtYzFjNS01OTk4LThmY2MtYmNiZDJlY2NkZTYy"><div id="f95d891f-c1c5-5998-8fcc-bcbd2eccde62" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/28/world/south-korea-plane-crash#f95d891f-c1c5-5998-8fcc-bcbd2eccde62"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Jin Yu Young " src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/27/reader-center/author-jin-yu-young/author-jin-yu-young-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/27/reader-center/author-jin-yu-young/author-jin-yu-young-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/27/reader-center/author-jin-yu-young/author-jin-yu-young-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-29T07:39:41.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 29, 2024, 2:39 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><span itemprop="name">Jin Yu Young </span></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Seoul</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>The number of responders deployed to the site has increased to over 1,500, according to the government.

The diversion was caused by a medical, not technical, emergency on board, according to the Incheon International Airport Police Corps.</p><p>After that, the plane flew 10 flights between South Korea, Malaysia, Japan, China, Taiwan and Thailand without incident, according to Flightradar24, before Sunday morning’s crash.</p><p>Last year, the airline received a safety grade of A, or “very good,” from the South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport’s annual review of domestic airlines. The score is based on the number of accidents or near accidents. The highest grade any airline got that year was A++, and the lowest was B+.</p><p>In 2021, the South Korean authorities investigated Jeju Air after one of its planes flew despite having a defect, according to reports in the domestic news media. The plane had damaged the tip of a wing during landing, but the crew failed to notice the damage, and the plane took off again, the Korea Herald <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2576138" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. That year, the airline got a C for safety.</p><p>It was unlikely that the crash was related to broader aviation safety issues in South Korea, said Keith Tonkin, the managing director of Aviation Projects, an aviation consulting company in Brisbane, Australia. “South Korea’s safety record is very good.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2ZkY2E5ZDViLTQ0ODMtNTJkYS1iZWJjLTc2NTMxOWYzOTBlMQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/28/world/south-korea-plane-crash#south-korea-president-political-crisis" data-source-id="100000009899701"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/choe-sang-hun"><img alt="Choe Sang-Hun" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-choe-sang-hun/author-choe-sang-hun-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-choe-sang-hun/author-choe-sang-hun-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-choe-sang-hun/author-choe-sang-hun-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-29T04:49:39.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 28, 2024, 11:49 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The plane crash is the first major test for South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/asia/south-korea-impeach-president-han.html" title="">appointed the interim leader</a> only on Friday, as the country grapples with a political crisis at the highest levels.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s acting president, after an emergency meeting in Seoul on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yonhap/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Mr. Choi, who arrived at the site about 190 miles from Seoul around midday Sunday, ordered government agencies to mobilize all equipment and personnel available for rescue efforts, according to his office.</p><p>The leadership crisis started when President Yoon Suk Yeol made an ill-fated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law.html" title="">declaration</a> of martial law earlier this month, setting off protests and the most serious constitutional crisis in the country since it democratized in the late 1980s.</p><p>Mr. Yoon was impeached by lawmakers on Dec. 14 over the martial law bid, leaving South Korea <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment.html" title="">without an elected leader</a>. At first, the prime minister, Han Duck-soo, served as acting president, but he, too, was impeached by lawmakers, on Friday, less than two weeks into his term.</p><p>That was when Mr. Choi, the deputy prime minister and finance minister, was named acting president. Like Mr. Han, Mr. Choi has no electoral mandate.</p><p>Mr. Choi had been a career bureaucrat, climbing the ranks at the finance ministry. He served as a deputy finance minister when former President Park Geun-hye was impeached and removed from office in 2017. He then left government until Mr. Yoon picked him as his presidential secretary for economic affairs in 2022 and later made him the finance minister.</p><p>The second major impeachment in two weeks meant that South Korea continued to be without a strong elected leader in charge of the government and military in one of Washington’s most important allies, at a time when the country is grappling with North Korea’s nuclear threats and economic challenges at home.</p><p>The political uncertainty has pushed business and consumer confidence lower and caused the currency, the won, to plunge.</p><p>A new government cannot be formed until the Constitutional Court decides whether to reinstate or formally oust Mr. Yoon. The court can take up to six months to reach its decision.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
