    <h1>How Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, Is Avoiding Billions in Taxes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Jensen Huang, the chief executive of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/technology/nvidia-earnings-chips-ai.html" title="">Nvidia</a>, is the 10th-richest person in the United States, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/jenhsun-huang/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worth $127 billion</a>. In theory, when he dies, his estate should pay 40 percent of his net worth to the government in taxes.</p><p>But Mr. Huang, 61, is not only an engineering genius and Silicon Valley icon whose company, the world’s second-most valuable, makes the chips that power much <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/nvidia-ai-chips-gpu.html" title="">artificial intelligence</a>. He is also the beneficiary of a series of tax dodges that will enable him to pass on much of his fortune tax free, according to securities and tax filings reviewed by The New York Times.</p><p>The savings for his family are on a pace to be roughly $8 billion. It likely ranks among the largest tax dodges in the United States.</p><p>The types of strategies Mr. Huang has deployed to shield his wealth have become ubiquitous among the ultrawealthy. Blackstone Group’s Stephen A. Schwarzman, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and top executives at Google, Coinbase, Eli Lilly, Mastercard and Advanced Micro Devices have collectively shifted billions of dollars into financial vehicles in order to avoid the federal estate tax, according to a Times analysis of securities disclosures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is just one sign of how the estate tax — imposed solely on a sliver of the country’s multimillionaires — has been eviscerated.</p><p>Revenue from the tax has barely changed since 2000, even as the wealth of the richest Americans has roughly <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#range:2000.1,2024.1;quarter:138;series:Net%20worth;demographic:networth;population:1;units:levels" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quadrupled</a>. If the estate tax had simply kept pace, it would have raised around $120 billion last year. Instead it brought in about a quarter of that.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc/00nvidia-tax-01-lfpc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1600w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/c70eba65-2bba-5790-a40d-45cfa0a60701" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jensen Huang with his wife, Lori, and their children in 2007.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">MediaNews Group/The Mercury News, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That missing revenue would be enough to simultaneously double the budget of the Justice Department and triple federal funding for cancer and Alzheimer’s research.</p><p>The story of Mr. Huang’s tax avoidance is a case study in how the ultrarich bend the U.S. tax system for their benefit. His strategies were not explicitly authorized by Congress. Instead, they were cooked up by creative lawyers who have exploited a combination of <a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/irs-guidance/revenue-rulings/grantor-who-acquires-trust-corpus-in-exchange-for-unsecured-promissory/dg1q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obscure federal regulations</a>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/walton-v-commr-of-internal-revenue" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">narrow findings by courts</a> and <a href="https://www.naepcjournal.org/journal/issue24i.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rulings</a> that the Internal Revenue Service issues in individual cases that then served as models for future tax shelters.

In the early 1990s, the agency audited more than 20 percent of all estate tax returns. By 2020, the rate had fallen to about 3 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The trend is likely to accelerate with Republicans controlling both the White House and Capitol Hill.

Augustus Caesar in ancient Rome <a href="https://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2017/2017.01.02/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taxed wealth</a> at death. Adam Smith, the intellectual father of laissez-faire capitalism, <a href="https://quotefancy.com/quote/1417871/Adam-Smith-A-power-to-dispose-of-estates-for-ever-is-manifestly-absurd-The-earth-and-the" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attacked inherited fortunes</a>. During the last Gilded Age, so did some of America’s wealthiest men. “By taxing estates heavily at death, the state marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaire’s unworthy life,” Andrew Carnegie <a href="https://www.carnegie.org/about/our-history/gospelofwealth/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The United States <a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/opinions/interview-death-taxes-tax-historian-joseph-thorndike/2019/11/04/2b351" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">adopted</a> the modern estate tax in 1916. In recent decades, congressional Republicans have successfully <a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1758&amp;context=faculty_scholarship" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">watered it down,</a> cutting the rate and increasing the amount that is <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2022/7/28/decomposing-the-decline-in-estate-tax-liability-since-2000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exempt</a> from the tax. Today, a married couple can pass on about <a href="https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2024/10/irs-announces-increased-gift-and-estate-tax-exemption-amounts-for-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$27 million</a> tax free; anything more than that is generally supposed to be taxed at a 40 percent rate.</p><p>Billionaires have made a sport out of trying to avoid the tax. Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive who was President-elect Donald J. Trump’s chief economic adviser during his first administration, once quipped that “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/us/politics/trump-tax-plan-cohn-mnuchin.html" title="">only morons</a> pay the estate tax.”</p><p>Mr. Huang is no moron. In 1993, he and two other engineers were eating in a booth at a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-dennys-trillion/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Denny’s in San Jose</a>, Calif., when they came up with the idea for a powerful new computer chip that would be the basis for Nvidia. The company was initially focused on making chips for 3-D graphics, but by the 2000s it was branching into other areas, such as supplying semiconductors for Tesla’s electric vehicles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>In 2012, Mr. Huang and his wife, Lori, took one of their first steps to shield their fortune from the estate tax.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>They set up a financial vehicle known as an <a href="https://www.actec.org/resource-center/video/can-i-change-my-irrevocable-trust/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">irrevocable trust</a> and moved 584,000 Nvidia shares into it, according to a securities disclosure that Mr. Huang filed. The shares at the time were worth about $7 million, but they would eventually generate tax savings many times greater.</p><p>The Huangs were taking advantage of a precedent set nearly two decades earlier, in 1995, when the <a href="https://www.csepc.org/assets/Councils/ColoradoSprings-CO/library/LISI%20Note%20Sales%2CEconomic%20Substance%20and%20The%2010%25%20Myth%20-%20Hesch%2COshins%2CMagne....pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I.R.S. blessed</a> a transaction that tax professionals affectionately nicknamed “<a href="https://actecfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/I-Dig-It-But-Congress-Shouldnt-Let-Me-Closing-the-IDGT-Loophole.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I Dig It</a>.” (The moniker was a play on the name of the type of financial vehicle involved: an intentionally defective grantor trust.)</p><p>One of the beauties of I Dig It was that it had the potential to largely circumvent not only the estate tax but also the federal gift tax. That tax applies to assets that multimillionaires give to their heirs while they’re alive and essentially serves as a backstop to the estate tax; otherwise, rich people could give away all their money before they die in order to avoid the estate tax.</p><p>Here’s how the I Dig It arrangement worked. Say that a hypothetical tycoon, John Doe, gave $10 million in cash to a trust for the benefit of his children. He wouldn’t have to pay gift taxes on that unless he had already hit the $27 million gift-tax exemption.</p><p>The trust could then use a combination of the $10 million and <a href="https://www.epclongisland.org/assets/Councils/Nassau-NY/library/Unscrambling%20Installment%20Obligations%20Outline%20EPCLI%5B66925%5D.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a loan</a> from Mr. Doe to acquire $100 million of shares. Those shares wouldn’t be subject to the estate tax, thanks to the I.R.S.’s 1995 ruling.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>There was an additional benefit. Say that the value of the shares in the trust soared tenfold. None of that would be subject to the estate tax. But it could trigger a $214 million capital gains tax bill — the $900 million gain taxed at 23.8 percent. Under a separate I.R.S. <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/faculty_scholarship/506/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruling</a>, Mr. Doe could pay that tax on the trust’s behalf, without it counting as an additional gift to his heirs.</p><p>Otherwise, the trust would have to pay the capital gains tax bill, leaving a smaller fortune to future generations.</p><p>The I Dig It <a href="https://www.lewisrice.com/content/uploads/2023/01/Sale-to-an-IDIT-For-a-Promissory-Note-The-Best-Estate-Planning-Strategy-Gimmick-Going.3.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">maneuver</a> was enormously complicated — and enormously lucrative.</p><p>“I’ve always called it the gift that keeps on giving,” said Michael D. Mulligan, a veteran trusts and estates lawyer in St. Louis who <a href="https://www.lewisrice.com/content/uploads/2015/08/MulliganNotreDameSeminar1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped create</a> the strategy.</p><p>A parade of the ultrawealthy soon deployed variations of the technique, according to filings in court and with securities regulators.</p><p>The family of the media mogul Mel Karmazin used several I Dig Its. A former owner of the Detroit Pistons, Bill Davidson, <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2015/09/24/davidson-estate-suesdeloitte-tax-billion-irs-bill/72776294/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used them</a> to avoid more than $2.7 billion in taxes. Mitt Romney, who at the time was running the private equity firm Bain Capital and would later propose abolishing the estate tax as the Republican nominee for president in 2012, also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-09-27/romney-i-dig-it-trust-gives-heirs-triple-benefit" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used the technique</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The I.R.S. has challenged some setups that it viewed as overly aggressive. <a href="https://www.stout.com/en/insights/commentary/estate-of-william-m-davidson-v-commissioner-t-c-docket-no-13748-13-filed-june-14-2013-stipulated-dec" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Davidson</a> settled with the I.R.S. The agency claimed that the Karmazin family’s arrangements “lacked economic substance” and sought $2.4 million in back taxes. But the agency ultimately abandoned most of its arguments and collected about $100,000, according to <a href="https://www.foxrothschild.com/jerome-a-deener" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a lawyer</a> for the Karmazin family.</p><p>In Mr. Huang’s case, the details in securities filings are limited. But multiple experts, including Mr. Mulligan, said it was almost certainly a classic I Dig It gift, loan and sale transaction.</p><p>The $7 million of shares that Mr. Huang moved into his trust in 2012 are today worth more than $3 billion. If those shares were directly passed on to Mr. Huang’s heirs, they would be taxed at 40 percent — or well over $1 billion.</p><p>Instead, the tax bill will probably be no more than a few hundred thousand dollars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-23"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mel Karmazin, the media mogul, in 2008.

Beginning in 1993, Audrey Walton transferred about $200 million worth of shares to two GRATs. The twist was that the trusts had to eventually repay Ms. Walton the value of those shares, plus some modest interest. If the value of the shares went up more than what had to be repaid, the trusts could keep whatever was left over — tax free.</p><p>The I.R.S. contested the arrangement on narrow technical grounds. But in 2000, a U.S. Tax Court judge <a href="https://casetext.com/case/walton-v-commr-of-internal-revenue" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upheld its legality</a>.</p><p>Mr. Hemel of New York University said the I.R.S. could have challenged the use of GRATs on other grounds as well. Instead, he said, the agency “capitulated” and essentially <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2629&amp;context=law_and_economics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permitted</a> the use of the trusts as an acceptable avenue for avoiding the estate tax.</p><p>Billionaires took notice. The Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, the casino magnate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/business/sheldon-adelson-dead.html" title="">Sheldon Adelson</a>, the oil investor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/climate/trump-oil-gas-mar-a-lago.html" title="">Harold Hamm</a>, the cable magnates John Malone and Charles Dolan, and the designer Ralph Lauren were among those who set up GRATs soon after the Walton decision, according to disclosures in the men’s filings with the S.E.C. That positioned their families to collectively avoid billions of dollars in future tax bills.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Under President Barack Obama, the Treasury Department repeatedly tried to make it harder to avoid the estate tax, <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/General-Explanations-FY2010.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposing</a> restrictions on the use of GRATs and I Dig Its. But the proposals died in Congress. (In the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-02/steven-mnuchin-gets-into-capital-investments-after-trump-treasury-role" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Steven Mnuchin</a>, himself a GRAT user, would halt efforts to close the loopholes.)</p><p>In 2016, Mr. Huang and his wife put just over <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581016000214/xslF345X03/wf-form4_145834563559753.xml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three million Nvidia shares</a> into their four new GRATs. The shares were worth about $100 million. If their value rose, the increase would be a tax-free windfall for their two adult children, who both work at Nvidia.</p><p>That is precisely what happened. The shares are now worth more than $15 billion, according to data from securities filings compiled for The Times by <a href="https://www.equilar.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Equilar</a>, a data firm. That means that the Huang family is poised to avoid roughly $6 billion in estate taxes.</p><p>If the Huangs’ trusts sell their shares, that will generate a hefty capital gains tax bill — more than $4 billion, based on Nvidia’s current stock price.

But a fund could, say, <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/using_donor_advised_funds_to_invest_in_early_stage_entrepreneurs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">invest</a> money in a business run by the donor’s friend or donate enough money to name a building at <a href="https://giving.stanford.edu/planned-giving/donor-advised-funds/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a university</a> that the donor’s children hope to attend.</p><p>There is a gaping loophole in the tax laws: Donor-advised funds are <a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/tax-notes-federal/charitable-giving/case-regulating-dafs-further-rejoinder/2023/06/12/7grz0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not required</a> to actually give any money to charitable organizations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>When the donor dies, control of the fund can pass to his heirs — without incurring any estate taxes.</p><p>In recent years, 84 percent of the Huang foundation’s donations have gone to their donor-advised fund, named GeForce, an apparent nod to the name of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/?srsltid=AfmBOooqAYLisTJfih9RbSWZ01NVTz3-HSBxfd3e8ZU_TraN3cMAeQg_" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an Nvidia videogame chip</a>. The Nvidia shares that the Huangs have donated are today worth about $2 billion.</p><p>The fund is not required to disclose how its money is spent, though the foundation has said the assets will be used for charitable purposes. The Nvidia spokeswoman, Ms. Matthew, said those causes included higher education and public health.</p><p>But there is another benefit. Based on Nvidia’s current stock price, the donations to the fund have reduced Mr. Huang’s eventual estate-tax bill by about $800 million.</p><p>Kitty Bennett<!-- --> and <!-- -->Dylan Freedman<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jesse Drucker is an investigative reporter for the Business section and has written extensively on the world of high end tax avoidance.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
