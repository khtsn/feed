    <h1>A Modern Townhouse Rises in Brooklyn and an Anonymous Critic Follows</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The five-story, two-family modern townhouse made of all-white stucco fully unveiled itself earlier this year in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p><p>Erected on a corner lot in a neighborhood dominated by brownstones and prewar buildings, it’s impossible to miss — made even more striking by entry doors painted traffic cone orange. The house hit the market in March with an eye-watering price tag of $5.25 million to match the eye-catching design.</p><p>That, residents say, made it a target. And sometime in May, the building got tagged — not with traditional spray-painted graffiti, but with a small museum-style plaque that spoke to a much larger issue.</p><p>“New York City</p><p>Housing Crisis, 2025</p><p>New apartments, full furnished, warmly lit, no inhabitants</p><p><em>This piece asks us to consider the tension between NYC’s historically low apartment vacancy rate (1.6%) and the price of this vacant duplex ($5.25m).”</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The New York Times could not locate the identity of the unauthorized mystery curator. Sometime between Sunday afternoon and Monday afternoon, the plaque was removed.</p><p>The award-winning Swiss architect Inès Lamunière, who designed the house, and Matthias Müller, the owner of the Brooklyn-based firm MuNYC Architecture, did not respond to requests for comment. Lucy Perry, the listing agent, also did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>But the neighborhood is talking.</p><p>Nate Patterson, 40, who has lived in Clinton Hill since 2020, said he first thought the architects might have been ego-tripping and labeled their own work a piece of gallery-worthy art. But then he looked closer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/27re-uglybuilding-critic1-pvhk/27re-uglybuilding-critic1-pvhk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/27re-uglybuilding-critic1-pvhk/27re-uglybuilding-critic1-pvhk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/27re-uglybuilding-critic1-pvhk/27re-uglybuilding-critic1-pvhk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A museum-style plaque reads, “New York City Housing Crisis, 2025.

The guerrilla plaque spoke to him. “I thought it summed up what I don’t like about this building perfectly,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The statements on the plaque weren’t perfectly accurate. The building at 272 Greene Avenue is not a single duplex; it includes a duplex and a triplex, as well as a garage. And as of May 21, the asking price has fallen to $4.85 million.</p><p>The conspicuous house has arrived at a time when Clinton Hill is increasingly in demand and out of reach even for wealthier New Yorkers. <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/hottest-neighborhoods-housing-market-redfin-analysis-brooklyn-prospect-heights-clinton-hill-11712414" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The neighborhood was declared the “hottest housing market”</a> in the U.S., according to data from Redfin, with median home prices at $1.4 million. That is combined with a citywide affordability crisis, with half of New York families unable <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/25/nyregion/affordable-housing-nyc.html" title="">to afford food, health care and housing</a>, according to a 2023 report by the Fund for the City of New York, which advises government agencies.</p><p>Concerns about further gentrification and the lack of affordable housing have clouded what some in the architectural community consider an imaginative design. The building’s structure looks like a pair of paper triangles sitting on top of one another. Ms. Lamunière, 70, has designed prominent buildings and complexes throughout Europe, including the Pictet Tower in Geneva, which is set <a href="https://www.worldradio.ch/news/bitesize-news/geneva-has-new-tallest-tower/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to be the city’s tallest building when completed</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The modern all-white building strikes a stark contrast to the surrounding neighborhood full of brownstones and prewar apartments.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mason Nabors, a Brooklyn-based architect, said he admired the building’s design, especially considering the placement of the lot on a busy intersection, which can introduce a lot of design complications. “A corner is a huge condition to address, so you’re bound to have critics, regardless,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Not everyone is upset about the new neighbor.</p><p>Hazra Ali has lived in the neighborhood for 22 years and said that she didn’t think there was anything wrong with a developer trying to sell a building at market price. “Someone spent the money to buy the lot and build something,” said Ms. Ali, a local community leader who is also a landlord with a property in East New York. “Are they supposed to sell it for $50 because there’s a housing crisis? If you can’t afford to live here, then move.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view of 272 Greene at night.

They couldn’t take their eyes off it.</p><p>The building, with wall-to-wall windows on the second and third floors, is invitingly voyeuristic. Passers-by have an unobstructed view into two of the second-floor bedrooms, both of which have been staged with furniture.</p><p>“It just doesn’t really fit with the rest of the neighborhood,” Mr. Boyd, 77, said. “All that glass and white concrete. It looks so out of place.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Habib, 68, has been in the neighborhood for 50 years, and said change was inevitable and with it comes wealth. “The amount of money in this neighborhood now — someone will buy it,” he said, gesturing to a set <a href="https://streeteasy.com/building/374-classon-avenue-brooklyn" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of new condos that sold quickly just up Classon Avenue</a>.</p><p>He remembers when the 272 Greene Avenue lot was home to a gas station and then a garage. Then, the property was neglected before a developer bought it for <a href="https://streeteasy.com/sale/1760653?utm_campaign=sale_listing&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_source=web&amp;lstt=WP16lnb3G473lE87uu91SNRaxlxBhmTqbOV9oZ35Acn1Tlx16oD8wyYi5kgwiTqQWWJ7V2BqMmlnw1kj" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1.166</a> million in 2016.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The lot was home to a disused garage for many years before being purchased by a developer in 2016 for $1,166,400.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrea Morales/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ian McGillivray, a graffiti artist, moved to the neighborhood more than 20 years ago. He was commissioned to paint a colorful mural of overlapping cartoon faces on the garage to generate interest in the lot in 2016.</p><p>When he first moved to Clinton Hill, many of his neighbors were using Section 8 housing vouchers and the neighborhood was more affordable, he said. “I realized after I painted the mural that it was being used to upsell the neighborhood,” Mr. McGillivray, 40, said. “It left a sour taste in my mouth.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>To see what was ultimately built on the lot is disappointing, he said, so he, too, was a fan of the plaque.</p><p>“It spoke volumes about the housing crisis,” Mr. McGillivray said. “An art plaque on that big, white, faceless cement wall. I thought it was a great tribute to the community.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Art and Museums in New York City</h2><h3>A guide to the shows, exhibitions and artists shaping the city’s cultural landscape.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Getting Hands On With Infrastructure</strong>: A new exhibit celebrates cities by exploring how they were developed and built, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/nyregion/new-york-hall-science-infrastructure-exhibit.html">has fun getting hands-on</a> with the complex infrastructure required to provide water, sanitation and transportation to millions of residents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charged Memories:</strong> “Smoke in Our Hair” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/arts/design/exhibition-native-artists-yonkers-hudson-river-museum.html">features 22 native artists</a> who boldly challenge the romanticism that often tinges American fables of the nation’s birth and expansion.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Red Scare’</strong>: The New York Historical prepares to examine the campaign against Communism that once <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/arts/design/new-york-historical-blacklist-exhibition.html">shook Hollywood and beyond</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Building the Frick Collection: </strong>Henry Clay Frick, aggressive in art collecting as well as business, acquired many of the masterpieces of the museum <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/arts/design/frick-museum-collection.html">with passion, patience and bargaining</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Looking for More Art?:</strong> Art abounds in New York this May <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/arts/design/new-york-may-art-scene.html">amid market uncertainty</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
