From Virginia through Maine, three to six inches of snow is expected on the coasts and inland parts of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.</p><p>Behind the storm is a mass of arctic air that is expected to bring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/weather/weather-us-cold-forecast.html" title="">several days of frigid weather to much of the country</a>, starting on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The forecast prompted organizers of President-elect Donald J.
