The interim government has introduced austerity measures to stabilize the economy, a condition for receiving a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/20/business/sri-lanka-international-monetary-fund.html" title="">$3 billion bailout</a> from the International Monetary Fund.</p><p>The central issue in the election is how Sri Lanka should correct the imbalances in an economy long warped by too little taxation, too many subsidies and excessive borrowing. Opponents are trying to paint the incumbent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/20/world/asia/sri-lanka-presidential-election.html" title="">Ranil Wickremesinghe</a>, as placing an unfair burden on the poor through increased taxation. They also say he is letting off the hook the elites whose corruption and mismanagement wrecked the economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The race is seen as tight. Here are the main contenders.</p><h2 id="link-6c6cef1e">The Incumbent</h2><p>Mr. Wickremesinghe, 75, a six-time former prime minister, is a political survivor. After the overthrow of Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022, Mr. Wickremesinghe’s elevation to the presidency plucked him out of irrelevance and demonstrated his formidable bargaining powers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ranil Wickremesinghe after casting his vote in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rajesh Kumar Singh/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He became interim president with the help of the powerful Rajapaksa clan, in what many saw as a deal in which he would not take action against the Rajapaksas for running the economy into the ground.</p><p>Over the past two years, Mr. Wickremesinghe has pitched himself as a senior statesman who has helped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/31/business/sri-lanka-economy.html" title="">stabilize the country</a>. He has argued that the economy is on the road to recovery, pointing to declining inflation and the country’s current account surplus, a broad measure of the trade balance. He has also promised to reduce taxes on essential goods, a nod to how his measures have pinched the poor.</p><h2 id="link-69afb7d3">The Marxist</h2><p>Anura Kumara Dissanayake, 55, is the most closely watched candidate in the election. He has tapped into popular disenchantment with the political parties that have led the country in recent decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Anura Kumara Dissanayake, center in red, has tapped into popular disenchantment.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eranga Jayawardena/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The party that Mr. Dissanayake leads was once behind deadly Marxist insurrections against the Sri Lankan state. But over the past 10 years, he has tried to move the party more to the center, distancing it from the staunch Communism and revolutionary principles of its past.</p><p>Mr. Dissanayake positioned his party, which is part of a much larger leftist coalition, as a supporter of the 2022 protest movement and presented himself as someone who would carry out its demands for a less centralized state. He has said he would renegotiate the deal with the I.M.F. and end corruption in higher offices.</p><h2 id="link-6c164170">The Opposition Leader</h2><p>Sajith Premadasa, 57, the son of a former president, has promised a “social market economy” with a mix of market-led and social justice policies. Mr. Premadasa’s platform promises to strengthen fiscal discipline under the I.M.F. agreement while making changes to give relief to the poor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sajith Premadasa, center with hands raised, wants to decentralize powers to the country’s provinces.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eranga Jayawardena/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>He has the backing of the main political party of the country’s minority Tamils.

But as the family’s star has fallen, Namal Rajapaksa has campaigned as the candidate of youth and change. He has also drawn on the postwar development projects that his father oversaw to say he will expand the economy.</p><p>Mujib Mashal<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
