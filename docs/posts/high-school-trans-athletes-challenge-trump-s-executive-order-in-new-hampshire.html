Trump’s executive order that seeks to bar trans girls and women from competing on women’s sports teams, according to documents filed in federal court on Wednesday.</p><p>The teenagers asked the court on Wednesday to add Mr. Trump and members of his administration as defendants in a lawsuit the students filed last summer regarding their eligibility to play girls’ sports at school. The state had enacted a law in August barring transgender girls in grades 5 through 12 from participating in girls’ sports, and the two students initially sued their schools and state education officials, asking the court to rule that they could compete on teams that aligned with their gender identity.</p><p>Their court filing on Wednesday appears to be the first time that the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-trans-athletes-executive-order.html" title="">executive order</a>, titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” has been challenged in court.</p><p>The order, signed last week, effectively bars the participation of trans athletes on girls’ and women’s teams, directing the Department of Education to investigate schools that do not comply and to withdraw the schools’ federal funding. It is one of several orders in which Mr. Trump has sought to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/transgender-trump-executive-orders.html" title="">roll back government recognition</a> of transgender Americans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the lawsuit, the two teenagers call Mr. Trump’s actions “a broad intention to deny transgender people legal protections and to purge transgender people from society.”</p><p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in September allowing the two athletes, Parker Tirrell, 16, and Iris Turmelle, 15, to play on girls’ sports teams while their lawsuit was pending. Mr. Trump’s directive puts that ability at new risk, the filing states.</p><p>“I played soccer — nothing bad happened,” Parker, a sophomore at Plymouth Regional High School, said in an interview this week. “Not everyone was happy about it, but it seemed like the people I was playing against weren’t overly concerned.” But when she got home from school last Wednesday, she said, “my mom told me that Trump had signed an executive order banning trans girls from playing sports.”</p><p>She added, “The amount of effort he’s going through to stop me from playing sports seems extraordinarily high, for not a very good reason.”</p><p>Iris, a freshman at Pembroke Academy, a public high school in Pembroke, N.H., once said of a middle-school program called Girls on the Run that she loved everything about it “except the running,” said her mother, Amy Manzelli. Even so, the teenager said in an interview this week that she wanted to preserve her chance to play any sport she chooses:</p><p>“Other girls have that,” she said. “Why shouldn’t I?” She said she hoped to try out for her school’s tennis and track teams.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The teenagers are also challenging another executive order that directs federal agencies to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/federal-agencies-ordered-to-end-initiatives-that-support-gender-ideology.html" title="">end funding for programs</a> that foster “gender ideology,” which the order defined as the idea that a person’s gender identity, rather than the sex on their original birth certificate, should determine whether they participate in men’s or women’s sports, or use male or female bathrooms, or are called by their chosen pronouns.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s two directives, the court filing argues, violate constitutional protections against sex discrimination and conflict with Title IX, the 1972 civil rights statute that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs that receive federal funding.</p><p>“Our plaintiffs and many other transgender girls and women across the country are being deprived of opportunities in education and beyond, simply because they’re transgender,” said Chris Erchull, a senior staff attorney with GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders, which represents the girls and their families. “It’s unconstitutional and it’s wrong, and we’re standing up against it.”</p><p>Like several other challenges to Mr. Trump’s executive orders, the lawsuit also argues that the president exceeded his authority by directing the federal agencies to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.</p><p>In states where Democrats control the legislatures, transgender student athletes in elementary and secondary schools typically are able to compete on teams that align with their gender identity, leaving federal agencies with numerous enforcement targets for Mr. Trump’s orders. Mr. Erchull said the publicity surrounding his clients’ case might put their schools high on the list. Last week, the Education Department said it had begun investigating two colleges and a state athletic association that had drawn public attention for allowing transgender athletes to compete on women’s teams.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some players on one of the opposing teams that Parker’s soccer team faced in the fall refused to play because she is trans, according to Parker’s parents. The game was played with other players participating.</p><p>At another game, some parents protested by wearing pink wristbands marked “XX,” to represent the typical chromosomal pattern for females. That incident <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/10/01/metro/nh-pink-wristbands-xx-lawsuit-transgender-girls-sports-free-speech/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attracted media coverage</a> and <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nhd.64211/gov.uscourts.nhd.64211.1.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sparked a lawsuit</a> on free-speech grounds after the Bow School District responded by prohibiting such protests.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s order states that allowing transgender girls and women to compete in categories designated for female athletes is unfair and “results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls.” Nearly 80 percent of Americans do not believe transgender female athletes should be allowed to compete in women’s sports, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/democrats-ipsos-poll-abortion-lgbt.html" title="">a recent New York Times and Ipsos poll</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lia Thomas, center, competed for the University of Pennsylvania at a swim meet at Harvard University in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">M. Scott Brauer for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The day after Mr. Trump issued his order concerning trans athletes, the National Collegiate Athletic Association fell into line, announcing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/ncaa-transgender-athletes-ban.html" title="">sweeping ban</a> on transgender athletes competing at its member institutions. “President Trump’s order provides a clear, national standard,” Charlie Baker, the president of the N.C.A.A., said in a statement.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Baker told Congress in testimony last year that he was aware of fewer than 10 transgender athletes among the more than 500,000 students who play N.C.A.A. sports. Yet they remain at the center of a heated cultural debate, especially when they win.</p><p>In 2022, Lia Thomas, a swimmer, competed on the University of Pennsylvania women’s team after taking testosterone blockers and estrogen, and became the first openly transgender woman to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/sports/lia-thomas-swimmer-wins.html" title="">win an N.C.A.A. Division I title</a>. The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it wants the N.C.A.A. to strip her and other trans athletes of their titles.</p><p>In temporarily shielding Parker and Iris from enforcement of New Hampshire’s law, U.S. District Court Judge Landya McCafferty found last summer that the state had not demonstrated that concerns about fairness and safety were more than a “hypothesized problem’&#39; in their particular cases. Both Parker and Iris said they knew they were girls at an early age, were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and began taking puberty-suppressing medication before the hormonal changes that, according to the opinion, underpin the divergence in average athletic performance between boys and girls.</p><p>“Parker’s soccer team had a winless season last year, and Iris did not make the cut for middle-school softball,’’ <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69050456/70/tirrell-v-edelblut/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote the judge</a>, an appointee of President Barack Obama.</p><p>The potential consequences for not complying with Mr. Trump’s orders have reverberated through the country. A school district in another part of New Hampshire that once defied the statewide ban on trans girls playing girls’ sports felt that it had no choice but to obey Mr. Trump’s orders, for fear of losing federal funding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Before Mr. Trump took office, the district, the Kearsarge Regional School District, decided to keep its girls’ sports open to any trans girl who wanted to play on them, despite the state ban, because it wanted to remain in compliance with Title IX.<span>  </span>It had one trans girl competing in girls’ sports.</p><p>But Mr. Trump’s recent executive orders changed — and upended — everything, John Fortney, the district’s superintendent of schools, said in an interview on Tuesday.</p><p>The new administration’s interpretation of Title IX is that in that law, “sex” refers to whether someone is male or female at birth, and not the person’s gender identity. Defining it that way meant that the school district was suddenly out of compliance with Title IX, Mr. Fortney said, compelling the district to bar trans girls from its girls’ teams and change “our internal processes and internal expectations.”</p><p>“It’s like speeding,” he said. “You say you’re going to drive the speed limit, and then the speed limit goes from 70 to 55, so you’re going to follow it. You may not like it, but you’re going to follow it.”</p><p>Mr. Fortney said he hoped the trans athlete in the district could continue to participate in sports with some level of comfort by joining her school’s track and field team in the spring; that team is coed.</p><p>“When you look at how the teenagers learn to handle defeat and victory, and how to work hard for a goal, you know, athletics provides a very concentrated bit of that kind of medicine that I think everybody needs access to,” he said. “You want a kid to have the most complete experience that they can.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amy Harmon covers how shifting conceptions of gender affect everyday life in the United States.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/amy-harmon">More about Amy Harmon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Juliet Macur is a national reporter at The Times, based in Washington, D.C., who often writes about America through the lens of sports.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/juliet-macur">More about Juliet Macur</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/education-department-us">Education Department (US)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/lia-thomas">Lia Thomas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/national-collegiate-athletic-association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>FEMA:</strong> The Trump administration fired the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s chief financial officer and three others after Elon Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/nyregion/fema-fired-nyc-migrant-hotels.html">misleadingly claimed the agency had used disaster relief funds for migrant services</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> A group of nongovernmental organizations, contractors and small businesses that rely on American foreign aid to carry out humanitarian and development programs abroad <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-usaid-lawsuit-foreign-aid.html">filed a lawsuit in federal court</a> against the Trump administration and its efforts to phase out the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fired Workers:</strong> Eight former inspectors general who were summarily <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/trump-inspectors-general-fired.html">fired by President Trump</a> last month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/inspectors-general-trump-lawsuit.html">filed a lawsuit</a> asking a judge to declare their removals illegal and order the government to reinstate them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Executive Power:</strong> Trump’s early moves to slash the federal government and expand American territory represent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-ideology-power.html">significant ideological swings from his first term</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:</strong> Barely two days after Russell Vought, the new acting director, ordered the agency to close its office and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/business/vought-cfpb-musk-trump.html">halt all its work</a>, employees were in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/business/cfpb-shutdown-confusion.html">state of deep confusion</a> about what they should — or should not — be doing.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
