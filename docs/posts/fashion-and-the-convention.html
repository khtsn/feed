Sexist!, the lament generally goes. Superficial! (That’s the nice version.)</p><p>But here’s the thing: There’s a reason we refer to “the national stage” and the “theater of politics.” Costume is an intrinsic part of any drama, for both the stars and the supporting cast. It is woven into the creation and communication of character.</p><p>We make instant judgments about one another based on the images we see. It’s human instinct and part of how we decide if someone is likable or believable or a leader, as political figures of all genders, from Castro to Cleopatra, have always been aware.</p></div></div><div><p>To not acknowledge that our candidates consider how style connects to substance is to give them less credit than they are due. After all, no one can fill every moment with policy proposals. But they can always look the part. Here are seven politicians who did it most notably during the Republican and Democratic conventions.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p><strong>Kamala Harris: </strong>For the biggest, most consequential speech of her life, Harris accepted her nomination as the Democratic candidate for president not in white, but in navy blue. That’s a bigger symbolic statement than it may at first appear. Since 2016, when Hillary Clinton strode onstage in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/fashion/hillary-clinton-democratic-national-convention.html" title="">her white Ralph Lauren</a>, assuming the mantle of the women who had fought for a political voice before her, the white pantsuit has become a political trope, a way for women (Democratic and otherwise) to demonstrate solidarity and signal their opposition to Donald Trump and his policies. By <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/style/kamala-harris-dnc-suit.html" title="">making a different choice</a>, Harris may have brought that particular historical chapter to a close. As she said in her speech, it was time “to chart a new way forward” — and she dressed the part.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p><strong>JD Vance: </strong>On the last day of the Republican convention, the vice-presidential nominee telegraphed the fact that he was on the same page as his running mate by adopting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/style/donald-trump-american-flag-patriotism.html" title="">Trump’s signature uniform</a> of red tie, white shirt and blue suit — though he stuck with his beard, an accessory that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/style/jd-vance-beard-politics.html" title="">breaks all the rules of modern politics</a>. There hasn’t been a candidate with facial hair on a major party presidential ticket in 75 years. Still, his scruff matches the beard worn by Donald Trump Jr., and it speaks to clichés of he-man frontiersmanship that reflect Vance’s more traditional approach to gender roles.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p><strong>Melania Trump</strong>: The former first lady made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/style/rnc-ear-bandages-melania-trump.html" title="">a rare public appearance</a> to stand by her husband’s side at the R.N.C., and she made it count in a red Dior suit that she had previously worn on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/fashion/melania-trump-brigitte-macron-paris.html" title="">2017 state trip to Paris</a>. It was an implicit nod to the period when the Trumps occupied the White House, and a reminder, like the virtual White House projected behind Trump as he made his speech, of their goal.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p><strong>Tim Walz</strong>: Pretty much from the moment Harris chose him as her running mate, the narrative around the Minnesota governor has focused on his regular guy cred, as represented by his penchant for plaid shirts, Carhartt, Filson and other costumes of regular guy-hood. When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/style/tim-walz-dnc.html" title="">he took the stage to accept the nomination</a> for vice president, however, Walz did so in an impeccably tailored navy suit, blue tie and pristine white shirt — the uniform of the D.C. establishment. It sent a message that his character didn’t just play on the campaign trail, but in the corridors of power.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p><strong>Michelle Obama</strong>: The former first lady has always understood that if the spotlight is going to be thrust upon her, she might as well use every photon available to her own ends, including those focused on what she wears. So as she spoke in support of Harris, she did so in a pantsuit — but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/style/michelle-obama-dnc-fashion.html" title="">not a traditional political woman’s pantsuit</a>. Her pantsuit, by the small independent New York brand Monse, featured a sleeveless jacket that had been de- and reconstructed, so the lapels crossed over the throat in an almost futuristic, militaristic way. This election is going to be a fight, her tunic and her speech suggested, and everyone should gear themselves up to get out the vote.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p><strong>Nikki Haley</strong>: The former Trump opponent was a surprise presence onstage at the R.N.C., but her very wardrobe was a form of outreach. If she didn’t have an olive branch, exactly, on her dress (which happened to be by the same designer, Teri Jon, who had made the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/politics/nikki-haley-dress-fancy-but-not-too-fancy.html" title="">“fancy-but-not-so-fancy”</a> dress she wore during her campaign), it did feature a veritable bouquet of red and blue blooms.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Andy Beshear:</strong> The governor of Kentucky was the rare (very rare) male politician to speak at the D.N.C. and eschew a tie. The decision may have been an effort to signal his status as a next-gen Democrat, though the fact that he wore a high-collared white shirt buttoned almost to the neck, and also buttoned his blue suit jacket while onstage, somewhat undercut the hipster-casual vibe he seemed to be going for.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-33ffbf21">Middle East</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view of southern Lebanon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aziz Taher/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><ul><li><p>Israel bombarded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/24/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war/heres-the-latest?smid=url-share" title="">dozens of targets in southern Lebanon</a> in what it called a pre-emptive strike against Hezbollah and said it thwarted a major attack. </p></li><li><p>Benjamin Netanyahu said that “thousands of rockets” aimed at the country had been destroyed.</p></li><li><p>Hezbollah said that it had fired more than 320 rockets at Israeli bases and positions.

Ortega started her career as a child actor, playing the lead on the Disney Channel series “Stuck in the Middle.” But it was the role of Wednesday on the Netflix show of the same name that changed her life in significant, and disorienting, ways. We spoke about what it’s like to get so famous so fast.</em></p><p><strong>You wrote a book when you were 17, and in it you talk about insecurities and mental-health challenges. You’re 21 now. I’m wondering since your career blew up, does that make things easier or harder?</strong></p><p>Much, much harder.</p><p><strong>Really?</strong></p><p>Yes, of course. Because I’ve always been someone who’s put an immense amount of pressure on myself, but it’s a bit different when you can’t really walk outside without expecting to be pointed at or — it’s kind of died down now, but still, I walk into a room, and I am looking at everything differently. I was a private person, and I prefer to be a private person, so I think understanding that there’s a lot more eyes and a lot more people watching — and I’m so underdeveloped! My prefrontal cortex isn’t even fully there yet, technically, you know? I want to be making the mistakes and learning from them and falling on my face and maybe the opposite. I want to be extremely confident and try everything and do everything and be the biggest risk taker in the world. There’s a lot more at stake now, whether I like it or not, and people are entirely entitled to share their opinion, even when maybe it’s not the most welcome, but I think it’s just — sorry, I’m trying to think of the best way to phrase this or put this in a way that is still refreshing —</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Just say it in the way that you feel it.</strong></p><p>It’s really scary, actually. And it’s hard to say that because mostly you can’t complain. I wanted this when I was a child. I live such a privileged life. I’m so lucky to do the things that I do. I love my job. I don’t see myself wanting to stop my job. There are certain things that no one can really prepare you for, though, and that kind of attention is one of them.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/magazine/jenna-ortega-interview.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id="link-640bc3b8"><span><strong>THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Painting by Alan Coulson.
