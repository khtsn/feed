It did not provide details on where, or say when the second was taken prisoner, but said they were the first North Koreans fighting against Ukraine in Kursk to be captured.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Interrogations are being carried out through Korean translators in coordination with South Korea’s intelligence service, according to the SBU.
