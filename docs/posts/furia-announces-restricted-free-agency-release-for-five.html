U.S. investment in 2023 was about $10 billion.</p><p>Experts said that even though not all of these pledges would pan out, they showed an overall commitment to doing business on the continent. The Emirates is also looking to build trade and has signed bilateral <a href="https://www.mofa.gov.ae/mediahub/news?selcategory=Minister%20News" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">economic partnership pacts</a> with three African nations, including <a href="https://mfa.go.ke/kenya-and-uae-sign-landmark-comprehensive-economic-partnership-agreement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kenya</a>, since the year’s start.</p><p>The Emirates has focused its investments on “key future-focused sectors such as renewable energy, food security, digital transformation, infrastructure, and logistics over the past five years,” said a spokesperson for the Emirati ministry of foreign affairs. In addition, the country’s total foreign assistance in Africa exceeded $1 billion in 2023-24, according to a government spokesperson on trade.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has fast-tracked America’s exit from Africa, ending billions of dollars in funding, dismantling the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/africa/africa-usaid-funds.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">U.S. Agency for International Development</a> and <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2025/us-plans-555m-cut-to-african-development-bank-fund" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ending</a> all contributions to the African Development Bank. The State Department’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/trump-state-department-overhaul.html" title="">reorganization plan</a> also calls for the elimination of most operations in the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/uk-to-reduce-aid-to-0-3-of-gross-national-income-from-2027/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Britain</a> has also tightened its flow of money into the continent in recent years as it has increased aid to Ukraine and increased its own military spending.</p><p>The Trump administration’s actions are extreme, said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, a co-director of a program on <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/african-governance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">African governance</a> at Oxford University, but they reflect a larger global trend away from development aid and liberal values.</p><p>The world is transitioning to an era in which the focus on democracy and free markets is becoming less significant, Mr. Soares de Oliveira said. “A more business-focused approach is going to be the shared norm,” he added.</p><p>That isn’t to say the Emirates does not have substantial strategic and political interests in Africa.</p><p>What’s different is that it has delegated statecraft to private interests and businesses, almost all of which have ties in some way to the government or ruling families, said Andreas Krieg, a fellow at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies at King’s College London. These enterprises are expected to generate both economic and strategic returns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump visited the gulf region this week to meet with business leaders and government officials, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The U.A.E. has revolutionized statecraft for a small country,” Mr. Krieg said. It has fewer than one million citizens, is smaller than the state of Indiana and has a relatively tiny military. Yet, he said, “it’s very much playing the game of a middle power.”</p><p>Some of the Emirates’ political choices have stirred concerns. Sudan’s government has accused the Emirates of fueling genocide with its backing of the Rapid Support Forces, the paramilitary group engaged in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/middleeast/un-court-sudan-genocide-uae.html" title="">civil war</a> that has killed 150,000 and displaced 14 million people. Recently, Sudan’s military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/africa/port-sudan-attacks.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">cut diplomatic ties</a> with the Emirates, which has said it has provided only humanitarian assistance.</p><p>The Emirates has also been accused of funneling money to the Russian mercenary group Wagner in both Sudan and Libya.</p><p>“There is no such thing as clean or dirty money in the U.A.E.,” Mr. Krieg said.</p><p>Ken Opalo, an associate lecturer at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service, said the Emirates aimed to be the world’s gateway to Africa for investment and trade, whether legal or smuggled. The gold trade alone that passes mostly through Dubai is worth $30 billion, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“The U.A.E. has developed a robust regulatory framework that ensures that the trade in gold is conducted with the maximum security, integrity and transparency,” an Emirati official said.</p><p>As Mr. Trump’s visit to the gulf region this week illustrates, Washington considers the Emirates a reliable ally in the region and in Africa. The two countries have maintained close security ties.</p><p>But Washington may underestimate just how valuable the commercial partnership between the Emirates and China is. Ambitious investments in green energy in Africa rely on Chinese technology, minerals and goods.</p><p>“The U.A.E. ultimately militarily relies on the U.S., but it also wants to position itself as the Switzerland of the gulf where everyone is welcome,” Mr. Opalo said. “They want to be a renewables hub, and it’s hard to play that game without engaging China.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patricia Cohen writes about global economics for The Times and is based in London.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
