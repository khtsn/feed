In the immediate aftermath, the videos showed, some people were hanging from the wreckage by ropes, and others inched along on their bellies toward the center.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In other videos posted on social media, a tugboat could be seen near the Cuauhtémoc, which appeared to be moving backward, stern first, when it crashed.</p><p>The vessel lurched but stayed upright as it came to a stop at Brooklyn Bridge Park, according to social media video and images from the scene. Its masts appeared to be badly damaged.</p><p>At a news conference on Saturday, the authorities said the pilot who was assigned to navigate the Cuauhtémoc out of the channel experienced “mechanical issues.” The National Transportation Safety Board will be doing a full investigation of the crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Emergency workers walk with a bloodied man." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/79e4a0b9-7229-5148-809b-d41769fc21b9" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Emergency workers assisted crew members who were on the ship.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Nick Corso, 23, was finishing dinner with friends at a restaurant nearby when they saw the ship heading toward them.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He thought at first that the vessel would clear the bridge, he said, but then “the top lights on the mast disappeared behind the bridge and I was like, oh, it’s not going to make it.”</p><p>When the top of a mast hit the underside of the bridge, he said, “you could hear it snap.”</p><p>At Pier 16, where the injured were brought, a large crowd gathered by the waterfront, and emergency vehicles with lights flashing filled South Street. Periodically, emergency workers wheeled victims with neck braces on toward ambulances and loaded them in on gurneys. Whenever a new survivor appeared, the crowd broke into cheers and applause and chanted: “Mex-i-co! Mex-i-co!”</p><p>One woman with her head bandaged was pushed out on a gurney. She was weeping.

Government <a href="https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/coast-pilot/files/cp2/CPB2_C09_WEB.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">infrastructure documents</a> show the bridge has a navigational clearance of 127 feet. The Cuauhtémoc’s masts were roughly 160 feet tall.</p><p>After the crash, all lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge were briefly closed in both directions, the city’s <a href="https://x.com/NotifyNYC/status/1923923134618406926" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emergency management notification system</a> reported. Ydanis Rodriguez, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation, said that the span was being inspected, but “information is there was not any major damage to the bridge.”</p><p>The Brooklyn Bridge, which took 14 years to build, was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/nyregion/brooklyn-bridge-140-years.html" title="">city’s first suspension bridge</a>. Since its construction over 140 years ago, the monolithic connector has become a quintessential part of New York City, tying together Brooklyn to Manhattan. It is as recognizable a symbol of New York as the Empire State Building.</p><p>This is not the first tall ship to strike the Brooklyn Bridge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The damaged vessel, docked at sunrise on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>In 1921, for instance, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1921/02/04/archives/ship-bends-mast-on-brooklyn-bridge.html" title="">steel mainmast</a> of the six-masted schooner, Edward J.
