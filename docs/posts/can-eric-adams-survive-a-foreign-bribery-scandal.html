As we allege, Mayor Adams took these contributions even though he knew they were illegal, and even though he knew these contributions were attempts by a Turkish government official and Turkish businessmen to buy influence with him. We also alleged that the mayor sought and accepted well over $100,000 in luxury travel benefits. He told the public he received no gifts, even though he was secretly being showered with them.” “This did not surprise us that we reached this day. And I ask New Yorkers to wait to hear our defense before making any judgments. From here, my attorneys will take care of the case, so I can take care of the city. My day to day will not change. I will continue to do the job for 8.3 million New Yorkers that I was elected to do.” “Amen.” Protester: “You’re an embarrassment — you’re an embarrassment to Black people. You’re an embarrassment.” Crowd: “Resign, resign, resign, resign. resign, resign, resign.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/26adams-indictment-fallout-cmlf/26adams-indictment-fallout-cmlf-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Federal prosecutors say Mayor Eric Adams of New York took illegal campaign contributions and luxury travel benefits from foreign actors and used his power to help Turkey.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Juan Arredondo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emma-g-fitzsimmons"><img alt="Emma G.

Several of his most powerful appointees had fled the administration. Reliable allies were more circumspect in offering support.</p><p>And even a routine news conference outside Gracie Mansion, if anything could be considered routine given the circumstances, was turned upside down on Thursday when Mr. Adams’s words of defense were sometimes drowned out by shouts of “you are a disgrace.”</p><p>A more significant warning sign soon followed, when the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the mayor’s closest supporters, expressed concern on Thursday that Mr. Adams’s aggressive self-defense could hurt Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats electorally, and said that he would be convening a meeting with Black leaders to chart a path forward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Adams has vowed to continue on as mayor, fighting to keep a job he loves and one that he has said was ordained by God.</p><p>Mr. Adams acknowledged that it was a “painful day” and called for a speedy trial.</p><p>“I ask New Yorkers to wait to hear our defense,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The next few days could determine whether Mr. Adams can stay put and whether his administration will continue to descend into chaos. Another test may arrive quickly: Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Mr. Adams, asked that the mayor’s first appearance in court take place on Friday or Monday, according to a court filing. Mr. Spiro told the federal judge in the case that prosecutors do not object.</p><p>The stunning 57-page <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html" title="">indictment</a> accusing the mayor of bribery and of accepting $100,000 in travel benefits led to a wave of new calls for Mr. Adams to resign or to be ousted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Two elected officials could be critical: Gov. Kathy Hochul, a political ally who has the power to remove him, and Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader. Both are deeply focused on the November election, and both declined, for now, to pressure Mr. Adams to step aside.</p><p>Mr. Jeffries called the indictment a “serious and sober moment for New York City” and said that Mr. Adams was entitled to the presumption of innocence.</p><p>“A jury of the mayor’s peers will now evaluate the charges in the indictment and ultimately render a determination,” he said. “In the meantime, I pray for the well-being of our great city.”</p><p>Addressing reporters today, Ms. Hochul kept her thinking on the matter to herself, saying only that she would be thoughtful and deliberative about her next step. Even so, she appeared to recognize the responsibility — and opportunity — in the choice before her.</p><p>“I have a unique responsibility here to make sure I do right by all people in this great state,” she said, taking note of the city’s residents: “I also represent 8.3 million New Yorkers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>There is another way to force Mr. Adams out, relying on a five-member “committee on mayoral inability” that has never been deployed.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But a growing number of the mayor’s rivals pressed him to resign for the good of the city.</p><p>While the mayor was sequestered for much of Thursday at Gracie Mansion, his home in Manhattan, Brad Lander, the city comptroller who is running for mayor, held a well-attended news conference in the rotunda of City Hall to assert that the management of the city would suffer under Mr. Adams.</p><p>The mayor, he said, cannot possibly handle the plethora of problems facing the city, such as the housing crisis and the influx of migrants, while fighting the criminal case against him and the increasing number of vacancies in his administration.</p><p>Quality candidates for important leadership roles are not going to feel comfortable working for someone who is under federal indictment, Mr. Lander said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“He can’t provide the leadership that the mayoralty demands,” he said. “The charges are really serious and they are going to take serious work, not just from his lawyer, but from him.”</p><p>Political consultants and former New York officials doubted that Mr. Adams would step aside, given his combative stance and personality.</p><p>Chris Coffey, a Democratic political strategist who ran Andrew Yang’s mayoral campaign against Mr. Adams in 2021, said that it was extremely unlikely that Mr. Adams would resign and that his fate would most likely be decided by a deal with prosecutors or at the ballot box next June in the Democratic primary.</p><p>“He’s not going to resign because of media or political pressure,” he said.</p><p>Former Gov. David A. Paterson said that it was difficult to face pressure to resign — something that happened to him in 2010 when he ended his campaign for governor. But he said he had known “spiritually that I didn’t do anything wrong.”</p><p>“It’s a very hard thing to do, and most times when you’ve seen an elected official resign, it’s because there is condemning evidence against them,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Indeed, during a defiant news conference in front of Gracie Mansion with a group of Black clergy and community leaders, the mayor somewhat mockingly referred to the charges as a “story,” much in the way that he had routinely referred to the federal investigation that resulted in his indictment as a “review.”</p><p>“The story will come from the federal prosecutors,” the mayor said.</p><p>He also pledged to continue running the city, saying, “my day to day will not change,” and promised that there would be no decline in the city’s quality of life or services.</p><p>“It’s an insult to the hard-working people of this city that anyone will say that they won’t do their jobs while this case proceeds in the background,” Mr. Adams said.</p><p>Mr. Adams has tried to make the case that he is being targeted because he is Black, even going so far as to compare himself to the city’s first Black mayor, David N. Dinkins, calling himself “Dinkins 2.”</p><p>But protesters at Gracie Mansion were not moved. They compared his rhetoric to that of former President Donald J. Trump and said he had brought shame to Mr. Dinkins’s legacy.</p><p>“Resign, resign, resign,” the crowd chanted as Mr. Adams ended the news conference.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Nicholas Fandos<!-- -->, <!-- -->Olivia Bensimon<!-- -->, <!-- -->Grace Ashford<!-- --> and <!-- -->Benjamin Oreskes<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>18</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>As Calls for Mayor’s Resignation Swell, Adams Fights to Keep the Job He Loves<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
