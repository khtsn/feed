    <h1>Eric Adams Heads to Mar-a-Lago to Meet With Trump</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Levy, in his statement, said Mayor Adams and Mr. Trump would discuss “New Yorkers’ priorities” when they meet on Friday. “The mayor looks forward to having a productive conversation with the incoming president on how we can move our city and country forward,” Mr. Levy wrote.</p><p>For months, Mr. Adams has adopted a warm posture toward the incoming president.</p><p>In the run-up to the November election, his apparent reluctance to criticize Mr. Trump and resistance to naming Kamala Harris as his pick for president raised questions about who he intended to vote for. On Election Day, he told reporters he did in fact plan to vote for Ms. Harris.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump’s victory, Mr. Adams has repeatedly said he wanted to work with the president-elect, not war with him. In December, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/nyregion/adams-homan-meeting-migrants.html" title="">met</a> with Mr. Trump’s incoming “border czar,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-homan-immigration-border.html" title="">Thomas D. Homan</a>, and said they shared “the same desire” to go after undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes in the city. Mr. Homan, who played a central role in Mr. Trump’s first-term family separation policies, proceeded to go on the TV show “Dr. Phil” and praise the mayor.</p><p>At a charity event in September, Mr. Trump said he felt a kinship with Mr. Adams.</p><p>“We were persecuted, Eric,” Mr. Trump said at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/us/politics/trump-harris-al-smith-dinner.html" title="">Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner</a>. “I was persecuted, and so are you, Eric.”</p><p>At a news conference three months later, Mr. Trump said he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/nyregion/trump-pardon-eric-adams.html" title="">would consider a pardon</a> for Mr. Adams.</p><p>William K.
