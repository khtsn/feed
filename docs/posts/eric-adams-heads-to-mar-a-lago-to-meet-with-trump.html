Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his spokesman confirmed.</p><p>The meeting did not appear on Mr. Adams’s public schedule.</p><p>“Mayor Adams has made quite clear his willingness to work with President-elect Trump and his incoming administration on behalf of New Yorkers — and that partnership with the federal government is critical to New York City’s success,” Fabien Levy, the mayor’s spokesman, said in an email. </p><p>Mr. Adams, a Democrat, has drawn criticism from members of his party for appearing to cozy up to Mr. Trump. And while Mr. Adams has expressed a desire to work productively with the incoming administration, critics have suggested that his warmth toward the president-elect masks a different motivation.</p><p>In September, Mr. Adams was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html" title="">indicted</a> on five federal corruption charges, part of an investigation that he argues is political retribution for his criticism of President Biden’s immigration policies. Mr. Trump has publicly commiserated with Mr. Adams and seconded his depiction of a Justice Department run amok. Mr. Adams has expressed openness to the notion of receiving a presidential pardon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Levy, in his statement, said Mayor Adams and Mr. Trump would discuss “New Yorkers’ priorities” when they meet on Friday. “The mayor looks forward to having a productive conversation with the incoming president on how we can move our city and country forward,” Mr. Levy wrote.</p><p>For months, Mr. Adams has adopted a warm posture toward the incoming president.</p><p>In the run-up to the November election, his apparent reluctance to criticize Mr. Trump and resistance to naming Kamala Harris as his pick for president raised questions about who he intended to vote for. On Election Day, he told reporters he did in fact plan to vote for Ms. Harris.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump’s victory, Mr. Adams has repeatedly said he wanted to work with the president-elect, not war with him. In December, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/nyregion/adams-homan-meeting-migrants.html" title="">met</a> with Mr. Trump’s incoming “border czar,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-homan-immigration-border.html" title="">Thomas D. Homan</a>, and said they shared “the same desire” to go after undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes in the city. Mr. Homan, who played a central role in Mr. Trump’s first-term family separation policies, proceeded to go on the TV show “Dr. Phil” and praise the mayor.</p><p>At a charity event in September, Mr. Trump said he felt a kinship with Mr. Adams.</p><p>“We were persecuted, Eric,” Mr. Trump said at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/us/politics/trump-harris-al-smith-dinner.html" title="">Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner</a>. “I was persecuted, and so are you, Eric.”</p><p>At a news conference three months later, Mr. Trump said he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/nyregion/trump-pardon-eric-adams.html" title="">would consider a pardon</a> for Mr. Adams.</p><p>William K.
