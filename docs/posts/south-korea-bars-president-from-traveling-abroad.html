data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>South Korea’s political dysfunction deepened Monday as its Ministry of Justice barred President Yoon Suk Yeol from leaving the country while officials investigate whether his brief declaration of martial law last week amounted to leading an insurrection.</p><p>Oh Dong-woon, the chief prosecutor who heads the office for investigating high-ranking officials, told lawmakers that he had sought the travel ban as the office carries out search-and-seizure operations targeting officials who were involved in the martial law order.</p><p>No sitting president has ever been arrested in South Korea, and the order adds to the spiraling fallout of Mr. Yoon’s extraordinary move last Tuesday. Since his short-lived martial law declaration, the country has been thrust into a leadership vacuum, and widespread protests have called for his removal.</p><p>The justice ministry’s quick acceptance of Mr. Oh’s request shows how Mr. Yoon’s grip on his own government is coming unglued. Mr. Yoon, a former prosecutor, has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep the prosecutors and the justice ministry on his side as a key governing tool, appointing loyalists to key posts there. Home Minister Lee Sang-min, another staunch Yoon ally who controlled the police, stepped down on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the ban also suggested that the investigators considered the allegations of insurrection against Mr. Yoon serious enough to bar the head of state from leaving the country. Mr. Yoon did not immediately notify the National Assembly of his declaration of martial law, as required by law. Even during martial law, the president has no right to detain lawmakers unless they are caught in the act of a crime — a legal provision law scholars say Mr. Yoon violated when he sent troops into the Assembly to physically remove legislators.</p><p>The president can be arrested or indicted while in office if he commits insurrection or treason. Legal scholars were divided over whether Mr. Yoon could continue to run the government as president if he were arrested. Some say that his arrest would mean that he was unable to perform his duties and that the prime minister would step in as an interim president until Mr. Yoon’s fate is decided through trial or impeachment. But others say that unless he was convicted and removed from office through impeachment or resignation, he is still the president and could try to act as one, even from prison.</p><p>Opposition lawmakers have accused Mr. Yoon and officials including his former defense minister, Kim Yong-hyun, of staging an insurrection when they sent armed soldiers into the National Assembly in an effort to seize the legislative body after the declaration of martial law. If convicted, the leader of an insurrection would face the death penalty or life imprisonment.</p><p>An attempt on Saturday by opposition lawmakers to impeach Mr. Yoon failed after the president’s party boycotted the vote, prolonging the uncertainty over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law-yoon.html?searchResultPosition=7" title="">who was at the nation’s helm</a>. South Korea’s defense ministry said Monday in a regularly scheduled briefing that command over the country’s military remained with the president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators took part in a sit-in protest calling for the ouster of Mr. Yoon at the National Assembly in Seoul on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anthony Wallace/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>South Koreans are unsure who is governing the country with Mr. Yoon largely absent from view. Han Dong-hoon, the chairman of Mr. Yoon’s governing People Power Party, said over the weekend that the president had been excluded from performing his duties. Han Duck-soo, the prime minister, said the cabinet, in consultation with the ruling party, would keep the country running.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Opposition groups have said that the party chairman had no legal basis to exclude Mr. Yoon and accused him of making his own grab for power.</p><p>The constitutional crisis is unfolding as South Korea faces a raft of policy challenges abroad and at home, and has raised questions over the health of the country’s democracy. The repercussions spread to financial markets on Monday. South Korea’s currency lost value, and the country’s benchmark stock index tumbled 2.8 percent, a steep drop that added to deeper concerns about the country’s economy.</p><p>The justice ministry’s travel ban order came as dissension has emerged in the ranks of the military that stormed the legislature during the few hours of martial law command.</p><p>Col. Kim Hyun-tae, who led a special forces unit that was sent into the National Assembly, held a news conference on Monday and told reporters that his troops were victims exploited by the defense minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Colonel Kim said he received orders to forcibly remove lawmakers from the Assembly chamber. His commanders appeared to be relaying orders from the defense minister, who said the troops needed to prevent 150 lawmakers — the threshold required to repeal martial law — from gathering in the Assembly, he said.</p><p>Mr. Kim, the former defense minister, was taken into custody on Sunday for questioning by prosecutors. He is also barred from leaving the country.</p><p>After the martial law declaration, Mr. Yoon’s approval rating dropped by nearly eight points to 17 percent, its lowest level during his term, according a survey released on Monday by Realmeter, a South Korean polling company. His party, which boycotted the impeachment vote, also took a hit, its approval rating dropping by six points to 26.2 percent.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victoria Kim is a reporter based in Seoul and focuses on breaking news coverage across the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">More about Victoria Kim</a></span></p></div><div><p>Choe Sang-Hun is the lead reporter for The Times in Seoul, covering South and North Korea.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/choe-sang-hun">More about Choe Sang-Hun</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/yoon-suk-yeol">Yoon Suk-yeol</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
