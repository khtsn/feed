name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>What is the Department of Government Efficiency?</p><p>It’s a question that has come up over and over again in the avalanche of court cases challenging the authority of Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, to conduct a full-throttle effort to gut and remake the federal government.</p><p>Over two months of litigation playing out across more than 170 lawsuits, the government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/doge-lawsuits-elon-musk.html" title="">has offered limited answers</a> but insisted on one thing: that Mr. Musk exercises no authority over the office and is not even an employee.</p><p>But that assertion flies in the face of Mr. Musk’s own words and deeds as the ideological leader and public face of the still-secretive office — and President Trump’s praise of his team as an engine of upheaval. Mr. Musk and his associates have been involved in the effective shutdown of an entire agency, had a hand in thousands of federal workers losing their jobs and helped put millions of dollars in government funding and programs on the chopping block, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-funding-freeze-states.html" title="">sowing chaos at home</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/us-foreign-aid-freeze-explained.html" title="">around the globe</a>.</p><p>Often, judges have sided with the scores of lawyers demanding clarity about what Mr. Musk and members of his team are doing, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-records-questioning.html" title="">showing willingness to expedite the process</a> for groups challenging those actions to demand documents and written answers to questions about the details of the Musk team’s operations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a filing on Wednesday, lawyers for the plaintiffs asked a judge to hurry along a case focused on how DOGE, which was first announced by Mr. Trump as a limited private-sector task force shortly after he won the election, came to exercise such dramatic influence over the federal government.</p><p>“The entire thrust of this motion has been to get a definitive answer to one question,” they <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.276598/gov.uscourts.dcd.276598.29.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>. “What is the Department of Government Efficiency?”</p><p>“On the one hand, every public statement made about the leadership of DOGE agrees that Elon Musk is in charge of DOGE,” the lawyers continued. “On the other hand, every time the government is required to file a sworn declaration on the subject, Musk is a simple adviser with no role in DOGE.”</p><p>“This case as a whole hinges on the court’s ability to reconcile these two positions,” they added.</p><p>Judges have so far tended to agree that the Department of Government Efficiency described in court filings bears little resemblance to the operation whose employees have on occasion physically forced their way into agencies as well as, most recently, the nonprofit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/peace-institute-lawsuit-doge-trump.html" title="">Institute of Peace</a>. Mr. Musk has bragged about this no-holds barred approach, and Mr. Trump’s allies in Congress and elsewhere have cheered it. Lawyers for the plaintiffs have seized on that dissonance, quoting the president, Republican lawmakers and the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, all crediting Mr. Musk for significant moves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In the government’s telling, the group is an amorphous collective with no front office or organizational chart, led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/amy-gleason-doge-administrator.html" title="">Amy Gleason</a>, a former health care investment executive, and exists only as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/doge-government-efficiency-trump-musk.html" title="">an evolution of the U.S. Digital Service</a>, a tech troubleshooting office created by former President Barack Obama.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the Department of Government Efficiency were among those who physically forced their way into the Institutes of Peace earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>When early lawsuits attempted to stop the group’s operatives, as outsiders, from accessing internal agency databases and looking through sensitive information about private citizens, the unit adjusted by simply having its staff members formally hired.</p><p>“Every member of an agency’s DOGE Team is an employee of the agency or a detailee to the agency,” Ms. Gleason wrote in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277646/gov.uscourts.dcd.277646.24.2.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filing</a> on Wednesday. “The DOGE Team members — whether employees of the agency or detailed to the agency — thus report to the agency heads or their designees, not to me or anyone else at U.S.D.S.”</p><p>Ms. Gleason also reiterated a distinction Mr. Trump had made in his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> establishing the office, hinting at a longer shelf life for its efforts. While the order established DOGE as a “temporary” organization within the former digital service that would dissolve after 18 months, she stated that the office will live on as a permanent fixture within the White House that may continue its efforts after its initial blitz.</p><p>“U.S.D.S. is a permanent entity, whereas the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization is, as its name suggests, a temporary entity with an expiration date of July 4, 2026,” she wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Musk, who the White House has said is serving as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/elon-musk-special-government-employee-explainer.html" title="">special government employee</a> — a position with a strict 130-day limit — indicated in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6DiMIJIvYw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> on Fox this month that he would stay involved with the administration for “another year.”</p><p>The conflicting statements and shifting goals have helped mask the real-world influence of Mr. Musk and some of his top deputies, such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/technology/elon-musk-steve-davis-doge.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20250320&amp;instance_id=150493&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=73336075&amp;segment_id=193937&amp;user_id=06df42642a140cd72088440ffa553416" title="">Steve Davis</a>.

While the government said the office would likely struggle to comply with the order, Judge Cooper instructed it to begin retaining documents and making them available.</p><p>“The court has faith that the employees of a government organization charged with ‘modernizing federal technology and software,’ who have reportedly gained access to databases and payment systems across federal agencies, are technologically sophisticated enough to perform these basic tasks,” the judge said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Federal Layoffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Federal Workers and State Governments:</strong> Seeking to serve as a counterweight to the Trump administration, a flurry of mostly blue states has created initiatives — and ad campaigns — to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/states-hiring-fired-federal-workers.html">lure federal employees to state government jobs</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>DOGE’s ‘Wall of Receipts’:</strong> Elon Musk’s cost-cutting group debuted a website touting the money it has saved taxpayers.
