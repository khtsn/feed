Mr. Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have strongly denied that any of his sexual arrangements were nonconsensual.</p><p>Returning for a second day of testimony, Jane — who described herself as a single mother who earned a living from social media promotions — laid out how what had begun as a romantic, intimate relationship with the famed producer devolved into the hotel nights. Her testimony about those encounters closely resembled the “freak-offs” described by Casandra Ventura: elaborately staged, drug-fueled sexual encounters that were often filmed by Mr. Combs, which both women said they reluctantly took part in to please him and out of fear of repercussions if they refused.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the defense’s opening statement last month, Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, described Jane as a willing participant in a sexual relationship with Mr. Combs, and said that “she did it over and over again for three years because she made the choice.”</p><p>At a hotel night with Mr. Combs in October 2023, Jane said, she attempted to go sober. She had sex with two escorts — without the drugs, she was “repulsed” by the experience, she testified — and then went to a bathroom, where she vomited.</p><p>Mr. Combs entered the bathroom, she said, and told her, “Let’s go” — a third escort had arrived. She said she complied.</p><p>Sitting in between his lawyers, Mr. Combs appeared to listen to Jane’s testimony intently, leaning back in his chair. His mother and sister were present in the spectators’ gallery, as was Dana Tran, the mother of his youngest child.</p><p>On the stand, Jane said that if they ran out of drugs during hotel nights, Mr. Combs would call one of a number of assistants and bodyguards to get more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Twice, Jane said, Mr. Combs asked her to transport drugs from Los Angeles to Mr. Combs’s island mansion outside Miami.</p><p>The first time, she said, Mr. Combs told her to pick up a “package” from his residence in Beverly Hills. Before she did so, Jane said, she called Kristina Khorram, Mr. Combs’s chief of staff, and asked her if it was safe. “She said, ‘It’s fine, I do it all the time,’” Jane testified.</p><p>On Thursday, prosecutors told the judge that they consider Ms. Khorram a part of the criminal conspiracy they have outlined as part of the racketeering charge against Mr. Combs. Ms. Khorram has not been called as a witness.</p><p>Jane said she put the package — a white envelope — in her luggage and brought it to Mr. Combs’s home. She saw him open it in a bathroom; inside were “colorful” Ecstasy pills. She took some of them to “start partying,” Jane said.</p><p>Jane, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-trial-jane-freak-offs.html" title="">testimony began on Thursday</a> and is expected to last well into next week, also gave more details about her hotel nights with Mr. Combs.</p><p>Her longest sexual marathon occurred around a New Year’s Eve celebration and lasted three or three-and-a-half sleepless days, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Her voice breaking on the stand while she cried, Jane said that if she would indicate to Mr. Combs that she was exhausted during these extended sessions, he would say something to the effect of, “You’re not getting tired on me, are you?” She said he would give her multiple doses of Ecstasy, which would help her stay awake.</p><p>Maurene Comey, a prosecutor, asked Jane who decided when one of these encounters would end.</p><p>“Sean,” Jane answered.</p><p>She said that after one of these events, she began to cry. Mr. Combs had promised that it would be quick, she testified, but it ended up lasting about 18 hours, and she grew emotional when Mr. Combs said he then had to leave.</p><p>“He said, ‘Are you crying?’” Jane testified. “And just looked like almost disgusted with my face.”</p><p>Jane said she asked Mr. Combs’s permission to have the other men involved in these encounters wear condoms. He generally was “dismissive” of her request, she said, and pressured her to continue without protection.</p><p>The jury was played an audio recording that Jane said came from an iPhone video that had captured a “hotel night” involving a man she called Don. The recording was noisy, but Jane described a conversation in which she and Don were searching for a condom, and said that Mr. Combs entered the room and instructed her to touch herself.</p><p>“I just understood,” Jane testified, “that my request is just going to be denied, so just move on from this request.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When her encounters with Mr. Combs began in 2021, Jane said, he chose the male escorts they hired. By the next year, she began picking some of the men herself, picking two pornographic actors she called Kabral and Anton.</p><p>“I just said to myself, if we’re going to be doing this I should just choose,” Jane testified.</p><p>The prosecution presented sexually charged text messages between Jane and Kabral, which she said she participated in because Mr. Combs asked her to try to get Kabral to send nude images.</p><p>Jane testified that hotel nights would usually occur without use of a condom, and that the man Mr. Combs hired to have sex with her would ejaculate on her body. Without cleaning herself, she would then have sex with Mr. Combs, she said, because that is what he preferred.</p><p>Jane also testified about various text messages between her and Mr. Combs — sexually explicit flirtations involving “fantasy talk” about other men, as well as a complaint to Mr. Combs that she did not want to participate in their group encounters anymore and that she feared he would revoke financial support. On Thursday, Jane had testified that Mr. Combs paid the $10,000 monthly rent for her home.</p><p>“I don’t want to play this role in your life anymore,” Jane told Mr. Combs in a text, saying that she did not want to participate in hotel nights to maintain a roof over her head.</p><p>Mr. Combs responded: “Girl stop.”</p><p>Anusha Bayya<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
