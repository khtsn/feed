Three other men were invited, Jane said, and Ecstasy and cocaine were available.</p><p>Following what Jane — a pseudonym used in court to protect the woman’s privacy — called a frequent pattern in her relationship with Mr. Combs, she started off having sex with one of the men, whom she described as escorts or “entertainers.” Mr. Combs took drugs; that night she did not. After she had sex with the second man, Jane said, she retreated to a bathroom and vomited.</p><p>Mr. Combs said the vomiting would make her feel better, Jane testified, and he told her a third escort was ready for her. “Let’s go,” he said. She complied, and had sex with the third man.</p><p>“I was just disgusted,” Jane testified of the experience. “I was just repulsed.”</p><p>Jane’s account of that night was one of many grueling details from her second day of testimony in Mr. Combs’s trial on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. Mr. Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have strongly denied that any of his sexual arrangements were nonconsensual.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>During hours on the stand that left her in tears at times, Jane recounted a relationship with Mr. Combs that began in 2021 with intimacy and romance, but devolved into what she called “hotel nights” or debauchery: elaborately staged, drug-fueled sexual marathons with male prostitutes while Mr. Combs watched, masturbated, provided specific directions and made video recordings.</p><p>Her account of these events mirrored aspects of the “freak-offs” described earlier in the trial by Casandra Ventura, who had been in an off-and-on relationship with Mr. Combs before he met Jane. Both women said they reluctantly participated, in part to please him but also out of fear of repercussions if they refused. Mr. Combs started paying Jane’s rent in 2023 and still pays it now, she testified.</p><p>Ms. Ventura, the singer known as Cassie, filed a bombshell lawsuit against Mr. Combs in late 2023 that offered many details of their freak-offs and led to the government’s investigation. But according to Jane, Mr. Combs’s behavior continued well after Ms. Ventura’s suit brought it to public attention, stretching well into 2024, not long before he was arrested.</p><p>Jane said that Mr. Combs pressured her to have sex with male escorts without a condom and asked her to transport drugs in her luggage. Their hotel nights frequently lasted up to 30 hours, she said, and once went as long as three days. She said she told Mr. Combs that she did not want to have sex with other men anymore, but feared he would revoke financial support if she refused.</p><p>“Look at the roof over your head and that pretty smile,” Mr. Combs texted Jane in August 2023, referring to the dental veneers he bought her because, she said, he did not like her teeth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Prosecutors showed jurors a series of text messages that Jane sent to Mr. Combs during their relationship in which she expressed distaste and regret about their hotel nights.</p><p>“I don’t ever want to do another hotel entertainment night with you,” Jane texted Mr. Combs in 2022, saying that they made her feel “cheap.”</p><p>Jane also read aloud a private note from her phone that she wrote about Mr. Combs that same year: “I don’t want to do drugs for days and days and have you use me to fulfill your freaky, wild desires in hotel rooms.”</p><p>But the hotel nights continued for nearly two more years. Jane testified that she continued to “perform” for Mr. Combs sexually both to please a man she said she loved deeply and out of a sense of obligation.</p><p>In the defense’s opening statement last month, Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, described Jane as a willing participant in a sexual relationship with Mr. Combs, and said that she took part in the hotel nights “over and over again for three years because she made the choice.”</p><p>Her voice breaking on the stand while she cried, Jane said that if she indicated to Mr. Combs that she was exhausted during these extended sessions, he would say something to the effect of, “You’re not getting tired on me, are you?” She said that during each encounter, he would give her multiple doses of Ecstasy, which would help her stay awake. She said she suffered from urinary tract and yeast infections as a result of frequent sex with other men.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Maurene Comey, a prosecutor, asked Jane who decided when one of these encounters would end.</p><p>“Sean,” Jane answered.</p><p>Earlier, Jane described asking Mr. Combs’s permission to have the other man wear a condom. He generally was “dismissive” of her request, she said, and pressured her to continue without protection.</p><p>The jury was played an audio recording that Jane said came from an iPhone video that had captured a “hotel night” involving a man she called Don. The recording was noisy, but Jane described a conversation in which she and Don were searching for a condom, and said that Mr. Combs entered the room and instructed her to touch herself.</p><p>“I just understood,” Jane testified, “that my request is just going to be denied, so just move on from this request.”</p><p>Jane also described two instances in which she communicated to Mr. Combs that she did not want to have sex with the particular men who had been invited. Mr. Combs seemed “agitated,” she said, but he agreed.</p><p>Sitting in between his lawyers, Mr. Combs appeared to listen to Jane’s testimony intently, leaning back in his chair. His mother, sister and two of his sons have been present in the spectators’ gallery, as has Dana Tran, the mother of his youngest child. His reactions were more muted on Friday, after the judge overseeing the case <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-trial-jane-freak-offs.html" title="">admonished him for “nodding vigorously”</a> at the jury during the cross-examination of another witness on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On the stand, Jane said that if they ran out of drugs during hotel nights, Mr. Combs would call an assistant or bodyguard to get more. Twice, Jane said, Mr. Combs asked her to transport drugs to his island mansion outside Miami.</p><p>The first time, she said, Mr. Combs told her to pick up a “package” from his residence in the Los Angeles area. Before she did so, Jane said, she called Kristina Khorram, Mr. Combs’s chief of staff, and asked her if it was safe. “She said, ‘It’s fine, I do it all the time,’” Jane testified.</p><p>On Thursday, prosecutors told the judge that they consider Ms. Khorram a part of the criminal conspiracy at the heart of the racketeering charge against Mr. Combs. Ms. Khorram has not been called as a witness.</p><p>Jane said she put the package — a white envelope — in her luggage and brought it to Mr. Combs’s home. She saw him open it in a bathroom; inside were “colorful” Ecstasy pills. She took some of them to “start partying,” Jane said.</p><p>For her birthday in 2023, Jane testified, she had hoped for a romantic night for just the two of them. She dressed up for a sushi dinner. Mr. Combs was loving and sweet at first, she said, but then said he was “excited to see what entertainment is tonight.” She knew that meant a hotel night.</p><p>Jane had sex with three other men that night, she testified.</p><p>When those encounters began in 2021, Jane said, Mr. Combs chose the male escorts they hired. By the next year, she began picking some of the men herself, selecting two pornographic actors she called Sly and Anton.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I just said to myself, if we’re going to be doing this, I should just choose,” Jane testified.</p><p>Jane testified that during hotel nights, the escort would ejaculate on her body. Without cleaning herself, she would then have sex with Mr. Combs, she said, because that is what he preferred.</p><p>At a certain point, Jane testified, she felt compelled to participate in the sex with escorts because of the $10,000-a-month rent that Mr. Combs was paying — a dynamic that prosecutors have framed as financial coercion.</p><p>“I don’t want to play this role in your life anymore,” Jane told Mr. Combs in a text in 2023, saying that she did not want to feel obligated to participate in hotel nights to maintain a roof over her head.</p><p>Mr. Combs responded: “Girl stop.”</p><p>Anusha Bayya<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
