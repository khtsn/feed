Three other men were invited, Jane said, and Ecstasy and cocaine were available.</p><p>Following what Jane — a pseudonym used in court to protect the woman’s privacy — called a frequent pattern in her relationship with Mr. Combs, she started off having sex with one of the men, whom she described as escorts or “entertainers.” Mr. Combs took drugs; that night she did not. By the time she finished having sex with the second man, Jane said, she retreated to a bathroom and vomited.</p><p>Mr. Combs insisted the vomiting would make her feel better, she said, and let her know that a third escort was ready for her. “Let’s go,” he told Jane. She complied, and had sex with the third man.</p><p>“I was just disgusted,” Jane testified of the experience. “I was just repulsed.”</p><p>Jane’s account of that night was one of many grueling details from her testimony in Mr. Combs’s trial on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. Mr. Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have strongly denied that any of his sexual arrangements were nonconsensual.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>During hours on the stand that left her in tears at times, Jane recounted a relationship with Mr. Combs that began in 2021 with intimacy and romance, but quickly devolved into what she called “hotel nights”: elaborately staged, drug-fueled sexual marathons with male prostitutes, while Mr. Combs watched, masturbated, provided specific directions and made video recordings.</p><p>In many ways, her descriptions of these events mirrored the accounts of the “freak-offs” that had been recounted earlier in the trial by Casandra Ventura, who had been in an off-and-on relationship with Mr. Combs for 11 years before he met Jane. Both women said they reluctantly took part to please him and out of fear of repercussions if they refused.</p><p>Ms. Ventura, the singer known as Cassie, filed a bombshell lawsuit against Mr. Combs in late 2023 — offering many details of their freak-offs — that was settled in just one day, and led to the government’s investigation. But according to Jane, Mr. Combs’s behavior continued well after Ms. Ventura’s case brought it to public attention, stretching well into 2024, not long before he was arrested.</p><p>Jane said that Mr. Combs pressured her to have sex with male escorts without a condom and asked her to transport drugs for him in her luggage. Their hotel nights frequently lasted up to 30 hours, she said, and once went as long as three days. She said she told Mr. Combs that she did not want to have sex with other men anymore, but feared he would stop financial support if she refused.</p><p>In the defense’s opening statement last month, Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, described Jane as a willing participant in a sexual relationship with Mr. Combs, and said that “she did it over and over again for three years because she made the choice.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Her voice breaking on the stand while she cried, Jane said that if she indicated to Mr. Combs that she was exhausted during these extended sessions, he would say something to the effect of, “You’re not getting tired on me, are you?” She said that during each encounter, he would give her multiple doses of Ecstasy, which would help her stay awake. She said she suffered from urinary tract and yeast infections as a result of frequent sex with other men.</p><p>Maurene Comey, a prosecutor, asked Jane who decided when one of these encounters would end.</p><p>“Sean,” Jane answered.</p><p>She said that after one of these events, she began to cry. Mr. Combs had promised that it would be quick, she testified, but it ended up lasting about 18 hours, and she grew emotional when Mr. Combs said he then had to leave.</p><p>“He said, ‘Are you crying?’” Jane testified. “And just looked like almost disgusted with my face.”</p><p>She described two times that she told Mr. Combs she did not want to have sex with a man who was hired for the night, and he agreed. On one occasion in 2023, when she said she was not attracted to the entertainer, Mr. Combs was “agitated,” she said, “but he was like, ‘OK, all right,’ and just seemed almost a little confused by it.”</p><p>During her testimony, she also said that she took part in the hotel nights to please Mr. Combs. “I loved him deeply,” she said.</p><p>Sitting in between his lawyers, Mr. Combs appeared to listen to Jane’s testimony intently, leaning back in his chair. His mother, sister and two of his sons have been present in the spectators’ gallery, as has Dana Tran, the mother of his youngest child.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On the stand, Jane said that if they ran out of drugs during hotel nights, Mr. Combs would call one of his assistants and bodyguards to get more.</p><p>Twice, Jane said, Mr. Combs asked her to transport drugs from his home in the Los Angeles area to Mr. Combs’s island mansion outside Miami.</p><p>The first time, she said, Mr. Combs told her to pick up a “package” from his residence in Beverly Hills. Before she did so, Jane said, she called Kristina Khorram, Mr. Combs’s chief of staff, and asked her if it was safe. “She said, ‘It’s fine, I do it all the time,’” Jane testified.</p><p>On Thursday, prosecutors told the judge that they consider Ms. Khorram a part of the criminal conspiracy they have outlined as part of the racketeering charge against Mr. Combs. Ms. Khorram has not been called as a witness.</p><p>Jane said she put the package — a white envelope — in her luggage and brought it to Mr. Combs’s home. She saw him open it in a bathroom; inside were “colorful” Ecstasy pills. She took some of them to “start partying,” Jane said.</p><p>Jane said she asked Mr. Combs’s permission to have the other men involved in these encounters wear condoms. He generally was “dismissive” of her request, she said, and pressured her to continue without protection.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Earlier in the day, the jury was played an audio recording that Jane said came from an iPhone video that had captured a hotel night involving a man she called Don. The recording was noisy, but Jane described a conversation in which she and Don were searching for a condom, and said that Mr. Combs entered the room and instructed her to touch herself.</p><p>“I just understood,” Jane testified, “that my request is just going to be denied, so just move on from this request.”</p><p>For her birthday in 2023, Jane testified, she hoped for a romantic night for just the two of them. She dressed up for a sushi dinner. Mr. Combs was loving and sweet at first, she said, before telling her he was “excited to see what entertainment is tonight.” She knew that meant a hotel night.</p><p>She had sex with three men that night, she testified.</p><p>When her encounters with Mr. Combs began in 2021, Jane said, he chose the male escorts they hired. By the next year, she began picking some of the men herself, selecting two pornographic actors she called Kabral and Anton.</p><p>“I just said to myself, if we’re going to be doing this, I should just choose,” Jane testified.</p><p>Jane testified that hotel nights would usually occur without use of a condom, and that the man Mr. Combs hired to have sex with her would ejaculate on her body. Without cleaning herself, she would then have sex with Mr. Combs, she said, because that is what he preferred.</p><p>Jane also testified about various text messages between her and Mr. Combs — sexually explicit flirtations involving “fantasy talk” about other men, as well as a complaint to Mr. Combs that she did not want to participate in their group encounters anymore and that she feared he would stop supporting her financially. On Thursday, Jane had testified that Mr. Combs paid the $10,000 monthly rent for her home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I don’t want to play this role in your life anymore,” Jane told Mr. Combs in a text, saying that she did not want to participate in hotel nights to maintain a roof over her head.</p><p>Mr. Combs responded: “Girl stop.”</p><p>Anusha Bayya<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
