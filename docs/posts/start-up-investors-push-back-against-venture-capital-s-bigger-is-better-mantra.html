But Mr. Chirls said he had become disillusioned as venture capital grew from a collection of small partnerships into an industry dominated by firms that managed enormous sums.</p><p>The focus on accumulating and deploying as much money as possible “completely dehumanized the entire business,” he said.</p><p>Instead, Mr. Chirls is starting a new kind of firm. From the outside, the endeavor, Asylum Ventures, looks like his old firm, with a $55 million venture fund that will invest in very young tech companies. But the approach is set to be very different, making fewer investments over a longer period in companies that will not need to raise increasingly large funding rounds, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Chirls and his partners, Jonathan Wu and Mackenzie Regent, are part of a small but vocal group of start-up investors who are pushing back against venture capital’s changing scope and priorities. Venture capital investing has traditionally involved small groups of financiers who backed very young, very risky companies that couldn’t obtain traditional loans. The sums invested were often small.</p><p>But that changed in recent years as investors poured billions of dollars into unproven start-ups with little diligence and investment firms expanded rapidly into new strategies and geographies. Last year, venture capital managed $1.1 trillion, up from $297 billion in 2013, according to PitchBook, which tracks start-ups.</p><p>The growth was, in some ways, a natural result of the outsize expansion of the tech industry over the last decade. The five most valuable public companies — Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet — were initially backed by venture capital. And since many tech start-ups stay private longer than they did in the past, there were more opportunities for venture funds to back them.</p><p>The expansion has damaged what makes the tech industry special, Mr. Chirls said, which is why Asylum is aiming to do things differently. Most venture capital funds raise money from outside investors and deploy it in dozens of start-ups within two to three years. The start-ups then raise numerous rounds of funding, with the aim of selling or going public and earning a return for investors.</p><p>But Asylum plans to make only four or five investments a year over a longer period, Mr. Chirls said. It will also focus on backing start-ups that need only a small amount of money — as little as $500,000 — to get going.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Those are rare,” Mr. Chirls said. “There are not hundreds of them.”</p><p>He said he was inspired by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/business/media/a24-oscars-everything-everywhere-the-whale.html" title="">A24</a>, the independent movie company known for hits like “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” which fosters small, unusual projects that the big Hollywood studios won’t touch.</p><p>Bryce Roberts, an investor at Indie.vc, a firm that encourages start-ups to put a priority on building sustainable businesses over raising the most money, said he supported these tiny forms of resistance.</p><p>“We’re still a small minority,” Mr. Roberts said. “My hope is it starts to validate this approach.”</p><p>Terrain, another firm, has also <a href="https://www.terrain.com/letter" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged</a> founders to explore new ways of expanding businesses beyond the typical start-up track of raising more money.</p><p>Mr. Chirls, previously a bond trader at Lehman Brothers, found his way to start-ups after the 2008 financial crisis. He was struck by the way some entrepreneurs he met, like David Karp, who founded the blogging platform Tumblr, approached building tech products as creative endeavors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Chirls became an investor at Betaworks, a New York-based start-up studio, before forming Notation with a partner, Alex Lines, in 2015. Notation was among the first funds focused on “pre-seed” investing, or the very earliest funding a start-up raises.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Asylum plans to make only four or five investments a year and over a longer period than most venture capital funds, Mr. Chirls said. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jack Flame Sorokin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The firm invested in start-ups including Bison Trails, a crypto start-up that sold to Coinbase, and Parsec Cloud, a gaming start-up that sold to Unity Software. So far, Notation’s first fund has returned more than three times the capital raised, while its second has returned more than two and a half times, putting them in the top 5 percent of funds in the years they were raised, according to data from Notation Capital and Cambridge Associates, which tracks venture fund performance.</p><p>Since then, larger funds have moved into the pre-seed area, as the venture industry has become awash in cash.</p><p>The growth and a frenzy of start-up deal-making — which Mr. Chirls said reminded him of his time at Lehman and “was indistinguishable from a trading floor” — peaked in 2021, he said. He considered leaving the industry but decided, with Mr. Wu and Ms. Regent, who worked at Notation, on a new approach.</p><p>Limited partners, which back venture funds, were willing to give Asylum more than the $55 million it raised, said Beezer Clarkson, an investor at Sapphire Partners, which put money into the new fund.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Ms. Clarkson said she appreciated that Mr. Chirls “stayed true to his power alley” by keeping the fund small, since smaller funds tended to perform the best.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-11"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Erin Griffith covers tech companies, start-ups and the culture of Silicon Valley from San Francisco.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erin-griffith">More about Erin Griffith</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Has Tipping Reached Its Limit?: </strong>Americans are being asked to tip more often and in more places than ever before. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/business/economy/tipped-workers-taxes.html">It may soon get worse</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Coffee Wars: </strong>From Starbucks to specialty cafes, there is something of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/business/coffee-wars-arms-race-starbucks.html">an arms race going on in the coffee world</a>, as competitors battle to create the craziest, calorie-laden, not-really-coffee drink.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rise of ‘Retailtainment’: </strong>Mall owners are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/business/malls-experiences-hasbro-nerf.html">spending millions on fun, games and other experiential offerings</a> in hopes of drawing customers back to their properties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Changing a Chatbot’s Mind: </strong>When our tech columnist set out to improve his tainted reputation with chatbots, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/technology/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-manipulation.html">he discovered a new world of A.I. manipulation</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>College Sports’ Big Money Era: </strong>Some college athletes can expect to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars annually through name, image and likeness deals. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/31/business/nil-money-ncaa.html">Here’s where the money goes</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
