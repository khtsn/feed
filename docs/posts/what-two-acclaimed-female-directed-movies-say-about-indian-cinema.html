The other is a delicate tale about the intersecting lives of three women in cosmopolitan Mumbai.</p><p>And both films might have a shot at winning Academy Awards — a rare prospect for a country that produces more than 1,000 movies a year but has found the topmost industry honors hard to come by.</p><p>With small budgets and unconventional plots, “Laapataa Ladies” and “All We Imagine as Light” have captivated audiences. That both were directed by women and have female-centric themes has become an additional point of pride in India, where the frothy romps of male-dominated Bollywood are a large part of the cinematic landscape.</p><p>Directed by Kiran Rao, “Laapataa Ladies” — renamed “Lost Ladies” for its Oscar campaign — has had a hugely successful run in the domestic market since its March release, and is now streaming on Netflix.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“All We Imagine as Light,” directed by Payal Kapadia, won the Grand Prix at Cannes in May. It was released in Indian theaters this month, and opened on Nov. 15 in New York and Los Angeles.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/movies/all-we-imagine-as-light-review.html" title="">review</a> of the movie for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called it a “quiet drama about fragility, beauty and kinship” that is “flat-out wonderful, one of finest of the year.”</p><p>Ms. Kapadia’s victory was the first big win for an Indian film in more than three decades at Cannes. “Please don’t wait 30 years to have another Indian film,” Ms. Kapadia said while accepting the award.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A scene from “All We Imagine as Light,” directed by Ms. Kapadia.

But in September, the Film Federation of India chose to enter “Laapataa Ladies” as its official submission for best foreign language film at the Oscars. The decision surprised many critics, who considered “All We Imagine as Light” a better choice.</p><p>Representatives of Ms. Kapadia’s film called the choice a snub and are pushing for the movie to get nominations in other Oscar categories, including for best director.</p><p>“India has a long history of not electing decorated, critically acclaimed independent films,” Ezra Scott-Henning, who represents the U.S. distributor of Ms. Kapadia’s movie, said in a statement.</p><p>In explaining its choice of “Laapataa Ladies,” the 13-member Film Federation jury said the movie spoke to the diversity of women’s experiences in India.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The organization’s president, Ravi Kottarakara, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/ffi-president-ravi-kottakara-reveals-why-cannes-grand-prix-winning-all-we-imagine-as-light-was-not-selected-for-oscars-race-jury-felt-that-laapataa-ladies-represents-india-exclusive/articleshow/113610052.cms" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Times of India</a> that the jury “felt that ‘All We Imagine as Light’ is like a foreign film and not like Indian cinema.” While quirky and smaller in scale, “Laapataa Ladies” fits within the general Bollywood format.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Lost Ladies,” also known as “Laapataa Ladies,” released domestically in March, has been popular with audiences. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Product of Culture</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mira Nair, the acclaimed director whose 1988 film “Salaam Bombay!” won the Camera d’Or prize at Cannes and was nominated for best foreign language film at the Oscars, said that “usually the committees only know, and favor, Bollywood-style storytelling.”</p><p>“The kind of films that may be favored by the Academy,” she added, “are not thought about.”</p><p>Ms. Rao, the director of “Laapataa Ladies,” acknowledged the pressure that her Oscar selection had placed on her and lamented the controversy over the two films.</p><p>“It is a little bit overwhelming that everyone is looking at this film to achieve something,” said Ms. Rao, speaking by phone from Los Angeles, where her team was arranging screenings for Academy Award judges. “It makes us really happy that we have so many people rooting for us, but also, we really have to keep our heads down and keep going.”</p><p>Referring to the way her film has been pitted against Ms. Kapadia’s, Ms. Rao added, “This either/or point of view needs to change, and it has to become an ‘and’ kind of conversation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Kapadia had a similar reaction. She said she did not see it as two female directors competing against each other, but simply as two films among the 29 that were submitted to the film federation.</p><p>The debate about whether her film would have a better shot at the Academy Awards arose because it “had gotten so much publicity during that Cannes time,” she said, and because people wanted “click bait.”</p><p>As these two movies show, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/11/movies/cannes-film-festival-india.html" title="">Indian cinema is much more than traditional Bollywood</a>, with its grand melodramas, romantic comedies and action thrillers dotted with song-and-dance routines. There are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/25/world/asia/kaathal-film-mammootty-india.html" title="">vibrant pockets of regional cinema</a> around the country.</p><p>India also has a strong tradition of documentary and art house cinema. In 2021, Ms. Kapadia’s film “A Night of Knowing Nothing,” which <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-night-of-knowing-nothing-review-payal-kapadia-1234669068/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chronicled a student protest movement</a> against the Modi government, won the award for best documentary film at Cannes.</p><p>Many other Indian films have also won awards at film festivals and played to critical acclaim globally, even if the highest honors have been elusive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Only three movies submitted by India have been chosen as nominees for best foreign film Oscars — in 1957, 1988 and 2001. In 2023, the three-hour Telugu-language movie “RRR” became the first Indian feature to win an Academy Award for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/movies/oscars-naatu-naatu-best-original-song.html" title="">best original song</a>. In 1983, Bhanu Athaiya brought India its first Oscar when she won in the costume design category for the film “Gandhi.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“It makes us really happy that we have so many people rooting for us, but also, we really have to keep our heads down and keep going,” said Kiran Rao, director of “Lost Ladies,” aka “Laapataa Ladies.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin Tallis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>By comparison, South Korea, with a far smaller film industry, has achieved global recognition with a breakthrough win at the Oscars. In 2020, “Parasite” picked up four Academy Awards, including best picture.<span>  </span>An earlier Korean film, “Oldboy,” won the Grand Prix at Cannes in 2004.</p><p>“Indian cinema is really traveling far and wide,” said Anupama Chopra, a film journalist and critic. “Whether we win or not is more complex.”</p><p>Ms. Chopra said that running an awards campaign for a film was like “running a political campaign,” where money, lobbying and logistics come into play. Film critics said that international awards are just one measure of a film’s quality.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Ms. Rao and Ms. Kapadia have crisscrossed the globe recently to promote their films and generate Oscar buzz. In New York, Ms. Rao and her former husband, the Bollywood megastar Aamir Khan, whose company co-produced her film, kicked off her U.S. publicity campaign at Bungalow, a popular Indian restaurant.</p><p>Ms. Kapadia, who was in Delhi this month to talk about her film ahead of its India release, flew back to New York to attend screenings.</p><p>It can be tough to compete for attention with other international and Hollywood movies, according to the two directors.</p><p>There’s “much work to be done to amplify voices in our country, but I think we’ve made a pretty good start this year with these films,” Ms. Rao said.</p><p>Promoting a movie from India can also be challenging because the diversity of Indian cinema makes it hard to put films into neat categories that would appeal to awards committees, according to film critics and filmmakers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Last year the Telugu-language movie “RRR” became the first Indian feature to win an Academy Award for best original song.
