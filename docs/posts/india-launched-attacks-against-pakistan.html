India said the strikes were “focused, measured, and nonescalatory in nature,” and that Pakistani military facilities were not targeted. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/asia/india-pakistan-attacks.html" title="">This is a developing story.</a></p><p>Pakistan, which confirmed five strikes, said in a statement that the attacks “will not go unanswered,” and military officials said they had begun a “measured but forceful” response. The two countries, both nuclear-armed, have fought several wars over Kashmir, a region that they share but that each claims in whole. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-terrorism.html" title="">Here’s what to know about the latest clash</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-48555f9c">Justices allowed Trump to enforce a transgender troop ban</h2><p>The Supreme Court ruled today that the Trump administration could enforce its ban on transgender troops while legal challenges to the policy move forward. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/politics/supreme-court-transgender-troops.html" title="">Lower courts had blocked the ban</a>, saying it was not supported by evidence and violated equal protection principles.</p><p>The ruling was unsigned and it offered no reasoning, which is typical when the court acts on emergency applications. All three of the court’s liberal justices dissented.</p><p>The Pentagon began enforcing a ban on transgender troops in February, but federal judges in Washington State and Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked the policy after service members sued. According to military officials, about 4,200 service members, or roughly 0.2 percent of the military, are transgender.</p><p><strong>In related news: </strong>Fencing is the latest sport <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/trump-transgender-athletes-fencing-olympics.html" title="">caught in the transgender athlete debate</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada and President Trump in the Oval Office.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-1b468b65">Carney told Trump that Canada was ‘not for sale’</h2><p>Prime Minister Mark Carney sat down today with President Trump in the Oval Office for their first face-to-face meeting since Carney won his federal election last month on an anti-Trump platform. Carney had one key goal: to say that Canada is not going to become the 51st state while avoiding a public fight.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/canada/trump-carney-white-house-meeting-us-canada.html" title="">On that, he succeeded</a>, my colleagues Matina Stevis-Gridneff and Tyler Pager reported from Washington.</p><p>Carney spoke just three times over the course of a half-hour in front of the cameras. Carney said Canada “won’t be for sale, ever,” to which Trump replied, “Never say never.” But the meeting was otherwise cordial. Trump said he had “a lot of respect” for Carney. The Canadian leader applauded Trump for his “relentless focus on the American worker.”</p><h2 id="link-45b6d1ea">In other politics news:</h2><ul><li><p>Trump said the U.S. would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/politics/trump-houthis-bombing.html" title="">stop bombing Houthi rebels</a> over their attacks on ships.</p></li><li><p>Congressional leaders urged the White House to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/politics/congress-white-house-spending-website.html" title="">restore a website tracking federal spending</a>, escalating a battle over spending powers.</p></li><li><p>Dozens of House Democrats joined Republicans in a vote against a major climate policy. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/democrats-california-ban-electric-vehicles.html" title="">Here’s why</a>.</p></li><li><p>Thom Tillis, a key Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/politics/thom-tillis-ed-martin.html" title="">would not support Trump’s pick</a> for U.S. attorney in Washington.</p></li><li><p>Alcatraz as a prison, again? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/alcatraz-trump-tourists.html" title="">Tourists say Trump is on his own island</a>.</p></li><li><p>Democrats are facing long odds to retake the Senate majority. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/politics/2026-senate-map-democrats-schumer.html" title="">Here’s their plan</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sirine Shebaya, the executive director of the National Immigration Project.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-23e0db0">Big law firms are turning down pro bono immigration cases</h2><p>Fearing Trump’s wrath, some elite law firms are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/business/trump-law-firms-pro-bono-immigration.html" title="">declining pro bono work on lawsuits challenging the administration’s policies</a>.
