The attack appeared to target support features of the bridge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was not immediately clear how much damage the bridge sustained. A photo from the agency shows some damage to its railing.</p><p>Traffic on the bridge was suspended for about three hours on Tuesday morning, and then later in the day, about an hour after the S.B.U. published its report, it was closed again for about two hours, according to <a href="https://t.me/most_official" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Telegram channel</a> that tracks the bridge’s operation. The reasons for the closures were not disclosed.

Debris fell on the road above, Rybar said in <a href="https://t.me/rybar/70969" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the post</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The strike on the bridge came two days after Ukraine conducted one of the most ambitious operations of the war deep inside Russia, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-strikes.html" title="">targeting</a> the Russian strategic bombing fleet.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/08/world/russia-ukraine-war-news/a-fireball-erupts-on-a-bridge-linking-crimea-to-russia?smid=url-share" title="">Kerch Strait Bridge</a> stretches for 12 miles and is a primary supply route for Moscow’s forces fighting in southern Ukraine. It is deeply symbolic for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/world/europe/putin-russia-crimea-bridge.html" title="">presided over its opening</a> in 2018.</p><p>In October 2022, a truck laden with explosives was detonated as it crossed the bridge, causing a fireball <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/17/world/europe/crimea-bridge-collapse.html" title="">large enough to rupture fuel tanks on a passing train</a> and setting it on fire.

These include the installation of underwater barriers to defend its stanchions from attacks at or below the water line and the deployment of the most sophisticated air defense systems to defend it from aerial rockets and drones.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, the Russians directed a barrage of rockets at the center of Sumy, a city in the northeast near Ukraine’s border with Russia that is home to more than 200,000 civilians, including many who fled fighting along the border.</p><p>The attack killed at least three people, wounding another 25 and setting cars on fire, according to local officials.</p><p>One rocket remained unexploded in an apartment on the top floor of a nine-story building. Videos from the scene showed many burning cars and destroyed houses, with emergency workers evacuating the wounded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>That attack on Sumy is part of an increase in Russian offensive operations on the front. In May, Russian troops gained more than twice as much territory as they did in April, seizing roughly 449 square kilometers of land, according to DeepState, a Ukrainian research group that uses combat footage to map the battlefield.</p><p>Most of those gains have come in eastern Ukraine, south of the town of Kostiantynivka, and in a push across the border in the Sumy region, where Russian forces captured another village on Tuesday, according to military analysts.</p><p>Ivan Shevtsov of Ukraine’s Steel Border Brigade said Russia had advanced about four miles into the country along a nine-mile-long stretch of border in the Sumy region.</p><p>Military analysts say that if Russia advanced 12 miles into Ukraine, its forces could target the city of Sumy with short-range weapons like small exploding drones. Such attacks in Kherson, in southern Ukraine, have killed at least 150 civilians; a United Nations commission <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/05/un-commission-concludes-russian-armed-forces-drone-attacks-against-civilians" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said last week</a> that those attacks amounted to crimes against humanity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the site of a strike in Sumy, Ukraine, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Across Ukraine over the past day, Russian drone attacks killed at least 10 civilians and wounded more than 50, Ukrainian officials said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“It is obvious: Without global pressure — without decisive actions from the United States, Europe, and everyone in the world who has the power — Putin will not agree even to a cease-fire,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement.</p><p>Amid the escalating violence, Mr. Zelensky’s chief of staff flew to the United States, accompanied by a Ukrainian delegation, for talks with the Trump administration.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Adam Entous<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ivan Nechepurenko<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nataliya Vasilyeva<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nataliia Novosolova<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia. He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.
