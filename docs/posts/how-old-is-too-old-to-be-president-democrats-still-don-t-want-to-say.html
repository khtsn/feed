The issue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/us/politics/biden-campaign-democrats.html" title="">torpedoed his campaign</a> and saddled his vice president with an extraordinarily short political runway.</p><p>But one month after Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/democrats-kamala-harris.html" title="">lost up and down the ticket</a>, party leaders are already struggling with the next age-related question: How old is too old to be the 2028 Democratic nominee?</p><p>“There’s no such thing,” insisted Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, 65, of New Mexico.</p><p>“It’s not a time of life, it’s a state of mind,” declared Gov. Gavin Newsom, 57, of California, adding that the idea of broadly defining 80 as too old to run was “absurd.”</p><p>“When I was growing up, people who were 65 were almost dead,” Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said. “I’m 65. I’m not almost dead.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As the nation’s Democratic governors gathered for a winter meeting in Beverly Hills, Calif., this weekend, they lamented their party’s messaging challenges and grappled with the widespread defeats. But in interviews with roughly 10 Democratic governors and candidates for governor, no one offered an explicit age limit for the next nominee. And some said that age was irrelevant altogether if a candidate appeared to be in strong shape and was connecting with voters.</p><p>“I don’t have an age test,” said Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, 67, though he allowed that he would be “surprised” if any 80-year-olds ended up in the running. “The question is: Are you in the game? Are you — we have an incredible bench, and the bench is sort of a spectrum of ages.”</p><p>The interviews illustrated how discussions of age remain delicate and divisive in Democratic politics — and showed that many leading Democrats remain reluctant to publicly criticize Mr. Biden, 82, even as many in the party fault him for Vice President Kamala Harris’s defeat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

Trump back to power.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A number of Democrats in powerful positions, such as Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, are in their 70s. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is stepping down from leadership but remains the minority leader, is 82. (The House leaders from both parties, however, are considerably younger.)</p><p>This weekend, the Democratic governors milled around the lobby and huddled in conference rooms at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/arts/music/whitney-houston-dies.html" title="">Beverly Hilton hotel</a>, where the actress Halle Berry was spotted mingling and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, Ms. Harris’s running mate, was treated as a returning hero. </p><p>A number of attendees suggested that the issue of age would be moot in the next campaign anyway. They expected that a wide field of contenders from the next generation, most likely including several governors, would step forward.</p><p>Everyone who is even marginally discussed as a potential future presidential candidate, at least at this wildly early stage, is significantly younger than Mr. Biden.</p><p>“I’ve been the guy who was way too young. Now people are saying I’m too old,” said Mr. Newsom, one of several Democratic governors who could seek the presidency. Pressed further on whether he had really heard people saying that, he replied: “Well, no. The too-young part, for sure.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He and others alluded to the fact that Mr. Trump is just a few years younger than Mr. Biden, and that voters did not regard him as too old to be president again.</p><p>Of course, some of the governors who would be septuagenarians during the next presidential campaign — which a few of them privately harbor some interest in joining — have reason to brush aside concerns about old age.</p><p>“Obviously, the American people have just elected somebody who is pretty old,” said Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, who is himself 67 and is mentioned by some Democrats as a potential future contender.</p><p>There was, however, a contingent of attendees with a clear perspective about which generation should step up: their own.</p><p>Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, 52, who is running for governor, said bluntly that she did not believe Mr. Biden should have run for re-election, voicing a view quietly held by other Democratic officeholders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“With, you know, some of his, what appeared to be his health issues, he just wasn’t somebody that could forcefully carry the message that we needed in a tough election cycle,” Ms. Sherrill said. She did not have an age limit in her mind, she said, but for future presidential candidates, “I’m a little partial to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gen X</a>.”</p><p>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, 53, of Michigan, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/politics/2028-democrats-whitmer-shapiro-newsom.html" title="">seen by many in her party</a> as a possible future presidential candidate. In an interview, she said that she did not “know what comes next” in her career, but that she would “love to see someone from Gen X” take the lead.</p><p>“We’ve had a lot of leaders from the same generation for a long time,” she said. “There are going to be a lot of really dynamic, qualified people who will rise up over the next few years. And I think that’s exciting, and that makes me, you know, really proud to be one of the many leaders in this country that are in this generation and are fired up to to be leading in tough times.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

And how many male nominees have we had?” Mr. Newsom said. “Because you had 0 for 2, that, ‘Oh that’s not going to happen,’ is kind of ludicrous and laughable.”</p><p>In an interview at a rooftop restaurant, Ms. Lujan Grisham of New Mexico colorfully bashed prejudices based on age and sex.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I hope lots of women run in the next presidential election,” she said. “I’m going to take these boots and do some sexist kicking.”</p><p>Asked if she was considering a presidential bid, Ms. Lujan Grisham played out how critics might react before responding that she did not want to run.</p><p>Voters, she predicted, would say: “‘I can’t vote for her. She’s wearing a miniskirt, and she’s 111.’”</p><p>“My grandmother died in her 90s, and she had a pair of stilettos in her closet that she wore the day before,” Ms. Lujan Grisham said. “That’s how I’m going.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
