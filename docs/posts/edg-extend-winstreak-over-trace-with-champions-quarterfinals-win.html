			<p>Thumbnail guy with the correct prediction again</p>
<p>Honestly I was rooting for TE to win however it seems like they are not playing as a team against EDG as most of the time and are super inconsistent, like how there is little covering fire and util to help FengF entry, so he often dies without getting traded out.( Realise how this is oddly similar to Demon1 on NRG against EG)</p>
<p>However, they are mostly good at punishing mistakes on defender side, being able to hold their ground against a lot of aggression and also knowing when to peek / hold etc</p>
<p>If they can try to change up how they play their attack rounds, they can be an even stronger team than they are now</p>		</div></div>
