And NATO has made it clear that 2 percent must be “a floor not a ceiling,” and more must be spent.</p><p>The meeting comes the same day that Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/world/middleeast/rubio-saudi-arabia-gaza-ukraine.html" title="">arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia</a> for planned meetings with Russian officials to discuss the future of the Russia-Ukraine war. European leaders and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine have expressed surprise and frustration at being sidelined from the talks.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky was in the United Arab Emirates on Monday for a track of negotiations with Russia that is separate from the Trump administration’s effort, focusing on prisoner exchanges and returning Ukrainian children from Russia. He reiterated that Ukraine would accept no terms negotiated between Russia and the Trump administration without Ukrainian participation, and confirmed that Ukrainian representatives would not be at the talks in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Andrew E.
