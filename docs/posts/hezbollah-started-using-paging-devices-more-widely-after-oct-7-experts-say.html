Several independent experts said that it looked highly likely that Israel was behind the attack.</p><p>The wave of explosions left many people in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, in a state of confusion and shock. Witnesses reported smoke coming from people’s pockets, followed by small blasts that sounded like fireworks or gunshots. Amateur footage broadcast on Lebanese television showed chaotic scenes at hospitals, as wounded patients with mangled hands and mutilated faces sought treatment. Sirens blared throughout the city.</p><p>Lebanon’s prime minister, Najib Mikati, characterized the attack as “criminal Israeli aggression” and called it “a serious violation of Lebanese sovereignty.” Here is what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Thousands injured:</strong> The U.N.’s special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said the death toll had risen to nine people killed. Hezbollah told The New York Times that six of the nine people were Hezbollah fighters. Lebanon’s Ministry of Health said that a young girl was also among those killed and that more than 2,700 others were injured. Lebanon’s health minister, Dr. Firass Abiad, said many of the victims had injuries to their faces, particularly the eyes, as well as to their hands and stomachs. <a href="#irans-ambassador-to-lebanon-is-injured-in-the-apparent-attack-state-media-reports" title="">Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amini</a>, suffered injuries to his hand and face when a pager he was carrying exploded, according to Iranian state news media reports.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hezbollah’s pagers targeted</strong>: Three officials briefed on the attack said that the operation had <a href="#hezbollah-started-using-paging-devices-more-widely-after-oct-7-experts-say" title="">targeted hundreds of pagers belonging to Hezbollah operatives</a> who have used such devices for years to make it harder for their messages to be intercepted. The use of pagers had became even more widespread after the Oct. 7 attacks, when Hezbollah’s chief warned that Israeli intelligence had penetrated the cellphone network, security experts said. The devices were programmed to beep for several seconds before exploding, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Escalating conflict</strong>: The blasts appeared to be <a href="#israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-impact" title="">the latest salvo in an 11-month conflict between Israel and Hezbollah</a> that began last October, after Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militia, began firing into Israeli territory in solidarity with its ally, Hamas, which is also backed by Iran. The conflict has largely remained contained to exchanges of missiles and rockets, but for months, leaders on either side have warned that it could expand into a war involving ground forces.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assassination attempt</strong>: On Tuesday afternoon, before the pager explosions in Lebanon, <a href="#israel-gaza-netanyahu-gallant" title="">the Israeli military had accused Hezbollah of attempting to assassinate a retired senior member of the country’s security services</a> with an explosive device that could be remotely detonated from Lebanon. The same operatives were behind a similar attempted attack in Tel Aviv last year, the military said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Syrian attacks:</strong> In Syria, at least 14 people were injured by pager explosions in the apparently coordinated attack on Hezbollah, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pager danger: </strong>Lebanon’s health ministry has put all hospitals in Lebanon on “maximum alert,” and has requested citizens to discard their pagers.</p></li></ul><p>Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> and <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- -->

Cellphones can be used to locate the person carrying them.</p><p>But, he said, that became more urgent after Oct. 7, when some of the Hezbollah’s senior members were assassinated in airstrikes. In February, Hezbollah’s chief, Hassan Nasrallah, warned members during a speech that their phones were dangerous and could be spied on by Israeli forces, saying they should break or bury them.</p><p>Iran, whose government has for decades supplied Hezbollah with arms, technology and other forms of military aid, and would have been pivotal both to any decision to switch to the system and in the delivery of the technology, the experts said.</p><p>Experts said that they did not know the precise arrangement for the distribution of the paging devices to Hezbollah members, nor how they had been compromised, but a key element of the new paging system was that it did not use the technology that is the basis of most conventional cellphone networks, and therefore were harder to track electronically.</p><p>David Wood, a senior Lebanon analyst with the International Crisis Group think tank, described it as a “limited, closed network.”</p><p>He said that in the short term, Hezbollah would likely resort to other methods of communication, potentially one that avoided electronic means altogether.</p><p>“It will obviously make coordination more difficult and more risky and without a doubt this is a serious blow to Hezbollah’s operational capacity,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Sabaileh said the explosions would be a psychological blow for Hezbollah because it showed the capacity of Israel to strike not just fighters but anyone connected with the group as they went about their daily business.</p><p>“It’s like doing an operation in every part of Hezbollah’s territory,” Mr. Sabaileh said, adding that the group would likely see it as a prelude to an Israeli escalation of the conflict, potentially on the ground. “The way they are targeted and the timing looks like a movie — making devices explode all at the same time everywhere is shocking.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="23" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off"

The hostilities have also forced more than 150,000 people on both sides of the border to leave their homes for temporary shelters. That has put pressure on the Israeli government to make the north of the country safe for residents again by pushing Hezbollah back from the border region.</p><div><p>The pagers that exploded across Lebanon on Tuesday came a day after Israeli leaders warned that they were considering stepping up their military campaign against Hezbollah. Israel hasn’t commented on whether it was behind the attacks, but tensions between the two countries were already rising.</p><p>Here’s a look at Hezbollah and what a wider war would mean for Lebanon.</p><h2 id="link-7810ae94">What is Hezbollah?</h2><p>Hezbollah has opposed Israel since the group’s very beginnings. It was founded in the 1980s, after Israel, responding to attacks, invaded and occupied southern Lebanon, intending to root out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was then based in the country.</p><p>But Israel soon ran into a new enemy, one whose guerrilla fighters quickly grew effective at bedeviling the far-better-equipped Israeli forces: Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim popular movement that made driving Israel out of Lebanon a major goal.</p><p>By 2000, Israel had withdrawn from Lebanon, making Hezbollah a hero to many Lebanese. It fought Israel again in 2006, launching a military operation into its southern neighbor that led to a fierce counterattack. In that war, Israel rained bombs on southern Lebanon and Beirut, the capital; the fighting killed more than 1,000 Lebanese.</p><p>Yet, the Israeli military never managed to overwhelm Hezbollah in 34 days of war, allowing the group and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, to emerge as stars in an Arab world wearily accustomed to being defeated by Israel.</p><p>Hezbollah soon allied with Iran, and they became close partners.</p><p>Though the group retains a large and loyal following among Shiite Muslims because of the social services and political power it offers them — as well as the authoritarian tactics it uses to quell any dissent — many Lebanese see the group as an obstacle to progress that keeps threatening to drag the country into an unwanted war.</p><p>Hezbollah, considered a terrorist group by the United States and other countries, has evolved from a fighting force into a dominant political one, accruing significant influence in Lebanon’s government.</p><h2 id="link-51d24701">What would a wider war mean for Lebanon?</h2><p>Lebanon can hardly afford a new conflict with Israel.</p><p>The country is reeling from years of an economic crisis that has left countless Lebanese in poverty and a political one that has stripped citizens of many basic services. The strikes at the border have displaced about 100,000 Lebanese civilians, depriving many of their income and their homes, and have cost the country billions of dollars in lost tourism and agricultural revenue, Lebanese officials say.</p><p>Even some of Hezbollah’s traditionally loyal Shiite Muslim constituents in southern Lebanon are questioning the price of the current fighting. As a result, analysts say, Mr. Nasrallah knows he has to step carefully. He has said that Hezbollah does not want a broader conflict, while warning that his fighters are prepared for one — and that Israel will face serious consequences if it comes.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A fresh market in Beirut last year.

Such a conflict could draw in Iran, as well as the United States, which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/us/politics/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-iran.html" title="">working to avert</a> further escalation.</p><p>Though jitters have grown with the frequency and deadliness of each side’s strikes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/world/middleeast/lebanon-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">Israel, Hezbollah and Iran do not want a full-fledged war</a>, analysts and U.S. officials say. Yet, the only near-certain way to avoid one, they say, is to end the fighting in Gaza with a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas, whose Oct. 7 attack led to the war in the enclave.</p><h2 id="link-706ed708">How strong is Hezbollah?</h2><p>Through propaganda videos and calibrated strikes, Hezbollah has repeatedly displayed signs of a <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bulked-up arsenal</a> that analysts say is capable of inflicting heavy damage on Israeli cities. Its forces are also battle-tested after years of fighting against rebels in Syria, where Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters during that country’s civil war to help prop up the government of President Bashar al-Assad, a close ally of Iran and Hezbollah.</p><p>Estimates vary about just how many missiles Hezbollah has and just how sophisticated its systems are. The Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook says the group may have more than 150,000 missiles and rockets of various types and ranges.

Previously, Beirut had been far from the cross-border violence between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia that, like Hamas, is aligned with Iran. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-leader-war.html" title="">Mr. al-Arouri</a> was the first high-level Hamas official to be killed outside the West Bank and Gaza in recent years. Israeli officials declined to comment, but Lebanese and U.S. officials attributed the attack to Israel.</p><h3 id="link-57f5e54c"><span><strong>Jan. 6: Hezbollah’s retaliation against Israel</strong></span></h3><p>In response to Mr. al-Arouri’s assassination, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/06/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-lebanon-gaza-war.html?searchResultPosition=9" title="">Hezbollah fired a volley of rockets</a> at a small military base in northern Israel. Though Hezbollah said it caused casualties, the Israeli military reported no injuries and responded with its own strikes in Lebanon. Analysts viewed Hezbollah’s response as a symbolic act rather than a significant escalation, with the group firing about 40 rockets toward Mount Meron, an area housing a military radar station.</p><h3 id="link-4af87147"><span><strong>April 1:</strong> Airstrikes in Damascus</span></h3><p>Israel carried out airstrikes that hit part of the Iranian Embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/01/world/middleeast/iran-commanders-killed-syria-israel.html" title="">killing three senior Iranian commanders and four officers</a> involved in Iran’s covert operations. The attack, one of the deadliest in the yearslong shadow war between Israel and Iran, increased regional tensions, which were already strained over the war in Gaza and hostilities involving Iran-backed groups. Israeli officials, speaking anonymously, confirmed the strike but denied that the targeted building had diplomatic status.</p><h3 id="link-44ddf1a6"><span><strong>April 14:</strong> A barrage of missiles and drones against Israel</span></h3><p>Iran retaliated for the Damascus strikes by launching more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/14/world/iran-israel-gaza-war-news" title="">300 drones and missiles against Israel</a>, its first open attack on Israel from Iranian soil. The strikes, aimed at military targets, caused minor damage and injured a young girl. Israel intercepted most of the projectiles and others were shot down by U.S. and Jordanian defenses. The calibrated attack, telegraphed well in advance, demonstrated Iran’s effort to avoid mass casualties or direct war, analysts said.</p><h3 id="link-7d95f58e"><span><strong>July 13:</strong> An airstrike in a designated humanitarian zone of Gaza</span></h3><p>Israel tried to kill Muhammad Deif, a top Hamas military commander in Gaza, in an airstrike that the territory’s health ministry said killed 90 people and injured 300 others. The strike hit a strip of coastal land known as Mawasi, which Israel had designated as a humanitarian zone, and where thousands of displaced Palestinians were living. Mr. Deif, believed to be a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/13/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas" title="">mastermind behind the Oct. 7 attack on Israel,</a> had long been a high-priority target, and after weeks of uncertainty about his condition, Israeli <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/muhammad-deif-hamas-death.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">authorities said in August that he had been killed</a>. Hamas has not explicitly confirmed or denied Israel’s claim.</p><h3 id="link-34c08e54"><span><strong>July 27:</strong> Rocket strikes in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights</span></h3><p>A rocket from Lebanon struck a soccer field in the Druse town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/world/middleeast/israel-golan-heights-lebanon-rocket.html" title="">killing 12</a> teenagers and children, according to the Israeli military. It was the deadliest single attack from across Israel’s northern border in months of hostilities. Israel accused Hezbollah, but the group denied responsibility.</p><h3 id="link-5c9a0978"><span><strong>July 30:</strong> A second strike in Beirut</span></h3><p>Israel targeted Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah leader and close adviser to the organization’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">deadly strike in Beirut</a>. Israeli officials described the attack as a response to the Golan Heights rocket strike, but the assault quickly raised concerns in the region about Israel’s willingness to strike deep within Lebanese territory.</p><h3 id="link-2e2f598f"><span><strong>July 31:</strong> A top Hamas official is killed in Tehran</span></h3><p>Hours after the strike in Beirut, Ismail Haniyeh, one of the most senior Hamas leaders and a key figure in the stalled cease-fire talks, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/30/world/israel-gaza-war-lebanon-hezbollah" title="">assassinated in Iran</a>, where he had gone for the inauguration of that country’s new president. Iran and Hamas said Israel had carried out the killing, and they vowed to retaliate. Mr. Haniyeh, who had led Hamas’s political office and helped manage negotiations for a cease-fire, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html" title="">killed</a> by an explosive device covertly smuggled into the guesthouse in Tehran where he was staying, according to seven Middle Eastern officials, including two Iranians, as well as an American official.</p><h3 id="link-6ed08f79"><span>Aug. 25: Israel says it thwarted a major attack</span></h3><p>The Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/24/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war" title="">said</a> it had launched airstrikes against Hezbollah forces that had been preparing an “extensive” attack against Israel, destroying what it said were thousands of rocket launch barrels. Hezbollah later said it had retaliated for Mr. Shukr’s killing by launching hundreds of rockets at Israeli military positions — believed to be one of its largest barrages in months — though Israel said there had been “very little damage.”</p><p>The strikes came after cross-border strikes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-strikes.html" title="">escalated</a> sharply. A week earlier, an Israeli airstrike hit a factory in a small town in southern Lebanon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/world/middleeast/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-strike-cease-fire.html" title="">killing at least 10 civilians</a>, according to Lebanese officials. It was one of the largest death tolls in a single strike in Lebanon since the war in Gaza began.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
