She said the government looked forward to being “fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia’s compliance with accreditation standards, including compliance with federal civil rights laws.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>President Trump has described the accreditation process as his “secret weapon” to force ideological changes at universities. But the Trump administration does not have direct control over which universities are accredited. Instead, those decisions are made by nongovernmental organizations certified by the government, in a complex process meant to insulate universities from political interference.</p><p>Experts on the process said that despite the letter, Columbia faced no immediate threat that its accreditation would be revoked, a process that typically takes years.</p><p>“This is another semi-random attack against a celebrity institution,” said Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, an association that includes many colleges and universities in its membership. “They are trying once again to skirt due process in order to score political points.”</p><p>Antoinette Flores, the director of higher education accountability and quality at New America, a Washington think tank, said she thought the letter was both a threat to Middle States, and to Columbia, about federal aid.</p><p>But she said that the Department of Education does not have the authority to determine what violates the accreditation group’s standards. Only the accrediting body can do that, which would require its own review of what is alleged.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Still, Ms. Flores said, the letter “is definitely an escalation. It is trying to weaponize the accreditor to get the institution to bend to its will.”</p><p>Middle States confirmed that it had received a letter on Wednesday but did not comment further.</p><p>Columbia said in a statement that it was “aware of the concerns raised” and said it had “addressed those concerns directly with Middle States.”</p><p>“Columbia is deeply committed to combating antisemitism on our campus,” the statement added. “We take this issue seriously and are continuing to work with the federal government to address it.”</p><p>Claire McCann, an expert on accreditation at the Postsecondary Education &amp; Economics Research Center at American University, said that she would expect Middle States to examine the government’s findings that Columbia had violated civil rights law and make its own determination about next steps.</p><p>Part of that would involve considering whether Columbia was taking actions to remedy any violations of the law, which Columbia has said it is doing by tightening disciplinary procedures and rules on protests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Middle States could come under pressure because it needs to be approved by the government to act as an accrediting body.</p><p>“They could send a warning letter to Columbia, or they could decide they don’t need to,” Ms. McCann said of what Middle States might do in the short-term. “It’s hard to say what the reaction might be.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon Otterman is a Times reporter covering higher education, public health and other issues facing New York City.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
