</span>. T1 on the other hand were playing in their first-ever grand final and also searching for their first VCT trophy of any kind.</p>

<p>With the double map ban online, DRX banned Pearl and Haven. The maps selected were DRX&#39;s Abyss, T1&#39;s Lotus, DRX&#39;s Fracture, T1&#39;s Bind, and the decider map Split.</p>

<p>Abyss, which DRX has yet to lose in VCT play since its arrival, was a dominant one for DRX. T1 looked to mitigate a quick 4-0 DRX start with a timeout, but the most they could manage was one round before DRX won the next six. A halftime lead of 10-2 was easily converted into 13-3 after pistol and anti-eco rounds were clinched by DRX.</p>


<p><em>DRX makes it look oh-so easy to finish Abyss.</em></p>

<p>Abyss was yet another great map for <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/1916/free1ng">
		free1ng	</a>
</span>, who has exclusively played Tejo throughout Kickoff and has quickly gained respect as one of the world&#39;s best on the agent. He finished the map with the most kills, ending with a 21-5 scoreline. </p>

<p>Lotus was the map that T1 had defeated DRX on in their upper final meeting. In the early moments, T1 appeared to be shutting down DRX as DRX had done to them on Abyss. Holding a 7-1 lead on defense, T1 played sharply, but four straight DRX rounds made for a more even 7-5 halftime scoreline.</p>

<p><em>Meteor and stax work together with a deadly combo.</em></p>

<p>The combination between <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span>&#39;s Iso Undercut and <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/485/stax">
		stax	</a>
</span>&#39;s Sova Shock Darts saw the pair link up on a number of occasions. Meanwhile, <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span> had a strong map after struggling in the series against Gen.G, picking up a map-high 20 kills en route to a 13-6 win.</p>

<p>Fracture, a map well-suited to Tejo, saw both teams field the agent for the first time in the series, with T1 flex player <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/29833/izu">
		iZu	</a>
</span> looking to take on free1ng. Though typically attacker-favored, Fracture was more defense-sided on this day.</p>

<p>DRX&#39;s defense saw them enter halftime on Fracture with an 8-4 lead, but that lead whittled down as the teams switched sides. T1 seized the momentum, working to cut the DRX lead down to 11-9, but a miraculous DRX thrifty saw them reach match point and eventually push T1 aside.</p>


<p><em>A momentum-seizing thrifty for DRX.</em></p>

<p>The round was made possible thanks to a <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxRZecb1Ybouet2JrDzRCAqqhRxAFpK5y4?si=p-YZqduQ-XzMpUCW" target="_blank">crafty utility combo</a> from free1ng&#39;s Tejo and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4678/beyn">
		BeYN	</a>
</span>&#39;s Breach, which picked off T1 in-game leader stax for the opening kill of the round. DRX went on to convert the next round to clinch the map 13-9.</p>

<p>Bind, the fourth map, is one that both teams had recent success on. DRX defeated Gen.G in the upper semifinal in 15-13 overtime, while T1&#39;s five-map lower final bout with Gen.G ended on Bind, fueled by a 9-0 start.</p>

<p>The map started out rocky for both teams. T1 won the opening pistol, but gave up an eco. To open the second half, DRX&#39;s pistol was countered with a T1 eco. The back and forth between the rounds rendered DRX&#39;s 7-5 halftime lead nearly pointless, as the two teams were separated by no less than two rounds for the entirety of the second half.</p>

<p>That was until a near-perfect read from DRX seemed to get ahead on T1&#39;s attack. A string of three straight rounds saw them reach match point with a 12-8 advantage, but like in their match against Gen.G, DRX slipped. Moments of heroics from the likes of Meteor and <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/31207/carpe">
		carpe	</a>
</span> saw T1 force overtime, which they dominantly converted.</p>


<p><em>No ace needed. T1 forces map five thanks to a 4K from BuZz.</em></p>

<p>After winning six straight rounds through the end of regulation and overtime, T1 forced the series to Split, the decider map. T1 changed their team comp on the map, moving away from the double Duelist, no Sentinel comp, and putting Meteor on Chamber.</p>

<p>It was DRX&#39;s first time playing Split this season, and they made quite the debut. After dropping the first pistol round on attack, MaKo&#39;s hero buy of a Guardian helped fuel an anti-eco for his team. That momentum continued, as DRX won the next five rounds to claim a 6-1 lead.</p>

<p>T1 did manage to claw their way back, holding DRX to just a 7-5 lead at halftime. Still, the attack was their weaker side from the match played against Gen.G the day before. Both teams again seemed destined for a close finish. Before the match was tied at 11, DRX strayed ahead by fine margins, but the deficit was never greater than two in the second half. </p>

<p>In the end, a few moments of individual brilliance and more moments of magic from free1ng&#39;s Tejo saw DRX close the book on T1, lifting their <strong>first-ever</strong> VCT trophy.</p>


<p><em>A moment in DRX history.</em></p>

<p>DRX&#39;s rookie Duelist <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/28400/hyunmin">
		HYUNMIN	</a>
</span> came alive on Split. While having his fair share of struggles on the four maps before, his map-leading 29 kills paved the way for DRX to edge out their opponents to the 13-11 victory.</p>

<p>HYUNMIN ended the series with a team-high 92 kills for DRX, while BuZz&#39;s 101 kills against his former team were not enough in the losing effort.</p>

<p>Both teams already had their tickets to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> punched, but the result gives DRX the Pacific region&#39;s first seed, matching them up with a second seed from another region. DRX also claims three championship points, which may play a crucial role in qualification for Champions Paris. T1 leaves the event with two points and will be the second seed at Masters, while Gen.G claims one championship point.</p>
