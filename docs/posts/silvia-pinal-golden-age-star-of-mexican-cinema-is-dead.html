The next year, she teamed with Mr. Infante again in the comedy “El Inocente” (“The Innocent”), in which she played a moneyed and capricious woman who takes up with an auto mechanic.</p><p>More awards soon followed. She took home the Ariel as best actress in 1956 for “Locura Pasional” (“Passionate Madness”), in which she played a theater star who lands in the cross hairs of her jealous and murderous husband, and a year later for “La Dulce Enemiga” (“The Sweet Enemy”), in which she played a femme fatale whose story is told in flashbacks by the ghosts of erstwhile lovers.</p><p>For all her outsize success in her native land, it was her work with Mr. Buñuel that made her a familiar name to cineastes around the world.</p><p>Their partnership started with pluck. Ms. Pinal earned her role in the twisted period drama <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055601/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_2_cdt_t_13" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Viridiana”</a> (1961) only after her second of four husbands, the director and producer <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055601/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_2_cdt_t_13" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gustavo Alatriste,</a> who produced the film, journeyed to Mr. Buñuel’s home to lobby for her to get the part.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I chose Buñuel, not he me,” Ms. Pinal later said.</p><p>In a 1996 interview with the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, she recalled that “the environment that surrounded him was very intellectual.” It was, she added, “a very closed world, where he was the king and was respected as such.”</p><p>The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther, who described “Viridiana” as a “grim and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1962/03/20/archives/screen-viridiana-here-from-spainluis-bunuel-film-is-at-paris.html" title="">tumorous tale</a> of a beautiful young religious novice who gets into an unholy mess when she gives up her holy calling to try to atone for a wrong she has done,” praised Ms. Pinal’s work. He wrote that she was “lovely and precisely as stiff and forbidding as she should be as the misguided novice.”</p><p>Even though the movie was banned in Spain under the military dictatorship of Generalissimo Francisco Franco and denounced by the official Vatican newspaper, “Viridiana” shared the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Pinal, wearing a shawl, in a scene from Mr. Buñuel’s “The Exterminating Angel” (1962).

Ms. Pinal played Leticia, known as the Valkyrie, who eventually helps the surviving guests escape.</p><p>While “The Exterminating Angel” was eventually anointed a classic — it <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/film/909bd4b2-afe0-5a1c-a403-438fe2092eb2/viridiana" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tied for 52nd</a> in the 2022 Sight and Sound directors’ poll of the greatest films of all time — it baffled many viewers. It also baffled Ms. Pinal. “To this day,” she said in a 2006 interview when the Criterion Collection released it on DVD, “I don’t know what that film is about.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>According to many reports, Ms. Pinal was born on Sept. 12, 1931, in Guaymas, a port city in the state of Sonora. She was the product of a romance between her 15-year-old mother, María Luisa Hidalgo Aguilar, who worked in a restaurant, and the orchestra director Moisés Pasquel, who was already married at the time. She later adopted the surname of her stepfather, Luis G. Pinal, a journalist and politician.</p><p>By her early teens she was studying acting, with her sights set on becoming a movie star, despite Mr. Pinal’s protestations that she pursue a more stable career. Her dreams began to take shape after she married the Cuban-born actor and director Rafael Banquells and honed her skills in theater. She made her move to the big screen in a series of films in 1949, including “La Mujer Que Yo Perdí” (“The Woman I Lost”), which starred Mr. Infante.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Pinal made a foray of sorts into Hollywood with the 1969 action movie “Shark,” a joint Mexican-American production starring Burt Reynolds.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Excelsior</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Pinal also made films in Europe, including the 1959 Italian comedy “Uomini e Nobiluomini” <strong><em>(</em></strong>“Men and Noblemen”), starring the celebrated actor and director Vittorio De Sica and Elke Sommer. She made a foray of sorts into Hollywood with the 1969 English-language action movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxCLGF8uL1I" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Shark,”</a> a joint Mexican-American production starring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/obituaries/burt-reynolds-dead.html" title="">Burt Reynolds</a> and directed by Samuel Fuller.</p><p>She also worked extensively in Mexican television, and in 1985 she began producing and hosting <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222600/?ref_=nm_flmg_knf_t_4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real”</a> (“Woman, Real Life Cases”), an anthology series presenting dramas based on true stories about women facing domestic abuse and other crises. It ran until 2007.</p><p>Ms. Pinal’s survivors include her daughters, Sylvia Pasquel, an actress, and Alejandra Guzmán, a Mexican singing star and entrepreneur; her son, Luis Enrique Guzmán; four granddaughters; and two great-granddaughters. Another daughter, Viridiana, also an actress, died at 19 in a car accident. All four of her marriages, including to the rock singer Enrique Guzmán and the politician Tulio Hernández Gómez, ended in divorce.</p><p>In a Criterion Collection interview for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vYI4TPiAok" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Simon of the Desert”</a> (1965), another film she made with Mr. Buñuel, Ms. Pinal expressed gratitude for having the opportunity to work with a master of the absurd. “Working with Buñuel,” she said, “was the most important part of my career. It accorded me a place in film archives around the world, and in the history of world cinema.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
