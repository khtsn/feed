The photo of the shirtless man was created for the 2015 edition of the “Hunks and Hounds” annual calendar.</p><p>“Now that we have your attention,” the text read, “a critical special election is happening TOMORROW!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the election, Wisconsin voters approved an amendment to the state’s constitution to strengthen a current law <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/wisconsin-voters-approve-amendment-requiring-photo-id-to-vote.html" title="">requiring photo identification</a> at the polls — a measure that Look Ahead America supported — while electing a liberal candidate to a pivotal seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</p><p>Matt Braynard, the executive director of <a href="https://lookaheadamerica.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Look Ahead America</a>, said in an email that the organization had “conducted studies that have proven that using eye-catching images not typically associated with politics increase voter awareness of elections and voter participation.”</p><p>He added that the organization would not know the effectiveness of its unconventional text-message campaign for several weeks but that it was looking forward to reporting those numbers.</p><p>Look Ahead America, which was founded in 2017, identifies itself as nonpartisan but has engaged mostly on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/23/us/jan-6-attendees.html" title="">conservative issues</a>, such as holding rallies for people involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The group describes its mission as supporting and amplifying the voices of “rural and blue-collar patriotic Americans who are disaffected and disenfranchised from the nation’s corridors of power.”</p><p>Mr. Braynard, who created the group, is a former member of President Trump’s campaign team.</p><p>When selecting images to accompany the texts, Look Ahead America went with the photo of the shirtless man, which had been taken by the photographer Mike Ruiz for a calendar series that raises funds for Louie’s Legacy Animal Rescue, and the photo of Ms. Ratajkowski, which was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7pLB8KPFO-/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted to Instagram</a> by Inamorata, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/books/emily-ratajkowski-my-body.html" title="">apparel company</a> she founded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Ratajkowski, who declined to comment, was a peculiar choice considering her support of Mr. Sanders and other left-leaning causes.</p><p>Mr. Ruiz was not happy about the group’s choice to use his work.</p><p>“I am disgusted that they used a beautiful philanthropic project to save animals in dire need, a project which means so much to me, to spread their propaganda,” he said in an email. “You can quote me.”</p><p>Mr. Braynard defended his organization’s decision to use the photos without seeking permission of the subjects or the original photographers.</p><p>“All of these images were originally shared publicly on social media,” Mr. Braynard said, “and our nonprofit using them to encourage voter turnout constitutes ‘fair use.’ We are not a partisan organization so we aren’t concerned with partisan beliefs of the subjects, we just wanted eye-catching photos.”</p><p>Tuesday’s election in Wisconsin was notable for, among other reasons, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-crawford-schimel.html" title="">the involvement of Elon Musk</a>, the businessman-turned-policy-aide to Mr. Trump, who spent $25 million in support of Judge Brad Schimel, the conservative candidate in the race for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Judge Schimel lost to his liberal opponent, Judge Susan Crawford.</p><p>Though Look Ahead America did not explicitly endorse Judge Schimel in its text message to potential voters this week, it <a href="https://lookaheadamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/LAA_WI_SC_Graphic.jpg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">linked to a chart</a> of the two candidates that purported to detail some of the crucial differences between them on issues like immigration, gender identity and “late-term abortion.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Ratajkowski did not publicly comment on the election results, but she had previously made her feelings on Mr. Musk’s political ambitions known.</p><p>On the day before the 2024 general election, the social media account Pop Base reported on X that the rapper Azealia Banks had decided to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris because Mr. Musk “belongs nowhere near American politics.”</p><p>Ms. Ratajkowski <a href="https://x.com/emrata/status/1853548043519340805" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">replied to the post</a>, saying, “finally an endorsement i can get behind.”</p><p>Benjamin Hoffman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Scott Cacciola writes features and profiles of people in the worlds of sports and entertainment for the Styles section of The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/scott-cacciola">More about Scott Cacciola</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Inside Elite Law Firms:</strong> Paul Weiss and Skadden reached deals with President Trump to scuttle executive orders that could have crippled their businesses.
