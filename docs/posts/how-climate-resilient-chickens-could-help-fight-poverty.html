For years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/africa/africa-usaid-funds.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">sub-Saharan Africa</a> was a primary recipient of U.S. aid. Last year, the region received $12.7 billion. Billions more were spent on other worldwide programs related to health and climate resilience that also largely benefited Africa.</p><p>Britain, too, is cutting back on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyrkkv4gd7o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">foreign assistance</a> to finance increases in its military spending.</p><p>Dual-purpose breeds started spreading to Africa in the mid-2010s. There were <a href="https://noiler.net/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Noilers</a> in Nigeria, <a href="https://interchick.co.tz/tanbro/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tanbros</a> in Tanzania, <a href="https://www.kenchic.com/kenbro/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kenbros</a> in Kenya. The World Poultry Foundation began helping to <a href="https://worldpoultryfoundation.org/initiative/apmi-african-poultry-multiplication-initiative/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">distribute these breeds</a> in 2016.</p><p>Hybrid teamed up once before with another nonprofit organization that donated chickens to farmers. But when the funding ended, so did the project, said Simon Wilde, Hybrid’s managing director. “Anybody can come in and throw money at it,” he explained. You’ve got to teach farmers, he said — do this, not that, and this is how you make money.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dorcas Shonga, a farmer, tending to her poultry.

Similar business models supporting dual-purpose chickens can be found throughout the continent.</p><p>“There’s no doubt in my mind that this is an absolutely transformative program for these rural sectors,” Mr. Ennis said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-21"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/00Biz-Zambia-Chickens-17-gbmk/00Biz-Zambia-Chickens-17-gbmk-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/00Biz-Zambia-Chickens-17-gbmk/00Biz-Zambia-Chickens-17-gbmk-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/03/22/136341_1_22visualUploader-46368_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Dual-purpose chickens are bred to both lay eggs and plump up to be eaten.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Photographs and Video by Brian Otieno</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The foundation is looking to expand to other continents. Eighty percent of the people living in rural areas across the globe raise chickens in the backyard; a majority of them are women.</p><p>If you are accustomed to buying your chicken plucked and plastic-wrapped, the idea of a dual-purpose chicken may be confusing. In the world of commercial poultry, chickens are essentially grouped into one of two categories: layers and broilers. Chickens that either reliably produce an egg every day or quickly plump up to be eaten.</p><p>A chicken that can be used to both lay eggs and<em> </em>be eaten can be something of a wonder. Especially when that same bird consumes less water and supplements its diet by foraging for termites and grasshoppers.</p><p>Still, getting subsistence farmers to take a risk and invest their meager savings in a new breed and develop a new market takes outreach, training and marketing services.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Hybrid learned the hard way. Before its partnership with the foundation, it tried to market a dual-purpose bird that was different from the Zambro. That breed had brown feathers, which made it look just like a local village chicken that no longer produced eggs. Buyers were confused.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Hybrid Poultry store offering vaccines, medicine and feeders for chickens in Lusaka.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elisha Zakoka and Eletina Mwanza, field representatives for Hybrid Poultry Farm, weighing a chicken. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sepo Nasilele, a 19-year-old chicken farmer who lives in Zambia’s Eastern Province.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The failure underscored the need for field representatives to work closely with the brooders, who raise the chicks for the first four weeks, as well as the small-scale producers, who buy the month-old birds and then sell the chickens, their eggs or both.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Elisha Zakoka, a field rep in the Rufunsa district, visits each client once a week and calls twice a week to check in. If there are problems, he comes more often.</p><p>“He started mentoring me,” said Phidelis Kayaya, a brooder who started raising Zambros last year. Mr. Zakoka taught him, for example, how to vaccinate the chicks. He explained why feeders should be placed atop bricks, so the chickens don’t have to bend their necks to eat, which impairs chewing and digestion.</p><p>Mr. Kayaya previously raised broilers. “They eat too much, and they are prone to diseases,” he said, explaining why he switched. The Zambros’ need for less water also makes a difference. Every day, Mr. Kayaya must walk a third of a mile to a hand pump, fill a large metal drum and then roll it home so his family can have water.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Hybrid shop in Petauke that sells day-old chicks.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An agent carrying a box of day-old chicks.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-35"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A box of day-old chicks.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mr. Kayaya had recently bought 1,000 Zambro chicks and started selling door to door. With a motorized three-wheeled vehicle, he could offer free delivery — a big selling point in a large rural area where paved roads are an anomaly and cars are scarce.</p><p>At the four-week mark, though, he was able to sell only 700 of the flock. So he waited a few more weeks for the remaining ones to grow fat enough to sell as broilers. Meanwhile, with the eggs, Mr. Kayaya said, his family has been eating better.</p><p>Mr. Zakoka, the field rep, noted that the chickens were underweight. Mr. Kayaya nodded. He said he had cut their daily feed because he couldn’t afford more. Last year’s drought wiped out crops and pushed most farmers in the region to the brink. A national <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/business/african-debt-crisis.html?searchResultPosition=53" title="">debt crisis</a> added strain.
