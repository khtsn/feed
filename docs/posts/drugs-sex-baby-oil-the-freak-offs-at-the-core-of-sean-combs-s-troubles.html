Another man watches and sometimes captures the events on video. These sexual marathons, complete with a cleanup staff, sometimes went on for days.</p><p>To the people involved, they were known as “freak-offs.”</p><p>The 14-page federal criminal indictment of Sean Combs, the music mogul known as Diddy and Puff Daddy, accuses him of participating in many crimes including arson, bribery, kidnapping and obstruction of justice. But the heart of the government’s case is the premise that the criminal “enterprise” he ran as an alleged racketeer was responsible for coordinating these “freak-offs,” and then covering up any damage to hotel rooms, or people, when they were over.</p><p>In the government’s portrayal, they were horror shows — “elaborate and produced sex performances,” according to the indictment — that involved copious drug use and coerced sex, leaving participants so exhausted and drained that they were given fluids intravenously to recover. Then, the government said, Mr. Combs weaponized the videos he had shot to keep any participants from complaining.</p><p>“Freak-off activity is the core of this case, and freak-offs are inherently dangerous,” Emily A. Johnson, one of the prosecutors, said at a hearing last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The government’s depiction closely mirrors allegations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-rape-lawsuit.html" title="">made by the singer Cassie in a bombshell civil suit</a> she filed last fall against Mr. Combs, her former boyfriend. The indictment attaches no name to its account of the freak-offs, instead referring only anonymously to a “Victim-1.”</p><p>Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, said in her lawsuit that Mr. Combs directed frequent “freak-offs” at high-end hotels around the country, directing her at the events to pour “excessive” amounts of oil on herself and telling her where to touch the prostitutes while he filmed and masturbated.</p><p>“He treated the forced encounter as a personal art project, adjusting the candles he used for lighting to frame the videos he took,” the lawsuit said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The prosecutor’s case very much tracks the allegations raised in Casandra Ventura’s suit again Mr. Combs, in which she accused him of abusing her during what he called “freak offs.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alberto E.

These trysts, they argued, may shock some people, but they did not involve sexual assault and did not involve “force, fraud or coercion,” as the main federal sex trafficking statute requires.</p><p>“Does everybody have experience with being intimate this way? No,” Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, said at a court hearing on Tuesday. “Is it sex trafficking? No, not if everybody wants to be there.”</p><p>Mr. Agnifilo said, in fact, that he had interviewed six of the men the government describes as sex workers. They told him, he said, that they did not view any of the events as coercive or themselves as prostitutes, only escorts compensated for their time.</p><p>“Did anything ever, ever seem remotely non-consensual?” Mr. Agnifilo said he asked them. “Was anybody too drunk? Was anybody too high? Did anyone express any hesitation? Was there the slightest inkling that possibly, possibly the woman wasn’t consenting?”</p><p>Mr. Agnifilo said their answers had been: “No. No. No. No.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A lawyer for Mr. Combs, Marc Agnifilo, has argued that the sexual encounters the government has depicted as criminal were all consensual.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The government, in contending that Mr. Combs ran a criminal racketeering enterprise, has sought to emphasize that the freak-offs were events coordinated by a team of enablers who worked for him. Prosecutors underscored that witnesses saw violence “during and in connection with” freak-offs, which the defense has denied.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>None are named or charged in the indictment, but they are characterized as a team that was deployed to find the prostitutes and the hotel rooms, deliver supplies and then fix any damage to the rooms after sessions. “These occasions included instances in which a victim was required to remain in hiding — sometimes for several days at a time — to recover from injuries Combs inflicted,” the indictment said.</p><p>Citing the racketeering law long used against mobsters and drug kingpins, prosecutors have argued that Mr. Combs used the underlings to carry out his commands, expected “absolute loyalty” and ruled with threats of violence.</p><p>“Combs did not do this all on his own,” Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a news conference last week. “He used his business and employees of that business and other close associates to get his way. Those individuals allegedly included high-ranking supervisors in the business, personal assistants, security staff and household staff.”</p><p>Asked why those people had not been charged, Mr. Williams described the investigation as ongoing.</p><p>Anthony Capozzolo, a former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, said it was possible that some of Mr. Combs’s staff were not named as defendants because they were already cooperating witnesses, or that the government hoped they would be convinced by the indictment to join others in testifying against their boss.</p><p>“It will be interesting to see if any people, now that this has started, come in to plead guilty,” Mr. Capozzolo said.</p><p>In several months, a jury sitting in Manhattan will have to decide which of these competing views of the hotel room sessions is more credible. Until then Mr. Combs likely will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/arts/music/sean-combs-jail-brooklyn-mdc.html" title="">housed at a federal jail in Brooklyn</a> because he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-bail-appeal.html" title="">has been denied bail</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Johnson has expressed confidence in the case prosecutors are bringing, relating in court last week that the government has a “massive amount” of evidence, including many witnesses, photos, videos and text messages.</p><p>Perhaps most compelling is a video that was discussed during a bail hearing last week in which Mr. Combs is seen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-assault-video.html" title="">brutally assaulting Ms. Ventura</a> at an InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016. Presented as evidence that force, fraud or coercion were rampant in Mr. Combs’s orchestrated sexual encounters, the surveillance video shows him striking her, hurling a vase at her and dragging her through a hallway by her sweatshirt.</p><p>Ms. Johnson described the video in court as one that depicts Ms. Ventura attempting to leave the site of a freak-off. She said there was evidence that at least one prostitute was inside the hotel room during the assault.</p><p>“It’s a bad video for Mr. Combs,” Mr. Agnifilo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s75LAia5RA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acknowledged on CNN</a> last week.</p><p>But Mr. Combs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/19/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-assault-video-response.html" title="">who apologized in May</a> after the footage leaked, calling his behavior inexcusable, has provided a different version of the encounter to his lawyers. They say the video is not evidence of their client using violence to control participants in a sex act. Rather, they argue, the altercation was prompted by Ms. Ventura finding proof on Mr. Combs’s phone that he had “more than one girlfriend.” Mr. Agnifilo said that Mr. Combs had been sleeping when Ms. Ventura hit him in the head with his phone and left the hotel room with all of his clothes. (The surveillance footage shows Mr. Combs assaulting Ms. Ventura while wearing a towel.)</p><p>Prosecutors dispute that the argument was just about getting clothes back. If it had been, they say, Mr. Combs could have just retrieved the clothes without dragging her back to the hotel room.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The government has also asserted Mr. Combs and his employees sought to cover up evidence of the attack on Ms. Ventura. Ms. Johnson said Mr. Combs tried to get a hotel security officer to stay quiet by offering him a “handful of cash,” and that three days after the assault, “the surveillance video disappeared.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One of the sexual encounters took place at the InterContinental Century City hotel in Los Angeles.

In a court hearing, they offered snippets of further evidence of women accusing Mr. Combs of using video footage from freak-offs to blackmail them. One said: “He just threatened me about my sex tapes that he has of me on two phones. He said he would expose me, mind you these sex tapes where I am heavily drugged.”</p><p>Though Ms. Ventura’s lawsuit was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/arts/music/cassie-diddy-sean-combs-settlement.html" title="">settled a day after its filing</a>, and Mr. Combs denied its claims, it spurred a cascade of other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/arts/ny-sexual-misconduct-sean-comb-lawsuits.html" title="">civil suits against him</a>. Several of the suits, all of which are being challenged by Mr. Combs in court, were filed by women whose accounts carry some similarities to Ms. Ventura’s, with descriptions of coerced, drug-fueled sexual encounters.</p><p>One plaintiff, Adria English, accused Mr. Combs of demanding she have sex with guests while working at Mr. Combs’s famous “white parties” in the Hamptons and Miami Beach, where she said she was given ecstasy-laced liquor. Mr. Combs’s lawyers have characterized the civil suits as plaintiffs jumping on a “bandwagon” with false claims to try to extract a settlement.</p><p>In denying Mr. Combs’s bail on Wednesday, Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr. stressed his concern that Mr. Combs would obstruct justice by tampering with witnesses. Prosecutors said that for months Mr. Combs had been “feeding victims and witnesses false narratives,” while sometimes having accomplices record the conversations. His lawyers contend that he was merely informing contacts that his counsel would be reaching out to them.</p><p>But in court, prosecutors told a chilling story of an unnamed woman who texted Mr. Combs three days after Ms. Ventura’s suit was filed in November, with its depictions of the “freak-offs.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“I feel like I’m reading my own sexual trauma,” she wrote. “It makes me sick how three solid pages, word for word, is exactly my experiences and my anguish.”</p><p>Mr. Combs then called her twice, the prosecutors said, while an accomplice recorded the conversation on another phone. “He gaslit her and he attempted to convince her that she had willingly engaged in sex acts with him,” Ms. Johnson said. “But she pushed back.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-sisario">More about Ben Sisario</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Sex ‘Freak-Offs’ At Core of Case Against Combs<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
