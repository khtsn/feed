They’re waiting until they feel it’s safe enough to go back.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“They’re having food right here. Now we’re staying at an Airbnb. I come back and forth to get food, or waters and stuff like that. Really, to come get hot meals so we can come eat. A lot of stuff that’s been helpful is all the donations and stuff that these people have provided for us. They’re going to have a wildfire relief night, too. And then also this other place called Altadena Girls, they’re giving away some stuff too.” “Without school, I really don’t have a lot to do. But when I hang out with my mom and my aunties and my cousins, they fill up my schedule. Even though I don’t really like having to do math and not being able to play all the time, I really like school, hanging out with my friends. I always knew a fire was going to happen eventually, but I didn’t know it was going to be like this — destroying houses everywhere it went and blocking things. And yeah, making people not be able to have a home or going back to their home to get what they need.” I never thought that it would happen to Altadena, to our neighborhood. It’s no longer going to look the same. It’s no longer going to be the same.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="playlist-block"><div id="Wildfires"><p>Recent episodes in</p><!-- --> <p><span>Wildfires</span></p></div></div></div></div></div>
