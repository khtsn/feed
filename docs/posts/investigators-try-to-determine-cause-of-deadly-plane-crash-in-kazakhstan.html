Shortly afterward, it crashed while trying to make an emergency landing in Aktau, Kazakhstan, about 260 miles east of Grozny.</p><p>Of 62 passengers and five crew members on board, 29 survived, according to Kazakhstan’s authorities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Investigative authorities in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia said they had opened criminal investigations into the crash.

On Wednesday morning, around the time the plane had been scheduled to land in Grozny, a series of drone strikes took place, according to residents and local news media reports. </p><p>Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security company, said in a note to its clients on Wednesday that the plane had likely been struck by Russian air defenses “during an incident of misidentification.” </p><p>The Kremlin warned against making any immediate judgments about the cause. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, told reporters on Thursday: “The investigation is ongoing. We need to wait for its conclusions.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan said on Wednesday that “the reasons for the crash are not yet known.”</p><p>“There are various theories, but I believe it is premature to discuss them,” he said <a href="https://president.az/en/articles/view/67689" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">during a meeting</a> with government officials.</p><p>Azerbaijan Airlines <a href="https://t.me/AzerbaijanAirlines/2021" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that it was suspending flights from Baku to Grozny and Makhachkala, in neighboring Dagestan, until investigations into the crash had concluded.</p><p>Qasim Nauman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Milana Mazaeva<!-- --> and <!-- -->Marc Santora<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
