He also said the building had two fire escapes.</p><p>But no external escapes are visible in aerial footage of the building broadcast on Turkish television after the fire.</p><p>Fifty-two of the victims have been identified, and 14 were sent to forensic medicine unit for further DNA testing, officials said.
