But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/elections/florida-house-special-election-turnout.html" title="">on Tuesday, they will cast ballots</a> in what seems to be an unusually competitive contest to replace former Representative Michael Waltz, who stepped down to become Mr. Trump’s national security adviser.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Fine, who is facing Josh Weil, a Democrat and public school employee, is still widely favored to win. But with Republicans clinging to their House majority by just a few seats, it was clear this week that voters in the district are thinking about what the outcome of the race — and of another race for former Representative Matt Gaetz’s seat in the Florida Panhandle — could mean for Mr. Trump’s agenda.</p><p>“It’s important that we keep the seats,” said Doreen Colby, 74, a registered Republican who lives in Daytona Beach. “We want to make sure Trump can keep doing what he’s doing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Josh Weil, a Democrat and public school employee, during a campaign stop in Ocala, Fla., on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>After tapping Mr. Waltz and Mr. Gaetz for his cabinet, Mr. Trump quickly endorsed candidates to replace them. (Mr. Gaetz later withdrew from consideration as attorney general, but had already resigned from Congress.)</p><p>But while Jimmy Patronis, Florida’s chief financial officer, is expected to coast to victory in Mr. Gaetz’s former district, which is extremely conservative, some Republicans have expressed concern about the Sixth District race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There are nearly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats in the district, which Mr. Trump won in November by a two-to-one margin. </p><p>“We have a candidate that I don’t think is winning,” Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, said of Mr. Fine last week on his “War Room” podcast.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Trump held a telephone town hall for Mr. Fine, stressing his loyalty to the administration’s agenda.</p><p>“It’s not overstating things to say that your agenda is at stake in this election, and this district can’t let you down,” Mr. Fine told the president during the event. </p><p>Only one Democrat — former Senator Bill Nelson — has won the district in a federal race since 1989. Both Gov. Ron DeSantis, who held the seat from 2013 to 2018, and Mr. Waltz, who succeeded him, won it by double-digit margins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In interviews this week, loyal Republicans in the district were largely complimentary of Mr. Trump’s first few months in office. They praised him for his aggressive immigration enforcement and applauded the deep cuts to the federal work force. .</p><p>Their vote for Mr. Fine, they said, would send a message that Mr. Trump’s actions so far are what they wanted. Leaders in both parties “all talk about making cuts but none of them do it, and Trump is the first one to actually do it,” said Greg Bohr, 74, a Palm Coast retiree. “My theory is, give the guy a chance.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“It’s not overstating things to say that your agenda is at stake in this election, and this district can’t let you down,” Randy Fine told the president during a town hall event.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Steve Cannon/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>For Democrats, despairing over how little legislative opposition Mr. Trump has faced, the special election is a chance to voice their displeasure.</p><p>“I’ve got to do something,” said Marcia Hopkins, 63. Before driving to cast her vote for Mr. Weil, she said she asked the construction crew working on her condominium if they had voted and offered them rides to a polling place. (No one took her up on it.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Pointing to Mr. Fine’s high praise for Mr. Trump, Paul Hunt, 61, who works in real estate in DeLand, said of the candidate: “I don’t care if he was saving Bambi — based upon his affiliation, that tells me everything I need to know.”</p><p>Of Mr. Weil, whose campaign workers directly reached out to him, Mr. Hunt said, “He’s running at the right time.”</p><p>By Friday, Mr. Weil received an endorsement from Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent.</p><p>Mr. Weil, a public school teacher for a decade, has said if elected, he would prioritize expanding access to health care and education. </p><p>Mr. Weil has also emphasized his objections to cutting the federal work force and government assistance programs; nearly <a href="https://www.census.gov/mycd/?st=12&amp;cd=06" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a third of the district’s population</a> qualifies for Social Security. He has also worked to convince conservative voters that he would be a voice for them, too.</p><p>“People want a representative who will actually serve and represent them,” Mr. Weil said in an interview at Stetson University in DeLand. “They don’t need 200 carbon copies of a Republican Party clone all moving in lock step.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>By mid-March, Mr. Weil had brought in nearly $10 million, while Mr. Fine had raised less than $1 million. In the final week of the campaign, outside Republican groups have poured more than $1 million into television advertising for Mr. Fine; Elon Musk and his allies have pitched in money, too.</p><p>Despite the national investment and high-profile visits, officials in both parties are cautioning against parsing the race’s outcome for hints of how the electorate is feeling about Mr. Trump.</p><p>Should Mr. Fine not do as well as other Republicans have in the district, Mr. DeSantis told reporters on Tuesday, “That is not a reflection of President Trump — it’s a reflection of the specific candidate running in that race.” (Mr. Fine <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/oct/23/donald-trump-has-never-let-us-down/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">endorsed Mr. Trump</a> over Mr. DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary last year.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The seat became open after former Representative Michael Waltz stepped down to become President Trump’s national security adviser.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The race drew more attention last week after the editor of The Atlantic revealed that Mr. Waltz had accidentally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/war-plans-signal-chat-what-to-know.html" title="">included him in a group chat</a> on the encrypted messaging app Signal, in which plans for attacks against Houthi rebels in Yemen were shared and discussed. Mr. Waltz has faced calls for his resignation, given the sensitivity of the military plans.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>There is little indication, however, that the issue would register in the special election.</p><p>Some voters who supported Mr. Waltz in past elections downplayed what they perceived as an honest, if not slightly embarrassing, mistake. Others expressed confusion about what exactly had transpired.</p><p>“I have no idea what Signal is,” said Michelle Moyer, 49, who helps run her family’s wholesale sleigh bell business in South Daytona and voted for Mr. Waltz in November. What was more important, she said, was “filling Waltz’s seat with someone who is like-minded.”</p><p>“I appreciate that the country is going in the right direction,” she said, and Mr. Fine “agrees with the policies Trump is putting in place.”</p><p>On Thursday, Republican volunteers at the Daytona Beach polling place where Mr. Curnow voted kept a watchful eye on the early voting numbers. A man driving by rolled down his window to tell them that Representative Elise Stefanik of New York would stay in her seat, at Mr. Trump’s request, instead of becoming his ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p>“Yay,” Gisela Klobucar, one of the lead volunteers, said, clapping in reaction to the news.</p><p>She added, “We have one more person on our side.”</p><p>Eric Adelson<!-- --> contributed reporting from DeLand, Fla., and <!-- -->Abigail Geiger<!-- --> from Palm Coast, Fla. <!-- -->Theodore Schleifer<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ruth Igielnik<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington, D.C.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane">More about Emily Cochrane</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Congress</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Capitol Hill.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Schumer Under Fire: </strong>One downside of being a Senate leader is taking the heat both for and from party lawmakers when decisions can cause a political backlash.
