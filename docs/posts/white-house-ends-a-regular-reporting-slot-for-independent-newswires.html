It was also a new wrinkle in an unfolding legal battle with The A.P., whose journalists have been barred for the past two months from covering small-scale events with the president.</p><p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/trump-ap-oval-office-access.html" title="">said last week</a> that the White House had to restore full access to A.P. journalists, ruling that the administration’s ban amounted to a violation of the First Amendment. The White House has appealed, and a hearing is set for Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The presidential press pool is a small, rotating group of reporters who are granted access to more intimate events with the president, such as Oval Office receptions, and relay the proceedings to other journalists and the broader public. It is a logistical accommodation for smaller spaces that cannot fit dozens of reporters, and an opportunity for journalists to interact up close with the president and ask him direct questions.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to exert more control over the dedicated press corps that reports on its day-to-day activities.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Brenner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In February, breaking decades of bipartisan precedent, the administration said it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/media/trump-white-house-press.html" title="">begin handpicking</a> the members of the pool, wresting control from the independent <a href="https://whca.press/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">White House Correspondents’ Association</a>, which decried the move. “In a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps,” the group said at the time.</p><p>On Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, released a more specific set of guidelines for the press pool, including the elimination of a slot reserved for journalists representing one of three major newswires: The A.P., Bloomberg News and Reuters. (Newswires distribute syndicated news articles, videos and photographs to thousands of other media outlets around the United States and the world, many of which cannot afford to employ reporters in Washington.)</p><p>That slot, Ms. Leavitt said, will instead be filled by an additional journalist from a print media outlet, selected from a rotation of several dozen. Reporters at the three newswires are still eligible to fill the print media slot, but they will no longer be granted access to these sorts of presidential events on a near-daily basis. The change was reported earlier by <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/15/us-news/white-house-ends-permanent-wires-spot-in-press-pool-after-ap-court-win-expands-print-access/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The New York Post</a>.</p><p>“The White House press secretary shall retain day-to-day discretion to determine composition of the pool,” Ms. Leavitt said in a memorandum. “This is necessary to ensure that the president’s message reaches targeted audiences and that outlets with applicable subject-matter expertise are present as events warrant.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, during a briefing with members of the news media on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Lauren Easton, an A.P. spokeswoman, said in a statement on Tuesday that the Trump administration’s actions “continue to disregard the fundamental American freedom to speak without government control or retaliation.”</p><p>“We are deeply disappointed that the administration has chosen to restrict the access of all wire services, whose fast and accurate White House coverage informs billions of people every single day, rather than reinstate The Associated Press to the wire pool,” Ms. Easton said.</p><p>Bloomberg’s editor in chief, John Micklethwait, said in a statement: “We deeply regret the decision to remove that permanent level of scrutiny and accountability.”</p><p>A Reuters spokeswoman said, “We remain committed to covering the White House in an impartial, accurate and independent way.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The White House Correspondents’ Association said in a statement that the changes “show that the White House is just using a new means to do the same thing: retaliate against news organizations for coverage the White House doesn’t like.”</p><p>President Trump and his allies have embarked on a multipronged effort to weaken branches of the American independent press, filing lawsuits against ABC and CBS and threatening to rescind the broadcast licenses of major networks.</p><p>The administration’s dispute with The A.P. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-ap-gulf-mexico-america.html" title="">stems</a> from the newswire’s continued use of the term “Gulf of Mexico” to refer to the body of water that Mr. Trump renamed the Gulf of America in an executive order.</p><p>In response, White House officials in February blocked A.P. journalists from participating in the press pool, prompting the newswire to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/business/media/ap-white-house-ban-lawsuit.html" title="">file a lawsuit</a> to restore its access.</p><p>Trump officials say the changes are intended to grant more opportunities to nontraditional media outlets as Americans often consume information from venues beyond traditional news sources. “Legacy media outlets who have been here for years will still participate in the pool, but new voices are going to be welcomed in as well,” Ms. Leavitt said in February.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In February, The A.P., Bloomberg and Reuters issued <a href="https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/statement-from-ap-bloomberg-news-reuters-on-white-house-press-pool-access/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a joint statement</a> saying that “much of the White House coverage people see in their local news outlets, wherever they are in the world, comes from the wires.”</p><p>“It is essential in a democracy for the public to have access to news about their government from an independent, free press,” the statement continued. “We believe that any steps by the government to limit the number of wire services with access to the president threatens that principle.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
