    <h1>Selfishness Is Not a Virtue</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>When Christianity goes wrong, it goes wrong in a familiar way.</p><p>Last Friday, at a town hall meeting in Butler County, Iowa, Senator Joni Ernst delivered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/medicaid-cuts-joni-ernst-iowa-town-hall.html" title="">grim message</a> to her constituents. In the midst of an exchange over Medicaid cuts in President Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” someone in the crowd shouted at Ernst, “People are going to die!”</p><p>Ernst’s immediate response was bizarre. “Well, we all are going to die,” she said.</p><p>True enough, but that’s irrelevant to the question at hand. Yes, we’re all going to die, but it matters a great deal when, how and why. There’s a tremendous difference between dying after living a long and full life that’s enabled at least in part by access to decent health care, and dying a premature and perhaps needlessly painful death because you can’t afford the care you need.</p><p>All of this should be too obvious to explain, and it would cost Ernst — who occupies a relatively safe seat in an <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2024/11/14/iowa-2024-election-results-republican-democrat-red-wave" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increasingly red</a> state — virtually nothing to apologize and move on. In fact, just after her flippant comment, she did emphasize that she wanted to protect vulnerable people. <a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/public-affairs-event/senator-ernst-defends-medicaid-cuts-snap-changes-and-school-vouchers/5164363" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The full answer</a> was more complicated than the headline-generating quip.</p><p>By the standards of 2025, Ernst’s comment would have been little more than a micro-scandal, gone by the end of the day. And if we lived even in the relatively recent past, demonstrating humility could have worked to her benefit. It can be inspiring to watch a person genuinely apologize.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But we’re in a new normal now.</p><p>That means no apologies. That means doubling down. And that can also mean tying your cruelty to the Christian cross.</p><p>And so, the next day Ernst posted an apology <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/gqdwSLKE554?si=7KB2syiH5T-hLGav" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> — filmed, incredibly enough, in what appears to be a cemetery. It began well. “I would like to take this opportunity,” she said, “to sincerely apologize for a statement I made yesterday at my town hall.” But her statement devolved from there.</p><p>“I made an incorrect assumption,” she continued, “that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this earth.”</p><p>She didn’t stop there. “I’m really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well. But for those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I’d encourage you to embrace my lord and savior, Jesus Christ.”</p><p>Remember, this was not a snarky, impulsive rejoinder. It was a considered response. She decided to film the statement and release it. There is no ambiguity — the video delivered exactly the message she wanted to send.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>The fact that</strong> a sitting United States senator was that callous — and then tried to twist her cruelty into a bizarro version of the Christian gospel — is worth highlighting on its own as another instance of the pervasive “own the libs” ethos of the Republican Party. But Ernst’s fake apology was something different — and worse — than simple trolling. It exemplified the contortions of American Christianity in the Trump era.</p><p>Americans are now quite familiar with the “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/30/18037464/trump-rallies-apology-media-mobs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no apologies</a>” ethos of the Trumpist right. They’re familiar with Trumpist trolling and with MAGA politicians and MAGA influencers doubling and tripling down on their mistakes. My former Times colleague Jane Coaston has even popularized a term — “<a href="https://x.com/janecoaston/status/1126884369715597312" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vice signaling</a>” — to describe MAGA’s performative transgressiveness. Trumpists think it’s good to be bad.</p><p>But why bring Jesus into it?</p><p>America has always been a country with lots of Christian citizens, but it has not always behaved like a Christian country, and for reasons that resonate again today. An old error is new. Too many Christians are transforming Christianity into a vertical faith, one that focuses on your personal relationship with God at the expense of the horizontal relationship you have with your neighbors.</p><p>To understand what I mean, let’s turn to a much darker time in American history, when Christianity and slavery existed side-by-side in the American South. In 1970, Wendell Berry published “<a href="https://www.counterpointpress.com/books/the-hidden-wound/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Hidden Wound</a>,” a book-length essay about the profound damage that racism had inflicted on us all.</p><p>Reflecting on the Christianity of the slave-owning South, Berry wrote this passage, which is worth quoting at some length:</p><blockquote><p>First, consider the moral predicament of the master who sat in church with his slaves, thus attesting his belief in the immortality of the souls of people whose bodies he owned and used. He thus placed his body, if not his mind, at the very crux of the deepest contradiction of his life. How could he presume to own the body of a man whose soul he considered as worthy of salvation as his own? To keep this question from articulating itself in his thoughts and demanding an answer, he had to perfect an empty space in his mind, a silence, between heavenly concerns and earthly concerns, between body and spirit. If there had ever opened a conscious connection between the two claims, if the two sides of his mind had ever touched, it would have been like building a fire in a house full of gunpowder.</p></blockquote><p>The master hardened his heart to the plight of the slave by fundamentally rejecting the idea that his vertical faith in God carried with it a series of horizontal earthly obligations to love your neighbor as yourself, to do justice to the oppressed and to care for the vulnerable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>So long as the vertical relationship between God and man was secure, the horizontal relationship between men was of secondary importance, to the extent that it mattered at all. Why would this fleeting life matter when eternity was at stake?</p><p><strong>Thankfully, we don’t live</strong> in such extreme times. We’re far from the dreadful days of slavery, and we’ve left Jim Crow behind, but I’m noticing a morphing of American evangelicalism back to the vertical, away from the horizontal, and that change is turning our gaze inward, to our own well-being above all, sometimes even to the exclusion of caring about the fate of others.</p><p>Let’s look at a different, more contemporary, example.</p><p>In April, I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/opinion/trump-evangelicals-easter.html" title="">wrote about Paula White</a>, one of Trump’s principal faith advisers, and her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxP6PxMFx4E" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Easter offer</a> of “seven supernatural blessings” in exchange for a suggested offering of $1,000. My piece was focused on the cohort of pastors and their Christian followers who behave more like Trump than like Jesus.</p><p>But I could have just as easily focused on the sheer selfishness of her message as well. Look again at the gifts White offered to her flock: “God will assign an angel to you, he’ll be an enemy to your enemies, he’ll give you prosperity, he’ll take sickness away from you, he will give you long life, he’ll bring increase in inheritance, and he’ll bring a special year of blessing.”</p><p>The emphasis is clear — look at what God will do for you. It’s all vertical. Honor God (by giving White a pile of cash), and he’ll make you healthy, wealthy and strong.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Consider also the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/opinion/trump-usaid-evangelicals.html" title="">evangelical turn against empathy</a>. There are now Christian writers and theologians who are mounting a frontal attack against the very value that allows us to understand our neighbors, that places us in their shoes and asks what we would want and need if we were in their place.</p><p>But Christianity is a cross-shaped faith. The vertical relationship creates horizontal obligations. While Christians can certainly differ, for example, on the best way to provide health care to our nation’s most vulnerable citizens, it’s hard to see how we can disagree on the need to care for the poor.</p><p>Put another way, when the sick and lame approached Jesus, he did not say, “Depart from me, for thou shalt die anyway.” He healed the sick and fed the hungry and told his followers <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025&amp;version=CSB" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to do the same</a>.</p><p>Or, as the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202&amp;version=CSB" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Book of James declares</a>, “If a brother or sister is without clothes and lacks daily food<strong> </strong>and one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace, stay warm, and be well fed,’ but you don’t give them what the body needs, what good is it?”</p><p>Again, these passages do not dictate any particular policy, but they do tell us that we must try to meet the physical needs of the poor — here, on this earth — even if our souls are far more durable than our bodies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>People often ask me</strong> if I think the evangelical church has changed during the age of Trump or if its true nature is being revealed. There is not a neat yes or no answer. Certainly Trump’s rise has revealed the extent to which the will to power has always lurked in Christian hearts. When faced with a conflict between their stated principles and their access to power, millions of Republican Christians chose power over principle — and they are continuing to do so every day.</p><p>At the same time, some things have changed. An evangelical community that once celebrated, for example, George W. Bush’s PEPFAR program — the AIDS initiative that has saved an <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief-pepfar/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated 26 million lives</a> — has now either applauded or stood by passively as Trump has decimated American foreign aid and damaged a program that was one of America’s greatest humanitarian accomplishments.</p><p>Ernst isn’t the chief offender here by any means. Nor do I think that she’s consciously trying to narrow Christian doctrine to the kind of purely vertical relationship that enables so much injustice. Senators aren’t theologians, and neither are columnists.</p><p>But politicians are weather vanes (as we’re all tempted to be), and there’s a foul wind blowing out of parts of American Christianity. Ernst’s first quip was a gaffe. Her apology video was no such thing. It was a premeditated effort to say exactly what she thinks Republicans want to hear.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-16923424">Some other things I did</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/opinion/trump-judges-federalist-society.html" title="">In my Sunday column</a>, I explained why Trump has turned against the Federalist Society and why the judiciary — including Republican-appointed judges — is holding firm to its constitutional principles when the vast majority of Republican politicians have surrendered to Trump:</p><blockquote><p>Trump and I have something in common. We’ve both been thinking about why the judiciary has held firm when many other American institutions (especially conservative institutions) have collapsed. Why have a vast majority of conservative judges remained faithful to their legal philosophies when we’ve watched a vast majority of Republicans twist themselves into pretzels celebrating Trump for practices and policies they’d condemn in any other person or politician?</p><p>I come from the conservative legal movement, I have friends throughout the conservative legal movement (including many Trump-appointed judges), and I think I know the answer, or at least part of it.</p><p>The immense pressure that Trump puts on his perceived rivals and opponents exposes our core motivations, and the core motivations of federal judges are very different from the core motivations of members of Congress. Think of it as the difference between seeking the judgment of history over the judgment of the electorate, and to the extent that you seek approval, you place a higher priority on the respect of your peers than the applause of the crowd.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/opinion/end-of-empathy-politics.html" title="">On Monday</a>, we published a conversation between my colleagues Jamelle Bouie, Michelle Cottle and me that tried to explain why politics feel so cruel these days. One reason is quite simple and connects with what I was just talking about — Trump is changing American evangelicalism more than American evangelicalism is changing Trump:</p><blockquote><p>There’s this very powerful argument that you choose among the lesser evils, especially when people are cynical about politics to begin with. But here’s the thing that’s interesting about human beings: We don’t like to be on Team Lesser Evil. No one’s running around chanting, “Lesser evil, lesser evil.”</p><p>We want to be on the side that’s good. And if you can’t make Donald Trump good, you’ll just redefine Donald Trump as good. And this is part of what is all happening. If you can’t change the MAGA culture, they’re redefining the MAGA culture to try to assimilate it within Christianity or to assimilate Christianity into the MAGA culture. And so that’s why I think it’s quite clear to me why these attacks on empathy are now coming up several years into the Trump era. And it’s because it’s this long, slow process of “How do we make Trump good?” Well, you can’t make Trump good, so how do you change our definition of what is good to meet Trump?</p></blockquote></div></div></section></article></div>
