Many are still reeling from the squeeze of inflation. Early data on online spending released today showed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/business/black-friday-holiday-shopping.html" title="">consumers were being drawn to discounts.</a> </p><p>Shoppers spent $6.1 billion on Thanksgiving, according to Adobe Analytics, around a 9 percent increase over last year. That was driven by large discounts on items like toys, electronics and apparel.</p><p>The spending patterns are separating retailers into winners and losers. Walmart is emerging as one of the winners, reporting that its U.S. sales had increased 5 percent in its most recent quarter. Higher-income households accounted for most of its market share gains.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But Target — which features more discretionary categories like apparel and home décor — badly missed sales expectations, cut its forecast and saw the steepest drop in its stock in years.
