This was the 84th call about him that the police had logged so far that year. The complaints varied: lying down in traffic, trying to get hit; masturbating on the back steps of a home.

But the neighborhood has long been a magnet for people wrestling with addiction and mental illness, drawn to its remarkable repertoire of social services. Fentanyl and then meth readily found him. Abruptly, he began pinballing from the Bayside streets to the hospital to a local psychiatric facility to jail. The ricocheting was about to start again.</p><p>The next day, the 85th call came in: shirtless, shoeless man flinging toys around the sandbox at a nursery school playground. The police arrived in time, tucked him in their cruiser and took him to the hospital.</p><p>But the officers did not have a “blue paper” — an order signed by a judge that <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/obh/support-services/rights-and-legal-issues/involuntary-admissions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">allows a hospital</a> emergency department to hold a patient for psychiatric commitment.

Among the Bayside folks whom Mr. Burns shuttles daily to opioid addiction treatment clinics, her attendance is among the most consistent.</p><p>On a biting cold day, she settled into his van alongside sleepy passengers. But Kailan was perky. “Dope is my worst enemy,” she declared, using the street word for opioids, “but meth is my best friend.” Meth, she said, gets her up and moving every day.</p><p>On the drive back to Bayside from the clinic, she asked Mr. Burns if he would stop so she could have a cigarette. He parked along a promenade overlooking Casco Bay and waited, as Kailan, in slippers, a thin T-shirt and a hooded jacket, trudged across the packed snow. At a picnic table behind a stand of trees, she crouched down and lifted her jacket over her head.</p><p>Shielded from bitter winds and curious passers-by, she dropped a grayish pebble of crystal meth into a glass pipe, lit it, and swirled till vapor steamed from the bowl.

Because the drug improved her alertness and focus, Kailan believes she does, in fact, have the disability, not uncommon among people who use meth. Adderall, an amphetamine, is chemically related to meth.</p><p>Kailan sometimes wonders how her life might have turned out if she had been given a proper psychiatric evaluation and a diagnosis of A.D.H.D. Without it, doctors refused her requests for Adderall.

The walls of a vacant parking garage, where homeless people slept at night, became covered with meth-fueled murals.

Recounting this, Kailan buried her head on the picnic table and wept.</p><p>“At no point did any of us ever say: ‘Yay, these drugs are here! Let’s have fun!’ None of us wanted these drugs on the streets. Like, if we had a vote, I don’t think any of us would vote for them.”</p><p>As Kailan’s meth dependence grew, her housing became unstable. A boyfriend introduced her to fentanyl, which they both injected. Days bled into nights as the couple toggled between meth and opioids. He beat her up, knocking out three teeth with one punch, and locked her in his basement. When he was hospitalized for drug-related infections, she fantasized about leaving him and drugs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>About two years ago, Kailan served another short jail sentence. As she sat at the promenade picnic table, she recalled her surprise in jail when she realized, “ ‘The whole time I haven’t wanted drugs at all!’ And I was thinking, ‘This has been you, locked up and lost inside of you, in chains, and now you’re released.’ And I said to myself: ‘Don’t forget. Don’t forget.’”</p><p>A year or so ago, she scored a coveted spot at <a href="https://www.preblestreet.org/elenas-way/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elena’s Way</a>, a 40-bed shelter in Bayside.
