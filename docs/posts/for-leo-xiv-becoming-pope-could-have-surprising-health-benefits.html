At 69, he’s seven years junior to his predecessor Francis when he became pope, and nine years to Benedict XVI before him. </p><p>Still, the new pope is already older than many people are when they retire. And he is not simply adopting a new hobby. He is taking on a high-stakes, high-stress role that he is expected to occupy until death.</p><p>“The papacy is an enormous effort for any person,” said Dr. Nelson Castro, a physician and journalist who was close to Francis and wrote the book “The Health of Popes.” The pope is a head of state and the global head of the Roman Catholic Church, responsible for overseeing church theology, appointing cardinals and bishops, celebrating Masses and undertaking pilgrimages to far-flung destinations.</p><p>“He has a heavy job to do, and his health will be a key factor,” Dr. Castro said.</p><h2 id="link-520ab150">The job can have health benefits.</h2><p>The “biggest benefit” of working well into old age is cognitive, said Mara Mather, a professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California. The brain is still adaptable, even into old age, she said; learning new skills on the job can preserve a person’s ability to think and process new information, despite the decline that naturally comes with getting older.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Leo may already be at lower risk for age-related cognitive decline, she added: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/73/suppl_1/S20/4971564?login=false" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Studies show that</a> people with at least a college education or who <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32462636/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speak multiple languages</a> (both of which are true for Leo) can function normally for longer than peers without those degrees and skills, even if they have neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>What’s more, having a sense of purpose increases one’s positive outlook and reduces the likelihood of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/well/dementia-stroke-depression-prevention.html" title="">late-life depression and dementia</a>, said Dr. Margaret Flanagan, a neuropathologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.</p><p>And experts said staying socially engaged can reduce the risk of cognitive decline.</p><p>James Martin, a Jesuit priest and a consultant to the Vatican’s communications office who knew Francis, said the papacy checks all three boxes. “He has 1.4 billion Catholics to engage with. He has a sense of purpose from Jesus Christ. Given that he’s writing encyclicals and homilies and books, he certainly has cognitive engagement,” Father Martin said.</p><h2 id="link-44534b96">It also comes with risks.</h2><p>Becoming pope brings new stressors, including a high profile and diplomatic pressures that could be mentally taxing. In recent decades, the Catholic Church has had to contend with a string of sex-abuse scandals, internal political divisions and thorny questions about theology and its role on the global political stage.</p><p>“If there’s any problem in the church, it’s you,” Father Martin said. “You’re always on call, you’re always the pope.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>One of the most grueling elements of the job might be all the travel. Just last fall, Pope Francis, at 87 and in a wheelchair, flew to Papua New Guinea as part of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/asia/pope-francis-asia-trip.html" title="">11-day</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/asia/francis-pope-asia-trip.html" title="">four-nation visit to Asia and the Pacific</a>. </p><p>“When he’s in those countries, he’s doing a Mass in the morning, a talk in the afternoon, meeting with heads of state,” Father Martin said. </p><p>The chronic stress that comes with being in such a prominent role can also raise the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular issues, as well as weaken the immune system, said Dr. Roberto Vicinanza, an instructional associate professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California. And as we age, the body is less able to recover quickly from stress, he said.</p><p>The daily demands of the job, coupled with the pressure to stay in the position for life, could also increase the pope’s risk of burnout, which “in turn can lead to longer recovery times for illness and poorer mental health,” said Aaron Guest, an assistant professor of aging at Arizona State University.</p><p>In addition, he could face hearing loss, forgetfulness or decreased mobility, all common issues for people in their 60s and 70s. It may also be harder to multitask, meet deadlines or react to stressors quickly, said Dr. R. Sean Morrison, chair of the geriatrics and palliative medicine department at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-692b2d93">The spiritual practice itself may be good for his brain and body.</h2><p><a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/sites/projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/rshm/files/jama_balboni_2022_sc_220002_1660748706.29282_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Some studies</a> of older American adults have shown that weekly attendance at religious services is associated with lower rates of depression and of premature death, said Dr. Warren Kinghorn, a psychiatrist and theological ethicist at Duke University. That’s partly because religious practice tends to be associated with other healthy behaviors, like not smoking or drinking heavily, Dr. Kinghorn said.</p><p>The Nun Study, which followed 678 Catholic nuns over several decades to study aging and dementia, showed that those who remained intellectually, socially and spiritually active into their 80s and 90s often maintained better cognitive and physical function than those who did not, said Dr. Flanagan, who now directs the study. </p><h2 id="link-6ed5d7e7">The basics still matter.</h2><p>The pope needs to exercise, eat a good diet and get sufficient sleep to stay healthy, Dr. Castro said. “Those are the normal things that everybody must do in order to keep his health,” he said. “Popes are human beings.”</p><p>By all accounts thus far, Leo is in good health, Dr. Castro noted. He has an affinity for tennis, and the Vatican <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6344149/2025/05/10/pope-leo-xiv-vatican-city-tennis-court/" title="">does have a court</a>. John Paul II <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/18/world/john-paul-stresses-priestly-obedience.html" title="">famously hiked</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/12/magazine/determined-to-lead.html" title="">skied</a> for years into his papacy and had a swimming pool built at the pope’s summer residence. Benedict played the piano.</p><p>Still, aging varies widely from person to person, and how Leo fares — and how long he occupies the papacy — will depend largely on his individual condition and philosophy, experts said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>John Paul II survived an assassination attempt and later developed Parkinson’s disease, becoming debilitated by the end of his papacy. Benedict broke with tradition and stepped down, saying he was no longer strong enough to carry out his papal duties. Francis worked until the day he died.</p><p>“I have many patients who are making major societal contributions well into their 70s, 80s and even 90s,” Dr. Morrison said, adding: “It’s much more important to focus on physiological and cognitive ability rather than chronological age.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nina Agrawal is a Times health reporter.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Pope Leo XIV</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Pope’s Brother, MAGA Disciple: </strong>Now-deleted Facebook posts from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/louis-prevost-pope-leo-xiv-brother.html">Louis Prevost</a> suggest an embrace of some of the most common complaints and conspiracies of the right.</p></li><li><p><strong> The</strong><strong> Health Benefits of Being Pope</strong>: Such a demanding job can be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/well/pope-health-leo.html">good for the brain and body</a>, but Leo may still have to contend with challenges that are common in old age.</p></li><li><p><strong> The Religious Order That Molded the Pope: </strong>The Order of St. Augustine, with fewer than 3,000 members, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/europe/pope-leo-order-of-st-augustine.html">shaped the man</a> who would become a cardinal, and then pope to the world’s Roman Catholics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Call for Peace: </strong>In his first audience with the press as pontiff, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/europe/pope-leo-vatican-journalists.html">Leo renewed his pleas for a more peaceful world</a> and quoted his predecessor, Pope Francis, who had called for communication that is free from aggression.</p></li><li><p><strong>Echoing Francis in First Mass: </strong>In Pope Leo XIV’s advocacy of the poor, migrants and a more open church, many people see the new pope as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/pope-leo-mass-catholic-church.html">continuation of his predecessor</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seeing the First American Pope as Hardly American:</strong> Catholics around the world were skeptical at first about an American pope.
