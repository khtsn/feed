    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CBS News will broadcast the debate in its entirety and stream it on CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+. Other television networks, including C-SPAN, PBS, NBC News, CNN, Fox News and BBC, will carry a simulcast of the event.</p><h2 id="link-19034f8e">Who are the moderators?</h2><p>The event will be moderated by Norah O’Donnell, the anchor of “CBS Evening News,” and Margaret Brennan, who hosts CBS’s weekend show “Face the Nation.”</p><h2 id="link-2b1939ae">What are the debate rules?</h2><p>Tuesday’s debate rules differ from the Sept. 10 presidential debate, which was hosted by ABC News, in that both candidates’ microphones will be turned on for the duration of the debate. But CBS has said that its producers will be able to turn off the microphones if needed.</p><p>The event will otherwise have similar ground rules to the Trump-Harris debate:</p><ul><li><p>There will be two commercial breaks, each four minutes long.</p></li><li><p>No in-person audience will be present.</p></li><li><p>The candidates will stand at lecterns onstage, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/politics/vance-walz-debate-standing.html" title="">first time since 2008</a> that vice-presidential candidates have debated standing up.</p></li><li><p>There will be no opening statements. Mr. Vance, who won a coin toss to determine the order of closing statements, has chosen to have the last word.</p></li><li><p>Each candidate will be given two minutes to answer a moderator’s question, and their opponent will have two minutes to respond. Another minute will be granted for a rebuttal, and the moderators may give them another minute each “to continue a discussion,” according to the rules.</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/business/media/vp-debate-cbs-rules-format.html" title="">Read more about the debate rules.</a></p><h2 id="link-401fbb7d">Will there be another Harris-Trump debate?</h2><p>It’s possible, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/trump-harris-second-debate.html" title="">unlikely</a>.
