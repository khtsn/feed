    <h1>BLEED announce roster overhaul, bench four players</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
			<p>a player can negotiate and agree to a contract with another team, but the player&#39;s original team can match/beat that offer and keep them or even just refuse that offer (at least, I think). similar to other sports. an unrestricted free agent can sign with whoever he wants and the org can&#39;t do anything.</p>
<p>so basically, a player can negotiate and sign with another team, but then the current team has to approve. i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve seen a team refuse an offer for a player in vct so far? someone feel free to fact check</p>		</div></div>
