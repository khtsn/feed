I formally apologize. It’s long overdue.”</p><p>He added that “quite frankly, there’s no excuse that this apology took 50 years to make” and acknowledged that it could only mean so much after so long. “I know no apology can or will make up for what was lost during the darkness of the federal boarding school policy,” Mr. Biden said. “But today, we’re finally moving forward into the light.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Biden’s visit culminated years of study and discussion by his administration led by Deb Haaland, the nation’s first Native American interior secretary, whose own family was affected by a practice that lasted from the early 1800s to the late 1960s. An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/us/politics/native-american-boarding-schools.html" title="">investigative report</a> by her department in July found that at least 19,000 Native children were sent to federal boarding schools, and nearly 1,000 died while attending them.</p><p>In addition to an apology, the report called on the federal government to create a national memorial to commemorate the children’s deaths and educate the public; invest in research and help Native communities heal from intergenerational stress and trauma; and revitalize Native languages.</p><p>Mr. Biden has signed legislation to invest more than $45 billion in tribal nations, focusing particularly on infrastructure and health systems on reservations. The Gila River Indian Community, located just outside Phoenix, has received more than $80 million in federal funds to build a pipeline to irrigate crops amid drought conditions.</p><p>The community’s governor, Stephen Lewis, thanked Mr. Biden onstage. “We’ve never had a president and vice president who have done more for Indian country,” he said.</p><p>Doug Kiel, a citizen of the Oneida Nation and a scholar at Northwestern University’s Center for Native American and Indigenous Research, said Mr. Biden’s apology was a “significant acknowledgment” of the injustices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But he added that “true healing demands” more concrete actions, including returning stolen lands, honoring Indigenous sovereignty and fulfilling treaty obligations. “Without such tangible steps, the apology risks remaining a symbolic gesture without fostering real accountability and justice,” he said.</p><p>The president made his visit in the final days of a heated campaign to choose his successor. While it took him away from the major centers of the deadlocked race, Native Americans make up 6 percent of the population in Arizona, one of seven battleground states that political strategists believe will settle the contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Biden, the fifth sitting president to visit Native American territory, said it was important for Americans to own up to their history even when it is ugly. “We must know the good, the bad, the truth of who we are as a nation,” he said. “That’s what great nations do. We’re a great nation; we’re the greatest of nations. We do not erase history, we make history, we learn from history. And we remember so we can heal as a nation.”</p><p>Ms. Haaland, who introduced him, choked up as she talked about her own family’s experiences. “We know that the federal government failed,” she said. “It failed to annihilate our languages, our traditions, our life ways, it failed to destroy us because we persevered.”</p><p>In an interview, Ms. Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, recalled that three generations of her family had been rounded up from their village in New Mexico and sent away to boarding schools. Her great-grandfather was sent to the East Coast and both of her grandparents were sent more than a hundred of miles away to Santa Fe. Her mother, who also attended a boarding school, was later too afraid to teach her children their native language, Keres.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I felt that my life had been definitely affected by the generational trauma,” Ms. Haaland said. She can only speak a small amount of Keres. “I’m sorry to say that that is the situation with a lot of folks.”</p><p>She said the administration was pursuing other recommendations in the July report in the time it has until leaving office in January. “We have 90 days left in this administration,” she said, “and we’re going to work as hard as we possibly can.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
