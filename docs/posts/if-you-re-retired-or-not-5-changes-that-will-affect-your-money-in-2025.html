But the payoff — and, in one case, possible penalty — can be substantial.</p><p>Here is a roundup of the most important changes to retirement savings plans, Medicare, Social Security and consumer regulations that could affect your finances in 2025.</p><h2 id="link-2bd84403">A Boost for Retirement Savers</h2><p>For the first time, people ages 60 to 63 will be able to supersize catch-up contributions to 401(k)s and similar workplace plans beyond the maximum for other savers 50 and older, powering the push to accelerate savings in the years just before retirement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The new <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-limit-increases-to-23500-for-2025-ira-limit-remains-7000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">catch-up contribution limit</a> for this age group for 2025: $11,250, versus $7,500 for employees ages 50 to 59 or 64 and older. That’s on top of the $23,500 maximum in 2025 for savers younger than 50, bringing the total allowable contribution for workers 60 to 63 to $34,750 this year.</p><p>“People at this stage of life may be in their peak earning years, may have paid off their mortgages and often have college funding in the rearview mirror,” said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar. “That can create the wherewithal to save more.”</p><p>Still, the new super catch-up provision may prove tough to afford for many workers, as regular catch-up contributions already are. Just 15 percent of all eligible 401(k) savers made catch-up contributions in 2023, compared with over half of those who earned $150,000 or more, <a href="https://institutional.vanguard.com/content/dam/inst/iig-transformation/insights/pdf/2024/has/how_america_saves_report_2024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vanguard reports</a>.</p><p>“Unfortunately, the people who are most equipped to make these extra contributions least need to, and the people who most need to are the least able to do so,” said Ms. Benz, author of the book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Retire-lessons-successful-retirement/dp/1804090697" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to Retire</a>.”</p><p>There are a few other changes to tax-advantaged accounts that will benefit retirement savers this year. They include small increases in the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-limit-increases-to-23500-for-2025-ira-limit-remains-7000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">income limits</a> to qualify for Roth individual retirement accounts, health savings accounts, and deductible I.R.A.s for people also covered by a retirement plan at work. The income limit is also going up for the saver’s credit, worth up to $1,000 for singles who earn $39,500 or less, and $2,000 for married couples filing jointly who make $79,000 or less.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In addition, the regular contribution limit for 401(k) plans is up by $500, from $23,000 last year.</p><p>“Individually, these are pretty modest changes, but, collectively, they offer a real boost to people who are saving for retirement,” said Amber Brestowski, head of advice and client experience at Vanguard’s institutional investor group.</p><h2 id="link-4008dc53">A Cap on Medicare Drug Bills</h2><p>In a true game-changer for millions of Medicare enrollees — especially those who take expensive specialty medicines to treat health conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and some cancers — out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs covered under Part D will be limited to $2,000 this year.</p><p>The new cap on costs, which started to phase in last year, replaces a system in which people with Medicare Part D coverage typically had to spend <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/changes-to-medicare-part-d-in-2024-and-2025-under-the-inflation-reduction-act-and-how-enrollees-will-benefit/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than $3,000</a> before they qualified for catastrophic coverage, when insurance would pick up most of a drug’s cost, leaving patients with a 5 percent co-payment. The average price of specialty medicines is around $7,000 a month and many run $10,000 a month or more.</p><p>“Five percent of a big number is still a big number,” said Philip Moeller, author of the book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1668031914?" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Get What’s Yours for Medicare.</a>”</p><p>Some 3.2 million Medicare enrollees are expected to save money in 2025 because of the cap, and nearly 1.4 million enrollees will save $1,000 or more, according to <a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/ppi/topics/health/prescription-drugs/new-medicare-part-d-out-of-pocket-spending-cap-important-improvement-for-enrollees-facing-high-prescription-drug-costs.doi.10.26419-2fppi.00335.001.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AARP</a>. The impact is expected to grow over time, as drug prices increase and expensive new medications come to market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“In addition to those who will benefit directly, people who don’t take expensive medications will have peace of mind knowing that if, heaven forbid, they get a cancer diagnosis or some other chronic disease where pricey medications are involved in treatment, they won’t have to leave the pharmacy empty-handed because they can’t afford the drug cost or put it on a credit card and go into serious medical debt,” said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Medicare policy program at KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care policy.</p><p>Also new this year: People with Part D coverage have the option of spreading out their payments over the course of the year. But if you can swing it, Mr. Moeller said, pay the full cost up front to get drug bills for the year out of the way and avoid paperwork.</p><h2 id="link-16c5deb2">Higher Earned Income Limits for Early Retirees</h2><p>Some <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/social-security-claiming-age-importance-claiming-behavior-and-trends/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">60 percent of workers</a> take Social Security before they reach the age when they can collect full benefits (66 and 10 months in 2025). In a small break for the many among them who continue to work full or part time, the amount most can earn before the government will temporarily reduce their benefits is rising modestly to $23,400, up from $22,320 in 2024.</p><p>The income limit is more generous for those who will hit full retirement age this year: $62,160, up from $59,520 in 2024.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/whileworking.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how the system works</a>: For every $2 that early retirees earn above the income limit, they lose $1 in Social Security benefits until they reach full retirement age. Then in the calendar year they hit full retirement age, they’ll lose $1 in benefits for every $3 in work earnings. Once they hit full retirement age, Social Security repays the money withheld, adding it back over time to the monthly benefit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It’s important to remember the reduction in benefits is temporary and will be restored over the course of your retirement,” said Mr. Moeller, author of the newsletter “<a href="https://philmoeller.substack.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aging in America</a>.” “It’s an inconvenience, not a permanent loss, and shouldn’t be a disincentive to work.”</p><h2 id="link-72a0aec4">New Withdrawal Rules for Inherited I.R.A.s</h2><p>The prize — booby prize may be more fitting — for the most confusing financial change of 2025 goes to newly clarified I.R.S. rules governing how you need to withdraw money from an inherited I.R.A. “It’s complicated, the penalties for not getting it right are significant and awareness is low, which can make for a frustrating experience,” Ms. Brestowski said.</p><p>The rules apply to I.R.A.s inherited after 2019 by people other than a spouse, minor child or someone who is disabled or chronically ill — commonly, adult children and grandchildren — and require all the money in the account to be withdrawn within 10 years of the original owner’s death.</p><p>Under <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-and-ira-required-minimum-distributions-faqs#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the guidelines</a>, if the person who died wasn’t required to take minimum distributions from the account (starting at age 73, currently), the heir can withdraw money any time over the 10-year period as long as there’s none left by the end of it. But if the original owner had to take distributions every year, the person who inherits the account must too, starting the year after the original owner’s death.</p><p>The penalty for not making the correct withdrawal: 25 percent of the amount you should have taken out, or 10 percent if you correct the mistake within two years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Deciding how much to take out of the account, and when, over the 10-year withdrawal period is also complicated. Research <a href="https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/minimize-taxes-inherited-ira-distributions.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from Vanguard suggests</a> that withdrawing the same amount every year for each of the 10 years typically results in the lowest tax bill. But that may not be the best strategy for heirs whose top priority is to grow the account’s value.</p><p>“The most essential thing for people who have inherited I.R.A.s to do, honestly, is to get some customized advice from a financial expert based on your own situation,” Ms. Benz of Morningstar said.</p><h2 id="link-43d4ea91">Medical Debt Comes Off Credit Reports</h2><p>There’s a last-minute gift from the Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to the <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/press-release/people-with-medical-debt-are-much-more-likely-to-experience-other-forms-of-financial-stress/#:~:text=KFF&#39;s%202022%20Health%20Care%20Debt,or%20owed%20to%20family%20members." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one-quarter of Americans</a> who owe money for past-due health care bills: a ban on including medical debt in credit reports. In a move announced this month, the agency also barred creditors from considering some medical information in loan decisions.</p><p>The new regulations, according to the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/07/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-final-rule-removing-medical-debt-from-all-credit-reports/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">White House</a>, are expected to erase nearly $50 million in medical debt from the credit reports of more than 15 million Americans. It will also raise their credit scores by an estimated 20 points and could lead to the approval of an additional 22,000 mortgages a year, White House officials said.</p><p>“This change provides a more accurate picture of creditworthiness by removing a debt that people have little control over,” said Allison Sesso, president and chief executive of the nonprofit Undue Medical Debt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Still, there could be unintended consequences. “In the short run, the major advantage for consumers is that they no longer need to worry about medical debt damaging their credit scores,” said Craig Antico, chief executive of ForgiveCo, a public benefit corporation that works with companies to forgive consumer debt. “Over time, however, this may lead to more upfront payment demands as providers face challenges collecting from patients.”</p><p>Then too, what one administration gives, another may take away. President-elect Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress have already signaled their intention to roll back some regulations and their displeasure with the C.F.P.B. Two lawsuits challenging the ruling have already been filed from members of the debt-collection industry.</p><p>As a result, the changes, which were originally expected to take effect in 60 days, are likely to be delayed — or, possibly, derailed. “Our hope is that the incoming administration recognizes that medical debt is a trap that nearly anyone can be unfairly caught up in,” Ms. Sesso said. “Only time will tell.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>BU</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>3</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Key Changes That May Affect Your Savings<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
