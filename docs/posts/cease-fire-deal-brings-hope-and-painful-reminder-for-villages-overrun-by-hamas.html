He added, though, that both sides were still working on concluding some of the logistical matters.</p><div><p>The agreement needs to be formally ratified by the Israeli cabinet and the government, two senior Israeli officials said. The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said in a statement that a number of details in the agreement remained unresolved, but that it was hoped that they would be worked out on Wednesday night. Votes are expected on Thursday morning.</p><p>Mr. Al Thani said <a href="#gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas" title="">the first phase of the cease-fire deal</a> would see Israeli forces withdraw to the east, away from populated areas. Some 33 hostages would be released over the course of the 42 days, he said. He did not say how many Palestinian prisoners would be released.</p><p>About 100 hostages are thought to still be in Gaza, although the Israeli authorities believe around 35 of them are dead.</p><p>Mr. Biden said that in addition to the hostage releases, Palestinians would be able to return to their homes and receive a surge of humanitarian supplies. “Too many innocent people have died; too many communities have been destroyed,” he said in a speech at the White House. “In this deal, the people of Gaza can finally recover and rebuild.”</p><p>Hamas confirmed the cease-fire deal in a statement on Telegram, calling it an “achievement for our people” and hailing Gazans’ “legendary resilience” in the face of the war.</p><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump also announced that a hostage deal had been reached, writing on social media that “THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY.” Mr. Trump had threatened severe consequences unless Israel and Hamas reached an agreement before his Jan. 20 inauguration, which some officials credited with helping to advance the negotiations.</p><p>The nearly uninterrupted fighting in Gaza has left Hamas <a href="#hamas-weakened-israel-ceasefire" title="">severely battered</a>, with many of its military commanders killed, including its longtime leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.</p><p>Many Gazans reacted with hope tempered by sadness, exhaustion and fear. Suzanne Abu Daqqa, who lives in a suburb near the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, said she was thrilled that the fighting and bombing could end soon. But she remained anxious about the future. “How can we ever rebuild?” she said. “Where will we even begin?”</p><p>In Israel, supporters of the deal celebrated the new hope to see hostages returned, but also expressed sorrow that a truce would likely only pause the conflict. “In order for there to be peace, there must be new leadership in Gaza and Israel, as well as years of quiet and education for peace and mutual understanding,” said Yaniv Hegyi, who survived Hamas’s October 2023 attack on the Israeli community of Be’eri. “What’s the chance of all that happening? Practically zero.”</p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>What’s in the deal:</strong> The cease-fire deal in Gaza is broadly <a href="#the-current-deal-on-the-table-is-similar-to-one-pushed-by-president-biden-in-may-officials-say" title="">similar to a three-phase framework</a> publicized by President Biden in late May, according to several officials familiar with the talks. Under that May proposal, Israel and Hamas would first observe a six-week cease-fire in which Hamas would release women, older men, and ill hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinians jailed by Israel, and 600 trucks carrying humanitarian relief would enter Gaza daily.</p></li><li><p><strong>Right-wing opposition: </strong>In Israel, some hard-line members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government have also voiced opposition to the deal. But on Wednesday, Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, <a href="https://x.com/TheNationalNews/status/1879431395283480700" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he believed that a majority would sign off on an agreement if it came to a cabinet vote.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hostage talks:</strong> The deal on the table comes after months of shuttle diplomacy to end the war in Gaza, which began when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage.<span>  </span>Since Israel began its military campaign in response to the October 2023 attack, at least 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials there.</p></li></ul><p>Abu Bakr Bashir<!-- --> and <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="68" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2NhNmE5YmMxLWUxYjYtNWY5ZS05ODJhLTAxOTJjODE3NmZmNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/15/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire-deal-gaza#news-of-a-deal-brings-hope-and-a-painful-reminder-for-residents-of-villages-overrun-by-hamas" data-source-id="100000009928994"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman"><img alt="Aaron Boxerman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon"><img alt="Adam Rasgon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-15T23:20:04.270Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 15, 2025, 6:20 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman" itemprop="name">Aaron Boxerman</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon" itemprop="name">Adam Rasgon</a></p><p>Reporting from Jerusalem</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2NhNmE5YmMxLWUxYjYtNWY5ZS05ODJhLTAxOTJjODE3NmZmNQ=="><a href="#news-of-a-deal-brings-hope-and-a-painful-reminder-for-residents-of-villages-overrun-by-hamas">News of a deal brings hope and a painful reminder for residents of villages overrun by Hamas.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The small community of Be’eri in southern Israel near the Gaza border in November 2023, after the community was attacked by Hamas militants in October that year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Yaniv Hegyi, who survived <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/22/world/europe/beeri-massacre.html" title="">the Hamas-led attack on the Israeli community of Be’eri</a> on Oct. 7, 2023, said he was watching the announcement of an imminent cease-fire with painfully mixed feelings.</p><p>At least three Be’eri residents who were abducted during the assault are still being held in Gaza. “Watching them come home would be a moment of real joy,” said Mr. Hegyi, who supports the deal. “We’re hoping for that.”</p><div><p>But the provisional cease-fire also underscored the fact that Hamas mostly remained in power in Gaza for now, despite 15 months of Israeli efforts to uproot the group by force, said Mr. Hegyi.</p><p>“I’m hoping for a cease-fire, but I know we’ll eventually go back to fighting,” he said.</p><p>Roughly 100 people were killed in Be’eri during the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, according to the Israeli authorities. The loss constituted almost one in every 10 people who lived in Be’eri, a small collective kibbutz just east of the border with Gaza.</p><p>Another village in southern Israel close to the border that was overrun by Hamas militants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/06/world/israel-hamas-october-7-gaza-war/mourners-gather-in-nir-oz-an-emblem-of-israels-security-failures?" title="">was Nir Oz</a>. More than 50 people were killed and 70 others taken hostage from Nir Oz on that day, including Sagui Dekel-Chen, an Israeli-American.</p><p>Jonathan Dekel-Chen, Sagui’s father, said he would feel relief only when his son and the other hostages in Gaza returned to Israel. Sagui, 36, is a father of three daughters, including one whom he hasn’t met.</p><p>“We’ve had too many disappointments, too many additional horrors over the course of these last 15 months,” Jonathan Dekel-Chen said. “So we are just taking this day by day.”</p><p>The residents of Be’eri once hoped to return to their homes without fear of another attack like the Oct. 7, 2023, incursion. But many now have begun to accept that any truce would most likely only pause, not end, the conflict with Hamas, said Mr. Hegyi.</p><p>“If we return to Be’eri, we’ll still be living under air-raid sirens and rocket attacks,” lamented Mr. Hegyi. “I don’t see there being peace. In order for there to be peace, there must be new leadership in Gaza and Israel, as well as years of quiet and education for peace and mutual understanding.”</p><p>“What’s the chance of all that happening? Practically zero,” he added.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="66" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad0"><div id="ad-0" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="65" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2QxZWY2NmM5LWFhZTUtNTQ4Mi04YTgzLTgwMDBmMmM2YjBlZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/15/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire-deal-gaza#britain-france-cease-fire-reaction" data-source-id="100000009928948"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg"><img alt="Matthew Mpoke Bigg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/01/reader-center/author-matthew-bigg/author-matthew-bigg-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/01/reader-center/author-matthew-bigg/author-matthew-bigg-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/01/reader-center/author-matthew-bigg/author-matthew-bigg-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-15T22:59:23.428Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 15, 2025, 5:59 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg" itemprop="name">Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2QxZWY2NmM5LWFhZTUtNTQ4Mi04YTgzLTgwMDBmMmM2YjBlZg=="><a href="#britain-france-cease-fire-reaction">The leaders of Britain and France say the deal should be the basis for a long- term political settlement.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians celebrating in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, after news of a cease-fire deal on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Afif Amireh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The leaders of France and Britain said on Wednesday that the cease-fire deal would come as a relief for the hostages and their families, as well as for the people of Gaza.

During that time, Israeli airstrikes and fighting have laid waste to much of Gaza, tens of thousands of people have been reported killed, and a hunger crisis has worsened in the enclave.</p><p>The previous cease-fire ended at the start of December 2023. Since then, Israeli forces have invaded the cities of Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza, destroyed and re-invaded the north of Gaza to dismantle Hamas’s battalions and destroyed the group’s military infrastructure.</p><p>Agnès Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International, said the cease-fire was “bitterly overdue.”</p><p>For its part, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it hoped the deal would lead to a permanent end to what it called “this brutal Israeli war.”</p><p>António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, who has called for a cease-fire since the start of the conflict, commended the mediators, who have come from the United States, Egypt and Qatar. But he also said the priority was easing civilian suffering.</p><p>“It is imperative that this cease-fire removes the significant security and political obstacles to delivering aid across Gaza,” Mr. Guterres said in a statement.</p><p>Catherine Russell, the head of UNICEF, echoed that sentiment, noting that the conflict had caused immense suffering among children.</p><p>She said that 14,500 children had reportedly been killed, thousands more had been wounded, and an estimated 17,000 others had been left unaccompanied or separated from their parents. In addition, she said, nearly one million children had been displaced from their homes.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="64" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off"

Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>For President-elect Donald J. Trump, the Israeli-Gaza cease-fire deal was key for two reasons.</p><p>It removed one of the most vexing international conflicts that hovered over the start of his second term, and it gave Mr. Trump, who was known during his real-estate developer days in New York City as a “deals guy,” something to claim credit for as an early win — even if it happened before he took office.</p><div><p>In a posting on social media on Wednesday, Mr. Trump declared that the deal “only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November.”</p><p>The contours of the deal were not especially different than what President Biden had sought in May.

It’s still unclear how many of the 33 are alive, but Israeli officials have estimated that most are.</p><p>At the beginning of the first phase, Israel would have to move its forces east, and on the seventh day, Palestinians displaced in southern Gaza could begin to return to the northern part of the territory, according to the document.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in southern Gaza have been living in tents, makeshift shelters, rented homes and relatives’ apartments for more than a year. Many of those planning to return to the north will most likely find that their homes and neighborhoods have been destroyed, especially residents of Jabaliya, a town in northern Gaza.</p><p>The provisional deal says a minimum of 60,000 temporary homes and 200,000 tents would be brought into Gaza during the initial phase.</p><p>While the deal calls for 600 trucks to enter daily, United Nations officials have said that increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to that level will be challenging. Israeli restrictions, looting, a shortage of truck drivers and other factors have made it difficult to bring sufficient relief into Gaza, according to the officials. The current number of trucks entering Gaza daily is well below 600.</p><p>By the 16th day of the first phase, negotiations about the second phase of the deal — also lasting six weeks — would begin, especially details related to the further exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>During the second phase, Israel and Hamas would declare a “permanent cessation of hostilities,” Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the remaining living hostages would be traded for Palestinian prisoners, the deal says.</p><p>Hamas has long said that it would agree only to a deal that ends the war, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has rejected ending the conflict, indicating he may seek to resume fighting the group after freeing some hostages.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="41" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYmMyNDg2ZDktNDNjYy01MzFiLTg0N2MtZDgxOGJlZDJlMWZh"><div id="bc2486d9-43cc-531b-847c-d818bed2e1fa" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/15/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire-deal-gaza#bc2486d9-43cc-531b-847c-d818bed2e1fa"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Abu Bakr Bashir" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-15T20:23:55.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 15, 2025, 3:23 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><p><span itemprop="name">Abu Bakr Bashir</span></p></div></div></div><p>“I wish I could say I am happy,” said Fadia Nassar, a 43-year-old from northern Gaza displaced to the southern city of Khan Younis. “My heart is broken.” Her house was destroyed, and if she feels secure enough to go back north, she will be homeless. “I will probably stay in a tent;

The captives were taken when Hamas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/22/world/europe/beeri-massacre.html" title="">raided Israel on Oct. 7, 2023</a>, the first of 466 days of war.</p><p>But the ambiguity of the deal, drafts of which were reviewed by The Times, also means lingering uncertainty and the possibility of renewed conflict within weeks. To persuade both sides to sign on, mediators forged an arrangement that is worded so loosely that some of its components remain unresolved, meaning that it could easily collapse.</p><p>In the first six weeks of the deal, Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages in exchange for several hundred Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israel is also meant to gradually withdraw its troops eastward, allowing for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return home.</p><p>For the six-week arrangement to become permanent, the sides still need to resolve certain issues, including the terms by which Hamas will release the roughly 65 other hostages, some of whom are believed to be dead, in its custody.</p><p>Should those talks break down, the war could continue after a 42-day truce, if not earlier.</p><p>That means the coming weeks will remain fraught for the families of the Israeli hostages who will likely not be released in the deal’s first phase. Gazans will live with the possibility that Israel’s strikes could continue.</p><p>This uncertainty also presents potential peril for both Hamas and Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister.</p><p>If war resumes, a severely weakened Hamas might finally lose its grip on Gaza. If the deal becomes permanent, Hamas would survive the war — a symbolic victory for a group that at one point seemed close to ceding its 17-year rule over the territory.</p><p>But such an outcome could prove damaging to Mr. Netanyahu, whose far-right coalition partners have threatened to leave his coalition if Hamas survives, destabilizing and potentially collapsing his government.</p><p>For months, Mr. Netanyahu has avoided an arrangement that would risk such a threat to his power. The ambiguity of the deal is partly the result of his need to present it as only a temporary arrangement.</p><p>The coming weeks could help clarify whether the prime minister feels politically strong enough to face down his coalition partners. Even if he does, other shoals await: The end of the war will likely lead to a national inquiry about Israel’s security failures on Oct. 7, 2023, possibly leading to revelations that could damage Mr. Netanyahu as well as his security chiefs.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="39" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad6"><div id="ad-6" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid7">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="38" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzNkNmUxNTZkLTg4OGQtNTk4Zi04ZmU5LTA2ZTM5MmNjOWI5MQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/15/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire-deal-gaza#ceasefire-netanyahu-israel" data-source-id="100000009928539"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner"><img alt="Isabel Kershner" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/12/multimedia/author-isabel-kershner/author-isabel-kershner-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/12/multimedia/author-isabel-kershner/author-isabel-kershner-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/12/multimedia/author-isabel-kershner/author-isabel-kershner-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-15T20:20:46.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 15, 2025, 3:20 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner" itemprop="name">Isabel Kershner</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Jerusalem</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzNkNmUxNTZkLTg4OGQtNTk4Zi04ZmU5LTA2ZTM5MmNjOWI5MQ=="><a href="#ceasefire-netanyahu-israel">The deal has exposed fissures in Netanyahu’s right-wing government.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israelis around a sign reading “Everyone returning” at a demonstration on Wednesday in Tel Aviv calling for the release of all the hostages.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Two days before Israel and Hamas reached a long-awaited cease-fire and hostage-release deal, Itamar Ben-Gvir, a rebellious far-right Israeli minister, issued <a href="https://x.com/itamarbengvir/status/1879075942015893956" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video statement</a> calling on another far-right coalition partner to join forces and scupper the agreement by quitting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.</p><p>Mr. Ben-Gvir also asserted that these far-right coalition parties had used their political leverage to thwart a similar deal “time after time” over the past year, causing an uproar.</p><div><p>Critics of Mr. Netanyahu’s government, including many of the families of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, have repeatedly accused the prime minister of sabotaging past efforts to reach a deal in order to preserve his coalition — the most right-wing and religiously conservative in Israel’s history — and remain in power.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu and his loyalists have blamed Hamas for past failures to reach a deal. The current agreement was expected to gain government approval even without the support of the two far-right parties, since a majority of cabinet members are in favor of it.</p><p>But the fracas caused by Mr. Ben Gvir’s comments underscored the resurgent fissures in Israeli politics and society following the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which prompted the war, and the widening fault lines within the Israeli government.</p><p>Another far-right cabinet member, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, called the agreement “bad and dangerous to Israel’s national security” and said he absolutely opposed it. But he did not explicitly threaten to leave the government.</p><p>Describing the emerging deal as an Israeli “surrender” to Hamas, Mr. Ben-Gvir played on Israeli emotions in his statement, saying that the terms of the agreement would erase the achievements of the war in Gaza that were gained with the blood of Israeli soldiers.</p><p>But the narrative being broadcast by Mr. Netanyahu and his aides says the opposite.</p><p>An Israeli government official contradicted Mr. Ben-Gvir’s assertions this week, saying Hamas had only put on a façade of negotiating in the past rounds of talks and had engaged seriously this time largely because of Israel’s military achievements.</p><p>Speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the emerging deal, which was negotiated in secret, the official said conditions for it were created by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/how-yahya-sinwar-killed.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">killing by Israeli forces of Yahya Sinwar</a>, the Hamas leader in Gaza, in October and the increasing isolation of Hamas as Israel began in recent months to dismantle the axis of Iranian-backed proxies around its borders, including Hezbollah, Hamas’s ally in Lebanon.</p><p>The official pointed to increasing pressure on Hamas from the suffering Palestinian population in Gaza with the onset of another winter.</p><p>He also acknowledged the pressure to achieve a deal from the United States.

Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Saturday to pressure him on a cease-fire deal in Gaza, there was someone on the speakerphone: Brett H. McGurk, President Biden’s longtime Mideast negotiator.</p><p>It was a vivid example of cooperation between two men representing bitter political rivals whose relationship has been best described as poisonous. Rarely if ever have teams of current and new presidents of different parties worked together at such a high-stakes moment, with the fate of American lives and the future of a devastating war hanging in the balance.</p><div><p>Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden publicly claimed credit for the breakthrough.</p><p>“This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,” Mr. Trump wrote on his social media site even before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/15/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire-deal-gaza" title="">the deal was formally announced</a> in the Middle East.</p><p>At the White House, Mr. Biden told reporters that his administration had worked tirelessly for months to convince the two sides to halt the fighting. He called it “one of the toughest negotiations I’ve ever experienced” and gave credit to “an extraordinary team of American diplomats who have worked nonstop for months to get this done.”</p><p>As he left the room, a reporter asked Mr. Biden, “Who gets credit for this, Mr. President, you or Trump?” Mr. Biden stopped, turned around and smiled.</p><p>“Is that a joke?” he asked.</p><p>But despite the tension between the current president and the next one, their representatives in the Middle East described a cooperative working relationship in the weeks since Election Day.</p><p>“Brett is in the lead,” Mr. Witkoff said last week at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s club in Florida, describing the working relationship. That description was accurate by all accounts, even if it did not match what Mr. Trump had said moments before in one of several statements describing his negotiators as critical players.</p><p>In fact, Mr. Trump’s threat that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/politics/trump-hostages-hamas.html" title="">“all hell” would break loose</a> if no deal was reached before his inauguration on Monday might have helped motivate Hamas’s leadership to make final decisions. But people familiar with the negotiations said the announcement on Wednesday of a deal to temporarily end hostilities in Gaza was the result of months of work by Mr. McGurk in the Middle East, capped off by several weeks of carefully coordinated efforts by Mr. Witkoff.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff, 67, a blunt real estate investor from the Bronx, has largely planted himself in Qatar for the negotiations, knowing that whatever Mr. McGurk negotiated, he would have to execute. In fact, the 33 hostages who will be released under the cease-fire deal may not see freedom until Inauguration Day or after. The cease-fire would expire six weeks later, unless Phase 2 of the agreement kicks in.</p><p>By design, the goal was to send a unified message that the fighting must end and the hostages held by Hamas must be released. One person familiar with the negotiations, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the discussions, said Mr. McGurk was more involved in hammering out details of the agreement, while Mr. Witkoff’s role was to make clear that Mr. Trump wanted a deal by the time he is inaugurated.</p><p>The president-elect has also been setting some early parameters in his dealings with Mr. Netanyahu — who, for all his support of Mr. Trump in the election, was perceived by the Trump camp as dragging his feet on a deal. Mr. Witkoff flew to to Israel from Doha on Saturday — despite the Sabbath — to underscore the message that Mr. Netanyahu had to get on board.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff’s work, including the meeting with Mr. Netanyahu, helped Mr. McGurk and the Biden administration to put pressure on both sides during the negotiation, according to the person familiar with the talks.</p><p>It was not at all clear that such an arrangement would work in the days immediately after Mr. Trump won a second term.</p><p>He and Mr. Biden have barely talked in recent weeks, their already acrimonious relationship weighed down by the Trump team’s determination to clean out the White House career staff and the Biden team issuing last-minute orders to box in the new administration.</p><p>In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Biden acknowledged some level of cooperation and respect between their aides.</p><p>“This deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented for the most part by the next administration,” Mr. Biden told reporters. “In these past few days, we’ve been speaking as one team.”</p><p>But he did not give any more credit to Mr. Trump for helping the effort. For his part, the president-elect said he was “thrilled” that the American hostages would be released, but he did not mention Mr. Biden or the work of the current administration.</p><p>“We have achieved so much without even being in the White House,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Just imagine all of the wonderful things that will happen when I return to the White House, and my Administration is fully confirmed, so they can secure more Victories for the United States!”</p><p>Both leaders left it to staff members to describe the way they had worked together on the Gaza negotiations.</p><p>A person familiar with that effort said a close partnership between Mr. McGurk and Mr. Witkoff was part of an “incredibly effective” process by which the Biden administration finalized a deal that the Trump administration would have to oversee.</p><p>That cooperation began soon after Mr. Trump won the election and named Mr. Witkoff to be his envoy to the region. Biden administration officials have said they believe the momentum for a deal began before that, when Mr. Biden helped broker a separate agreement to end fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. That isolated Hamas and helped persuade the group that a cease-fire was in its interests, according to Biden officials.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="35" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad7"><div id="ad-7" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid8">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="34" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOTVhZDA5YjUtN2I2OS01ZDliLTk3MzEtNWNjYWQzYzdhN2Qw"><div id="95ad09b5-7b69-5d9b-9731-5ccad3c7a7d0" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/15/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire-deal-gaza#95ad09b5-7b69-5d9b-9731-5ccad3c7a7d0"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon"><img alt="Adam Rasgon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-15T19:52:51.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 15, 2025, 2:52 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon" itemprop="name">Adam Rasgon</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Jerusalem</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In a speech, Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas’s top negotiator, thanked Hezbollah and the Houthis, Iran-backed militant groups that attacked Israel in solidarity with Hamas during the war in Gaza.</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Khalil Hamra/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="33" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMjMzYjcxOGYtMjJhMy01N2NkLWE5ZWItMmNmYjkyMjc1ZWE0"><div id="233b718f-22a3-57cd-a9eb-2cfb92275ea4" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/15/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire-deal-gaza#233b718f-22a3-57cd-a9eb-2cfb92275ea4"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ismaeel-naar"><img alt="Ismaeel Naar" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-15T19:51:14.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 15, 2025, 2:51 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ismaeel-naar" itemprop="name">Ismaeel Naar</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>The United Arab Emirates welcomed the announcement of a cease-fire agreement in Gaza in a statement from the country’s foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed.

In September, a spokesman for the Israeli military put the number at more than 17,000, including a number of senior commanders.</p><p>Hamas’s ability to mount sustained and coordinated operations has also been greatly reduced, the analysts say. Israel has destroyed large quantities of Hamas’s military hardware and disabled many of the tunnels it used to transport and store material.</p><p>Israel also seized a strip of land that runs along Gaza’s southern border in May, depriving Hamas of a conduit to funnel military supplies and personnel into the enclave from Egypt.</p><p>Hamas has lost many of its senior leaders. Israeli forces killed the commander of Hamas’s military wing, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/muhammad-deif-hamas-death.html" title="">Muhammad Deif</a>, in July; another top leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-dead.html" title="">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, later that month; and the group’s leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/yahya-sinwar-dead.html" title="">Yahya Sinwar</a>, in October. Mr. Sinwar had emerged from two decades in Israeli prisons to help plot the Oct. 7 attack.</p><p>“Israel worked on the ground for 15 months with a massive force and managed to destroy much of what Hamas had there,” said Ahron Bregman, a former Israeli military officer who is now a political scientist and expert in Middle East security issues at King’s College London.</p><p>But he added that Hamas might still have reason to congratulate itself. “Israel has turned Gaza into dust but Hamas is still standing and they have not raised the white flag,” he said.</p><p>The Iran-backed regional proxy network that has helped sustain Hamas has also been decimated.</p><p>Israel stepped up its assault on the Lebanese militia Hezbollah starting in September, relentlessly targeting the group’s personnel and infrastructure through airstrikes and killing its leader Hassan Nasrallah in September. That month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/hezbollah-pager-explosions-lebanon.html" title="">hundreds of pagers belonging to Hezbollah members exploded</a>, killing or maiming many of the group’s operatives — as well as civilians.</p><p>Days later, Israel launched an invasion of southern Lebanon.The invasion ended with a cease-fire in November under which Hezbollah agreed to stop its missile and drone attacks on Israel, which it had started in solidarity with Hamas.</p><p>Last month, rebels toppled Syria’s longtime leader Bashar al-Assad, who had been a key element in Iran’s so-called axis of resistance, eliminating Tehran’s main conduit to funnel arms to Hezbollah.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1"
