    <h1>President Trump’s Tariff Plans</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Today is, in President Trump’s telling, “Liberation Day.” For decades, many countries have imposed higher trade barriers on the United States than America does on them. In a Rose Garden event, Trump plans to strike back with tariffs that he claims will be “reciprocal” — ones that merely counter the penalties of other nations.</p><p>The logic is intuitive: Why shouldn’t we impose tariffs on countries that have imposed tariffs on us? Europe’s tax on U.S. cars, for instance, has been four times as high as America’s tax on European vehicles. That doesn’t seem fair.</p><p>Past presidents asked the same question — and came to a different conclusion than Trump did. They saw such tariffs as self-harm. That’s because America would lose more in a global trade war than every major economy except Mexico, experts estimate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: O.E.C.D. Economic Outlook | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Today’s newsletter explains how tariffs can hurt the U.S. economy — and why Trump believes they are worth it anyway.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-4505cc84">Tariffs’ harms</h2><p>Consider how America has benefited from freer trade. Yes, it meant cheaper shirts, cars and phones. But it also allowed the country to play to its more profitable strengths.</p><p>The United States no longer needs factories with low-skill workers to make clothes. It can instead invest more in advanced technologies like computers and pharmaceuticals. Those investments lead to jobs that pay better than traditional manufacturing work, making Americans richer.</p><p>Open trade then lets high-tech businesses sell their new products to billions of people worldwide instead of just hundreds of millions of Americans. With more customers, these companies make more money, and they can pour their profits into further innovation, well-paying jobs and higher taxes to the U.S. government. In theory, this process leaves the country as a whole better off.</p><p>Not everyone wins. Some manufacturing jobs go to China, Mexico and elsewhere. Communities that rely on those jobs suffer unless they find a way to adjust to the new economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But using trade barriers to keep those old jobs is costly: First, it means higher prices. Second, a closed-off United States needs to pay for factories that make clothes, for instance, meaning it can invest less in those newer, better-paying jobs in advanced technology. The economy becomes less efficient and fails to reach its potential.</p><p>Trump’s style also comes with costs. He has imposed and rescinded levies on a whim, making his moves unpredictable. Even now, no one outside the administration knows what Trump’s reciprocal tariffs will look like. Markets loathe such unpredictability. Businesses want to know what’s coming so they don’t waste money investing in the wrong things. They can’t do that if materials they depend on can become 25 percent more expensive with little warning.</p><h2 id="link-33eb45ce">Trump’s view</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Trump and his allies argue that they take a long view. Yes, they say, tariffs lead to chaos in the short term. But they will eventually bring back manufacturing jobs that people in some communities relied on. Yes, they say, consumers and businesses will pay higher prices. But those higher prices are worth the long-term benefits of self-sufficiency and more jobs. Yes, they say, the federal government will have to subsidize businesses that are vulnerable to a trade war (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/farmers-bailouts-trump-tariffs.html" title="">including farms</a>). But tariffs will bring in more revenue than the subsidies cost.</p><p>And the tariffs may not last long, anyway, if other countries repeal their own trade barriers against America, after which the United States can unwind its reciprocal levies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Most economists disagree with Trump’s claims. To the extent that he’s right, his goals will require something he has not demonstrated so far: commitment. Businesses will invest in domestic manufacturing only if they think they have no other option because the tariffs will stick. Other nations will withdraw their tariffs only if they think doing so is necessary to regain American customers.</p><p>Because Trump rescinded some of his previous tariffs after markets recoiled, businesses and other countries have good reason to believe that today’s tariff rollout is a feint. They may try to call Trump’s bluff. What happens next depends on whether he folds.</p><h2 id="link-6a69fb92">More on tariffs</h2><ul><li><p>Auto sales <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/business/auto-sales-trump-tariffs.html" title="">surged last month</a> as buyers rushed to get ahead of Trump’s tariffs on imported cars and parts.</p></li><li><p>Looking for the basics on the tariff plan? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">This article explains what you need to know</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-348e9e18">Election results</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Susan Crawford </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Elon Musk’s millions weren’t enough.
