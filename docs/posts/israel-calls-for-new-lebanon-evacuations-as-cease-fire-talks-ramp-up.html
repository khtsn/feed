It has significantly escalated in recent weeks and triggered a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon. Nearly 3,200 people have been killed, and more than a fifth of the Lebanese population has been displaced.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A funeral for Lebanese emergency workers affiliated with Hezbollah in the Lebanese coastal city of Tyre, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kawnat Haju/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Israel’s new foreign minister, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/world/middleeast/gideon-saar-israel-foreign-minister.html" title="">Gideon Saar</a>, signaled on Monday that renewed U.S.-brokered diplomatic efforts were underway to stem the conflict.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“There is progress,” said Mr. Saar, speaking at a news conference. “The main challenge eventually will be to enforce what will be agreed.”</p><p>The head of Hezbollah’s media office, Mohammed Afif, said on Monday that the group had not yet received any proposals on a cease-fire deal in Lebanon, but that there had been “contacts between Washington, Moscow, Tehran and other capitals” on the issue since the election of former President Donald J.
