The bombs were meant to hit a range several miles from the village, but at least one of the South Korean pilots had entered inaccurate coordinates, the military said.</p><p>Two of the injured people were seriously wounded, said officials in Pocheon, a town that includes the village of Nogok, where the bombs fell. Local news outlets said none of the victims were in critical condition.</p><p>The military said it was suspending all live-fire drills while an investigation was carried out. The exercise Thursday was connected to annual joint exercises, known as Freedom Shield, that the South Korean and U.S. military carry out every year, and which are set to officially begin on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There was no immediate comment from the United States military.</p><p>A woman in Nogok who runs a shop in her home said she was there when an “earthquake-like” explosion rattled the village, breaking windows in her house and in neighbors’ houses. Her home was 700 feet from the spot where the most serious damage was reported.</p><p>Photos carried by local news outlets showed a house in the village with parts of its walls and tiled roof blown away. They also showed damage to a Catholic church, and torn branches from pine trees strewn around.</p><p>The South Korean Air Force did not say how many of the eight bombs dropped had hit Nogok, which is about 20 miles from the heavily fortified North Korean border. It issued an apology and promised compensation for the victims.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Korean Air Force F-15K fighter jets firing flare shells during a joint U.S.-South Korean military drill in Pocheon on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yonhap, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Thursday, the South Korean and United States militaries said that this year’s Freedom Shield exercises would begin on Monday and run for 11 days.

The allies conduct several joint military exercises each year, calling them defensive in nature.

She indicated that North Korea might resume testing nuclear-capable weapons.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
