    <h1>CBS Says Trump Will Not Participate in ‘60 Minutes’ Interview</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Trump spokesman, Steven Cheung, pushed back on the network’s characterization of events.</p><p>“‘60 Minutes’ begged for an interview,” Mr. Cheung wrote in <a href="https://x.com/TheStevenCheung/status/1841242913302327506" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post on X</a>. “There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in.”</p><p>“60 Minutes” typically runs interviews with both major-party candidates in the weeks before a presidential election. According to CBS, Mr. Trump’s campaign had been the first to accept its invitation; each candidate was to receive two segments during the one-hour broadcast.</p><p>Mr. Pelley is expected to address the matter with viewers on Monday.</p><p>This is not the first time that Mr. Trump has clashed with “60 Minutes,” which is the country’s most popular television news program.</p><p>In 2020, Mr. Trump’s campaign abruptly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/trump-lesley-stahl-60-minutes.html" title="">cut short</a> an interview with the correspondent Lesley Stahl, complaining that she was “negative,” and later taunted her on Twitter. Mr. Trump also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/business/media/trump-pence-lesley-stahl-60-minutes.html" title="">posted online unfiltered footage</a> from the interview, during which he had become increasingly irritated with Ms. Stahl’s questions about his handling of the pandemic and other subjects.</p><p>For Monday’s episode, Ms. Harris will be interviewed by the “60 Minutes” correspondent Bill Whitaker.</p></div></div>
