German P-8 planes — which can detect and destroy submarines — will operate from an air base in Scotland.</p><p>John Healey, Britain’s defense secretary, described the deal as “a milestone moment in our relationship with Germany” and said it would bolster European security.</p><p>Ahead of a signing ceremony in London on Wednesday, Boris Pistorius, Germany’s defense minister, said in a statement that the countries could not afford to “take security in Europe for granted. Russia is waging war against Ukraine, it is increasing its weapons production immensely and has repeatedly launched hybrid attacks on our partners in Eastern Europe.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Both countries say that their deal will strengthen the European component of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/world/europe/nato-ukraine-sweden.html" title="">NATO</a>, the mutual defense alliance of which they are members. It comes at a time of growing nervousness in European capitals about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/09/us/politics/trump-2025-nato.html" title="">security implications</a> of a possible victory for Donald J. Trump in next month’s U.S. presidential election — particularly with regard to continuing America’s support for Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Trump alarmed Western allies in February by saying that he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/10/us/politics/trump-nato-russia.html" title="">encourage Russia</a> “to do whatever the hell they want” to NATO countries that didn’t pay enough into the alliance, comments that threatened to undermine the collective defense clause under which all NATO members agreed to regard an attack on one as an attack on all.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The U.S. Navy’s P-8 Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance plane over the South China Sea last year.

That is what we are doing by expanding that cooperation.”</p><p>The British government, which struck a defense deal with France in 2010, said in a statement that the new pact with Germany “will complete a triangle of agreements” between Europe’s most capable armed forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It’s a good thing to be doing,” said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College London, but “it’s not an answer to Europe’s security problems in and of itself.” He noted that obstacles remained to coordination among Western allies within NATO, and some member states had not done enough to increase their military spending.</p><p>Britain, which is no longer a member of the European Union, is not part of that bloc’s efforts to integrate its defense industrial base either, creating another impediment to collaboration on weaponry, Professor Menon said.</p><p>“If we wanted to prepare ourselves for a second Donald Trump presidency we should probably have started doing so around the time that the first one started,” he added.</p><p>The symbolism of a pact between two nations that fought two bloody global conflicts in the 20th century is also meant to underscore a determination to respond to Russian aggression.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The government said the deal will give Ukraine a new offensive capability by enabling German Sea King helicopters to be armed with modern missile systems. Britain will also increase support for German and Polish-led efforts to supply armored vehicles to Ukraine, while Germany will support Britain and Latvia in providing drones.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An MK41 Sea King helicopter landing on a frigate in Rostock, Germany, last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Clemens Bilan/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>After Russia’s attack on Ukraine, Germany embarked on a policy known as Zeitenwende, or turning point, designed to build up its defense capabilities and take a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/world/europe/germany-russia.html" title="">tougher approach to Russia</a>.</p><p>Britain’s relations with its European allies came under acute strain during the bitter disputes that followed Brexit but, since winning a general election in July, Keir Starmer, the new Labour prime minister, has worked hard to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/world/europe/keir-starmer-britain-germany-brexit.html" title="">improve ties</a>.</p><p>In addition to the pact with Germany, Britain wants to negotiate a new security agreement with the European Union — something the 27-nation bloc had pressed for unsuccessfully during the Brexit negotiations.</p><p>Under the so-called Trinity House Agreement — named for the London location where a signing ceremony is set to take place on Wednesday — Britain and Germany will aim to work together to develop new deep-strike weapons that can travel farther with more precision than current systems, including Storm Shadow.</p><p>British officials say that the plan paves the way for a new artillery gun barrel factory to be opened in Britain and for the two countries to work on developing new drones.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephen-castle">More about Stephen Castle</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
