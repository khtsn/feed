Just after 6 a.m., the military said the strikes had concluded.</p><div><p>Iranian officials appeared to downplay the impact of the attack, which the military said had killed two soldiers. Iran’s national air defense force said that Israel had attacked military bases in three provinces — Tehran and two near the Iraqi border, Ilam and Khuzestan. Iranian air defenses were able limit the damage, the statement said, but it was continuing to assess.</p><p>Three news agencies run by different branches of the Iranian authorities said that the city of Tehran itself had not been hit and that civilian airports were operating normally. The blasts were close enough to the Iranian capital for them to be seen and heard by residents, bringing close to home a war that had felt remote for many.</p><p>On Saturday, Israeli officials said that more than 100 combat aircraft, including fighter jets and unmanned drones, hit roughly 20 sites in Iran, Syria and Iraq. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the military operation, said that Israel targeted air defense systems and long-range missile production sites in Iran.</p><p>The Israeli strikes came 25 days after Iran fired waves of ballistic missiles at Israel in response to the assassinations of several officials of Iran and its allies. While Israeli air defenses intercepted many of the Iranian missiles, the attack forced millions of Israelis to take cover in bomb shelters, damaged several homes and air bases and killed a Palestinian in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p><p>For years, Israel and Iran have fought a clandestine war in which both sides targeted each other’s interests and allies, while rarely taking responsibility for their attacks. That turned into open confrontation, as the war between Israel and Hamas, Iran’s ally in Gaza, pulled the two countries toward a direct clash.</p><p>After the Hamas-led attack in Israel a year ago unleashed Israel’s devastating war in Gaza, Iran’s other proxies in Middle East, including Hezbollah, began striking Israel in solidarity with their Palestinian ally. Israel, in turn, scaled up its attacks on Iranian interests around the region, with both sides responding in force as tensions flared at various moments.</p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rising tensions: </strong>The conflict between the two nations spilled into the open in April after<strong> </strong>an Israeli strike killed several senior Iranian commanders in Syria; later that month, Iran fired a barrage of ballistic missiles at Israel, prompting Israel to attack an Iranian military base. Tensions mounted again this summer when Israel killed Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, during a visit to Iran. Israel also assassinated several leaders of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia that had been attacking Israel across its northern border.</p></li><li><p><strong>Soldier deaths:</strong> The two Iranian soldiers killed in Saturday’s attack had been working in air defense, Iran’s army said in a statement.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>United States informed: </strong>The Pentagon said that Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister, to receive updates on the strikes in Iran. Sean Savett, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said after the attack began that the United States had been informed of Israel’s plans.</p></li><li><p><strong>Warning from Israel:</strong> The Israeli military warned Iran against further escalation, saying in a statement that it would be “obligated to respond.” Daniel Hagari, a military spokesman, said in a news conference that there were no immediate changes to the government’s civil defense orders to the public, indicating that authorities were not anticipating an attack.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strikes in Gaza:</strong> Israel’s retaliation against Iran followed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/25/world/israel-lebanon-gaza-iran/israeli-attacks-kill-dozens-in-southern-gaza-health-officials-say?smid=url-share" title="">a series of strikes in Gaza</a> on Friday that left dozens dead, according to officials from the Gaza health ministry and the World Health Organization.

According to two officials, a second wave of jets targeted Iran’s long-range missile production sites; the attack was specifically aimed at destroying a critical component in the production process.</p><p>The strikes avoided energy infrastructure like oil and gas production sites, the Israeli officials said.

It was also a rare attack by a foreign air force in Iran since its war with Iraq in the 1980s.</p><div><p>Although it was a significant moment, the attack did not immediately provoke an Iranian threat to retaliate, easing fears that two of the most powerful militaries in the Middle East were on the point of uncontrollable conflict.</p><p>“The years of shadow war have fully entered open conflict — albeit a managed conflict, for now,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a Berlin-based research group. “Tehran can swallow these strikes against militarily facilities, without retaliating in a way that invites further Israeli action,” she added.</p><p>After weeks of pressure from the United States to reduce the scope of its attack, Israel avoided striking sensitive nuclear enrichment sites and oil production facilities in retaliation for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah" title="">large barrage of ballistic missiles that Iran fired at Israel</a> early this month.</p><p>On Saturday, Israel’s fighter jets focused instead on roughly 20 military installations, including air defense batteries, radar stations and missile production sites, according to Israeli officials.</p><p>The comparatively contained focus of those attacks allowed Iranian institutions to project a sense of normality on Saturday morning. The aviation authority reopened Iran’s airspace, and the state-run news agencies broadcast images and footage of life returning to normal — all signs, analysts said, that Iran’s leadership was trying to play down the significance of Israel’s attack and reduce domestic expectations of a major Iranian response.</p><p>“This is the beginning of a new phase, a dangerous one, with many more sensitivities,” said Yoel Guzansky, an Israeli expert on Iran at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv-based research group. “But the music that I hear from Iran is basically saying, ‘Oh, this is nothing.’”</p><p>As a result, he added, “It is possible for the two sides to close this round at least, and that we will not see an Iranian retaliation — or if we’ll see it, it will be small in scale.”</p><p>Still, analysts warned that even if the latest escalation ebbs, it has edged Iran and Israel further along a path toward an unmanageable conflict.</p><p>For years, the two countries fought a clandestine war in which each side undermined the other’s interests and provided support for the other’s opponents, while rarely taking responsibility for their own attacks. That covert conflict turned into open confrontation when war broke out last year between Israel and Hamas, Iran’s ally in Gaza.</p><p>After the Hamas-led attack in Israel last October unleashed Israel’s devastating war in Gaza, Iran’s other proxies in Middle East, including Hezbollah, began striking Israel in solidarity with their Palestinian ally. In turn, Israel scaled up its attacks on Iranian interests around the region, leading to direct exchanges between the two countries, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/14/world/middleeast/iran-israel-drones-attack.html" title="">first in April</a> and now in October.</p><p>Some analysts fear that Israel, though comparatively restrained on Saturday, was setting the stage for a bigger strike following the U.S. presidential election in early November. The vote will set in motion a transition of power during which Washington’s influence and focus on the Iran-Israel conflict will be diminished.</p><p>By damaging Iran’s air defenses and radar system, Israel has made it easier for its fighter jets to attack Iran in the future, a move that may either deter Tehran from responding forcefully, or embolden Israel to try further attacks, or both.</p><p>“There will be a sigh of relief across Iran and the region that the U.S. managed to restrain Netanyahu for now,” Ms. Geranmayeh said, referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. “But the fear is that this is a temporary restraint leading up to the U.S. elections. The ‘lame duck’ phase ahead could be a moment where we see renewed Israeli attacks inside Iran — as a perceived golden window to further deplete Iranian capabilities.”</p><p>Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> contributed reporting from Haifa, Israel.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvODMwNWY3NDctNGIzZi01ZmI2LTgwODktZGFkYmEyNGZhZGUz"><div id="8305f747-4b3f-5fb6-8089-dadba24fade3" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/26/world/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza#8305f747-4b3f-5fb6-8089-dadba24fade3"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Ismaeel Naar" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-26T08:55:32.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 26, 2024, 4:55 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><p><span itemprop="name">Ismaeel Naar</span></p></div></div></div><p>The United Arab Emirates condemned the “military targeting” of Iran, and said it was concerned about the continued escalation in the region. <a href="https://www.mofa.gov.ae/mediahub/news/2024/10/26/26-10-2024-iran" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The U.A.E. statement</a>, issued by its foreign ministry, did not mention Israel.</p></div><div><div id="" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url=""><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Rawan Sheikh Ahmad" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-26T09:08:08.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 26, 2024, 5:08 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><p><span itemprop="name">Rawan Sheikh Ahmad</span></p></div></div></div><p>Earlier, the government of Saudi Arabia also condemned the “military targeting” of Iran, saying the continued escalation threatened the stability of the region.

Aid and commercial supplies entering the enclave surged between May and August, followed by a sharp decline in September, they noted.</p><div><p>The Israeli agency responsible for coordinating aid to Gaza, known as COGAT, said Tuesday in a statement that nearly 480 aid trucks had entered the enclave in the week after Oct. 14, compared with 548 in the first two weeks of the month. While an increase, that was still short of the 350 aid trucks per day that the United States demanded be allowed to enter.</p><p>But getting aid into Gaza is only part of the battle, according to a U.N. official coordinating humanitarian assistance there for nearly a year. Those who pick up and distribute the desperately needed supplies then face bureaucracy, bombings, shootings, lawlessness and looting.</p><p>“COGAT is painting a picture of a massive volume of aid by articulating the number of trucks that reach the borders,” Georgios Petropoulos, who leads the Gaza office for OCHA, the United Nations agency for coordination of humanitarian affairs, said in an interview on Thursday. But while Israel tightly controls the aid that enters, humanitarian agencies must navigate a war-ravaged landscape, where criminality is rampant, without assistance and at huge risk, he contends.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A truck for the main United Nations agency for Palestinians after it was hit by an Israeli airstrike near Khan Younis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohammed Saber/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>COGAT has argued that its job is to get the aid to Gaza and that U.N. agencies are failing to distribute supplies inside the enclave. On Monday, <a href="https://x.com/cogatonline/status/1848372463757042027" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COGAT wrote on social media</a> that “600 trucks’ worth of aid” were “waiting to be picked up and distributed, the majority by U.N. aid agencies.” It said it had taken “many measures” to assist with collection.</p><p>COGAT has made this accusation repeatedly during the war. In June, in a post directed at the United Nations’ World Food Program, the Israeli agency <a href="https://twitter.com/cogatonline/status/1805707691433803907" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">displayed a photo</a> of supplies that it said were waiting at an offloading area. “Stop making excuses and start playing your role as a humanitarian food organization and the head of the logistic cluster,” it said.</p><p>Mr. Petropoulos said that the Israeli authorities create a range of administrative obstacles and limits that prevent assistance pickups and distribution.</p><p>The Israeli authorities, for example, commonly deny aid efforts in the enclave. OCHA’s recent <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-231-gaza-strip" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">update on the humanitarian situation</a> in Gaza reports that access for aid missions “remains severely restricted,” especially in the north and center. In the first three weeks of October, out of nearly 450 planned aid movements across Gaza that required coordination with the Israeli military, the military facilitated 36 percent and denied 45 percent, while the rest were impeded or canceled, OCHA said.</p><p>U.N. agencies are also facing their own infrastructure and supply constraints, in part because of military activity that has damaged warehouses, vehicles and roads, according to Mr. Petropoulos. “We never have enough cars or trucks. Our vehicles get destroyed,” he said. “We are being vilified for logistics capacity when we’re being bombed.”</p><p>In June, the World Food Program partly paused operations in Gaza after it said two of its warehouse complexes were <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cindy-mccain-world-food-programme-executive-director-face-the-nation-transcript-06-09-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hit by rockets</a>. In August, it briefly suspended staff movements after it said that Israeli <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-temporarily-suspend-staff-movement-across-gaza-following-security-incident-targeted-wfp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forces shot at its team</a> in armored vehicles returning from a mission escorting a convoy of trucks with humanitarian cargo.</p><p>Humanitarian escorts like the ones that drew fire are essential because looting and lawlessness abound in Gaza, Mr. Petropoulos said. Notably, most of the aid reaches the southern crossing, forcing aid convoys to travel a notoriously perilous route known as “looters’ alley.”</p><p>Truck drivers who have to travel the treacherous route are often swarmed by organized criminal groups and robbed of their aid, Mr. Petropoulos said.</p><p>Some U.N. agencies in June <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/aid-trucks-pile-up-inside-gaza-despite-pause-in-fighting-ccbb46e4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended aid pickups</a>, even amid a humanitarian pause in fighting, saying the looting in Gaza was endangering their staff. Trucks get raided not just for food and critical supplies but also by looters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-cigarette-smuggling.html" title="">in search of contraband</a>, like cigarettes.</p><p>Ultimately, about 30 percent of the aid that enters Gaza ends up looted en route, Mr. Petropoulos said. This not only means less humanitarian assistance reaches people in critical need, but it also further warps an extremely distorted local economy, where there are severe spikes in the prices for basic, necessary items.</p><p>Still, he said, “I don’t see an interest from Israel to stamp out looting or give us different routes.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzIwM2E2Y2FiLTVmYjMtNTAwNi1iY2Q1LTBkYjExZGQ1Yzk2NQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/26/world/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza#israel-gaza-jordan-ethnic-cleansing" data-source-id="100000009782971"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-crowley"><img alt="Michael Crowley" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nick-cumming-bruce"><img alt="Nick Cumming-Bruce" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-25T18:10:52.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 25, 2024, 2:10 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Antony J.

We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity.”</p><p>He reminded world leaders that the U.N. genocide convention imposes a binding obligation on states to act when there is a risk of such crimes being committed. “The international rule of law is being progressively dismantled,” Mr. Türk said. “Either the world ashamedly fails those who so desperately need help, or we stand united and put a stop to this.”</p><p>The Biden administration, Israel’s most important ally, has criticized Israel’s yearlong campaign in Gaza against Hamas, saying that while Israel was justified in retaliating for the Oct. 7, 2023, assault, the resulting destruction and casualties have been excessive. But it has not gone nearly as far as Mr. Türk, Mr. Safadi and others in condemning Israel’s conduct or demanding that it end.</p><p>“It’s getting worse, unfortunately, every time we meet,” Mr. Safadi said. “Not for lack of us trying, but because we do have an Israeli government that is not listening to anybody.”</p><p>The State Department said that Mr. Blinken had met with Mr. Safadi “to discuss ongoing efforts to de-escalate regional tensions.” They also talked about efforts to end the war in Gaza, to free the remaining hostages there and to get more food and medicine to the territory, it said.</p><p>Mr. Blinken was holding a day of meetings with Arab officials in London after his latest tour of the Middle East. He met with Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, to pursue a diplomatic solution to Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, a conflict entwined with the war in Gaza, as well as the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan.</p><p>Mr. Türk noted that Hamas and other armed groups were putting civilians in harm’s way by continuing to operate among areas such as shelters for the displaced, which he said was “totally unacceptable.” But his harshest words were aimed at Israel.</p><p>“The bombing in north Gaza is nonstop,” he said. “The Israeli military has ordered hundreds of thousands to move, with no guarantees of return. But there is no safe way to leave. The bombs continue to fall.”</p><p>The war has killed almost 43,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there. It has also destroyed much of the territory’s housing and other infrastructure and has forced most of its people to flee their homes.</p><p>Mr. Türk said the number of Palestinians reported killed, injured or missing in the war exceeds 150,000, a figure that the current Israeli offensive in northern Gaza could push dramatically higher.</p><p>“The Israeli military is striking hospitals, and staff and patients have been killed and injured or forced to evacuate simultaneously,” he said. “Shelters, once schools, are struck daily. Communication with the outside world remains extremely limited. Journalists continue to be killed.”</p><p>Mr. Türk said that Israel has allowed little aid to reach Gaza, and many Palestinians now face starvation.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
