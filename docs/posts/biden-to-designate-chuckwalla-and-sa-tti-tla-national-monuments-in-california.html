The other, in the woodlands north of Mount Shasta near the Oregon border, will be the Sáttítla National Monument.</p><p>The proclamation caps a flurry of final environmental proclamations that Mr. Biden has issued in his final days in office. On Monday, he banned future oil and gas drilling in more than 600 million acres of U.S. waters. Last week, the administration barred oil, gas and geothermal development in Nevada’s high alpine Ruby Mountain and also prevented mining and geothermal leasing in 20,000 acres of the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota.</p><p>With Tuesday’s announcement, Mr. Biden will have protected more than 674 million acres of public lands and federal waters, more than any president. In creating the Chuckwalla monument, the administration has effectively carved out a 600-mile wildlife corridor of protected lands along the Colorado River and into the deserts of California.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Biden has established 10 national monuments, expanded two others and restored three more. He used the Antiquities Act, a 1906 law that authorizes the president to protect lands and waters for the benefit of all Americans.</p><p>Elsewhere in California, he expanded the San Gabriel Mountains and Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monuments to protect land of cultural significance to Native American tribes, property that also serves as biodiversity and wildlife corridors.</p><p>Both Chuckwalla and the Sáttítla monuments were created at the request of lawmakers and tribal organizations.</p><p>“The stunning canyons and winding paths of the Chuckwalla National Monument represent a true unmatched beauty,” Deb Haaland, the interior secretary and the first Native American to hold the post, said in a statement. Mr. Biden’s designation “will protect important spiritual and cultural values tied to the land and wildlife,” she said.</p><p>About 750 miles to the north, the Sáttítla National Monument will encompass the Medicine Lake Highlands, which is considered the ancestral home for 11 bands of the Pit River Tribe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This landscape, which has been occupied by Indigenous peoples for more than 5,000 years, continues to be integral to tribal religious and cultural practices despite a history of forced dispossession,” said Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary. “Establishing this monument takes a step toward recognizing the history of exclusion of tribal nations on these lands.”</p><p>Many solar companies had wanted the land around the Chuckwalla monument for renewable energy development. Ultimately, the boundaries were drawn to avoid areas that would be suitable for clean energy and for the construction of electric transmission lines. That helped the designation win support from several renewable energy groups.</p><p>Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat of California, who sponsored legislation to create both sites, called the agreement for a transmission corridor “the biggest breakthrough” in months of negotiations. He said the Chuckwalla monument showed that protected lands could live side by side with clean energy.</p><p>“It’s not an either-or,” Mr. Padilla said. “We have plenty of locations, plenty of resource-rich regions of California that still have not been tapped to their fullest potential from a renewable energy standpoint. We also have very important areas of biodiversity that have to be protected as part of our climate goals.”</p><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump has said he intends to undo virtually all of Mr. Biden’s environmental policies, a move that could include an effort to roll back national monuments.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lisa Friedman is a Times reporter who writes about how governments are addressing climate change and the effects of those policies on communities.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lisa-friedman">More about Lisa Friedman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
