He mocked the way his predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., looked in a bathing suit and encouraged the crowd to cheer to indicate which demeaning nickname for him they preferred: “Sleepy Joe” or “Crooked Joe.”</p><p>“I miss the campaign,” Mr. Trump said at one point.</p><p>The speech had been billed as a way for the president to build momentum for his economic policies, which have been dragging him down politically. The area in which Mr. Trump spoke held signs that said “Buy American. Hire American.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>His expansive tariffs have hurt the stock market and contributed to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls.html" title="">drop in his approval rating</a>. A majority of Americans approved of Mr. Trump’s performance in office throughout January and February, but he is now struggling with what polls show is greater public disapproval.</p><p>Those in the crowd cheered Mr. Trump’s agenda, and attendees said they supported his efforts to use tariffs to try to bring back manufacturing jobs to areas like Detroit, the home of the U.S. auto industry. The city has lost one-third of its population since 2000.</p><p>Brian Pannebecker, a retired auto worker who backs Mr. Trump’s tariffs, spoke at the rally, declaring that “Macomb County is the home of the Reagan Democrats.” About 56 percent of the <a href="https://www.politico.com/2024-election/results/michigan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">county’s votes</a> in 2024 went for Mr. Trump.</p><p>Outside the venue, however, protesters gathered with signs saying, “I dissent.” Two protesters who made it into the rally were removed by security, and the president laughed after calling one by the wrong gender.</p><p>Much of the speech focused on Mr. Trump’s border crackdown, which has resulted in a sharp drop in crossings but also concerns about a lack of due process for those who’ve been arrested. Mr. Trump reveled in a cinematic video using drone footage that depicted men in military-style gear taking deported migrants into a prison in El Salvador as their heads were shaved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Since coming into power, the Trump administration has deployed an extensive public relations effort to promote its deportation policy. President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has assisted in the effort. Both administrations have posted sensational videos of the deportations on social media.</p><p>Mr. Trump exaggerated the extent of his crackdown during his speech, falsely claiming at one point that only three people had slipped by his border agents.</p><p>Mr. Trump also cast himself as a man of action, highlighting the rapid pace of his executive orders. He has <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed more than 130 executive orders this year</a>, nearly as many as Mr. Biden did throughout his term.</p><p>He seemed particularly proud of how he has wielded extraordinary executive power in slashing the federal work force of what he called “incompetent and unnecessary deep state bureaucrats.”</p><p>Fifty percent of voters in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-poll-approval.html" title="">recent New York Times/Siena College poll</a> said the upheaval Mr. Trump had brought to the nation’s political and economic systems was a “bad thing for the country.” Only 36 percent said the changes were good. And voters said he had “gone too far” on issue after issue: tariffs, immigration enforcement, cuts to the federal work force.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the rally, Mr. Trump showed little concern about his falling poll numbers, dismissing them as rigged.</p><p>The Democratic National Committee issued a statement responding to Mr. Trump’s rally. “While Donald Trump lives in his delusions, Michigan families — along with millions of working families across this country — are forced to live with the consequences of his dangerous, chaotic, and economy-destroying agenda,” said Ken Martin, the D.N.C. chairman.</p><p>Before the rally, Mr. Trump attended a bipartisan event at nearby Selfridge Air National Guard Base. There, he held to a more serious tone and announced an infusion of new resources, including 21 new fighter jets, seen as key to keeping the base open.</p><p>“This will keep Selfridge at the cutting edge of northern American air power,” Mr. Trump said.</p><p>At the event, Mr. Trump credited Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat who some criticized for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/whitmer-trump-michigan-selfridge.html" title="">her recent visit to the White House</a>, with pushing to save the base. Ms. Whitmer appeared onstage with the president.</p><p>“I’m really damn happy we’re here,” Ms. Whitmer said after the president’s announcement.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Luke Broadwater covers the White House for The Times.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump and Crypto: </strong>President Trump’s crypto firm has eviscerated the boundary between private enterprise and government policy in ways <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html">without precedent in modern American history</a>.
