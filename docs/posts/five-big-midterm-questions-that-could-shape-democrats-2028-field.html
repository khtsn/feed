That race will begin the moment the midterms are over, if not sooner, and the Democratic field is expected to be crowded, wide open and unpredictable.</p><p>Yet Republicans will be eager to tarnish promising presidential hopefuls early, and losses or underperformances could take the wind out of the sails of would-be candidates before they ever make it out of their home states.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As 2026 races take shape, here are five things we’re watching:</p><h2 id="link-402f28ff">Do blue-state Democrats run up the score?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

Wes Moore of Maryland and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and JB Pritzker of Illinois have not yet said whether they will seek third terms, but both are widely expected to do so.</p><p>As blue-state incumbents, they have more leeway to travel around the country campaigning for other candidates or fund-raising — and building national networks in the process.</p><p>“It’s crucial that we speak out on a national level,” Mr. Pritzker said in an interview. “If we don’t win federally, Illinois loses.”</p><p>Governors can also easily frame themselves as foils to President Trump’s Washington.</p><p>“I don’t just have to rail against the ‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/politics/trump-musk.html" title="">big, beautiful bill</a>’” pushed by Mr. Trump, Mr. Moore said. “I can show what an alternative looks like.”</p><p>But a closer-than-expected victory in some of these states — never mind an unexpected defeat — could alter the 2028 conversation, with Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/us/politics/wes-moore-tim-walz-south-carolina-democrats.html" title="">already weighing</a> questions of electability.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“If you lost your election bid, that would probably be not a great indicator,” Mr. Walz deadpanned, even as he suggested that the margins of victory wouldn’t matter much beyond the Beltway.</p><p>Re-election bids also mean there are longer records to scrutinize and, sometimes, rougher in-state politics to navigate.</p><p>In Maryland, one question is whether <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/us/politics/larry-hogan-wins-maryland-senate-primary.html" title="">Larry Hogan</a>, who was a popular Republican governor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/elections/maryland-senate-hogan-alsobrooks.html" title="">but lost</a> a Senate bid last year, will challenge Mr. Moore. But a person briefed on Mr. Hogan’s thinking, who insisted on anonymity, suggested that such a challenge was unlikely and said that the former governor had not yet taken steps to prepare for such a run.</p><h2 id="link-56691524">How close is Pennsylvania?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

Democrats have for years seen him as a possible White House contender.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>If a stronger Republican runs against him this time, his ability to fend off the challenge will be closely watched by Democrats beyond his state.</p><p>Mr. Shapiro, who has not yet announced a re-election bid, declined an interview. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/22/us/politics/democrats-religion-shapiro-warnock-buttigieg.html" title="">asked by The New York Times</a> in December about his re-election plans, he said: “I love what I’m doing.

Who is campaigning for Democrats in conservative areas — or in the traditional early-voting primary states?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>One increasingly prominent figure is Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, who is not up for re-election but will lead the Democratic Governors Association next year. </p><p>“If I do my job right, that paragraph that speculates on 2028 candidates will get a lot bigger,” he said in an interview, emphasizing his D.G.A. responsibilities. “I hope that we’ll win some races that will put people into that conversation, and I hope along the way, I can help in other types of races that may put people into that conversation.”</p><p>Asked if his name should be part of that 2028 presidential conversation, he didn’t hesitate.</p><p>“I was pretty sure that this was going to be my last political job,” he said. “But I don’t want to leave a broken country to my kids, so I’m going to be out there with my voice, making sure that the Democratic Party is talking about the core concerns of our American people.”</p><p>He suggested that he would assess in the future “whether I’m in a position to heal the country or it’s someone else” but added that his focus was “getting us back on track” as a nation.</p><p>Democrats who are out of office, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, are expected to support candidates across the country. And some who are up for re-election, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/us/politics/tim-walz-democrats-2024.html" title="">Mr. Walz</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/us/politics/jb-pritzker-2028-new-hampshire-trump-democrats.html" title="">Mr. Pritzker</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/us/politics/aoc-sanders-democrats-2028.html" title="">Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> of New York have already spent considerable time on the road.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“We have to take back the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C., period, end of sentence,” Mr. Pritzker said. “If you’re not doing something to assist in that endeavor, you’re doing it wrong. And that’s not a message to or about people who may be thinking about running in 2028. That’s a message to all Democrats.”</p><h2 id="link-50de7334">Who are the unexpected stars?</h2><p>At the beginning of the 2018 midterm cycle, Beto O’Rourke was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/opinion/beto-orourke-ted-cruz-texas-senate-race.html" title="">little-known congressman</a> from Texas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/us/politics/ted-cruz-beto-orourke-election.html" title="">mounting a long-shot campaign</a> against Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican.</p><p>By the end, Mr. O’Rourke <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/09/us/politics/beto-2020-presidential-race.html" title="">was seen as</a> a serious 2020 presidential prospect. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/beto-orourke-drops-out.html" title="">That bid fizzled</a>, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/ted-cruz-wins-texas-senate-race.html" title="">what he did</a> — overperform in a red state and become a national name — could well play out for others next year.</p><p>Keep an eye on other Democrats running in traditionally Republican-leaning territory, like Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia, who faces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/us/politics/jon-ossoff-georgia-jewish-democrats.html" title="">a difficult re-election</a> next year.</p><p>“I expect that we’ll see people who are doing the work in 2025 and doing the work in 2026, whose names we don’t know right now, will become part of the conversation,” Mr. O’Rourke said, adding that the tumult of 2025 made it difficult to think about races several years away. “Who’s willing to step up and fight and do something about it right now?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><h2 id="link-1877a563">Can anyone rescue their party’s toxic brand?</h2><p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/03/politics/democrats-brand-findings-cnn-poll" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Poll</a> after <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MLSPSC26PressReleaseNationalIssues.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poll</a> shows that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls.html" title="">whatever reservations</a> Americans have about Republicans, they take a dim view of the Democratic Party, too. The midterm elections will begin to test a range of theories about how to repair that reputation.</p><p>“There’s an authenticity problem,” Mr. Moore said.</p><p>Can anyone energize voters around an affirmative new vision or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/bernie-sanders-aoc-trump-democrats.html" title="">bold policy ideas</a> that go beyond reining in Mr. Trump? Does anyone successfully use a fight with the party’s left flank to win over more voters in the middle — or manage to create a new coalition entirely? Such questions may not be answered until 2028, but the clues will come sooner.</p><p>“The nominee in ’28 should be someone who will make expensive statements, statements that the exhausted majority loves but the overly online left hates,” said Representative Jake Auchincloss, a Massachusetts Democrat. “A campaign is one way to do it. Another way to do it is just governing.”</p><p>Reid J.
