Scientists have been consistently finding links between red and processed meat consumption and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/well/eat/meat-increases-heart-risks-latest-study-concludes.html" title="">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/health/report-links-some-types-of-cancer-with-processed-or-red-meat.html" title="">some types of cancer</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/well/eat/eat-less-meat-live-longer.html" title="">earlier death</a>.</p><p>And now, two recent studies have added to the growing body of evidence that a meat-heavy diet may increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes.</p><p>In one of the studies, published today in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00179-7/fulltext" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology</a>, researchers analyzed data from nearly two million adults participating in 31 studies across 20 countries, including the United States and parts of Europe and Asia. </p><p>The researchers reviewed survey data on participants’ diets and then looked at their health an average of 10 years later. After adjusting for other risk factors like smoking, a higher body mass index, physical inactivity and a family history of diabetes, they found that for every 1.8 ounces of processed meat the participants ate each day, their risk for Type 2 diabetes increased by 15 percent. (This is equivalent to a medium-sized sausage or two to three slices of bacon.) For every 3.5 ounces of unprocessed red meat they consumed daily, their risk increased by 10 percent. (This is about the size of a small steak.)</p></div></div><div><div><p>The data also suggested that one serving of poultry per day was associated with an 8 percent increase in Type 2 diabetes risk, but this finding was less consistent and only significant in the European studies, so more research is needed, said Dr. Nita Forouhi, a professor of population health and nutrition at the University of Cambridge who led the study.</p><p>The takeaway, she said, is that the less red and processed meat you eat, the better.</p><h2 id="link-6122bbf5">Why Eating Meat Might Increase Your Risk</h2><p>These findings jibe with previous research, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/well/eat/red-meat-diabetes.html" title="">a large U.S. study published in October</a>.</p><p>There are several potential explanations for why regular meat consumption might increase Type 2 diabetes risk, Dr. Forouhi said.</p><p>One is that red and processed meats tend to be higher in saturated fats than in unsaturated fats, a composition associated with greater <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/well/live/insulin-resistance-signs.html" title="">insulin resistance</a>, which can lead to Type 2 diabetes.</p><p>People who eat more meat may also eat fewer healthful foods, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/well/eat/mediterranean-diet-fruits-vegetables.html" title="">like fruits and vegetables</a>, Dr. Forouhi added.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Cooking meat at high temperatures, such as through pan frying or grilling over an open flame, can also form <a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/41/5/1049/36533/Meat-Cooking-Methods-and-Risk-of-Type-2-Diabetes" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">certain compounds</a> that may cause cell damage, inflammation and insulin resistance — all of which can contribute to Type 2 diabetes.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-024-01109-5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study published last week</a> in the journal Nature Metabolism added evidence for another longstanding hypothesis: that heme iron — a type of iron found in high levels in red meat (and to a lesser extent in fish and poultry) — may contribute to Type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The researchers followed nearly 205,000 predominantly white U.S. adults for up to 36 years, during which time about 21,000 of them developed Type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Those with the highest heme iron consumption — mainly coming from eight to 10 servings of unprocessed red meat per week — were 26 percent more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than those with the lowest consumption. They also had higher lipid levels, markers of insulin resistance and inflammation, and other compounds linked with Type 2 diabetes in their blood, the study revealed.</p><p>This added to <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-physiol-022522-102832" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">existing evidence</a> suggesting that heme iron is likely an important player in the link between red meat and Type 2 diabetes, said Dr. Frank B. Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who led the study.</p></div></div><div><div><p>On the other hand, heme iron did not explain the link between processed red meat and Type 2 diabetes, Dr. Hu said. Other components, such as their <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004149" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">preservative</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3496924/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sodium levels</a>, are probably more important to the risk of processed meats, he added.</p><p>Iron is an essential nutrient, but too much may cause inflammation and damage the pancreas, increasing diabetes risk, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Tufts University, who was not involved with the study.</p><h2 id="link-ec230a2">How Much is Too Much?</h2><p>While regular consumption of both red and processed meats have been associated with poorer health, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/well/eat/processed-meats.html" title="">processed meats</a> have the strongest and most consistent link with Type 2 diabetes and other conditions, Dr. Mozaffarian said. This is clearly a “class to avoid,” he added.</p><p>Processed meats include not only stereotypically unhealthy products like hot dogs and bacon, but also potentially healthy-seeming ones like turkey sausages and deli meats.</p><p>This doesn’t mean you should never eat these foods, Dr. Mozaffarian said. Instead, think of them as occasional treats, he added.</p></div></div><div><div><p>As for red meat, there’s not enough data to say exactly how much is too much, Dr. Hu said, but based on the current evidence, a serving or two per week — like a small pork chop or a couple meatballs over spaghetti — is probably OK.</p><p>Dr. Hu recommended shifting from a “meat centric” diet to one that incorporates plenty of plant-based foods like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2024/mediterranean-diet" title="">whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes</a> — all of which have been linked with a lower risk of Type 2 diabetes.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alice Callahan is a Times reporter covering nutrition and health.
