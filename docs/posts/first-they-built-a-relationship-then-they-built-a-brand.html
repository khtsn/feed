That home, in Bedford Stuyvesant, changed their lives.</p><p>“From that purchase, we started our business together,” Mr. Slocum said. That was seven years ago. The two, now known as the Brownstone Boys, have since renovated more than 27 prewar homes together.</p><p>The two first connected on April 4, 2017 on Grindr, but it was a week and a half before they met in person. “We talk about how weird it is because that’s not what usually happens on Grindr,” Mr. Slocum said of their virtual correspondence. “We talked nonstop.”</p><p>For their first date, they chose the Crown Inn, a bar in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, a favorite within walking distance for both.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We talked for hours and hours,” Mr. Bordelon said, until 1 or 2 in the morning. “Which is rare for me because I’m in bed by 9 or 10,” Mr. Slocum said. It was worth staying up for. “We ended the night with a passionate kiss,” Mr. Slocum said.</p><p>Their second date was the following weekend. “We had a very low-key date at Jordan’s house, just ordering food and watching TV,” Mr. Bordelon said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The couple closed on their brownstone in 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin McCallum Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin McCallum Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But after their second date, Mr. Slocum said, Mr. Bordelon “ghosted” him. They went from “talking all day every day,” he said, to five days of radio silence.</p><p>Still, Mr. Slocum said, “I knew in the back of my mind he would come back.”</p><p>And Mr. Bordelon did — with a text saying “Hey, what’s up?&#34; He explained the disappearing act. “I was raised in a strict religion, Jehovah’s Witness,” Mr. Bordelon said. He was out to his friends, but not “to my parents or a lot of people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Once they were back in touch, they went on a bike ride around Brooklyn. That’s when “Barry told me all of this,” Mr. Slocum said. “He had hidden his true self and I just fell in love with him and wanted to learn everything about him. Things happened really fast after the third date.”</p><p>The two realized they shared a strong mutual passion for architecture, specifically brownstones. “We learned of each other’s past journey both professionally and personally,” said Mr. Bordelon, who had already purchased, renovated and sold several homes in Brooklyn. Mr. Slocum had been saving aggressively in hopes of one day buying one. “Things happened really fast after the third date,” Mr. Slocum said.</p><p>Several weeks later, both were off on separate trips planned before they met — Mr. Slocum went to Spain and Mr. Bordelon to India.</p><p>“We had our last dinner together at St. Anselm in Brooklyn,” Mr. Slocum said. “I remember holding hands under a table in the back and feeling like we were saying goodbye for years even though it was only two weeks.”</p><p>When they were back, “we were off to the races,” Mr. Bordelon said. “We just constantly were planning things together.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The ceremony was led by Lauren Hill, who was ordained by American Marriage Ministries.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin McCallum Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The couple met on Grindr but didn’t meet for a week and a half. “We talk about how weird it is because that’s not what usually happens on Grindr,” Mr. Slocum said</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin McCallum Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In September 2017, the couple went on a six-day trip to Iceland, and when they returned home, the idea to buy a place together took root. They both were ready to buy a brownstone, so Mr. Slocum asked, “If we put our money together, would that help?” Of course, Mr. Bordelon answered. But, he recalled, “I don’t think Jordan realized how serious I was and how quickly it would happen.”</p><p>He was right. Mr. Slocum imagined house hunting might take a year or two. But Mr. Bordelon was already making appointments to see properties. It only took a few months to find just the right one. In October 2018, they closed on their brownstone in the Bedford Stuyvesant.</p><p>Mr. Bordelon moved in immediately, as he had sold his condo in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Mr. Slocum planned to wait since there were major renovations to be done. But, “after a couple of months, we decided we wanted to live together full time,” Mr. Slocum said. So by early 2019, Mr. Slocum had moved into the new place as well.</p><p>The two decided to blog about their journey of buying and renovating, thinking only a handful of family and friends would see it. “We blogged about everything in our renovation and posted on Instagram and YouTube,” Mr. Slocum said.</p><p>Their audience grew. “Eventually we developed a community around our renovation project,” Mr. Slocum said. People began reaching out with questions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Then they began reaching out for more than just answers. “In the fall of 2019, someone reached out with the email subject, ‘Please Help,’” Mr. Slocum said. The couple had just bought a brownstone and were having difficulty hiring an architect and contractors. “We had coffee with the couple and fell in love with them immediately.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In honor of Mr. Bordelon’s birthplace, New Orleans, the brass band from Big Apple Leadership, a youth-centered, nonprofit organization in New York City performed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin McCallum Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“When we started talking about where to get married, nothing felt right except to have something grounded in our community,” Mr. Slocum said. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin McCallum Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The two decided to take on the couple as clients. “We were hired as their project managers and designers,” Mr. Slocum said.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/vows" title=""><em>Binge more Vows columns here</em></a></strong><strong><em> and </em></strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/fashion/weddings" title=""><em>read all our wedding, relationship and divorce coverage here</em></a></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>More clients quickly followed. And at the start of 2020, the two quit their corporate jobs — Mr. Bordelon worked in sales for a startup software company and Mr. Slocum was on the marketing and design team of an ice cream maker — and became full time at “<a href="https://thebrownstoneboys.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Brownstone Boys</a>.”</p><p>For both, their community in Brooklyn remains paramount. “Our first clients were a young Black couple, both of whom grew up in New York City,” Mr. Slocum said. “We went on to help generational families, members of the L.G.B.T.Q. family, and many first-time home buyers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>For Mr. Bordelon and Mr. Slocum, buying a brownstone came in the first year. Starting a business together happened in the first three. But it was a whole lot longer before they began talking about marriage.</p><p>“I didn’t even think during the first five years of our relationship that marriage would be a thing for us,” Mr. Bordelon said. Mr. Slocum said, “I have very liberal, Jewish parents and they were like, ‘When are you going to get married?’”</p><p>The decision was made on a last-minute trip they took to Puerto Rico in 2023. “We decided in a little restaurant called El Jibarito that we would do it,” Mr. Slocum said. They would each propose to one another when they felt the time was right.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The couple’s favorite local drag queens, from left, Venus Mystique, Lana JaRae, Essa Noche, performed at the party. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin McCallum Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The guests and neighbors “followed our mood board,” Mr. Slocum said. “Met Gala comes to the Brooklyn Block.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin McCallum Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>For Mr. Bordelon, that was on April 4, 2023, the five-year anniversary of their first message on Grindr, on the front stoop of their brownstone. “Our stoop had become a really special place to us,” Mr. Bordelon said. “Coffee in the morning. Wine in the evenings. Getting to know our neighbors and community.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Slocum’s proposal came on June 1, 2023, and was much more public. “House Beautiful had asked us to be part of their video series, ‘<a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8lmgb6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">My Better Half</a>,’ where they ask home renovation couples questions,” Mr. Slocum said. “I messaged the producers of the series to see if they would let me ask Barry to marry him as the last question.”</p><p>They said yes. And so did Mr. Bordelon.</p><p>Mr. Bordelon, 44, has a bachelor’s degree in marketing from Louisiana State University. He is originally from New Orleans.</p><p>Mr. Slocum, 42, who grew up in Las Vegas, has a bachelor’s degree in fine arts from the University of Hartford.

Ms. Hill was ordained by American Marriage Ministries.</p><p>“When we started talking about where to get married, nothing felt right except to have something grounded in our community,” Mr. Slocum said.</p><p>Already, their block had become “my ‘Sesame Street’ dream, which I grew up watching,” Mr. Slocum said. “I saw the neighborhood and the people on the street talking. We were having these block activities and talking to neighbors every night. So, we came up with the idea to have a block party and invite all of our neighbors.”</p><p>Roughly 250 guests attended — and they “followed our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/style/wedding-dress-codes-mood-board.html" title="">mood board</a>,” Mr. Slocum said. “Met Gala comes to the Brooklyn Block.”</p><p>“It was imperative for Barry and I for our wedding to feel like a love party,” Mr. Slocum said. “Barry’s parents weren’t there and that was hard. But we opened the party to strangers and neighbors. We wanted all of the brave love.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“It was imperative for Barry and I for our wedding to feel like a love party,” Mr. Slocum said. “We opened the party to strangers and neighbors.

And then there was John McGovern, a neighbor who told the couple he wanted to grill for the party. “He made an entire buffet for all,” Mr. Slocum said.</p><p><strong>Guest of Honor</strong> “I surprised Barry with our dog Zuko,” said Mr. Slocum, who shares custody of Zuko, a 10-year-old, silver Labrador, with his ex-husband. Mr. Slocum made sure “he was there to celebrate.”</p><p><strong>All the World’s a Stage</strong> Their wedding began with an acoustic rendition of David Bowie’s “Changes” performed by a Broadway actress, Trista Doll, with a neighbor, Steve Mayone, on guitar.
