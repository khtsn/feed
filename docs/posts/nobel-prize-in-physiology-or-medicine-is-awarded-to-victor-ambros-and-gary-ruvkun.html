The discovery revealed a new principle of gene regulation that is crucial for multicellular organisms, including humans.</p><p>Gene regulation determines differences between types of cells, and if it goes off track it can lead to diseases such as cancer, diabetes or autoimmunity, the Nobel Committee said. Researchers now know that the human genome provides instructions for over 1,000 forms of microRNA, which are important to the development and function of organisms.</p><p>“That opened up a whole new understanding of how diseases happen, which means that we have new possibilities for reversing them,” said Jon Lorsch, director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-34a84e30">Who are the winners?</h2><p>Dr. Ambros is from Hanover, N.H., and is the Silverman professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Mass. Dr. Ruvkun, from Berkeley, Calif., is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and a member of the Mass General Research Institute.</p><p>The pair began studying gene regulation while they were postdoctoral fellows at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the lab of <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2002/horvitz/facts/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">H. Robert Horvitz</a>, who won his own <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/health/genetics/american-and-2-britons-win-nobel-for-studies-on-cell-death.html" title="">Nobel Prize in 2002</a>.</p><p>They continued collaborating after they established their own laboratories and received the 2008 <a href="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/tiny-rnas-that-regulate-gene-function/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award</a> (along with David C. Baulcombe of the University of Cambridge), which often precedes Nobel Prizes, for their work on the “unanticipated world of tiny RNAs.”</p><p>Dr. Runkun studied biophysics at the University of California, Berkeley and finished his Ph.D. at Harvard University. Dr. Ambros received his undergraduate and graduate degree from M.I.T.</p><h2 id="link-21b40a85">Why did the committee say they received the prize?</h2><p>The RNA molecule, or ribonucleic acid, is often explained to high school biology students as carrying instructions from DNA to cells, enabling the creation of proteins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Dr. Ambros and Dr. Ruvkun’s findings suggested that this process, so fundamental that it is often referred to as the “central dogma of molecular biology,” might be more complex.</p><p>Their work centered on microRNA, which, as the name suggests, is much shorter than its RNA counterpart. While typical RNA might have hundreds or thousands of basic building blocks, microRNA might only have dozens. The two Nobel laureates found that microRNA act as “controllers” of the process that produces proteins, telling the larger RNA when to slow down or stop. They made this discovery in a millimeter-size roundworm, C. elegans, which scientists often use in basic research because it has many types of cells packed into a simple anatomy.</p><p>This is important because too much or too little of a given protein can result in a wide range of diseases, like cancer or osteoporosis. Mutations in the genes that have instructions for microRNA has been linked to congenital hearing loss, eye and skeletal disorders, Nobel Prize officials said.</p><p>Treatments based on microRNAs are in clinical trials for heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>The discovery, originally described in 1993 in two <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8252622/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">separate</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8252621/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">papers</a> published the journal Cell, was first met with “almost deafening silence,” the Nobel committee wrote, because many scientists believed that this process be unique to the worm that Dr. Ambros and Dr. Ruvkum studied, not humans or other more complicated animals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>However, researchers have since found thousands of forms of microRNA in humans and other animals, confirming that this new principle of gene regulation is “essential for all complex life forms,” Nobel Prize officials said.</p><p><em>This is a developing news story that will be updated.</em></p><h2 id="link-1f108361">Who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2023?</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/02/health/nobel-prize-medicine.html" title="">Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman</a> recognized work that led to the development of potent Covid vaccines — that were administered to billions around the world.</p><h2 id="link-37aa440f">When will the other Nobel Prizes be announced?</h2><p>The prize for physiology or medicine is the first of six Nobel Prizes that will be awarded this year.

Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/science/nobel-prize-physics.html" title="">Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier</a> shared the prize for work that let scientists capture the motions of subatomic particles moving at impossible speeds.</p></li><li><p>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry will be awarded on Wednesday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, the prize went to Moungi G. Bawendi, Louis E. Brus and Alexei I.
