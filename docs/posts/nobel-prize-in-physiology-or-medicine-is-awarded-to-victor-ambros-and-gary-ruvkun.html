The discovery revealed a new principle of gene regulation that is crucial for multicellular organisms, including humans.</p><p>Gene regulation determines differences between types of cells, and if it goes off track it can lead to diseases such as cancer, diabetes or autoimmunity, the Nobel Committee said. Researchers now know that the human genome provides instructions for over 1,000 forms of micoRNA, which are important to the development and function of organisms.</p><p>Mr. Ambros is from Hanover, N.H. and is the Silverman Professor of Natural Science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Mass.
