                  <p>&#34;independent and fear have been helping me a lot with those positions,&#34; he said. &#34;And I think it&#39;s getting better and better.</p>
                  <p>&#34;The last two, three weeks have been much better for me. I didn&#39;t feel confident in some positions, but now it&#39;s getting better and better.&#34;</p>
                  <p>Currently ranked 35th in the world, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid945059161">fnatic</a> are still in the race for a spot at the next Major. They have a mountain to climb to make it to Cologne, but <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/11777/maden" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid359198525">Maden</a> pointed out that the team was in a similar situation last year before Budapest and still qualified for the Major.</p>
                  <p>&#34;It was very hard to get to the Major for them, and they managed to do it because they focused just on every tournament, on every game,&#34; he said. &#34; And then if it happens, it happens. So this is kind of our situation right now.&#34;</p>

                  <p><strong>As many people expected, fnatic is through to the playoffs. Walk me through the matches that you played in the group stage. The first one was quite close, then you lost to BetBoom and now you beat SAW.</strong></p>
                  <p>The first match was pretty close, I would say, but we managed to close it out. They played well, but we also made some mistakes, and that&#39;s why the match was very close. It was important that we won this best-of-one.</p>
                  <p>We lost the match against BetBoom, but, to be honest, I felt on Ancient that we had a chance to win. And on Overpass, I think, especially on the T side, we had so many good situations, but we couldn&#39;t convert the rounds. We couldn&#39;t finish then. I think we lacked a little bit of experience, and we needed to be calmer in those situations. In the pistol round, we were 5v3. We just had to make a better plan to finish out the round and it would have been much easier. It was fine. It was not the worst match ever. We played okay. We just need to close the rounds where we have advantages.</p>
                  <p>The third match, against SAW, I think we felt pretty confident on both maps. On Inferno, they caught us a bit off-guard on their T side. They played well. Props to them. But I think we managed to be calm and won the T pistol. We steamrolled [after that] and just played our game. It was very nice.</p>

                  <p><strong>This is your first LAN event with the team. What are your initial impressions of the team? Is this the kind of team you were looking for when you left Falcons, because Zero Tenacity was always something temporary?</strong></p>
                  <p>It&#39;s super nice. It&#39;s my first time seeing these guys, and it&#39;s always nice to see everyone and to learn how people are. And it has been a very nice experience with them. I think they&#39;re all super nice and they are very passionate about the game. They are loving the game, and they&#39;re enjoying it. It&#39;s very nice to see. It has been super nice with them. And I think we&#39;re going to learn a lot from this tournament, and it&#39;s going to be much better, now that we know each other in person.</p>
                  <p><strong>You were brought in to replace blameF, someone who contributed a lot in terms of fragging power. When fnatic announced you, they said they wanted someone who could play more aggressive roles. Are you happy with the role you have been given?</strong></p>
                  <p>Now it&#39;s getting much better. At the beginning, it was a little bit tough with the roles on some maps. Obviously, I don&#39;t want to say which maps and stuff, but it was a little bit hard for me. But independent and fear have been helping me a lot with those positions. And I think it&#39;s getting better and better.</p>
                  <p>The last two, three weeks have been much better for me. I didn&#39;t feel confident in some positions, but now it&#39;s getting better and better.</p>
                  <p><strong>You&#39;re ranked 35th in the world with this win. You are in that group of teams that still have a chance of making the Major, but it&#39;s going to be very hard to do it. Is that still in the team&#39;s mind, or are you just taking things as they come?</strong></p>
                  <p>We had a meeting yesterday, and we&#39;re going to take things as they come. We are going to play each game, focus on each game, and try to win. I think they were in a similar situation last season. It was very hard to get to the Major for them, and they managed to do it because they just focused on every tournament, on every game.  And then if it happens, it happens. So this is kind of our situation right now. We all know it&#39;s going to be very hard, but we&#39;re not going to think about it. We&#39;re just going to focus on each game. I think that&#39;s very important for us.</p>
                  <p><strong>For a while now, people have been looking at this fnatic team and questioning whether it can compete at the highest level. With blameF gone, how far do you think the team can go? What goals has the team set for this year?</strong></p>
                  <p>As I said, we haven&#39;t set any crazy goals for now. We know it&#39;s a hard situation, with the Major and everything, but we&#39;re just going to focus on each game. Nowadays, everyone knows how to play good Counter-Strike. I feel like we can do a lot of damage. The individuals on this team are very good. If things click, I think we can be a very good team. It was a little bit rough for me at the beginning to jump into this team and learn all their things. But now it&#39;s getting easier.</p>
                  <p>I feel that jackasmo and jambo are super good individually. If I give them space and create a lot of space for them, I think they can shine. jackasmo has been playing really well at this LAN already, especially against SAW. He put in some crazy numbers. I think they&#39;re very good individually. To be honest, if everything clicks, we can go far.</p>
