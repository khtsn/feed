Putin and President-elect Donald J. Trump, but that any concrete steps to set up such talks could be made only after Mr. Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20.</p><p>Responding to comments made on Thursday by Mr. Trump, who said that Mr. Putin wanted to meet him to discuss the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin’s spokesman reaffirmed Russia’s longstanding official position that Moscow was ready to talk.</p><p>“We need a mutual desire and political willingness to engage in a dialogue,” Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, told reporters. “We see that Mr. Trump also declares his readiness to solve issues via dialogue. We welcome that.”</p><p>Mr. Peskov added that the Kremlin’s understanding is that there is a “mutual readiness for a meeting,” but, he said, “it looks like things will start to move after Trump enters the Oval Office.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He did not confirm that Mr. Putin had requested a meeting with Mr. Trump or that one was being set up, <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/10/trump-putin-meeting/77591006007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as Mr. Trump said</a> on Thursday night.</p><p>A spokesman for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Friday that Kyiv expected President Volodymyr Zelensky would also meet with Mr. Trump after the inauguration.</p><p>The spokesman, Heorhii Tykhyi, said Ukraine was preparing for talks at “the highest levels.” As for Mr. Trump’s remarks about potential talks with Russia’s leader, Mr. Tykhyi said that the president-elect had “previously mentioned plans for such a meeting, so we see nothing new in this.”</p><p>“Our stance is clear: everyone in Ukraine wants to end the war on terms that are fair to Ukraine,” he said at a news briefing. “We believe President Trump is also committed to ending the war. Therefore, the priority now is for a meeting between our presidents.”</p><p>“The most important thing for us is to collaborate with America in the pursuit of peace,” he added.</p><p>While asserting its territorial claim over five regions in Ukraine, the Kremlin has been insisting that it would prefer diplomacy over war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ukraine and some of its Western allies have questioned Russia’s seriousness in offering to negotiate, and said that the Kremlin’s conditions actually represent a demand for Ukrainian capitulation.</p><p>Russia has been largely isolated from the West for almost three years since it invaded Ukraine. For Mr. Putin, a meeting with the American president would represent a chance to establish relations with a friendlier American administration.</p><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that he could resolve the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours, without saying how, and at times even said he could do so before taking office. But this week he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-sympathizes-with-russias-opposition-nato-membership-ukraine-2025-01-07/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> that it could take up to six months.</p><p>Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that he was sympathetic with the Russian position that Ukraine should never join NATO, one of the main conditions put forward by the Kremlin to end the war.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s victory in November produced a wave of cautious optimism that the war could end soon, even if in an unstable cease-fire. But analysts have said that the process will be hard and tedious, and many in Ukraine and elsewhere fear that Mr. Trump might want to push through a deal at the expense of its capitulation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In Russia, Giorgy Bovt, a political analyst, said that if a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin happened too early, when “the conditions for peace have not yet matured,” it could “lead to greater escalation.”</p><p>“Both warring parties are still betting on continuing military action,” Mr. Bovt wrote in <a href="https://t.me/bovtznaet/6246" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post</a> on Telegram, a popular messaging app. “They do not consider their forces exhausted.”</p><p>Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, <a href="https://t.me/stanovaya/1825" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on social media that “the higher the expectations” from the meeting “the riskier the game, most of all for Trump.”</p><p>Cassandra Vinograd<!-- --> contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
