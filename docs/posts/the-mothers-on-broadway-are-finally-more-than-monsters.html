But as Audra McDonald is proving to devastating effect in George C. Wolfe’s current revival, Rose is deeply human. Always has been.</p><p>This time around, she is also part of a subtle social shift: an unusual abundance of forceful, fully drawn mothers seen lately on New York’s larger stages. The current Broadway shows “Cult of Love” and “Eureka Day,” and recent ones including “The Hills of California” and “Suffs,” are interested in a lot more than how those characters traumatize their children, or how far they deviate from the maternal ideal. They might cast long shadows over their girls in particular, yet they are human beings as multidimensional as any man.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Rose, who has been emotionally complex all along, warps her daughters’ 1920s childhoods with the tyrannical ambitions she has for them. But her unyielding exterior was forged for protection against a world that shut her out.</p><p>“Well, someone tell me, when is it my turn?” she sings when at last she breaks down. “Don’t I get a dream for myself?”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
