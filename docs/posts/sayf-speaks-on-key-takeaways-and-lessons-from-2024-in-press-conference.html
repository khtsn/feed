<p><strong>What are Sayf&#39;s thoughts and comparisons between competing with Vitality this season and Team Liquid last season?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sayf: &#34;I mean, the season was successful in a sense. At the start of the year, no one imagined that we would even be here at Champions. We were working on very, very slow fundamental things and trying to find our groove. We said it would be a long-term thing and that we&#39;re going to try our best to be better and better, and we ended up at Champions.  With Liquid, we qualified for everything, yes, and I would feel like it was successful in itself, but I didn&#39;t feel the same development journey as I felt here. It didn&#39;t feel like I was growing, and I felt that the people and the staff around me at Vitality directed me well, especially with the additions to the coaching staff. I&#39;m super proud of the work that&#39;s been done, and I&#39;m super proud that we kept it together and whether we fell here at Champions, it doesn&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>

<p><strong>Coming into the match, you guys started strong on Icebox. What went wrong in the last part of the series, and why do you think Sunset wasn&#39;t as competitive as Icebox?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gorilla: &#34;Overall, I think we hesitated a lot more on Sunset compared to Icebox. The calls were good, the micro was good, but we were a bit too slow, too hesitant to move into actualizing upon what we called.&#34;</p>

<p><strong>How was runneR and Kicks&#39; experience at their first international event, and what are their biggest takeaways?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>runneR: &#34;It&#39;s been a great experience for my first Champions and first year in VCT. It&#39;s been a hard year, I&#39;ve tried not to think of it as a hard year, but it&#39;s definitely been a hard year. I still have a lot to go through. It&#39;s really good to get this kind of experience, and of course it sucks to lose, and I wouldn&#39;t wish this feeling on anyone. I&#39;ll be improving on myself and everything in general for next year. I hope I can come back here and compete again.</p>
  
  <p>Kicks: &#34;I can say for myself that we had a lot of ups and downs this season. The beginning of the year was rough for us and didn&#39;t go as expected in a lot of the events, but I&#39;m really grateful that we pulled through in Split 2 and I&#39;m grateful to be here. It&#39;s a really good experience. It&#39;s my first year in VCT, so it&#39;s always good to actually instantly make it.&#34;</p>

<p><strong>What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from this whole experience, be it good or bad from your point of view, and how will you use that going forward into next year?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sayf: &#34;The biggest takeaway is that you can accomplish a greater task with very small actions from everyone. You don&#39;t need something super significant from an individual person. You need small things from every individual, it takes little to no effort to do these things, and you will by default play better in the games you are playing. That&#39;s my biggest takeaway, that every individual can do something small and make something great for everyone.&#34;</p>
