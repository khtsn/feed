Asked directly in the television interview if she would consider such a campaign, she sidestepped the question but did not shoot down the premise.</p><p>The House Democratic leadership — with yet another New York legislator at the top — quickly followed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s criticism, putting out a statement knocking the Republican-written legislation. All but one House Democrat <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/house-stopgap-funding-bill-vote-government-shutdown.html" title="">voted Tuesday against the plan</a>, which would slightly decrease spending overall.</p><p>“The far-right Republican funding bill will unleash havoc on everyday Americans, giving Donald Trump and Elon Musk even more power to continue dismantling the federal government,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the top House Democrat, said in a joint statement with the rest of his leadership team.</p><p>“House Democrats will not be complicit,” they said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Capitol Hill in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Their anger, with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez out front, reflects a boiling over of resentments among some Democrats about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/government-shutdown-spending-bill-schumer-democrats.html" title="">gerontocracy leading</a> their party. The older generation led them astray last year during the presidential election, many younger Democrats say, and it is hurting them again as they try to stand up to Mr. Trump.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Frustrated House Democrats were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/government-shutdown-spending-bill-schumer-democrats.html" title="">already discussing primary</a> challenges to Mr. Schumer, who was first elected in 1998.</p><p>“Schumer has been in politics for a long time, and I would hope that this is his final term, and he opens it up for someone new,” said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/16/nyregion/politicians-housing-crisis-real-estate.html" title="">State Senator Jabari Brisport of New York</a>, an ideological ally of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed him when he first ran.</p><p>Mr. Brisport said that he did not know if Ms. Ocasio-Cortez aspired to higher office. But if she ran, he said, “she would make a fantastic senator.”</p><p>Mr. Schumer’s defenders note that it was easier for House Democrats to vote no — because the Republicans in their chamber had enough support to pass the legislation to keep the government open without Democratic help.</p><p>And, his defenders say, allowing the government to shut down would only make matters worse.</p><p>It “may feel good giving vent to our frustration,” Jay Jacobs, the New York Democratic Party chair, said in a statement. But it “will work against our long-term desire to win back the Congress in 2026 and the presidency in 2028.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In television interviews, floor speeches and a New York Times opinion piece, Mr. Schumer defended his choice, saying that he hated the bill before him but that its passage was better than a shutdown.</p><p>“The risk of allowing the president to take even more power via a government shutdown is a much worse path,” Mr. Schumer wrote in The Times.</p><p>On Friday afternoon, Mr. Schumer and his New York colleague Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Republicans, eight other Democrats and one Independent in passing the procedural vote to move forward with the stopgap spending measure, 62 to 38.</p><p>Later in the afternoon, the funding bill passed but with less Democratic support. Just two members of the Democratic caucus voted in favor.</p><p>Mr. Schumer’s efforts to get this Republican priority over the finish line drew praise from perhaps an unwelcome source: the president himself.</p><p>“Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing — Took ‘guts’ and courage!” Mr. Trump said on social media.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Oreskes is a reporter covering New York State politics and government for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benjamin-oreskes">More about Benjamin Oreskes</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>13</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Ocasio-Cortez Lashes Out at Schumer  For Going Along With Trump and Musk<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-house-of-representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/hakeem-jeffries">Hakeem Jeffries</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/charles-e-schumer">Charles Schumer</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Congress Cedes Power:</strong> On spending, oversight and other issues, Republican lawmakers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-republicans-congress-power.html">willingly turned over their constitutional powers</a> over to the Trump White House.</p></li><li><p><strong>Obscure Laws, ICE Agents and Fear:</strong> President Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trump-crackdown-dissent.html">clamping down broadly on dissent</a> using the tools of the federal government.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Big Bet:</strong> President Trump’s simultaneous trade wars with Canada, Mexico, China and the European Union amount to a huge economic and political gamble: that Americans will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-manufacturing-economy-risk.html">endure months or years of economic pain</a> in return for the distant hope of re-industrializing the American heartland.</p></li><li><p><strong>Birthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court:</strong> Trump administration lawyers have asked the justices to lift a nationwide pause on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-birthright-citizenship-supreme-court.html">the president’s order ending birthright citizenship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shake-Up at the I.R.S.:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-irs-lawyer-doge.html">replaced the top lawyer at the Internal Revenue Service</a>, a move that came as officials sought to gain access to the agency’s data.</p></li><li><p><strong>E.P.A.: </strong>Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/climate/epa-zeldin-rollbacks-pollution.html">reframed the purpose of the E.P.A</a>., saying his agency’s mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel Ban:</strong> The fate of thousands of Afghans waiting to reach the United States after serving with American troops was thrown into limbo after Trump took office.
