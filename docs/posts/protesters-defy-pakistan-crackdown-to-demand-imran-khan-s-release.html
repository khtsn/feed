His party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or P.T.I., says the cases are politically motivated.</p><p>Mr. Khan accuses the government and military of teaming up to crush his party, rig elections and undermine democracy. The government argues that Mr. Khan is sowing chaos through protests and insists the charges are legitimate, framing him as someone who refuses to play by the rules. It has rejected Mr. Khan’s calls to negotiate for his release.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Sunday, Mr. Khan strongly urged his supporters to descend on the capital, demand his release, call for fresh elections and reverse constitutional amendments that have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/asia/pakistan-judiciary-amendments.html" title="">curtailed judicial powers</a>.</p><p>The police said thousands of supporters, led by Mr. Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, and key aide Ali Amin Gandapur, who is also the chief minister of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and has led previous protests, set off from Peshawar on Sunday. Along the way, they removed shipping containers and barriers as the police deployed tear gas in the Attock district, about 50 miles from Islamabad. Officials said one police official was killed in clashes on Monday.</p><p>The government has warned protesters not to reach the large town square of D-Chowk, a key venue for political protests near important government buildings in the capital.</p><p>“Anyone who reaches D-Chowk will be arrested,” Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned. The government on Monday attempted to get P.T.I. to move the rally from the area.</p><p>The threats have done little to deter Mr. Khan’s supporters. They plan a sit-in in the capital in their bid to secure his release.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Bibi is also a spiritual guide to Mr. Khan and wears a full veil, symbolizing her adherence to Islamic modesty standards. She has been at the forefront of the current protest, stepping into a rare public leadership role.</p><p>“As long as Imran is not with us, we will not end this march,” Ms. Bibi said in a brief speech to supporters Monday afternoon. “I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you must support me. This is not just about my husband, but about the country and its leader.”</p><p>Since the weekend, Islamabad has resembled a city under siege: The government imposed a lockdown on Saturday, and major roads have been blocked with shipping containers. Internet and cellular services have been suspended, which the P.T.I. said affected its call on social media for a protest. The police have arrested more than 4,000 Khan supporters since Friday.</p><p>Authorities in Punjab Province also blocked the major arteries of Lahore, the provincial capital, as well as motorways leading to Islamabad.</p><p>Pakistan has seen recurring protests since Mr. Khan was removed from power in a no-confidence vote in 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Mr. Khan has had remarkable political staying power, persistently challenging Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, which has long controlled the levers of power in the country.</p><p>Tensions heightened further after this year’s general election, which Mr. Khan’s party claims to have won.</p><p>Some political analysts and observers warn that the country’s political crisis is nearing a breaking point.</p><p>“The political confrontation is taking a heavy toll on the economy and destabilizing the country,” said Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States and United Kingdom. “Khan’s party is tapping into widespread and growing public discontent with a weak government whose legitimacy is in question.”</p><p>Ms. Lodhi added that while the protests have brought pressure, their outcome remains uncertain.</p><p>“It’s an untenable situation, but also unpredictable,” she said. “Unless a political resolution is found, there is a clear and present danger of these protests snowballing into a larger crisis.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
