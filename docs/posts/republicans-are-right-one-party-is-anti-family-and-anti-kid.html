While neither party has done enough to support families and children, the one that is failing most egregiously is — not surprisingly — the one led by the thrice-married tycoon who tangled with a porn star, boasted about grabbing women by the genitals and was found by a jury to have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">committed sexual assault</a>.</p><p>You’d think that would make it awkward for the Republican Party to preach family values. But with the same chutzpah with which Donald Trump reportedly <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2016/oct/18/allegations-about-donald-trump-and-miss-teen-usa-c/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">marched</a> into a dressing room where teenage girls were <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kendalltaggart/teen-beauty-queens-say-trump-walked-in-on-them-changing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">half-naked</a>, the G.O.P. claims that it’s the Democrats who betray family values.</p><p>“The rejection of the American family is perhaps the most pernicious and most evil thing that the left has done in this country,” JD Vance said in 2021. Pressed on those remarks last month, he <a href="https://www.megynkelly.com/2024/07/26/jd-vance-reacts-to-childless-cat-ladies-comment/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">went further</a> in a conversation with Megyn Kelly, saying that Democrats “have become anti-family and anti-kid.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>This is gibberish. Children are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/15/opinion/progressives-california-portland.html" title="">more likely</a> to be poor, to die young and to drop out of high school in red states than in blue states. The <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/states-with-the-highest-divorce-rates" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">states</a> with the highest divorce rates are mostly Republican, and with some exceptions like Utah, it’s in red states that babies are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/unmarried/unmarried.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more likely</a> to be born to unmarried mothers (partly because of lack of access to reliable contraception).</p><p>One of President Biden’s greatest achievements was to cut the child poverty rate by almost half, largely with the refundable child tax credit. Then Republicans killed the program, sending child poverty soaring again.</p><p>Can anything be more anti-child?</p><p>Well, maybe our firearms policy is. Guns are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/07/is-gun-violence-leading-cause-death-children/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the leading cause</a> of death <a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/child-and-teen-firearm-mortality-in-the-u-s-and-peer-countries/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for American children and teenagers</a>, largely because of Republican intransigence and refusal to pass meaningful <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/24/opinion/gun-death-health.html" title="">gun safety laws</a>.</p><p>It’s because of the G.O.P. that the United States is one of only a few countries in the world without guaranteed paid maternity leave. Republicans fought universal health care and resisted the expansion of Medicaid; that’s one reason a child in the United States is <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three times as likely to die</a> by the age of 5 as a child in, say, Slovenia or Estonia.</p><p>Think of it this way: We’d be saving the life of one American child between the ages of 1 and 5 every three hours if we had the same child mortality level as Norway or Finland.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Project 2025, a blueprint for a Trump administration that Trump is frantically trying to disavow, would make things worse. It would end Head Start, a lifeline for low-income children, and would dismantle the Department of Education.</p><p>“My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113012083325505976" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on Friday. But even putting aside abortion rights, Republican extremism has led to obstacles to in vitro fertilization, especially after an Alabama court ruled that a frozen embryo must be considered a child. The Southern Baptist Convention, a bastion of support for Trump, this summer <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/southern-baptists-ivf-restrictions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticized</a> I.V.F.</p><p>Vance has supported a watered-down bill that he says protects I.V.F., but Republican senators <a href="https://apnews.com/article/senate-ivf-alabama-reproductive-care-460d099153d3faf548e9326ff17dbae6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blocked stronger legislation</a> to defend I.V.F. fertility treatments and expand access. They are leaving hanging so many of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/tim-walz-fertility-pregnancy.html" title="">one in seven</a> women who have trouble conceiving or sustaining a pregnancy.</p><p>Can anything be more anti-family?</p><p>Look, I’ve <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/opinion/when-liberals-blew-it.html" title="">repeatedly argued</a> that growing up in a two-parent household is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/opinion/single-parent-poverty.html" title="">the one privilege</a> that liberals ignore, that the left wrongly demonized Daniel Patrick Moynihan for his emphasis on family structure and that Democrats can do more to remove marriage penalties and bolster opportunities for children.</p><p>I’m troubled by the collapse of marriage in America’s working class — <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/ncfmr/resources/data/family-profiles/julian-decade-change-shares-single-cohabiting-married-2012-2022-fp-23-07.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 70 percent</a> of Americans without a high school diploma are unmarried. If we care about child poverty, we must face the reality that households headed by single moms are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/opinion/single-parent-poverty.html" title="">five times</a> as likely to live in poverty as those with married couples. So concerns about family and children are legitimate, and Democrats should do better.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But for Republicans to blame Democrats is ludicrous, for the G.O.P. has seemingly gone out of its way to undermine families and children.</p><p>Union membership among men <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/to-restore-marriage-restore-labor-unions/#:~:text=While%20union%20membership%20did%20not,men%20more%20likely%20to%20marry." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raises their marriage rates</a>, for example, apparently because they then earn more money and become more stable and appealing as partners. But Republicans have worked for decades to undermine unions.</p><p>Likewise, one way to raise marriage rates may be to help teenage girls <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/opinion/nicholas-kristof-politicians-teens-and-birth-control.html" title="">avoid pregnancy</a>; then they may be more likely to marry in their 20s. But Republicans have often been <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-declare-war-sex-education-seek-restrictions-public-schools-1777650" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspicious of comprehensive sex education</a> and have tried to <a href="https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/07-13-2023/contraception-funding-cut/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">defund Title X</a> family-planning programs, and it’s no accident that the states with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/teen-births/teenbirths.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highest rates of births to teenage mothers</a> are all red states.</p><p>Republicans like the House speaker, Mike Johnson, object to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/08/04/no-fault-divorce-jd-vance-women/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no-fault divorce</a> laws, which make it straightforward for couples to obtain divorces. They claim this is a pro-family stance. (Trump, understandably, appears more sympathetic to divorce.) But the evidence is overwhelming that before easy access to divorce, large numbers of women were trapped in violent marriages that terrorized them and their children.</p><p><a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w10175/w10175.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One careful study</a> by the economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers found that the introduction of no-fault divorce in America was associated with about a 20 percent reduction in female suicides, at least a 25 percent reduction in wife-beating and an apparent decline in husbands murdering wives.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Is it really pro-family to increase the number of moms who are beaten and murdered?</p><p>I’m glad Republicans are squawking about the challenges facing families and children. But if Trump, Vance and other Republicans want to blame those most responsible for the plight of families and children in America today, they should look in the mirror and hang their heads in shame.</p></div></div><div></div><div><div><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
