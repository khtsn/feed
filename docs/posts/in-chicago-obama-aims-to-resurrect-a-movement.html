Like 2016, when he championed Hillary Clinton, he will attempt to use his political star power to help fuel the ascension of the country’s first woman president, and warn voters of the perils of a Donald Trump presidency.</p><p>This time, however, Obama no longer has the strength of the presidency behind him. Instead, he will attempt to reassemble <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/obama-dnc-harris.html" title="">the kind of coalition that powered his own rise</a> behind the campaign of Kamala Harris.</p><p>Harris backed Obama’s long-shot campaign for president in 2007, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/harris-obama-friendship.html" title="">when it was a political risk that few others would take</a>. Now, Obama will return the favor.
