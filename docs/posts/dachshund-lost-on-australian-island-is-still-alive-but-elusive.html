But she has proved elusive to recapture.</p><p>The tale begins in November 2023 when a couple took their pet miniature dachshund, Valerie, to Kangaroo Island off the coast of Adelaide. But Valerie escaped from her pen and rushed off into the bush.</p><p>The couple scrapped their plans and searched for their pet for five days with the help of locals before finally giving up and returning to their home in New South Wales.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It was like finding a needle in a haystack,” Valerie’s owner Josh Fishlock told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPzsgPlSvYQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the “Today” show in Australia.</a></p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A surveillance image of Valerie.

Its Aboriginal name is Karta Pintingga, meaning “island of the dead.” Given Valerie’s predicament, we’re going to stick with Kangaroo Island.)</p><p>Now, more than a year after Valerie’s disappearance, hope has sprung. “Based on firsthand accounts and video evidence, we now know that Valerie is alive,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kangalarescue/posts/pfbid0XSNSS2ppQY9Kf3soFWJKVCm6ysyxU4uzVLQJNam6eXERNneaxSbe3i4t5C3AcyHgl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kangala Wildlife Rescue</a> said in a statement on social media last week. She was spotted about 10 miles from where she disappeared, in Stokes Bay, and was identified, in part, by her pink collar.</p><p>Efforts are now underway to rescue the dachshund, but that has proved difficult. “She runs at the first sign of humans or vehicles and despite the best efforts of dedicated island locals, Valerie has been impossible to catch,” the wildlife rescue said.</p><p>“We are using surveillance and various trapping and luring methods in the area she was last seen to try and bring her home,” the statement said. “This is a tiny dog in a huge area, and we will need help from the public to report any sightings and a lot of luck.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Thursday, a man who identified himself as “Jared, one of the Kangala team members that’s involved in the rescue mission for Valerie,” offered <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kangalarescue/videos/9477047562409522" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a heartening update in a video update</a>: “We have seen her. We’ve managed to narrow down the search area to one specific point.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We were initially skeptical, but we kept getting more and more sightings,” Mr. Fishlock told “Today.”</p><p>Her other owner, Georgia Gardner, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/26/miniature-dachshund-valerie-lost-kangaroo-island-south-australia-found-alive" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Guardian</a>: “She was not a very outside, rough-and-tough dog. To think that she even went one night outside in the rain, oh my gosh. To think that she’s gone a year and a half is incredible.”</p><p>While the first image of a dachshund might be of a cute little wiener dog, the breed has some real survival skills.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Dachshunds aren’t built for distance running, leaping, or strenuous swimming, but otherwise these tireless hounds are game for anything,” <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the American Kennel Club says</a> in its description of the breed. “Bred to be an independent hunter of dangerous prey, they can be brave to the point of rashness.”</p><p>The wildlife rescue said, “We hope to be able to update you all with an amazing outcome.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victor-mather">More about Victor Mather</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Driving in Singapore: </strong>The city-state, where it costs up to $84,000 just for the right to own a car, is one of the most expensive places to drive. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/car-certificate-singapore-luxury.html">That is by design</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Radio Martí Goes Off the Air: </strong>For four decades, a U.S.-financed broadcaster <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/americas/radio-marti-cuba-trump-castro.html">provoked the ire of the communist government</a> in Cuba.
