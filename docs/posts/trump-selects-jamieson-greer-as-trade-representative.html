    <h1>Trump Selects Jamieson Greer as Trade Representative</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The position of trade representative has historically been fairly low profile, but it has taken on greater importance under Mr. Trump. In his first term, the office helped wage a trade war against China, imposed substantial tariffs on its products and negotiated a series of trade deals.</p><p>In his next term, Mr. Trump has promised to again make aggressive use of the government’s authority over trade. On Monday, he said he would impose tariffs on all products coming into the United States from Canada, Mexico and China on his first day in office.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said he would use an executive order to levy a 25 percent tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico until drugs and migrants stopped coming over the border. In a separate post, he threatened an additional 10 percent tariff on all products from China, saying that the country was shipping illegal drugs to the United States.</p><p>Mr. Trump could be using the threats as an opening wager in negotiations. But they have threatened to disrupt America’s diplomatic and economic relationships, and if enacted, the tariffs would scramble global supply chains and impose costs on American businesses including auto manufacturers, farmers and food packagers.</p><p>The U.S. trade representative, a cabinet-level official who carries the rank of ambassador, is charged with carrying out trade negotiations and resolving economic disputes with other countries, as well as working with lawmakers, farmers and business owners to shape trade policy. The representative leads a small agency of more than 200 people that has offices in Washington, Geneva and Brussels.</p></div></div>
