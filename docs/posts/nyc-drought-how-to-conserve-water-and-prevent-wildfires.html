But the “good” weather is bad news for the city’s water supply, which is dwindling as the region suffers through a drought.</p><p>In October, New York City had one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/nyregion/drought-watch-nyc-weather.html" title="">longest dry streaks</a> in its recent history. September was unusually dry, too: Central Park received only <a href="https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=okx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slightly more than 1.5 inches of rain</a>. November isn’t looking much better.</p><p>The dry weather makes the New York region vulnerable to wildfires — and there have been plenty. Hundreds of fires have burned through tinder-dry leaves and underbrush in green spaces from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/nyregion/prospect-park-fire.html" title="">Brooklyn</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/nyregion/inwood-hill-park-fire-nyc.html" title="">Upper Manhattan</a> and New Jersey, casting a smoky haze over the city’s skyline and infusing the air with the acrid scent of burned wood.</p><p>Because of climate change, droughts are more likely to happen these days, and scientists say they are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/climate/united-states-record-drought.html" title="">becoming more severe</a>. On Monday, Mayor Eric Adams declared a drought warning — the second of three levels — for New York City for the first time in 22 years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Adams and city and state officials are asking New Yorkers to both help save water and prevent wildfires. Here’s what to know.</p><h3 id="link-62c00578"><span>I want to play my part. What do I need to do?</span></h3><p>There are no mandatory restrictions on water use yet, but that could change if the city declares a drought emergency, the next and highest level on its three-tiered classification system.</p><p>Even before that happens, officials are urging New Yorkers to take matters into their own hands and start conserving now.</p><p>The average person uses 82 gallons of water each day at home, according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/statistics-and-facts" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Most indoor, residential water use happens in just one room: the bathroom.</p><h3 id="link-78497b5a"><span>Does this mean I should stop showering?</span></h3><p>No!</p><p>Even in a drought, bathing regularly is still encouraged. (Whether that means daily or every other day <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/well/live/shower-every-day.html" title="">is up to you</a>.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But speeding up your cleaning routine can help save a lot of water. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/showerheads" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Typical shower heads</a> use 2.5 gallons of water each minute, so even slightly shorter showers can have a big impact on your personal water use.</p><p>During his weekly news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Adams also recommended turning off the shower or faucet while shaving, and embracing “just the normal, common-sense tips.”</p><p>Unfortunately for those among us who love a long soak in the tub, <a href="https://grist.org/living/baths-vs-showers-an-eco-smackdown/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">baths aren’t more efficient</a>. City officials suggest filling a tub up just halfway.</p><h3 id="link-25b408b6"><span>But it’s fine to flush, right?</span></h3><p>Don’t be weird about it, but the city also recommends flushing your toilet less frequently. With each whoosh of water down the bowl, typical toilets use around <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/residential-toilets" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1.6 gallons of water</a>, and older models can use up to six gallons.</p><p>“If it’s yellow, let it mellow, you know,” Mr. Adams said at his news conference on Tuesday. But he pointed out that often we flush the toilet for reasons that do “not have to do with personally relieving ourselves.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In other words, consider throwing waste that doesn’t come from your body — like dental floss, flushable wipes and tampons — into trash cans instead of into the toilet. (That’s what the city suggests anyway to <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/trash-it-dont-flush-it.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prevent the formation of fatbergs</a> — disgusting masses of congealed grease and personal hygiene products that form in sewers.)</p><h3 id="link-46145c85"><span>This is gross. Is there any other way I can pitch in?</span></h3><p>One of the best ways to save water in the bathroom is by replacing shower heads and toilets with <a href="https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/water/water-quantity/water-use-conservation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">energy-efficient models</a>. A low-water toilet uses less than 1.3 gallons each flush, and so-called low-flow shower heads use less than two gallons of water each minute.</p><p>Watching out for and repairing leaky and dripping faucets can also help limit unnecessary water waste.</p><p>Some good news: It’s possible you’re already using efficient toilets and showers — especially if they were installed in the last year and a half. <a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/New-York-State-Appliance-and-Equipment-Efficiency-Standards" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Regulations passed in Albany at the end of 2022</a> mandate that all new plumbing fixtures meet minimum efficiency standards.</p><h3 id="link-2323e99a"><span>What about cleaning my yard and sidewalk?</span></h3><p>It’s best to put aside the hose and use a broom to sweep outdoor areas like sidewalks, driveways and patios. City officials are also urging residents to rake up leaves and brush — which can catch on fire — and put them in compost bins for curbside pickup.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/drought-watersense" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Environmental Protection Agency</a> recommends avoiding watering lawns and other outdoor plants during the hottest parts of the day, when the water will evaporate fastest. The agency even suggests letting lawns go dry during periods of drought. Just because grass is yellow doesn’t mean it’s dead — dormant grass can revive when drought conditions ease.</p><p>The city has <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/water-saving-tips.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a list of more ways to save water indoors and outside</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A brush fire in Prospect Park on Nov. 8. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h3 id="link-1bb3534c"><span>Only you can prevent forest fires.</span></h3><p>Human actions can set off brush fires in city green space.</p><p>Earlier in November, after a brush fire burned two acres in Prospect Park, Mr. Adams <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/822-24/mayor-adams-bans-grilling-parks-reminds-new-yorkers-take-additional-precautions-conserve" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced a ban on grilling</a> in the city parks. That means no roasting hot dogs or toasting marshmallows, even in parks’ designated barbecue areas.</p><p>Smoking in parks and setting off fireworks anywhere in the city are already illegal.</p><h3 id="link-4576a8d3"><span>What’s the city doing?</span></h3><p>Several city agencies, including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Fire, Sanitation and Police Departments, are cutting back on how often they wash vehicles. Mr. Adams cautioned in a <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/839-24/mayor-adams-elevates-drought-level-warning-pauses-delaware-aqueduct-repair-project-orders-city#/0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, “Our city vehicles may look a bit dirtier, and our subways may look a bit dustier, but it’s what we have to do to delay or stave off a more serious drought emergency.”</p><p>The New York City Housing Authority is taking steps to find and fix leaks and replace toilets and sinks with efficient fixtures that use less water in buildings it manages. The agency also said it would cut back on watering lawns.</p><p>The city also announced that it would pause a $2 billion project to fix a leak beneath the Delaware Aqueduct, which delivers about half of the city’s water from reservoirs upstate. Pausing work on the repair will allow the city to tap into four reservoirs in the Catskill region that had been cut off when the aqueduct closed temporarily.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
