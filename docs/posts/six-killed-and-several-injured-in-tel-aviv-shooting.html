    <h1>Six Killed and Several Injured in Tel Aviv Shooting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Israeli police and emergency services said at least six people were killed and 12 more were injured when two gunmen opened fire on a light rail train in Tel Aviv shortly after residents were urged to seek shelter from an Iranian missile attack.</p><p>The police called the attack an act of terrorism and said the gunmen were “neutralized” on the scene. They urged residents of the city to remain calm and follow the directions of the military’s Home Front Command.</p><p>Shortly after the shooting, Israel’s air defense system intercepted a swarm of missiles over Tel Aviv. Loud booms and bright explosions filled the sky. “The police forces are handling the scene under a missile attack,” the police said in a statement about the shooting. “The event is under control.”</p><p>The shooting took place at a perilous moment in the Middle East. Israel invaded Lebanon on Monday after leading a series of punishing attacks on Hezbollah, the armed Lebanese militia and proxy to Iran. </p><p>No group claimed immediate responsibility for the shooting on Tuesday night. The authorities described the shooting as a terror attack. Recent incidents have brought Israel’s conflicts creeping ever closer to Tel Aviv, a city that often feels physically and psychologically removed from the violence.</p><p>The shooting occurred on Jerusalem Boulevard, a major tree-lined thoroughfare and important public transportation route in the city’s Jaffa neighborhood. Israel’s emergency service agency, Magen David Adom, said it was treating the injured. </p><p>Nadav Matzner, a spokesman for the group, said six of the 12 people who were wounded in the attack were severely injured.</p><p>Images broadcast on Israeli television showed two gunmen in street clothes carrying large rifles. Video shared widely online showed injured people lying on the sidewalk on Jerusalem Boulevard.</p></div></div>
