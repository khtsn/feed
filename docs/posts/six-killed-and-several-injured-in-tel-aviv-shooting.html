They urged residents of the city to remain calm and follow the directions of the military’s Home Front Command.</p><p>Shortly after the shooting, Israel’s air defense system intercepted a swarm of missiles over Tel Aviv. Loud booms and bright explosions filled the sky. “The police forces are handling the scene under a missile attack,” the police said in a statement about the shooting. “The event is under control.”</p><p>The shooting took place at a perilous moment in the Middle East. Israel invaded Lebanon on Monday after leading a series of punishing attacks on Hezbollah, the armed Lebanese militia and proxy to Iran. </p><p>No group claimed immediate responsibility for the shooting on Tuesday night. The authorities described the shooting as a terror attack. Recent incidents have brought Israel’s conflicts creeping ever closer to Tel Aviv, a city that often feels physically and psychologically removed from the violence.</p><p>The shooting occurred on Jerusalem Boulevard, a major tree-lined thoroughfare and important public transportation route in the city’s Jaffa neighborhood. Israel’s emergency service agency, Magen David Adom, said it was treating the injured. </p><p>Nadav Matzner, a spokesman for the group, said six of the 12 people who were wounded in the attack were severely injured. </p><p>Images broadcast on Israeli television showed two gunmen in street clothes carrying large rifles. Video shared widely online showed injured people lying on the sidewalk on Jerusalem Boulevard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The shooting occurred after a series of attempted aerial attacks on Tel Aviv by Iran-backed forces in Lebanon and Yemen, and six weeks after Hamas and Islamic Jihad took responsibility for what the groups said was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/middleeast/tel-aviv-bomb-hamas.html" title="">suicide bombing</a> in Tel Aviv.</p><p>The Israeli police did not describe that incident as a suicide bombing, but if it were it would have been the first suicide attack in the city since 2016. At that time, Hamas and Islamic Jihad had threatened attacks in response to the “continued civilian displacement and killings” of Palestinians.</p><p>The shooting on Tuesday took place shortly after Tel Aviv residents were advised by Israel’s home front command to stay close to bomb shelters and avoid any unnecessary travel or outdoor activities. The streets of the city were quickly emptied.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israel Invades Lebanon:</strong><strong> </strong>The Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-ground-invasion.html">began a ground invasion of southern Lebanon</a>, targeting what it said was Hezbollah military infrastructure in villages close to the Israel-Lebanon border.</p></li><li><p><strong>Striking on Multiple Fronts:</strong><strong> </strong>The escalation of violence between Israel and Iran-backed proxies across the Middle East <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-yemen-gaza.html">threatened to bring the combatants</a> closer to an all-out regional war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran Projects Caution: </strong>Leaders in Tehran suggested it would be the Lebanese militia that would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-hezbollah-israel-nasrallah.html">strike back at Israel</a> after the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, and bombings in Beirut.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biden-Netanyahu Disconnect:</strong><strong> </strong>Israeli officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/us/politics/hezbollah-strike-nasrallah-biden-netanyahu.html">gave their American counterparts no advance warning</a> of the strike that killed Nasrallah.
