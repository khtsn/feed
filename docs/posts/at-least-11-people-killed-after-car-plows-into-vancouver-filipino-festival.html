Last night, as thousands of members of Vancouver’s Filipino community gathered for an important cultural celebration, the actions of a single person shattered our collective sense of safety. A man driving a black Audi SUV drove into a large crowd of people at the Lapu Lapu street festival in South Vancouver. There are now 11 confirmed fatalities. We believe dozens more are injured, some seriously, and the number of dead could rise in the coming days or weeks. The driver of the vehicle was the lone occupant, and he was arrested at the crime scene by members of the Vancouver Police Department after bystanders and witnesses intervened to detain him. He remains in custody. I can now say with confidence that the evidence in this case does not lead us to believe this was an act of terrorism. I can also tell you that the person we have in custody does have a significant history of interactions with police and health care professionals related to mental health. The actual event was occurring in a closed area of that high school, and there was no access to vehicles for the main part of it, of the area. The area where the tragedy occurred was lined with food trucks, and that’s what that street was meant for. And there were no barriers denying people access to those food trucks.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/27/multimedia/27xp-vancouver-wqbc/27xp-vancouver-wqbc-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The police in Vancouver said a driver plowed an SUV into a crowd at a Filipino street festival on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Rich Lam/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p><time datetime="2025-04-27T22:21:15-04:00"><span>April 27, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>10:21 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>At first, no one found it suspicious that the black Audi SUV had gone around a portable barrier into a street packed with festivalgoers lining up at food trucks and checking out artisans’ wares.</p><p>It was about 8 p.m. Saturday, and Apl.de.ap, a Filipino American rapper and a founding member of the Black Eyed Peas, had finished a concert that was the signature event of the Lapu Lapu Festival organized by the Filipino community in Vancouver, British Columbia.</p><p>At first the large SUV crawled through the crowd, and Kris Pangilinan, who was selling clothing at a booth, assumed that it had been let in to help another merchant load up his wares and close shop.</p><p>Then, it started to speed up.</p><p>“He sideswiped someone where the vendors are,” Mr. Pangilinan said on Sunday after a largely sleepless night. “All of a sudden I hear this exhaust and the sound of the acceleration of the vehicle.

Aquino, the chairman of the Filipino Canadian Community and Cultural Society of B.C. “There was a lot of panic, and relief when somebody answers.”</p><p>Mable Elmore, a provincial lawmaker and festival organizer who turned her office into a refuge for people fleeing the killing, struggled, and sometimes failed, to maintain her composure at a news conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It was a beautiful day for a celebration,” she said, recalling the ideal weather the festival had been graced with.</p><p>Lapu Lapu Day, an annual celebration in the Philippines, commemorates Datu Lapu Lapu, an Indigenous leader who stood up against Spanish colonization.

Mr. Carney and Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the third-place New Democratic Party, both largely abandoned their schedules for Sunday. Mr. Carney still planned to go to Vancouver, but to meet with mourners rather than rally his supporters.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Last night, families lost a sister, a brother, a mother, a father, a son or a daughter,” Mr. Carney told reporters in Hamilton, Ontario. “Those families are living every family’s nightmare.”</p><p>Addressing Filipino Canadians, he said: “I join all Canadians in mourning with you. I know Canadians are united with you.”</p><p>Pierre Poilivere, Mr. Carney’s Conservative rival, continued to campaign but made an appearance at a Filipino church in suburban Toronto.</p><p>President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. of the Philippines said in a statement on Sunday that he was “completely shattered to hear about the terrible incident” in Vancouver, and he expressed his “deepest sympathies” to the families of the victims.</p><p>Vancouver prides itself on being a diverse, multicultural city, with more than half of its residents identifying themselves as a “visible minority,” according to 2021 census.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Eby, the province’s premier, noted on Sunday that Filipinos are prominent in health and child care as well as in the workforces of long-term care homes.</p><p>“We’re going to stand with them and support them just like they support us,” Mr. Eby said. “It’s their turn to get care from us.” </p><p>A hip-hop artist who performed at the festival, Jacob Bureros, said he was signing autographs, posing for photos and “feeling on top of the world” when he heard the SUV tear through the crowd and then saw the driver try to escape.</p><p>“He gets out of the car, takes off, and I start running to the left,” Mr. Bureros said. “Three of us surrounded the guy, screaming at him.” He said a security guard and event organizer stepped in to protect the suspect from retaliation.</p><p>This was the first mass killing involving a vehicle in Canada since 2021, when a far-right extremist drove a pickup truck into five members of a Muslim family in London, Ontario, killing four of them. A judge determined that the man was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/world/canada/muslim-killings-terrorism-nathaniel-veltman.html" title="">motivated by white supremacist ideology</a> and deemed the killings to be an act of terrorism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In 2018, a man in Toronto used a rented van to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/world/canada/toronto-van-rampage.html" title="">run down and kill 11 pedestrians,</a> injuring another 15. Most of the victims were women.</p><p>In recent years, police forces in Canada have regularly blocked roads leading to venues hosting large crowds with snowplows or gravel-filled dump trucks.</p><p>That step was not taken around the scene of the Vancouver attack. </p><p>Underscoring the authorities’ initial assessment that the attack was an isolated event, the police allowed a 10-kilometer run that drew more than 45,000 entrants last year to go ahead on Sunday.</p><p>The one-off nature, however, did little to console many in the Filipino community.</p><p>“Why us — why they would harm such a beautiful community?” Mr. Pangilinan, the merchant, asked. “It’s definitely something that I’m going to have to live with for the rest of my life. And we will just pay tribute to those affected and those who died.”</p><p>Sarah Berman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Vancouver.<br/></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ian Austen reports on Canada for The Times based in Ottawa.
