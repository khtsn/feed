Last night, as thousands of members of Vancouver’s Filipino community gathered for an important cultural celebration, the actions of a single person shattered our collective sense of safety. A man driving a black Audi SUV drove into a large crowd of people at the Lapu Lapu street festival in South Vancouver. There are now 11 confirmed fatalities. We believe dozens more are injured, some seriously, and the number of dead could rise in the coming days or weeks. The driver of the vehicle was the lone occupant, and he was arrested at the crime scene by members of the Vancouver Police Department after bystanders and witnesses intervened to detain him. He remains in custody. I can now say with confidence that the evidence in this case does not lead us to believe this was an act of terrorism. I can also tell you that the person we have in custody does have a significant history of interactions with police and health care professionals related to mental health. The actual event was occurring in a closed area of that high school, and there was no access to vehicles for the main part of it, of the area. The area where the tragedy occurred was lined with food trucks, and that’s what that street was meant for. And there were no barriers denying people access to those food trucks.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/27/multimedia/27xp-vancouver-wqbc/27xp-vancouver-wqbc-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The police in Vancouver said a driver plowed an SUV into a crowd at a Filipino street festival on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Rich Lam/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p><time datetime="2025-04-27T15:43:38-04:00"><span>April 27, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>3:43 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>A driver plowed into a group of partygoers attending a Filipino street festival on Saturday evening in Vancouver, British Columbia, killing at least 11 people, the city’s interim police chief said, adding that there may be deaths among the “dozens” of people who were injured.</p><p>The interim chief, Steve Rai, said on Sunday that a 30-year-old man from Vancouver was in custody, and that the police had previously had “substantive contact with him over mental health issues.” He declined to attribute any motive to the festival attack.</p><p>Investigators had ruled out terrorism as a motive, Vancouver police said in an email early Sunday, but they did not offer further details.

When asked by reporters whether the incident was related to the elections, Mr. Rai said, “I don’t know anything about that.”</p><p>Underscoring the police’s initial assessment that the attack was an isolated event, the police will allow a 10-kilometer run that drew more than 45,000 entrants last year to go ahead on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The incident occurred just as Apl.de.ap, a Filipino American rapper and a founding member of the Black Eyed Peas, had finished a concert performance at the festival on the grounds of a high school.</p><p>Alan Kane, a witness, told CBC Radio that just before the attack, the crowd on the street where it occurred was “wall to wall” and lined up for food trucks. He said that it appeared that the street was blocked to traffic only by plastic barriers.</p><p>Several witnesses told Canadian news outlets that those barriers had been pulled back before the incident. Kris Pangilinan, who was selling clothing at a booth, said that some cars and trucks had been allowed into the crowded street to allow vendors to pack up their stands. The Audi SUV, he said, had initially moved cautiously into the crowd before rapidly accelerating, knocking down victims.</p><p>“It looked like we literally in a war zone,” Mr. Pangilinan told the CBC.</p><p>Other witnesses said the driver tried to run away before being subdued by bystanders.</p><p>This was the first mass killing involving a vehicle in Canada since 2021, when a far-right extremist drove a pickup truck into five members of a Muslim family in London, Ontario, killing four of them. A judge ruled that the man was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/world/canada/muslim-killings-terrorism-nathaniel-veltman.html" title="">motivated by white supremacist ideology</a> and deemed the killings to be an act of terrorism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In 2018, a man in Toronto used a rented van to run down and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/world/canada/toronto-van-rampage.html" title="">kill 11 pedestrians</a>, injuring another 15. Most of the victims were women.</p><p>In recent years, police forces in Canada have regularly blocked roads leading to venues hosting large crowds with snowplows or gravel-filled dump trucks, a measure that did not appear to have been taken in Vancouver.</p><p>“Last night, families lost a sister, a brother, a mother, a father, a son or a daughter,” Mr. Carney told reporters in Hamilton, Ontario. “Those families are living every family’s nightmare.”</p><p>Addressing Filipino Canadians, he added: “I join all Canadians in mourning with you. I know Canadians are united with you.” </p><p>Mr. Carney canceled the largest of his events scheduled for the final day of campaigning on Sunday, and it was unclear if he would follow a plan to conclude his campaign in the evening in Vancouver.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party and a member of Parliament from British Columbia, canceled all of his final campaign events except one. Mr. Singh had left the festival not long before the attack.</p><p>Vancouver’s mayor, Ken Sim, <a href="https://x.com/KenSimCity/status/1916350887288836313" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he was “shocked and deeply saddened by the horrific incident.”</p><p>Vancouver prides itself on being a diverse, multicultural city, with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/2021-census-minority-demographics-metro-vancouver-bc-1.6630164" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than half of its residents</a> identifying themselves as a “visible minority,” according to 2021 census.</p><p>Lapu Lapu Day is an annual celebration in the Philippines, marking the memory of Datu Lapu Lapu, who stood up against Spanish colonization. In Vancouver, <a href="https://lapulapuday.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the festival</a> was established as an annual event in 2023.</p><p>President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. of the Philippines said in a statement on Sunday that he was “completely shattered to hear about the terrible incident” in Vancouver, and he expressed his “deepest sympathies” to the families of the victims.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ali Watkins covers international news and is based in London.</p></div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.</p></div><div><p>Ian Austen reports on Canada for The Times based in Ottawa.
