Republicans would need eight Democrats to join them in voting to allow the bill to advance, and Mr. Schumer privately indicated to Democrats on Thursday that he had lined up the votes.</p><p>If the Senate fail to pass the funding extension, federal funding would lapse at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday.</p><p>Mr. Schumer’s abrupt decision to reverse himself and allow the spending legislation to advance stunned many of his colleagues and angered many Democratic lawmakers and progressive activists. Many in his party have vociferously opposed the temporary spending measure, arguing that it was a capitulation to President Trump, and have said that they would rather shut the government down than vote for it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As recently as Wednesday, Mr. Schumer was arguing strongly against the bill, instead proposing a monthlong alternative to allow Congress to reach an agreement on individual spending measures with specific instructions over how federal funding should be doled out.</p><p>But he reversed course on Thursday, with a shutdown looming and amid concerns that Democrats would be blamed. He argued that a shutdown would only play into the hands of Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, ceding more power to them as they move to defund and dismantle whole swaths of the federal government. In that scenario, he said, the Trump administration could decide which federal workers would be “nonessential” and furloughed. And he warned that Republicans would have little incentive to reopen the government once it shut down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Chuck Schumer said he would back a Republican bill to fund the government.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“As bad as the C.R. is,” Mr. Schumer said on Friday morning, referring to the bill known as a continuing resolution, “I believe that allowing President Trump to take more power is a far worse option.”</p><p>It is unclear how many Democrats might join Mr. Schumer in voting for the measure, or who might do so. Other than Mr. Schumer, only one Democrat, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has publicly supported the bill.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A number of centrist Democrats, as well as Democrats facing tough re-election contests next year, who had been as potential supporters of the measure, have said they would oppose it. Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia, who will face voters next year, said in a statement that he would vote to block the legislation in part because it failed “to impose any constraints on the reckless and out-of-control Trump administration.”</p><p>“Both parties in Congress must fulfill our constitutional obligation to check the president,” Mr. Ossoff said.</p><p>At issue for Democrats is that the stopgap measure does not contain the specific congressional instructions to allocate money for programs usually included in spending bills. Democrats Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the party’s lead appropriator, have warned that the lack of explicit directions would essentially create slush funds for the Trump administration at a time when they have already disregarded spending directives set by Congress.</p><p>“We have already seen how far President Trump, Elon Musk and Russ Vought are willing to twist — and outright break — our laws to suit their will,” Ms. Murray said. “But House Republicans are setting them up to make everything so far look like child’s play.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Congress Cedes Power:</strong> On spending, oversight and other issues, Republican lawmakers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-republicans-congress-power.html">willingly turned over their constitutional powers</a> over to the Trump White House.</p></li><li><p><strong>Obscure Laws, ICE Agents and Fear:</strong> President Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trump-crackdown-dissent.html">clamping down broadly on dissent</a> using the tools of the federal government.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Big Bet:</strong> President Trump’s simultaneous trade wars with Canada, Mexico, China and the European Union amount to a huge economic and political gamble: that Americans will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-manufacturing-economy-risk.html">endure months or years of economic pain</a> in return for the distant hope of re-industrializing the American heartland.</p></li><li><p><strong>Birthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court:</strong> Trump administration lawyers have asked the justices to lift a nationwide pause on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-birthright-citizenship-supreme-court.html">the president’s order ending birthright citizenship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shake-Up at the I.R.S.:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-irs-lawyer-doge.html">replaced the top lawyer at the Internal Revenue Service</a>, a move that came as officials sought to gain access to the agency’s data.</p></li><li><p><strong>E.P.A.: </strong>Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/climate/epa-zeldin-rollbacks-pollution.html">reframed the purpose of the E.P.A</a>., saying his agency’s mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel Ban:</strong> The fate of thousands of Afghans waiting to reach the United States after serving with American troops was thrown into limbo after Trump took office.
