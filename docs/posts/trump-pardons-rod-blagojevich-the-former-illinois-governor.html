Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor of Illinois who was convicted of corruption in 2011 in a scheme to sell a Senate seat being vacated by Barack Obama.</p><p>“It’s my honor to do it,” Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office of the pardon. “I’ve watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people, some of the same people that I had to deal with.”</p><p>The pardon was the latest overture between the president and the former governor, who is still known in Chicago simply as “Blago.” Just five years ago, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/us/politics/trump-pardon-blagojevich-debartolo.html" title="">commuted Mr. Blagojevich’s 14-year sentence</a>, allowing him to be released from a Colorado prison after eight years and return to his family home on the North Side of Chicago.</p><p>Mr. Blagojevich spoke to reporters outside his home late Monday, thanking Mr. Trump and blasting a “broken justice system.” He said he had been wronged by prosecutors who misused their power to charge him. “I want to say to the people of Illinois two things: Number one, I never raised your taxes, and number two, I didn’t do it,” Mr. Blagojevich said. “It’s all political talk.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The former governor has insisted that he never broken any laws and that he was the victim of an overzealous Justice Department during the Obama administration. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/us/rod-blagojevich-sentence.html" title="">Federal prosecutors</a> said Mr. Blagojevich’s conduct — trying to benefit from the appointment of a Senate seat, among other actions — was so abysmal that it “would make Lincoln roll over in his grave.”</p><p>But he found a sympathetic audience in Mr. Trump. While Mr. Blagojevich was awaiting trial 15 years ago, he made appeals to Mr. Trump, appearing on “The Celebrity Apprentice” when Mr. Trump was the host. And Mr. Blagojevich’s wife, Patti, spoke on Fox News while her husband was in prison, a move that seemed calculated to grab Mr. Trump’s attention.</p><p>Mr. Blagojevich was the fourth governor of Illinois in recent decades to serve time in prison, in a state that has seen its share of corruption charges levied against elected officials from the Chicago City Council to the Statehouse in Springfield.</p><p>Michael J. Madigan, the former speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, is currently on federal trial in Chicago, facing racketeering and bribery charges. A jury has been deliberating for nine days so far without a verdict.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Bosman is the Chicago bureau chief for The Times, writing and reporting stories from around the Midwest.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julie-bosman">More about Julie Bosman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
