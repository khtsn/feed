name="articleBody"><div><div><p>Two weeks after Ukraine’s surprise incursion into Russia, the Kremlin’s forces have slowed the advance, with the hardening front line in the Kursk region of Russia setting up the next phase of a battle with great political stakes for both sides.</p><p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has pledged a decisive response to the first invasion of Russian territory since World War II. But so far, the response has been focused on containing the incursion rather than reversing it, raising the question of what Russia’s depleted military is willing to risk to expel the invaders — or if it is capable of doing so.</p><p>The unforeseen invasion of Kursk has exposed the ongoing intelligence failures of the Russian military as well as Moscow’s shortage of battle-ready reserves in a war fought along a 750-mile front. Ukraine’s rapid gains have also upended the global perception of a slow but unstoppable Russian march toward victory in a war of attrition.</p><p>As Ukrainian forces advanced, videos of surrendering groups of Russian conscripts and border guards shocked many in Russia, shaking Mr. Putin’s narrative that the war in Ukraine was being fought far away by well-paid, determined volunteers.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Still, the battle in Russia’s border regions remains in its initial stages, and the present pace of the Kursk incursion is giving Mr. Putin time to calibrate his response. Instead of weakening the Kremlin’s grip on power, the invasion may eventually cause more Russian citizens to rally around the flag, analysts said.</p><p>The Kursk invasion “is certainly a blow to the Kremlin’s reputation,” Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political scientist, <a href="https://x.com/Stanovaya/status/1825591269541785831" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media on Tuesday</a>. But “it is unlikely to spark a significant rise in social or political discontent among the population, nor will it lead to an elite rebellion.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian troops driving a tank along a main road in the Sumy region of Ukraine, near the Russian border, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Militarily, from the Russian perspective, Kyiv’s gambit has also created an opportunity to further deplete Ukraine’s own limited forces and make gains in other areas of the front. That could turn a short-term political victory for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine into a strategic defeat, Russian military analysts said.</p><p>After being initially heralded as a brilliant military stroke, the Kursk operation could end up becoming a trap for the Ukrainian Army, those analysts noted. </p></div></div><div><div><p>“The invasion of Kursk has merely expanded and prolonged a war of attrition, in which Russia enjoys a resource advantage,” said Vasily Kashin, a political scientist at Moscow’s state-run Higher School of Economics, who studies the political impact of Russia’s war. </p><p>Among the options for Russia’s generals, analysts said, are trying to muster an overwhelming new force to crush Ukraine’s bridgehead in Kursk or using their advantage in aviation and artillery to gradually pound the forces into a retreat.</p><p>Both those strategies could take weeks, or even months to carry out, and would come at the expense of other areas of the front, reflecting the reality of a war where neither side has enough resources to force its opponent to end the fighting. </p><p>Mr. Putin himself — who must balance the political cost of losing Russian territory against that of drafting more soldiers — has given little hint of his strategy. On Tuesday, he toured a provincial sweets factory, examining packages of sugar-free apple candy.</p></div></div><div><p>The calm of that scene was in sharp contrast to the initial days of the Kursk invasion, when Mr. Putin derided subordinates and promised a decisive response.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>This photograph released by Russian state media shows President Vladimir V.

They brushed aside the poorly equipped and inexperienced Russian conscripts sent to guard that section of the front and pushed tens of miles into Russian territory.</p><p>Some analysts believe the Russian command did not commit significant forces to this area because it lacked obvious military value. “The strike hit emptiness,” said Dmitry Kuznets, a military analyst with the Russian independent news outlet Meduza, which operates from Latvia after being outlawed by the Kremlin.</p><p>Another Russian military expert, Ruslan Pukhov, thinks the Russian leadership may have also been lulled into complacency by the negotiation overtures put out by Kyiv this summer.</p><p>After the first week of fighting, Ukraine claimed to control almost 400 square miles of Russian territory and to have taken hundreds of prisoners.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But as Ukraine’s supply lines became strained and as Russia pulled in reinforcements, the pace of advance fell significantly in the second week. Most military analysts believe Ukraine no longer threatens any strategic targets, such as Kursk’s nuclear plant or the provincial capital.</p><p>Those analysts believe that Russia has now concentrated enough forces in Kursk to largely bog down the invaders in the same type of positional warfare seen in other fronts of the war.</p><p>To counter the incursion, the Russian command has relied on a combination of conscripts, volunteers from units that were being formed in the rear at the time of the attack and handpicked experienced units from relatively quiet sections of the front in Ukraine, Mr. Kuznets said.</p><p>Russia’s Black Sea Marines, for example, have been moved to Kursk from the Kherson region of Ukraine, where the front has long followed the difficult-to-breach Dnipro River, Mr. Kuznets said. Other parts of the initial Kursk reaction force have come from the Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions of Ukraine, where the front has barely moved in weeks, a Russian military analyst, Valery Shiriaev, told Newsroom, an independent Russian news outlet.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Russian prisoners of war being held in northern Ukraine last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Kuznets said that while Mr. Putin has time to plan the Kursk riposte, he cannot allow the Russian territory to lie in enemy hands indefinitely, without risking a nationalist backlash.</p><p>The authorities have indirectly acknowledged that the fight to push out the Ukrainians may take weeks or even months by floating the idea that refugees from the occupied parts of the Kursk region be given financial aid to resettle in other parts of Russia. </p><p>“If Ukraine hoped that the shock of the attack would lead Russians to lose faith in the outlook of the war, then this is not happening,” said the analyst Mr. Kashin. “More likely it will lead to anger, and acceptance that the war was inevitable.”</p><p>The Kursk offensive did expose the flaws in Russia’s strategy of fighting a prolonged war, largely with volunteers lured by ever-increasing payments.</p><p>That strategy has allowed Russia to mostly replace its losses in Ukraine without resorting to another round of unpopular mobilization. But it has also meant that the flow of volunteers has not been enough to create strategic reserves able to respond to a new crisis, like the incursion into Kursk.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Russian conscripts in Moscow last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>In cobbling together a reaction force, the Russian military command has thus far left one part of the front untouched. None of the units currently fighting in Kursk have come from the Donetsk region in the east of Ukraine, according to analysts, where Russia is currently pressing an offensive.</p><p>Since the invasion of Kursk, the Russian forces have only accelerated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-pokrovsk-kursk.html" title="">their advance on the strategic Donetsk stronghold of Pokrovsk</a>. In recent days, they have also made gains in other areas of eastern Ukraine, which has seen the most brutal battles of the war.</p><p>The Ukrainian government has said that it has moved some units from the front lines to support the Kursk incursion, potentially aiding the Russian advances.</p><p>Although the long-term impact of the Kursk invasion remains unclear, one certainty is that it has expanded the front by an additional 60 miles or so for the foreseeable future, forcing both sides to stretch their limited forces even further.</p><p>Ultimately, the expansion of the war to new areas will, over time, favor the side with bigger resources, the Russian analysts said. With triple the population and a larger industrial base, that side remains Russia.</p><p>Oleg Matsnev<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anatoly Kurmanaev covers Russia and its transformation following the invasion of Ukraine.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anatoly-kurmanaev">More about Anatoly Kurmanaev</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Ukraine’s Incursion:</strong> Russian troops defending a pocket of territory in Russia’s Kursk region were at risk of becoming encircled, military analysts said, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/europe/ukraine-attacks-russia-bridges-border.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">after Ukraine bombed bridges</a> that are the only routes for resupply or retreat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kyiv’s Risky Bet:</strong> President Volodymyr Zelensky wants to hold Russian territory as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-putin-ceasefire.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">leverage in future peace talks</a>.
