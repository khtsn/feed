same prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, that has housed men accused of being members of Al Qaeda, U.S. defense officials said on Wednesday.</p><p>The Pentagon made the disclosure as U.S. forces are preparing a tent city for migrants, in compliance with an order from President Trump, on a separate portion of the base. But the Defense Department said the first group of 10 deportees, who were brought to the base on Tuesday, were too dangerous for the migrant site.</p><p>Instead they were put in a vacant section of the military prison that houses terrorism suspects and convicts, far from the area where other deportees will be held by the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>On Wednesday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said the men were members of a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. government last year <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/tren-de-aragua-transnational-criminal-organization/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labeled a “transnational criminal organization”</a> for human trafficking and other criminal acts. The gang traces its beginnings to a prison in Venezuela.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The U.S. government has long held migrants at Guantánamo Bay, primarily Cubans and Haitians who have been picked up at sea. But the wartime prisoners have always been kept away from the migrants. Migrants are in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security. Suspected Al Qaeda members are in the custody of the Defense Department.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/05/us/politics/immigrant-detention-guantanamo.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/05/multimedia/2025-02-04-immigration-gitmo-index/2025-02-04-immigration-gitmo-index-articleLarge-v3.jpg"/></p><div><h2>See Where Trump Is Expanding Immigrant Detention at Guantánamo</h2><p>Documents and satellite imagery show how much buildup is underway at the military site.</p></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The decision to fly migrants from within the United States to the base comes as Mr. Trump ramps up deportations and immigration enforcement across the country. Last week, he ordered his administration to expand a small, 120-bed center on the base to hold up to 30,000 deportees.</p><p>On Tuesday evening, U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a video on social media showing the men being loaded onto the Air Force C-17 plane in El Paso, Texas.</p><p>“Flights to Guantánamo Bay have begun,” the <a href="https://x.com/CBP/status/1886936769242845237" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post said</a>. “The worst of the worst have no place in our homeland.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Immigration officials hold around 40,000 detainees in private prisons and local county lockups across the United States.
