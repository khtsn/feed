But the Defense Department said the first group of 10 deportees, who were brought to the base on Tuesday, were too dangerous for the migrant site.</p><p>Instead they were put in a vacant section of the military prison that houses terrorism suspects and convicts, far from the area where other deportees will be held by the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>On Wednesday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said the men were members of a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. government last year <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/tren-de-aragua-transnational-criminal-organization/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labeled a “transnational criminal organization”</a> for human trafficking and other criminal acts. The gang traces its beginnings to a prison in Venezuela.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The U.S. government has long held migrants at Guantánamo Bay, primarily Cubans and Haitians who have been picked up at sea. But the wartime prisoners have always been kept away from the migrants. Migrants are in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security. Suspected Al Qaeda members are in the custody of the Defense Department.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The decision to fly migrants from within the United States to the base comes as Mr. Trump ramps up deportations and immigration enforcement across the country. Last week, he ordered his administration to expand a small, 120-bed center on the base to hold up to 30,000 deportees.</p><p>On Tuesday evening, U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a video on social media showing the men being loaded onto the Air Force C-17 plane in El Paso, Texas.</p><p>“Flights to Guantánamo Bay have begun,” the <a href="https://x.com/CBP/status/1886936769242845237" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post said</a>. “The worst of the worst have no place in our homeland.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Immigration officials hold around 40,000 detainees in private prisons and local county lockups across the United States. But Mr. Trump suggested last week that the use of Guantánamo could double detention capacity.</p><p>It is unclear how long the migrants will be held at the facility and where they will be taken next, but U.S. officials said on Wednesday that they would be sent to their home country or to another “appropriate destination.”</p><p>“These 10 high-threat individuals are currently being housed in vacant detention facilities,” the Defense Department said in a statement on Wednesday. “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is taking this measure to ensure the safe and secure detention of these individuals until they can be transported to their country of origin or other appropriate destination.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A prisoner inside the Camp 6 detention center in 2019. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The Venezuelans are being held in a 200-cell medium-security prison building, called Camp 6, that has communal dining and recreation areas.

The two sides are divided by Guantánamo Bay.</p><p>The prison building where the Venezuelans were held is next to a smaller, 75-cell maximum security prison, called Camp 5. As of Wednesday, that was where the Pentagon was holding all 15 wartime detainees, including the men accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks and other long-held detainees in the war against terrorism.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt">More about Eric Schmitt</a></span></p></div><div><p>Carol Rosenberg reports on the wartime prison and court at Guantánamo Bay.
