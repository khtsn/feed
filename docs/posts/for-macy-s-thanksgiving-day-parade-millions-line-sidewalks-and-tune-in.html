There were also a handful of protesters.</p><p>The crowd this year was thinner, most likely because of the persistent damp. Those who braved the rain, however, did so happily.</p><p>Kevin James, an auxiliary sergeant in the New York Police Department, said he volunteered for the parade for his 15th year in a row, despite the wet.</p><p>“I could be with my family,” he said. “But I’d rather be here with the people.”</p><p>Darely Atauje, 8, was wet through, but the parade made it worth it, she said.
