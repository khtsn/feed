Officials fear that hundreds or even thousands could be dead, far higher than the current confirmed toll of 14.</p><p>Tropical Storm Chido, which hit over the weekend, destroyed homes, schools and businesses on the tiny archipelago, with wind gusts of up to 124 miles per hour. Forecasters said that it was the worst storm in 90 years to hit the territory.</p><p>Mohamed Abdallah, the father of a family of seven, said that they had “lost everything.” As he picked up pieces of iron on the streets to rebuild a shelter on Monday, he said, “It will take us a while to even be safe.”</p><p>France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, led an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday evening to coordinate the government’s response. France has started <a href="https://x.com/SebLecornu/status/1868339808525045849" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aid flights</a> from Réunion, another French territory in the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I think that there will be several hundred” deaths, François-Xavier Bieuville, France’s top-ranking representative on Mayotte, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1390286958620458" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> a local news channel. “Maybe we will be closer to a thousand, maybe several thousand.”</p><p>The interior ministry cautioned that officials would likely be unable to count all the victims. About a third of the territory’s 320,000 people are undocumented immigrants, the ministry said, which could complicate official tallies. Also, many residents are Muslims, who traditionally try to bury their dead within 24 hours.</p><p>“These elements mean that the number of deaths that are officially counted will probably be much lower than reality,” the ministry said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In Pamanzi, home to Mayotte’s airport and many administrative buildings, the buzz of chain saws filled the air on Monday as emergency workers scrambled to clear uprooted trees and debris. Doctors worked in flooded health care centers. Children slept on mattresses outside of houses that had been torn apart.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Hundreds of people lined up to collect water from public taps that had been spared. Shop owners kept their businesses closed because of electricity blackouts. The cyclone destroyed entire slums, and the remains of precarious shelters made of rugged iron littered the streets.</p><p>“There are people who haven’t had anything to eat or drink since yesterday,” Salama Ramia, a French senator who represents Mayotte, <a href="https://x.com/BFMTV/status/1868662305006764340" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told French television outlet BFMTV</a> on Monday from the archipelago.</p><p>Water use on the archipelago had already been restricted in recent weeks because of drought. Last year, Mayotte experienced its worst drought in over two decades, which had led to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-mayotte-water-crisis-protests-f079fb9b8f2b4057cd06687bb88d9fb9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">protests over accusations of mismanagement</a> and cuts to service.</p><p>Ms. Ramia said many areas had no electricity, no phone network and barely any food and water. She said emergency workers had not yet been able to reach some neighborhoods that had been demolished, adding to uncertainty about the death toll.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“We are worried about what we will find,” she said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16chido-add-01-lpwq/16chido-add-01-lpwq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16chido-add-01-lpwq/16chido-add-01-lpwq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16chido-add-01-lpwq/16chido-add-01-lpwq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Troops with a netted pallet of supplies next to a truck on an airport tarmac." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16chido-add-01-lpwq/16chido-add-01-lpwq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16chido-add-01-lpwq/16chido-add-01-lpwq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16chido-add-01-lpwq/16chido-add-01-lpwq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16chido-add-01-lpwq/16chido-add-01-lpwq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1350w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d98a60d7-923a-5879-9159-775414df4993" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>French military officers receiving emergency supplies in Mayotte on Monday, after Tropical Cyclone Chido hit the islands.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chafion Madi/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mayotte, France’s poorest territory, was already struggling before the storm hit on Saturday. Mayotte’s health care system was “on its last legs,” according to a <a href="https://www.senat.fr/rap/r21-833/r21-833-syn.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2022 French Senate report</a>, with a single overburdened hospital and a severe shortage of doctors.</p><p>Geneviève Darrieussecq, the outgoing French health minister, <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/politique/cyclone-chido-a-mayotte-la-situation-est-tres-degradee-affirme-la-ministre-demissionnaire-de-la-sante-genevieve-darrieussecq_6958376.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told French television</a> on Monday morning that the official death toll was 14 people so far. She also said that Mayotte’s hospital had been “seriously damaged” and that access to care had become extremely difficult after the storm.</p><p>About 80 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, five times more than the percentage in the rest of France. Many people on Mayotte are crowded into shanty towns, which were hit especially hard. Videos and photos showed the destruction: Homes were destroyed, debris was strewn about hillsides and trees had been ripped apart by wind.</p><p>“Some shanty towns were completely devastated,” Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, the mayor of Mamoudzou, the capital of Mayotte, <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/meteo/mayotte-la-situation-evolue-heure-par-heure-affirme-ambdilwahedou-soumaila-maire-de-mamoudzou_VN-202412150086.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told French television</a> on Sunday.</p><p>He described “scenes of total chaos,” with widespread power cuts and blocked roads.</p><p>Mayotte has recently become a <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/02/20/how-mayotte-became-the-ideological-laboratory-of-the-french-far-right_6542553_7.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">focal point for bitter French debates around immigration</a>. The population has grown rapidly, which has strained social services. And French security officials have <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20240416-second-massive-security-operation-begins-in-france-s-mayotte" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">intervened in recent years</a> to try to crack down on illegal immigration and unsanitary housing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Much of the increase comes from an influx of undocumented immigrants, many from Comoros, a neighboring archipelago that is one of the world’s poorest countries.</p><p>In February, the French interior minister tried to make Mayotte less attractive to immigrants <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/02/11/minister-says-france-will-end-birthright-citizenship-in-overseas-territory-mayotte_6514624_7.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by pushing to end birthright citizenship there</a>. The effort, which some argued was a serious breach of French values that would do little to deter migrants, came to a halt when Mr. Macron called snap elections this summer.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/17/textes/l17b0297_proposition-loi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bill introduced</a> in September that proposes similar changes has yet to be discussed by the lower house of Parliament.</p><p>Mozambique also suffered serious damage, although the death toll there appears lower: Chido killed at least three people, according to an early estimate, local officials told the French news agency Agence France-Presse.</p><p>The storm, which has since been downgraded to a depression, is expected to dissipate by Tuesday.</p><p>Guy Taylor, the spokesman in Mozambique for the United Nations Children’s Fund, said that aid teams were traveling to rural areas throughout the northern part of the country on Monday to assess the situation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The organization fears that many of those communities, which already had little access to clean water and sanitation, would be susceptible to cholera outbreaks.</p><p>On Monday, families in Mayotte were still trying to reach relatives, even though mobile and internet networks were disrupted. Outages kept Mayotte almost entirely offline for more than 36 hours, according to <a href="https://x.com/netblocks/status/1868415207493837237" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NetBlocks</a>, an internet monitoring group.</p><p>Many people posted desperate pleas <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/803857393360547" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on a Facebook page</a> to try to find loved ones. Some ended their posts with a statement of solidarity: “Force à tous,” or stay strong.</p><p>Madi Ali contributed reporting from Pamanzi, Mayotte; <!-- -->John Eligon<!-- -->from Johannesburg; <!-- -->Elian Peltier<!-- --> from Dakar, Senegal; and <!-- -->Nazaneen Ghaffar<!-- --> from London.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
