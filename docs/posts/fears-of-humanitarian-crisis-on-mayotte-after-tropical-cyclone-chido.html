And about a third of the territory’s 320,000 people are undocumented, the ministry said, adding to the challenge of compiling an accurate toll.</p><p>“These elements mean that the number of deaths that are officially counted will probably be much lower than reality,” the ministry said.</p><p>French news outlets <a href="https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/podcasts/journal-de-7-h/journal-de-7h-du-lundi-16-decembre-2024-6580867" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described</a> “an unrecognizable island,” and officials were warning of an impending humanitarian catastrophe, as people on Mayotte struggle to get basic supplies. President Emmanuel Macron has convened an emergency meeting for Monday evening.</p><p>Chido was the worst storm in 90 years to hit the territory, which is in the Indian Ocean, according to <a href="https://x.com/meteofrance/status/1867912468645003514" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forecasters</a>. The forecasters said that wind gusts exceeded 124 miles per hour.</p><p>Mayotte lies between Mozambique and Madagascar. It has the <a href="https://www.afd.fr/en/page-region-pays/mayotte" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highest population density</a> of France’s overseas territories, with a total area of 145 square miles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As families dug through the wreckage of their homes to try to find loved ones and posted desperate pleas <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/803857393360547" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on a Facebook page</a> for residents trying to get information. Many end posts with a statement of solidarity, as they search together: “Force à tous,” or stay strong.</p><p>France has started aid flights from Réunion, another French territory about 900 miles away in the region. Sébastien Lecornu, the armed forces minister, called the flights an “air bridge” in a <a href="https://x.com/SebLecornu/status/1868339808525045849" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>French military officers receiving emergency supplies in Mayotte on Monday, after Tropical Cyclone Chido hit the islands.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chafion Madi/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Families in Mayotte have lost almost everything.

She gave the official death toll in a <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/politique/cyclone-chido-a-mayotte-la-situation-est-tres-degradee-affirme-la-ministre-demissionnaire-de-la-sante-genevieve-darrieussecq_6958376.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">television interview</a> on Monday morning.</p><p>The storm, which has been downgraded to a depression, has continued to move southwest. On Monday afternoon, Chido had left Malawi and had crossed into Mozambique, where it killed at least three people, according to an early estimate of the death toll, local officials told the French news agency Agence France-Presse.</p><p>It is expected to dissipate by Tuesday. Wind speeds have dropped to 30 miles per hour. Now, the main threat is rainfall, which could cause flash floods or dangerous mudslides. Some areas in the storm’s path could receive as much as 11 inches of rain by the end of Tuesday.</p><p>Although the death toll in Mozambique was relatively low, it also suffered serious damage after Chido made landfall there on Sunday, with winds equivalent to those of a Category 3 hurricane, according to the United States military’s Joint Typhoon Warning Center.</p><p>Several buildings were destroyed, officials said. The region also experienced telecommunications outages, NetBlocks said on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Officials at aid agencies, including <a href="https://x.com/UNICEF_Moz/status/1868255231827382601" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNICEF</a> and the <a href="https://x.com/NaemiHeita/status/1868392854478889184" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Red Cross</a>, said they were on the ground in Mozambique ahead of the storm, and boats were prepared for search-and-rescue operations.</p><p>Guy Taylor, the spokesman in Mozambique for UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund, said he saw significant damage in Pemba, the capital of the northernmost province, Cabo Delgado.</p><p>“We saw many roofs torn off buildings, electricity and communications infrastructure out of action,” he said in a text message. “And the situation is likely to be significantly worse in surrounding rural areas, where homes and other buildings are very rudimentary.”</p><p>UNICEF had already brought large quantities of supplies like medication, water purification tablets and flashlights to the province before the storm, Mr. Taylor said.</p><p>Now that the storm has passed, he said, UNICEF teams were traveling to rural areas throughout the northern part of Mozambique on Monday to assess the situation. The organization fears that many of those communities — which already had low access to clean water and sanitation — would be susceptible to cholera outbreaks.</p><p>John Eligon<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nazaneen Ghaffar<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
