Rockefeller Jr., the son of the oil magnate and philanthropist, designed and built on Mount Desert Island in Maine. He eventually donated 51 miles of roadway and 11,000 acres there to Acadia National Park.</p><p>“He realized that he had no desire to pursue his father’s business interests or to make more money,” Ms. Roberts wrote. He bought a huge Tudor-style house on the island, in Seal Harbor, where Nelson Rockefeller was born.</p><p>Her other book, “The Rockefeller Family Home: Kykuit” (1998), is a portrait of the country estate that John D. Rockefeller Sr. built in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., north of New York City. Kykuit (pronounced KAI-cut) — Dutch for lookout point, as it overlooks the Hudson River — was home to generations of his descendants. It is now <a href="https://hudsonvalley.org/historic-sites/kykuit-the-rockefeller-estate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a national historic site</a>.</p><p>Both books are illustrated with photographs by Ms. Roberts’s daughter Mary Louise Pierson, <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2024/08/05/mary-louise-pierson/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who died</a> in July.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kykuit, the Rockefeller family home in the Hudson Valley built by Ms. Roberts’s great-grandfather John D.
