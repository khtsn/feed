These deep gorges cradled and nurtured generations of Ancestral Puebloans, also called the Anasazi, who found the canyon floor fertile enough to plant crops and build settlements. The Hopi then arrived, planting crops like corn and peaches. Finally, the Diné, the term the Navajo use to describe themselves and their language, settled in the canyon — between the four sacred mountains of their creation story.</p><p>The canyon also has a painful history of clashes between its inhabitants and colonizers, first with the Spanish and then the U.S. military, which displaced and led many Navajo through the canyon on the “<a href="https://americanindian.si.edu/nk360/navajo/long-walk/long-walk.cshtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Long Walk</a>.” That campaign, which began in 1864, forced thousands of Navajo to march hundreds of miles to Fort Sumner, in what is now eastern New Mexico. Hundreds of Navajo died on the journey, and many more perished in the four years they were interned there before being allowed to return home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hogans, traditional six- or eight-sided Navajo dwellings, and farm buildings dot the canyon.

He is the grandson of one of the canyon’s first Navajo tour guides, and his family still farms in the canyon.</p><p>“I think tourism is really the main industry on the reservation, and it has allowed me and my family to still live here, where many of our people have left the reservation in search of jobs where the industries are,” Mr. Staley said.</p><p>With more tourism jobs for locals and more development, Mr. Staley believes, some Navajo youth might not leave the reservation and some who have left might return to raise families of their own.</p><h2 id="link-697b9f93">The meaning of ‘sacred’</h2><p>Visitors can enter most of the canyon only with a Navajo guide.
