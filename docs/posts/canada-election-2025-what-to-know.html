The chief electoral officer, the nonpartisan official assigned by Parliament to run the electoral system, cannot cast a ballot during his or her 10-year tenure.</p><p>By tradition, the governor general, who holds King Charles’ powers and responsibilities as Canada’s head of state, abstains from voting to protect the office&#39;s political neutrality.</p><p>Voters have a single task: to select their local member in the House of Commons, the elected assembly of Canada’s Parliament. The next Parliament will have 343 members, an increase of five since the last election because of population growth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Canada uses a “first past the post” system, in which the candidate with the most votes wins the seat, even if that total is not a majority of the ballots cast.</p><p>There is no voting on referendums or for other offices.</p><h2 id="link-b00640">How do I vote?</h2><p>Most Canadians have received <a href="https://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=faq&amp;document=faqvic&amp;lang=e#vic1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a card</a> in the mail indicating their polling place and locations for four days of advanced voting, which begin on Friday. Elections Canada, a nonpartisan agency that administers Canada’s election, has an <a href="https://ereg.elections.ca/en/ereg/index" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online service</a> for people whose cards have errors or who have not received a card.</p><p>While having a card makes voting easier, it is not required.</p><p>People who <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/living-abroad/elections-faq" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live outside of Canada</a> or who won’t be in their communities either on Election Day or any of the advance voting days have until Tuesday to <a href="https://www.elections.ca/voting-by-mail" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apply for a mail-in ballot</a>, which can also be handed in at any election office.</p><p>Any ballots that reach Elections Canada in Ottawa after 6 p.m. Eastern time on voting day will not be counted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voters at the Toronto Public Library in September 2021, during the last federal election.

In general, the party that emerges with at least a plurality of seats in the House of Commons will ask the governor general to allow it to form the government. The leader of the party that forms the government becomes prime minister, and he or she then chooses a cabinet, usually from the party’s members in the House of Commons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In addition to the Liberals and Conservatives, only the New Democratic Party runs candidates in most federal electoral districts across the country. But it has never formed a federal government, and polls show that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/americas/canada-new-democratic-party-jagmeet-singh.html" title="">support for the N.D.P. has sunk</a> to the lowest level since 2000. The Bloc Québécois also runs federal candidates, but only in the province of Quebec.</p><p>The prime minister is not required to be a member of Parliament. Mr. Carney, a former central banker, succeeded Justin Trudeau last month after Liberal Party members e<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/canada/mark-carney-liberal-election.html" title="">lected him as their leader</a>. He is now running in his first election, to represent a middle-class suburb of Ottawa rather than the affluent neighborhood where he, along with many diplomats, lives.</p><h2 id="link-1a2453fb">When are the results known?</h2><p>Canada has six time zones, but poll closing times are staggered so that most of them shut at 9:30 p.m. Eastern time regardless of where they are. The Westernmost province British Columbia closes half an hour later, at 10 p.m. Eastern time. The results of the election will, most likely, be known on the evening of April 28.</p><p>Canada uses paper ballots that are counted by hand at every polling station, by employees of Elections Canada. Candidates are allowed to appoint representatives to oversee the counting. No counting machines are used.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The polling station results are then reported upward to Elections Canada’s headquarters in Ottawa, which releases them online, immediately.</p><p>Because the ballot boxes are not moved to central counting locations, the first results usually begin trickling in soon after the polls close. The full count usually extends until well after the broad result of the election has become clear.</p><p>Special ballots used for people voting by mail, prisoners, Canadians outside of the country and military members are generally not counted until after voting day to allow officials to confirm they did not vote in person.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voters at Bruce Public School in Toronto casting their ballots in the federal election in 2019, during a power outage in the area.

The one exception was during World War I, when the Conservatives and some of the Liberals in the House of Commons, along with independent members, formed a coalition to deal with growing political divisions over conscription.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Minority governments formed by the party that wins the most seats, however, are common. They usually rely on the informal support of other parties to pass legislation. But such governments live in constant peril of being brought down by losing a confidence vote in the House of Commons or being defeated on a bill that involves taxes or spending money.</p><p>In 1979, a Progressive Conservative government only lasted 66 days before being defeated, forcing another election.</p><p>The New Democrats formally agreed to support Mr. Trudeau after the 2021 election, in exchange for the Liberal Party adopting some of its policy measures. But the New Democrats were never part of Mr. Trudeau’s government.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>April 17, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this story misstated the number of members in the next Parliament.
