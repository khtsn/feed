</div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Some items that he singled out had become flash points for conservative voters during the coronavirus pandemic, including ivermectin, which was found to be an ineffective treatment against Covid.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Dr. Robert Califf, the current F.D.A. commissioner who spoke frequently about the dangers of misinformation in the Covid pandemic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ7rYiJTcmU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said at an event Tuesday</a> that he was aware that experts were not always right — but he worried about them being broadly ignored.</p><p>“Not having experts, I think historically, in every society, has been a case for demise of that society,” Dr. Califf said.</p><p>He also noted that leadership above the F.D.A. — including the Health and Human Services Department — very rarely interferes with scientific decisions at the agency. Yet, “it’s totally within the law for the president or the H.H.S. secretary to overrule the entire F.D.A.,” he said.</p><p>Here is a look at some of the items raised by Mr. Kennedy and the actions the agency has taken.</p><h2 id="link-53b9daaf">Raw Milk</h2><p>Drinking raw milk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/well/eat/bird-flu-milk-raw.html" title="">has always been risky</a>, according <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/119383/download#:~:text=Raw%20milk%20can%20carry%20dangerous,products%20made%20from%20raw%20milk." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to the F.D.A.</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/foods/raw-milk.html#:~:text=milk%2Dborne%20illnesses.-,Risk,Listeria%2C%20Brucella%2C%20and%20Salmonella." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. It is regularly associated with outbreaks of illnesses from a long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/well/raw-milk-health-salmonella.html" title="">list of bacteria</a>, which includes <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21058911/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a strain of E. coli</a> that can cause <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352399" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kidney failure</a> and death.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The bird flu outbreak among dairy cows has heightened the risk to public health, said Meghan Davis, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies infectious diseases affecting animals and humans. Since the outbreak was first detected in March, the virus, known as H5N1, has spread to nearly <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">500 herds in 15 states</a>, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Raw milk contains high levels of the virus, which can also infect people.</p><p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/updates-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Recent studies</a> by the F.D.A. and the Department of Agriculture have found that pasteurization effectively renders the virus inactive.</p><p>Promoting consumption of raw milk — or silencing <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/food-safety-and-raw-milk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the F.D.A. from warning about its risks</a> — is “probably a bad idea,” in the middle of a bird flu outbreak, said Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association.</p><p>Doing so “would be fine until he gets his first bacterial outbreak in the population of kids drinking raw milk and someone dies because he encouraged people to drink raw milk,” Dr. Benjamin said.</p><p>There is no test to screen milk for the H5N1 strain in the current outbreak, and not all cows are showing symptoms. Also, the milk is often pooled from numerous cows, so only one cow needs to be sick to introduce contamination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The bird flu outbreak among dairy cows makes the risk of contamination and illness even greater, experts said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arin Yoon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Proponents of raw milk <a href="https://www.rawmilkinstitute.org/about-raw-milk/#nutrition" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">say it has more</a> beneficial enzymes and diverse probiotics than pasteurized milk and that its consumption is associated with lower rates of asthma and allergies.</p><p>The F.D.A. does not decide who can sell raw milk; states do. But since the 1980s, the agency has ensured that raw milk is not shipped out of the 30 states where sales are<span>  </span>permitted. Lawmakers who oppose the shipment regulation <a href="https://massie.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=395642" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have tried for years</a> to advance a bill in Congress that would allow sales among states where it is legal.</p><p>Dr. Davis said she was concerned that an increase in raw milk consumption could make it easier for the H5N1 virus to adapt and become more severe or transmissible among humans. On Thursday, the C.D.C. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7344a3.htm?s_cid=mm7344a3_w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a study</a> showing that some farm workers carried antibodies to the strain but were not aware that they had been infected.</p><p>“This is a virus that has pandemic potential,” Dr. Davis said.</p><h2 id="link-5cae624e">Hydroxychloroquine</h2><p>Early in the pandemic, under <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/us/politics/trump-fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-.html" title="">pressure from Mr. Trump</a>, the F.D.A. issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria. The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/136784/download" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agency noted</a> in March 2020 that the drug had been shown in a lab to prevent growth of the coronavirus and that some patients who took it reported improving.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The authorization did not last long. On June 15, the F.D.A. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-revokes-emergency-use-authorization-chloroquine-and" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revoked it</a> after a study of 821 people found a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trump.html" title="">lack of effectiveness.</a> The drug also carried serious side effects, including one that disrupted the electrical activity of the heart. The agency concluded that the potential benefits did not outweigh the risks.</p><p>In doing so, the F.D.A. showed flexibility in a time of crisis and pulled back when important information came to the fore, said Dr. Ashish Jha, a former Biden White House adviser on the Covid pandemic and the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.</p><p>“That is exactly what you would want the agency to do,” he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00060-6/fulltext" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Further studies</a> also found that hydroxychloroquine did not work against Covid, and one large analysis found that people who took it had an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22446-z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elevated risk of death</a>.</p><h2 id="link-2fd7c6ba">Chelation</h2><p>Mr. Kennedy has a history of promoting the possible benefits of chelation, which is an accepted therapy for removing heavy metals from the blood after a serious exposure, but not for treating autism.</p><p>A blog entry posted by the Children’s Health Defense, a nonprofit founded by Mr. Kennedy, claims that “<a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/uncategorized/chelation-mercury-treatment-autism/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many cases of autism</a>” are actually cases of mercury poisoning brought on by a preservative found in some vaccines. The post, which says it was written in 2000 and posted in 2017, went on to note the promise of chelating agents — chemicals that remove toxic metals from the body — as a potential treatment for autism. A 2015 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thimerosal-Supporting-Immediate-Mercury-Neurotoxin/dp/1632206013" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">book edited</a> by Mr. Kennedy that focused on widely debunked theories about vaccines and autism notes “evidence of chelation’s benefits” from a handful of small studies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Doctors do use chelating agents to treat some conditions, like lead poisoning, said Dr. Jeffrey Brent, a toxicologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. But he said he doubted that “any legitimate physician” believed that chelation was an appropriate treatment for autism.</p><p>Chelation can also be dangerous. A 5-year-old boy died in 2005 from cardiac arrest after a doctor in western Pennsylvania tried to treat his autism with chelation.</p><p>“It was a huge problem and there are people out there that are pushing it,” Dr. Brent said. “I’m sure they feel emboldened right now.”</p><p>Yet, several companies have marketed what they described <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/questions-and-answers-unapproved-chelation-products" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as chelation products</a> for a number of uses not approved by the F.D.A., including treating autism, prompting the agency to send <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2010/10/14/130569720/fda-warns-consumers-about-dangers-of-heavy-metal-therapy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warning letters</a> to those organizations in 2010.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/rfk-jr-brain-health-memory-loss.html" title="">underwent chelation therapy</a> himself after blood tests showed that his mercury levels were elevated. He attributed the high levels to his preference for eating tuna, which is known for containing mercury.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the previous Trump administration’s F.D.A. chief, warned of “small number of unscrupulous actors who have seized on the clinical promise” of stem cells by selling “unproven and, in some cases, dangerously dubious products.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Roberson/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-4f7f6b4b">Stem Cells</h2><p>Stem cell treatments have generated excitement in the medical field in recent years.

One recently approved therapy combines gene editing and a stem cell treatment for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/health/fda-sickle-cell-crispr.html" title="">sickle cell disease</a>. Yet amid the hope for revolutionary treatments, rogue clinics have promoted cures that were not approved by the F.D.A. for myriad ailments.</p><p>Given the context of Mr. Kennedy’s post on X, he appeared to be referring to stem cell clinics that the F.D.A. had targeted for enforcement, said Paul Knoepfler, a professor of cell biology and human anatomy at the University of California, Davis, who <a href="https://ipscell.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracks questionable stem cell treatments</a>.</p><p>Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who was appointed by Mr. Trump to lead the F.D.A. during his first term, summarized the problem in 2017, saying that some “unscrupulous actors who have seized on the clinical promise,” of advances in the field were selling “unproven and, in some cases, dangerously dubious products.”</p><p>“In such an environment, a select few, often motivated by greed without regard to responsible patient care, are able to promote unproven, clearly illegal and often expensive treatments that offer little hope and, even worse, may pose significant risks to the health and safety of vulnerable patients,” Dr. Gottlieb <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-fdas-new-policy-steps-and-enforcement-efforts-ensure" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in a statement</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In 2017, <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/03/unproven-stem-cell-therapy-blinds-three-patients-at-florida.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stanford researchers</a> reported that people who had gone to one stem cell clinic in Florida for eye procedures left with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/health/eyes-stem-cells-injections.html" title="">considerable loss of sight</a>, apparently caused by the stem cell infusions.</p><p>The next year, the F.D.A. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-seeks-permanent-injunctions-against-two-stem-cell-clinics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed two permanent injunctions</a> against stem cell clinics in California and Florida that “have continued to disregard the law and, more importantly, patient safety,” Dr. Gottlieb said in a statement at the time.</p><p>The two companies sued the F.D.A. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/federal-court-issues-decision-holding-us-stem-cell-clinics-and-owner-adulterated-and-misbranded-stem" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and lost their cases</a> at the <a href="https://calmatters.org/health/2024/10/stem-cell-therapy-fda/#:~:text=A%20three%2Djudge%20panel%20on,had%20exempted%20them%20from%20regulation." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appellate court level</a>.</p><p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2024/09/27/22-56014.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upheld the F.D.A.’s action</a> in a decision on Sept. 27 of this year, aligning with a Florida judge’s ruling in 2019 that protected the agency’s authority to crack down on a stem cell provider that it had deemed unscrupulous.</p><p>In the California case, judges concluded that the F.D.A. had correctly exercised its authority to oversee such treatments.</p><p>Given Mr. Kennedy’s potential influence in the new administration, he may be able to change the F.D.A.’s direction in such cases, Dr. Knoepfler said.</p><p>Teddy Rosenbluth and Emily Anthes contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christina Jewett covers the Food and Drug Administration, which means keeping a close eye on drugs, medical devices, food safety and tobacco policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christina-jewett">More about Christina Jewett</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Kennedy’s Wish List for F.D.A.
