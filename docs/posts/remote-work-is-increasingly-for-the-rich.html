Perhaps he was sequestered at his 600-acre ranch in the genteel upcountry of Hawaii’s Waimea district. Or maybe at his oceanfront estate, just down the hill.</p><p>In late October, Starbucks — under its newly minted leader, Brian Niccol — warned the coffee company’s corporate employees that they must also return to the office three days a week by January. Yet Mr. Niccol continues to make his primary home in sunny Newport Beach, Calif. Starbucks has provided him with dedicated office space, a local personal assistant and a corporate jet ready to fly him the 1,000 miles to and from the company’s world headquarters in Seattle. A company representative <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/starbucks-new-ceo-brian-niccol-will-supercommute-to-seattle-instead-of-relocating.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told CNBC</a> that Mr. Niccol will be held to the same three days a week standard.</p><p>When the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the world in 2020, many of America’s office workers were suddenly able to work from home, introducing previously unimagined flexibility. They could move to more affordable locales, apply for jobs regardless of location and balance the demands of work and family. This privileged perk, however, opened a divide, as many essential workers still had to report to their stations.</p><p>Now growing numbers of the white-collar class are under increasing pressure to return, while many corner offices sit empty. The ability to work from home was always economically stratified. Now it is often being reserved for the wealthiest among us.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><a href="https://wfhresearch.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Research</a> by the Stanford University economist and remote work expert Nick Bloom shows that postpandemic, the number of days people are allowed to work from home correlates to their income. Work-from-home days have fallen by 16 percent for workers earning $10,000 to $100,000 a year but only by 5 percent for those making $200,000 or more.</p><p>Perhaps that’s why Mr. Bloom found a correlation between income earned and distance from the office. Only 5 percent of employees earning $10,000 to $50,000 a year work 50 or more miles from their company headquarters, compared with 14 percent earning more than $250,000. The gap is growing despite research that concludes that working from home can benefit employees and employers alike. He found that the practice improves gender mix by increasing the number of women in the work force, expands the labor supply in an otherwise tight market, improves the disability employment gap and supports families and home life. As one LinkedIn poster put it, replying to Mr. Bloom, “Isn’t it amazing what the ability to put in a load of laundry during the workday can do for overall happiness.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
