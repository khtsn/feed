The workers, at 24 hotels total, included front-desk staff, housekeepers and other employees.</p><p>In a news release, UNITE HERE said that strikes had also been authorized in Baltimore; New Haven, Conn.; Oakland, Calif.; and Providence, R.I., and could begin “at any time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The union said the strikes were expected to last in each city for two to three days, during a long weekend when the busy summer travel season unofficially concludes.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Employees of Hilton Boston Park Plaza went on strike on Sunday.

During the height of the pandemic, the leisure and hospitality industry, including hotels, laid off millions of workers as it struggled under travel restrictions and a pullback in consumer spending on services. Employment in the sector has since rebounded as travel has surged back, though some hotels have continued to keep in place adjustments they made in recent years to services, such as daily housekeeping.</p><p>“We won’t accept a ‘new normal’ where hotel companies profit by cutting their offerings to guests and abandoning their commitments to workers,” Gwen Mills, international president of UNITE HERE, said in a statement, adding that many workers were not earning enough to support their families.</p><p>Michael D’Angelo, Hyatt’s head of labor relations for the Americas, said in a statement on Sunday that the company was “disappointed that UNITE HERE has chosen to strike while Hyatt remains willing to negotiate.” He said the company had contingency plans in place to mitigate the impact of the strike.</p><p>A Hilton spokesperson said that Hilton was “committed to negotiating in good faith to reach fair and reasonable agreements” and that its “hotels have contingency plans in place to ensure operations continue to run as smoothly as possible” for customers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Representatives for Marriott did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>UNITE HERE, which has more than 250,000 members in the United States and Canada, and is the main union representing hospitality workers in many large American cities, has a history of trying to impede busy travel periods with labor actions. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/02/us/los-angeles-hotel-workers-strike.html" title="">thousands of workers in Southern California went on strike</a> demanding higher pay and better benefits during the Fourth of July holiday.</p><p>Noam Scheiber<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
