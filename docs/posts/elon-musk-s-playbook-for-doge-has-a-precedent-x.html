Trump last month named Elon Musk to help lead a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-congress.html" title="">new Department of Government Efficiency</a>, the tech billionaire has turned to X to trumpet his plans.</p><p>Mr. Musk, who owns the platform, has singled out at least four federal employees focused on climate issues — including the niece of Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California — who he suggested ought to lose their jobs. “Maybe her advice is amazing,” Mr. Musk joked of Alexis Pelosi, a senior climate adviser at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Musk, X and Alexis Pelosi did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>He has also criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/business/elon-musk-tesla-sec-ban.html" title="">fined him millions of dollars</a>. And on Sunday, he wrote, “The government is more broken than you could possibly imagine.”</p><p>The posts are part of Mr. Musk’s plans to reduce the federal budget by $2 trillion, or 30 percent. To do so, he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-rto.html" title="">proposed a return-to-office mandate</a> for government workers, suggesting that it would lead to mass resignations. He has suggested cutting entire agencies. And he has called for firing agency leaders like the Federal Trade Commission’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/technology/election-2024-ftc-lina-khan.html" title="">outgoing chair, Lina Khan</a>, who led an investigation into privacy practices at X after Mr. Musk’s takeover.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Musk’s public flogging of government workers echoes the playbook he used during his contentious bid to buy X — then known as Twitter — in 2022. At the time, he publicly blasted company executives as being incompetent and floated suggestions for how he might run the business, including making major cost cuts.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s use of the platform to publicly air his plans became a powerful tool in buying the social media company, rallying supporters to his cause and drawing in investors. Now he is employing the same strategy with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, persuading supporters to work for the effort and winning over politicians to achieve his goals.</p><p>“Part of Musk’s M.O. historically has been to say big things and promise big things and hope that those things become a reality,” said Dan Moynihan, a professor at the University of Michigan Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. “He’ll say these things without any real sense of what’s possible or not, and assume that by saying it, he can make it possible.”</p><p>If Mr. Musk’s history with X is any indication of what’s to come, the situation is likely to get hairier for government agencies and their workers next year when Mr. Trump takes office. Not long after Mr. Musk bought Twitter, he cut its work force by more than 75 percent, including firing top executives, and upended established teams and processes at the company.</p><p>Besides Mr. Musk’s posts, little is known so far about how DOGE will work. (The name is a reference to Dogecoin, a meme cryptocurrency favored by Mr. Musk.) Vivek Ramaswamy, a businessman and a former Republican candidate for president, will co-lead the initiative. DOGE will operate outside official government, but will provide recommendations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Senator Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine who is set to lead the Appropriations Committee next Congress, met one-on-one with Mr. Musk for over an hour last week. But she told reporters that they had not gotten into specifics about DOGE.</p><p>“We did not go through any list of cuts or anything like that,” Ms. Collins said.</p><p>The similarities between Mr. Musk’s posts about DOGE and those ahead of his purchase of Twitter are striking. He secretly acquired a majority stake in Twitter before joining its board in April 2022. He did not hold back from criticizing the platform, posting, “is Twitter dying?” He later made a bid to buy the company.</p><p>All the while, Mr. Musk continued attacking the company online, lashing out at executives and how the platform operated. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s chief executive, posted an explanation of the company’s process for tallying bot accounts — which Mr. Musk said had riddled the platform — the billionaire responded with a poop emoji.</p><p>Mr. Musk also castigated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/technology/twitter-musk-content-moderators.html" title="">Twitter’s top lawyer</a>, posting that past decisions about how to moderate content on the platform were “obviously incredibly inappropriate.” Later, he shared a meme mocking the lawyer, sparking a torrent of attacks from other Twitter users.</p><p>These days, Mr. Musk is leveling similar criticisms against the government.</p><p>“The Federal government computers &amp; software are in such bad shape that they often cannot verify that payments are not fraud, waste or abuse!” Mr. Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1866136939247681617" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> Monday. “That’s why the government can’t pass basic audits. They often LITERALLY don’t know where your tax dollars went. It’s insane.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In another post, which highlighted an employee’s role at the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, Mr. Musk wrote, “so many fake jobs.”</p><p>Mr. Musk has suggested drastic cuts, including decreases in military spending. He and Mr. Ramaswamy have also suggested eliminating federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Planned Parenthood.</p><p>At X, Mr. Musk delivered on some of his promises, swiftly cutting costs through mass layoffs and halting payments to landlords, vendors and janitors.</p><p>After his takeover, Mr. Musk also asked Twitter employees to send weekly updates of their accomplishments. He required them to print out code they had written to demonstrate their productivity, then later told them to shred the printouts because they could present a security risk to the company’s data.</p><p>On Nov. 8, even before DOGE had been announced, Mr. Musk suggested he might take the same approach with federal employees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“A weekly email of accomplishments seems like it should be mandatory for all government employees,” he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1855142229788295534" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a>.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kate Conger is a technology reporter based in San Francisco.
