Gilchrist, Republican of Maryland and chairman of the Subcommittee on Buildings and Grounds, said at a hearing in October 1995. “While this building is not large, it represents one of a series of actions undertaken by the legislative branch to reduce its size and scope.”</p><p>Three decades later, that building is still controlled by Congress, sitting dark and empty as a monument to how hard it can be to impose significant change on the sprawling federal government. In the hallways of Washington, grand plans like the ones President-elect Donald J. Trump and allies like the billionaire Elon Musk are espousing about abolishing federal agencies and drastically cutting spending have a way of encountering political reality.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“They are fighting with the bureaucracy, and the bureaucracy always wins,” said Ray LaHood, who served as a Republican House member from Illinois during the Gingrich era and later became secretary of transportation under President Barack Obama. “They develop to a fare-thee-well every technique possible to stall, delay and make sure things don’t happen.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Grand plans like the ones President-elect Donald J.
