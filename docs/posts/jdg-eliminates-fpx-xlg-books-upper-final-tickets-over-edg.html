</span>. JDG ultimately survived the encounter, sending off FPX with only one map win over three matches. </p>

<p>The series began on JDG&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598943/jdg-esports-vs-funplus-phoenix-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lr1/?game=245268&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a>. JDG took control initially, stringing together five consecutive rounds and snowballing the economy to go up 5-2, but FPX responded with five of their own for a 7-5 lead at the half thanks to strong A site holds and multikills from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4382/sscary">
		sScary	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/19530/aaaay">
		AAAAY	</a>
</span>. </p>

<p>AAAAY continued to be the hero for FPX in the second half as he won the bonus round with a 1v3 ace, spurring his side on all the way to a 13-5 victory as they completed an 11-round win streak. The Killjoy player ended the map with an outsized 25/7/1 KDA, 347 ACS, and 224 ADR. </p>

Starting off on the attack, FPX found repeated success on the C site, going up 4-2 before JDG adjusted and drew the score back to 4-4. The half ended in a 6-6 deadlock as the teams traded the remaining rounds back and forth.</p>

<p>The rest of the map was all JDG. <span data-ref-id="10">

<p>stew ended the map at the top of the scoreboard with 21 kills, 176 ADR, and five first kills on Neon. The first kill tally continued to favor JDG throughout the series, as all five JDG members ended the overall match with positive FK/FD differentials.</p>

<p>As two of the region&#39;s titans and recent international representatives, XLG and EDG both sought to earn the remaining spot in the upper final after strong starts in the tournament. In the end, XLG dominated the former world champions and stand one win away from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2760/valorant-masters-santiago-2026" target="_blank">Masters Santiago</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598930/xi-lai-gaming-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-ur3/?game=245225&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a> was a first-time showing from both teams as both teams opted into similar double-Duelist compositions, with EDG favoring Neon and Yoru and XLG favoring Waylay and Yoru. EDG took an early 5-1 advantage after winning the second round eco, running over XLG&#39;s setups with fast site executes. XLG wrested back control after a timeout from coach <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1348/hvoya">
		hvoya	</a>
</span> to lead 7-5 at the half, leaning more into retakes and adjusting their setups to better handle the entry pathing from <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/39697/cb">
		cb	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span>. </p>

<p>The second half was flawless for XLG. The Ascension squad won the pistol, dismantled EDG&#39;s B main aggression to win the bonus, and ended the map early 13-5 with the ultimates they had saved up. <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/37927/happywei">
		happywei	</a>
</span> stood out on Viper with a 20/8/7 KDA and 195 ADR. </p>

<p>happywei kept his form up going into <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598930/xi-lai-gaming-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-ur3/?game=245226&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a>, kicking off the map with an instant ace in the pistol round and leading XLG to a 9-3 defense side. EDG&#39;s attack appeared disjointed as they often failed to create pressure around the map and ran into stacked sites; two out of their three rounds came from heroics from cb. </p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YMeVs8FovWs?si=b8v-t6aOE1C17PIj&amp;clip=UgkxVcDZa_oRmU0N0Eay_5Rtr8ig8LtM9Z9d&amp;clipt=EKuU1AgYxM3XCA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>An ace from happywei wins XLG the 3v5.</em></p>

<p>A second pistol round for XLG created an insurmountable 11-3 deficit for EDG as XLG won the map 13-6. happywei put up another 20 kills for a series-high 40-kill performance over 37 total rounds. </p>

<p>EDG drops down to the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598939/edward-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mr3" target="_blank">middle bracket</a> and will face familiar opponents <span data-ref-id="16">
