Trump on Monday demanded that the hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Israel be released from Gaza before his inauguration in January, or there will be “hell to pay” in the Middle East for those responsible.</p><p>Writing on Truth Social, and without naming any militant group, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/trump-warns-hell-to-pay-if-gaza-hostages-not-freed-before-his-inauguration-2c3c22e9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump</a> said in his post: “If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!”</p><p>About 250 hostages were captured in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct, 7, 2023, and about 100 of them remain in Gaza, with about a third believed to be dead, according to the Israeli authorities. The Biden administration has been working since last year with Israel and international mediators, including Qatar and Egypt, on a cease-fire deal that would include release of the hostages.</p><p>It was not clear what tactic Mr. Trump might take that has not already been taken already by Israel, which has killed many of Hamas’s leaders and thousands of its fighters, while leveling much of Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump said in his post on Monday, “It’s all talk and no action” when it comes to the hostages, and his statement suggesting that he could use the power of his office to punish those who took the captives is the first sign of how aggressively Mr. Trump might handle Middle East policy when he resumes office.</p><p>There was one brief pause in the fighting, more than a year ago, that led to the release of about 105 hostages. And efforts to broker a cease-fire deal appeared to stall last month after mediators met in Egypt.</p><p>Some hostages have also been rescued in Israeli military operations. But there have been protests and widespread frustration in Israel over the lack of a deal to secure their freedom, with critics of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel saying that he has failed to prioritize their release over his political survival.</p><p>This is not the first time that Mr. Trump has addressed the conflict in Gaza and the fate of the remaining hostages. He has told Mr. Netanyahu that he wants the war in the enclave to end <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-told-netanyahu-he-wants-gaza-war-over-by-time-he-enters-office-sources/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">before he returns to the White House</a>. And at the Republican National Convention in July, he said that he wanted the hostages returned and that captors “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/us/politics/trump-rnc-speech-transcript.html" title="">will be paying a very big price</a>.”</p><p>His latest warning came after Hamas released a propaganda video showing the American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, 20, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-december-2-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pleading with Mr. Trump</a> to secure his release.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Ephrat Livni is a reporter for The Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/dealbook">DealBook</a> newsletter, based in Washington.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni">More about Ephrat Livni</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>American Killed on Oct. 7:</strong> Omer Neutra, an American Israeli dual citizen who fought in the Israeli military and was thought to have been taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/omer-neutra-israel-oct-7-gaza-hamas-hostage.html">was in fact killed on the day of the attack</a>, the military said.</p></li><li><p><strong>World Central Kitchen Worker:</strong> Israel said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-world-central-kitchen.html">killed a World Central Kitchen worker</a> it accused of taking part in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack. “To the best of our knowledge, no WCK team members are affiliated with Hamas,” the aid group said.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘Nobody Won’:</strong> Tens of thousands of people who had fled the Lebanese city of Baalbek returned to bombed-out restaurants, flattened apartment buildings and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/middleeast/baalbek-lebanon-israel.html">many of the dead still buried under the rubble</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Independent Inquiry Into Oct. 7 Failures:</strong> After the Israeli government delayed a formal investigation into the Hamas attacks, an alliance of survivors and victims’ families set up their own inquiry. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/middleeast/israel-oct-7-inquiry.html">Their scathing findings were released</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rallying Around Netanyahu:</strong> An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-icc-jurisdiction-explained.html">I.C.C. arrest warrant</a> for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spurred <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-icc-warrant.html">outrage across Israel’s political spectrum</a>.
