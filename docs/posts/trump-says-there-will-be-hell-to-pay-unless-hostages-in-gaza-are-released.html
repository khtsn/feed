    <h1>Trump Says There Will Be ‘Hell to Pay’ Unless Hostages in Gaza Are Released</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump on Monday demanded that the hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Israel be released from Gaza before his inauguration in January, or there will be “hell to pay” in the Middle East for those responsible.</p><p>Writing on Truth Social, and without naming any militant group, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/trump-warns-hell-to-pay-if-gaza-hostages-not-freed-before-his-inauguration-2c3c22e9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump</a> said in his post: “If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!”</p><p>About 250 hostages were captured in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct, 7, 2023, and about 100 of them remain in Gaza, with about a third believed to be dead, according to the Israeli authorities. The Biden administration has been working since last year with Israel and international mediators, including Qatar and Egypt, on a cease-fire deal that would include release of the hostages.</p><p>It was not clear what tactic Mr. Trump might take that has not already been taken already by Israel, which has killed many of Hamas’s leaders and thousands of its fighters, while leveling much of Gaza.</p></div></div>
