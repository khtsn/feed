Trump would conduct themselves over the next four years to try to avoid conflicts of interest, even though the president is legally exempt from federal conflict of interest laws.</p><p>The measures described in the document largely echo pledges the family made eight years ago, when Mr. Trump first became president.

The tournament is sponsored by LIV Golf, the new league created and financed by the Saudi government. The deal will generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue.</p><p>“If the president receives any profits or benefits from foreign governments — not just new deals — then he is in violation of the Constitution,” said Richard W. Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, who has been a longtime critic of Mr. Trump’s handling of ethics issues. “The money flow has to stop on Jan. 20.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
