Instead, it is agreeing only to “no new transactions with foreign governments,” reflecting a plan that was first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/trump-organization-ethics-policy-foreign-deals.html" title="">described to The New York Times in December</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We are going above and beyond,” Eric Trump said in an interview with The Times on Friday.</p><p>Ethics lawyers immediately dismissed the moves as insufficient, citing as an example that the Trump family separately disclosed just this week that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/politics/liv-golf-tournament-trump-doral-resort.html" title="">it would host a golf tournament</a> in April at its Trump National Doral resort in Miami. The tournament is sponsored by LIV Golf, the new league created and financed by the Saudi government. The deal will generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue.</p><p>“If the president receives any profits or benefits from foreign governments — not just new deals — then he is in violation of the Constitution,” said Richard W. Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, who has been a longtime critic of Mr. Trump’s handling of ethics issues. “The money flow has to stop on Jan. 20.”</p><p>The ethics pledge included an announcement that William A. Burck, a prominent ethics lawyer at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, would serve as the outside lawyer for the family company. He will review any property acquisitions or sales worth more than $10 million, major leases on buildings owned by the Trump family, new loans or even loan refinancing deals, as well as any transactions with federal or state governments, or claims against foreign governments.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Lipton is an investigative reporter, who digs into a broad range of topics from Pentagon spending to toxic chemicals.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-lipton">More about Eric Lipton</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
