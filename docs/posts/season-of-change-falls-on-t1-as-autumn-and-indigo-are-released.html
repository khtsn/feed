		Do-hoon (설도훈)</span> departing the organization.</p>

<p>According to the VCT Global Contract Database, Autumn&#39;s deal with T1 ran until the end of 2025, meaning T1 opted not to renew his deal with the organization. </p>

<p>In 2023, the first year of the partnership era, T1 fielded an all-Korean roster with two players who have, in their careers, competed on English-speaking rosters in <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/5129/ban">
		ban	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4545/sayaplayer">
		Sayaplayer	</a>
</span>. CheongGak also joined T1 in 2023, entering the coaching booth before regional play began. After a third-place finish at the end of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1191/champions-tour-2023-pacific-league/playoffs" target="_blank">Pacific League</a>, T1 qualified for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1494/champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo/group-stage" target="_blank">Masters Tokyo</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1657/valorant-champions-2023/group-stage" target="_blank">Champions Los Angeles</a>, but ultimately disappointed on the international stage with group stage exits at both events.</p>

<p>T1 changed its approach for 2024, picking up international players <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1129/rossy">
		Rossy	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="9">

</span>, and letting go of CheongGak for American coach <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/27679/daeda">

</span>. After finishing 3rd-4th at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1924/champions-tour-2024-pacific-kickoff/group-stage" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a>, T1 clawed back in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2002/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a>, qualifying for the playoffs with a 2-4 group stage record and then making a strong run through the playoffs to finish third and qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai" target="_blank">Masters Shanghai</a>. After falling two games into the event&#39;s Swiss Stage, T1 returned to Pacific play but disappointed. They finished seventh, missing out on the playoffs and not finishing with enough points to qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions Seoul</a>.</p>

<p>Midway through 2024, T1 picked up countryman and <span data-ref-id="11">

<p>With Masters Shanghai MVP Meteor and a pair of DRX veterans in the squad, T1 started the 2025 season off strong, but fell in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/vct-2025-pacific-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> grand final to the DRX squad they poached two players from. The result qualified T1 for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>, though. T1 narrowly survived the Swiss Stage with a 2-1 record, and then fought through the lower bracket in the playoffs to defeat North American powerhouses <span data-ref-id="18">
