It looked bad. I knew that kids who contracted Covid tended to fare better than older people, but was the virus killing them, too?</p><p>Nope. It wasn’t the virus. It was injuries — mostly from guns and drugs. From 2019 to 2021, the child death rate rose more steeply than it had in at least half a century. It stayed high after that. Despite all of the medical advances and public health gains, there are enough injuries to have changed the direction of the chart.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Horrified, I started making phone calls. It turned out that I was not the only one who wanted to understand what was happening to America’s children. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain what we now know.</p><h2 id="link-666d0456">Guns and drugs</h2><p>When life expectancy in the United States plateaued around 2010, it was big news. Problems that grabbed people in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31769830/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">midlife</a> — chronic disease, depression, opioids and alcohol — were bringing down the average. Yet the survival rate for children kept improving, thanks to better neonatal care, vaccines and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/08/health/children-drowning-deaths.html" title="">swimming lessons</a>.</p><p>The first real alarm bells coincided with the pandemic. That’s when the mortality rate among children and adolescents shot up by more than 10 percent in a single year. These children weren’t felled by some spreading contagion; their deaths were sudden and “almost always preventable,” as Dr. Coleen Cunningham, the pediatrician in chief at Children’s Hospital of Orange County, puts it. Deadly car accidents among tweens and teens climbed nearly 16 percent. Murders went up 39 percent. Fatal overdoses more than doubled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Brooklyn, New York. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.

Black and Native American children were dying at much higher rates than white children. And the disparities — which had been narrowing — were now widening again. Black kids were mostly shot by other people. Native American kids mostly shot themselves.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>There were harbingers before 2020. Suicides started to increase in 10- to 19-year-olds after the 2007 recession alongside the rise of social media and cyberbullying. Homicides climbed as access to firearms rose. Overdose deaths spiked shortly before the pandemic began as cartels laced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/health/pills-fentanyl-social-media.html" title="">their drugs</a> with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/27/opinion/fentanyl-overdose-deaths.html" title="">fentanyl</a>.</p><p>But guns were at the center of it all, replacing car crashes as the leading killer of kids. Gun deaths alone accounted for almost half of the increase in young people. They are now equivalent to 52 school buses of children crashing each year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="children-deaths-7wabd" data-id="100000009832837" data-source-id="100000009832837"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Causes of death for children</h2></header><div slug="children-deaths-7wabd" data-sourceid="100000009832837" id="embed-id-100000009832837">

Three decades ago, major health studies began to reveal the danger of guns. The National Rifle Association took notice.
