Trump’s circle in Florida on Friday about a border security plan that Canada hopes will ward off Mr. Trump’s threats to impose economically damaging tariffs on imports from Canada.</p><p>The meetings will build on a dinner Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago over the Thanksgiving weekend as well as on a recent telephone conversation between members of Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet and Thomas D. Homan, Mr. Trump’s designated border czar.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/canada/melanie-joly-foreign-affairs-profile.html" title="">Mélanie Joly,</a> Canada’s foreign minister, and Dominic LeBlanc, the former public safety minister who became finance minister last week during a tumultuous political period for Mr. Trudeau, arrived in Florida on Thursday evening.</p><p>Jean-Sébastien Comeau, the spokesman for Mr. LeBlanc, said that the discussions would “focus on Canada’s efforts to combat fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration.” He added that the talks would also raise “the negative impacts that the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on Canadian goods would have on both Canada and the United States.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Neither minister’s office offered any details about their schedules.</p><p>But a Canadian official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the arrangements, said Ms. Joly was expected to meet with Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, on Friday, and that both ministers were likely to have talks with Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary.</p><p>The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for information about the meetings.</p><p>Mr. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on imports from Canada when he takes office in January unless the country reduces the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United States. Such a move could be devastating for Canada, whose economy depends heavily on exports to the United States. Many Canadian industries are tightly integrated across the border.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also repeatedly trolled Mr. Trudeau, a U.S. ally, on social media, referring to him as “Governor Justin Trudeau of Canada.”</p><p>On Christmas Day, he taunted Mr. Trudeau again, writing in a post on Truth Social that “if Canada were to become our 51st State, their Taxes would be cut by more than 60%, their businesses would immediately double in size, and they would be militarily protected like no other Country in the World.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has designs on more than Canada. In recent days, he has called for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/us/politics/trump-greenland-panama-canal.html" title="">other territorial expansions</a>, including reclaiming U.S. control over the Panama Canal and “owning” Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump is unpopular among Canadians. A poll found that the news story this year that <a href="https://www.pollara.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-News-Recall-Dec-2024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made Canadian respondents “angriest”</a> was about Mr. Trump’s election win, followed by the news of his tariff threat.</p><p>On Christmas, Mr. Trump floated the idea that the NHL legend <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113715216746072252" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wayne Gretzky</a> could run to be the next prime minister of Canada.</p><p>Or, as Mr. Trump put it, “soon to be known as the Governor of Canada.”</p><p>Mr. Gretzky, who has publicly supported several Conservative rivals of Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal Party, and his family attended Mr. Trump’s victory party at his Mar-a-Lago resort after the November election, according to photographs of the event.</p><p>Mr. Trump said Mr. Gretzky “had no interest” in running for prime minister but urged Canadians to “start a DRAFT WAYNE GRETZKY Movement. It would be so much fun to watch!”</p><p>Last week, Mr. Trudeau’s hold on power slipped and his political future became uncertain after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/canada/chrystia-freeland-resigns-canada-finance-minister.html" title="">Chrystia Freeland,</a> the deputy prime minister and finance minister, unexpectedly quit those posts. She renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement during the first Trump administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>She left after Mr. Trudeau said that he was going move her out of the finance minister’s job, one of the most important cabinet positions, to a vague role dealing with the United States. In a blistering resignation letter, Ms. Freeland said she was frustrated by recent economic moves from Trudeau’s government, including the lifting of a federal sales tax on some items during the holiday season. She called them “political gimmicks” that would weaken Canada’s economy at a moment when the country needed to prepare itself for potential tariffs.</p><p>In the aftermath, a growing number of Liberal members of Parliament called for Mr. Trudeau to quit as their leader and, thus, as prime minister. All of the opposition parties, including Mr. Trudeau’s former allies the New Democrats, are now vowing to bring down his government when Parliament resumes at the end of January.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113666067546631826" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">derided Ms. Freeland on social media</a> after she stepped down, writing, “Her behavior was totally toxic, and not at all conducive to making deals which are good for the very unhappy citizens of Canada. She will not be missed!!!”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ian Austen reports on Canada for The Times based in Ottawa.
