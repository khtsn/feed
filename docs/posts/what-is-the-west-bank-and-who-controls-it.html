name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Israeli troops raided two Palestinian cities on Wednesday in what they called an effort to tamp down rising militancy in the northern West Bank. The raids <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/29/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war" title="">continued on Thursday</a>, with the Israeli military saying it had killed several militants during a gun battle in a mosque.</p><p>The renewed violence has cast a spotlight on the Israeli-occupied territory, where over 600 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces, according <a href="https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/humanitarian-situation-update-204-west-bank" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to the United Nations</a>, in parallel to the devastating war in Gaza.</p><p>Here’s what to know:</p><h2 id="link-7835adb7">What is the West Bank?</h2><p>Roughly three million Palestinians and 500,000 settlers live in the West Bank, a kidney-shaped area between Israel and Jordan that has been a battleground between Israelis and Palestinians for decades.</p><p>The modern territory emerged after the 1948 war that created Israel; during the conflict, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes, with many taking refuge in the West Bank. Jordan occupied and then annexed the territory after the war.</p><p>In 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank and other territories in a war with neighboring Arab states. For religious Jews, the territory’s rolling hills and ancient sites were the heart of what they deemed a divinely promised homeland.</p><p>Israel slowly began permitting its own citizens — propelled by both nationalism and religious fervor — to build and expand settlements in the West Bank. But it never formally annexed the territory, fearing both the diplomatic repercussions abroad and that it might end the country’s coveted Jewish majority at home. </p><p>Gradually, a two-tier system developed in the West Bank. Israeli citizens live there, vote in Israeli elections and generally enjoy the rights and privileges of their compatriots who live within the country’s internationally recognized boundaries.</p><p>Their Palestinian neighbors, meanwhile, live under Israeli military rule. They have never had the right to vote for Israel’s government, whose decisions shape their everyday lives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel signing the agreement known as the Oslo Accords, in Washington, in 1993.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">J.

They hoped the Authority would become the basis for a future sovereign Palestine.</p><p>Under the agreements, the West Bank was broadly divided into three fragmented zones until the two sides could hash out a final deal. In the largest — comprising 60 percent of the West Bank — Israel would maintain direct control. Palestinian officials would hold varying degrees of autonomy in the other two.</p><p>That future state has never materialized, with both sides pointing figures at one another for the failure to reach an accord in the intervening decades.</p><p>Israeli leaders blamed Palestinian officials for rejecting peace offers and launching the Second Intifada, an uprising in which suicide attacks killed many Israeli civilians across the country. Israel struck back by recapturing major Palestinian cities in the West Bank in devastating battles with militants. </p><p>Palestinian leaders insist that Israel was never serious about reaching an agreement and note that most Israeli politicians today reject giving them an independent state at all.</p><h2 id="link-416c2377">Who controls the West Bank now?</h2><p>In practice, the Israeli military wields overriding security control over Palestinian cities and has the ultimate say on whoever wants to enter or leave the territory. Palestinians suspected of involvement in violence against Israelis are generally judged in Israeli military courts. Lacking full sovereign alternatives, Palestinians buy much of their electricity and water from Israel.</p><p>Officials from the Palestinian Authority still administer some local matters: trash collection, education, hospitals and schools. They also have their own local security forces, who coordinate with their Israeli counterparts but have limited authority. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli soldiers arrested two Palestinian men during a raid in the Nur Shams camp, near the city of Tulkarm, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaafar Ashtiyeh/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Palestinians argue that Israel has managed to continue ruling the West Bank while saddling the Authority with the responsibility to provide services to the territory’s Palestinian residents. In the past, some accepted this as a necessary step on the path to statehood, but many Israeli leaders now reject the idea of ever allowing Palestinians to have a sovereign state.</p><h2 id="link-211488a4">Why is there fighting in the West Bank?</h2><p>Israeli troops are in Tulkarm and Jenin to fend off the rising influence of Palestinian militant groups, who have become increasingly dominant in the northern West Bank. According to the Israeli military, roughly 150 attacks were launched at Israelis from the two areas over the past year.</p><p>The dwindling hope for a diplomatic end to Israeli rule has turbocharged the influence of groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, who believe in open-ended armed struggle against Israel, including attacks on civilians.</p><p>Newer local militias have also sprung up, made up of younger Palestinians who — having lost faith in a long-moribund peace process — believe that only violence will advance their cause. At the same time, Israel’s regional archnemesis, Iran, has sought to pump in more advanced weaponry in an attempt to spur further unrest.</p><p>The Palestinian Authority, whose leaders are broadly unpopular with the Palestinian public, has worked closely with Israeli security forces to crack down on the militants. But the increasingly frail body has seen its grip erode, particularly in the northern West Bank, such as in refugee camps in Tulkarm and Jenin.</p><p>Israeli military officials often say they would prefer to see Palestinian officers arrest the militants. But as long as the armed groups continue to plot attacks unhindered, Israeli soldiers will raid the cities to get at them, they say.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporting fellow with a focus on international news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman">More about Aaron Boxerman</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The War That Won’t End:</strong> It’s been nearly a year since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks in Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. “The Daily” explains <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/podcasts/the-daily/israel-gaza-hamas.html">why the conflict is still going</a>, and what it would take to end it.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Spotlight on Israel’s Bedouins:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/who-is-qaid-farhan-al-qadi-israel-hostage.html">Farhan al-Qadi</a>, the hostage rescued by the Israeli military from Gaza, is a member of the Bedouin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostage-bedouin.html">an Arab community marginalized by Israel</a> that suffered painful losses on Oct. 7.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.-Iran Nuclear Talks:</strong> Iran’s supreme leader suggested that his country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-talks-khamenei.html">would pursue nuclear negotiations</a> with the United States, but it was unclear if his comments signaled a shift in relations between the two countries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hamas’s Elusive Leader:</strong> Yahya Sinwar is by far Hamas’s most important figure, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/politics/israel-hamas-sinwar.html">his success in evading capture or death</a> has denied Israel a military success that could help end the war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza’s Orphans:</strong> The war in Gaza is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/middleeast/gaza-orphans.html">making so many orphans</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/middleeast/gaza-orphans.html"> </a>that no agency or aid group can count them.
