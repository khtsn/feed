But how to choose a destination when you’re overloaded with options and short on time? We’ve zeroed in on five places<strong> </strong>that should appeal to a range of budgets and preferences — whether you’re in the mood to park yourself on a white-sand beach, hike through meadows or gorge on art, baguettes and <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014757-socca" title="">socca</a>. All the hotels listed below still have availability (at press time) for March, April and May; rates listed are for March.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A 17th-century convent in Nice’s Old Town reopened last year as Hôtel du Couvent, with 88 guest rooms and three restaurants.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Giulio Ghirardi</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-7138bf3c">Food: Nice, France</h2><p>Finding a good meal in Nice was never the problem, says Philip Haslett, the Provence-based founder of the travel agency <a href="https://www.frenchpromise.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">French Promise</a>. After all, this perennially sunny city, the largest on the French Riviera, is home to sumptuous outdoor markets (open year-round), excellent seafood and countless inventive bistros (like <a href="https://www.peixes.fr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peixes</a> and <a href="https://oliveartichaut.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Olive &amp; Artichaut</a>). The art scene is just as <a href="https://www.explorenicecotedazur.com/en/explore/places-to-visit/museums-in-nice-cote-dazur/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prodigious</a>. But until recently, high-end hotels were scarce. Now, two old winter palace hotels have been resurrected with splashy new occupants — the 151-room <a href="https://www.anantara.com/en/plaza-nice" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anantara Plaza Nice Hotel</a>, from a Thailand-based luxury brand <em>(from about $360 a night)</em>, and, down the street, <a href="https://maison-albar-hotels-le-victoria.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maison Albar’s Le Victoria</a>, with 132 rooms and a marbled spa <em>(from about $370 a night).</em> Another notable newcomer, <a href="https://www.hotelducouvent.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hôtel du Couvent</a>, resides in a 17th-century convent, this one in the middle of Nice’s Old Town. Opened last summer, it’s a discreetly glamorous and surprisingly kid-friendly compound with 88 guest rooms, three restaurants, gardens, thermal baths, an herbalist, a bakery and its own monthly farmers’ market <em>(from about $400 a night)</em>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The arrival pavilion at the Amanyara resort on Providenciales, the main island of Turks and Caicos.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Aman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The beach at Amanyara overlooks Northwest Point Marine National Park.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Aman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3c60cc65">Beach: Turks and Caicos</h2><p>When it comes to the Caribbean fantasy of powdery sand and translucent sea, few places deliver like Turks and Caicos, even if it isn’t actually in the Caribbean. The British territory, a cluster of nine inhabited islands and dozens of islets and cays, sits southeast of the Bahamas in the Atlantic, within easy reach of the U.S. mainland. That’s why the old-guard hotels that line Grace Bay, on the main island of Providenciales, tend to book up quickly in winter and spring. Jill Taylor, a travel adviser at <a href="https://jetsetworldtravel.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jetset World Travel</a>, says the area is particularly well-suited for avid swimmers and families with young children: In spring especially, “the barrier reef keeps the water really calm.” For more modest rates, she steers families to the <a href="https://thewestbayclub.gracebayresorts.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">West Bay Club</a>, an oceanfront condo hotel <em>(from about $660 a night).</em> The newer <a href="https://rockhouse.gracebayresorts.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rock House</a>, down the beach and evocative of a Greek island retreat, is arguably a better fit for couples or broods with older kids <em>(from about $1,040 a night)</em>. The most indulgent option on the island, <a href="https://www.aman.com/resorts/amanyara?adgroup_name=brand_amanyara_pure_pure-Amanyara_inmarket&amp;utm_campaign=lux_aman_ggl_sem_property_amer-us-east_en_brand_amanyara_tc_pure_prospecting_mix_conv_all&amp;keyword=amanyara&amp;utm_term=amanyara&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=brand_amanyara_pure_pure-Amanyara_inmarket&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA2JG9BhAuEiwAH_zf3uN5VUDGKAteB3L3K1CatwupanzxwkfAJFP6MLPBDJEeL7ipuiy5phoCxQkQAvD_BwE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amanyara</a> claims a prime spot on the island’s northwest coast, just outside a national marine park <em>( from about $3,585 a night)</em>. For even more privacy, <a href="https://www.pinecay.com/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pine Cay</a> is the only hotel on the island of the same name and has just 11 large rooms and two stand-alone cottages, all beachfront, with two new larger houses set to open in April <em>(from about $2,200 a night).</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-6"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Puqio, an old storage hut was turned into connecting guest rooms.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Puqio</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The camp’s tents are furnished with wood-burning stoves and outdoor bathtubs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Puqio</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-6b3fcbf5">Mountains: The Peruvian Andes</h2><p>March and early April fall at the end of<strong> </strong>Peru’s rainy season. But visiting then means avoiding crowds and steep prices, says Joe Sandillo, a co-founder of the specialty tour operator <a href="https://exeterlatinamerica.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Exeter Latin America</a>. “And it isn’t like it rains all day, every day,” he says. For those determined to see Machu Picchu, Sandillo suggests flying to the mountain city of Cusco, then driving immediately to the Sacred Valley (which sits at a slightly lower elevation) to better acclimate to the altitude. Base yourself at <a href="https://www.hotelsolyluna.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sol y Luna</a>, where the profits from the 43 casitas help fund a local school <em>(from about $550 a night), </em>or the riverside Belmond hotel <a href="https://www.belmond.com/hotels/south-america/peru/sacred-valley/belmond-hotel-rio-sagrado/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA-5a9BhCBARIsACwMkJ4D7phdjFPvfioLYxzAq3vsTrkiA1ypTMZ25wkApY0lJfitKauJSmQaAj45EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rio Sagrado</a>, with its 19 rooms and two villas <em>(from about $750 a night). </em>After a few days of hikes and poolside pisco sours, head back to culturally rich Cusco and settle into <a href="https://www.belmond.com/hotels/south-america/peru/cusco/belmond-palacio-nazarenas/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Belmond’s Palacio Nazarenas</a>, a 17th-century palace and convent turned kid-friendly resort <em>(from about $960 a night).</em> For return visitors, Sandillo recommends Colca Canyon in Southern Peru, where the landscape is equally spectacular but far less touristed, and where <a href="https://www.puqio.pe/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Puqio</a>, a new luxury camp, offers guided hikes and village visits <em>(from about $1,120 a night, including meals and excursions)</em>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Blind Tiger Asheville, a 14-room hotel on the north end of the city’s downtown. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matt Kisiday</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-68f971e1">Wildflowers: Asheville, N.C.</h2><p>After Hurricane Helene tore through Asheville last year, “many people are hesitant to visit,” says the ceramist <a href="https://akirasatake.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Akira Satake</a>, who lost his studio in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/arts/hurricane-helene-asheville-nc-arts-district.html" title="">low-lying River Arts District</a>. “But our community is working hard to get back to normal, and we need visitors.” Around April, when dozens of varieties of <a href="https://www.blueridgeparkway.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Blue-Ridge-Parkway-Bloom-Calendar.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wildflowers</a> start blooming in the surrounding mountains, most sections of the Blue Ridge Parkway, the 469-mile scenic drive that cuts through town, should be open again, along with the majority of the area’s hiking trails (check with the tourism office for <a href="https://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoors/hike-finder" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">updates</a>). Asheville’s other big draw, the Biltmore Estate, was largely spared by the storm. Though some of the grounds, which were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, are still closed for repairs, the 1895 Biltmore House and the Walled Garden, where the spring blooms are <a href="https://www.biltmore.com/visit/biltmore-estate/gardens-grounds/bloom-report/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">meticulously choreographe</a>d, are open to visitors. The <a href="https://www.biltmore.com/stay/the-inn/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inn on Biltmore Estate</a>, the more pampering of the two on-site hotels, plans to finish renovations of all 210 rooms by May 9 <em>(from about $370 a night)</em>. Downtown, where the center of Asheville’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/dining/asheville-restaurants-hurricane-helene.html" title="">celebrated restaurant scene</a> is, are two newer boutique hotels: the pattern-happy <a href="https://www.larkhotels.com/hotels/blind-tiger-asheville?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA5Ka9BhB5EiwA1ZVtvJ1mMmVxCKeUU6lX7kIfhORkd0engcW5jYLgGVfTHDJAL5imHrg-xRoCuuwQAvD_BwE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blind Tiger</a><em> (from about $150 a night) </em>and <a href="https://www.zeldadearest.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zelda Dearest</a>, which moved into four 19th-century buildings around the corner from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/dining/favorite-restaurant-list-america.html" title="">the popular Indian restaurant Chai Pani</a> <em>(from about $200 a night).</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A former carpentry workshop in Lisbon’s Barrio Alto neighborhood is now the 24-room Pátio do Tijolo hotel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manuel Gomes da Costa</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Designed by the owners, the Barcelona-based siblings Natalia and Juan Tubella, and the local architect Carina Seelig, the hotel is primarily furnished with pieces from Spain and Portugal.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salva Lopez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-22db2ed7">City: Lisbon, Portugal</h2><p>“Lisbon used to be sort of like fado music,” says Virginia Irurita, the founder of the travel company <a href="https://www.madeforspainandportugal.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Made for Spain and Portugal</a>, “sad, quiet and decadent. But it’s full of energy now.” That’s especially true in summer, but spring is<strong> </strong>increasingly<strong> </strong>popular too: The days are mild, the city’s many orange trees are fragrant and restaurant reservations at cool neighborhood spots like <a href="https://www.danoilisboa.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Da Noi</a> are easier to come by. You’ll also find more elbow room at the museums, including <a href="https://www.ccb.pt/en/macccb/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MAC/CCB,</a> and in the hilltop palaces of Sintra, 20 miles north. Among the most serene of a new crop of hotels is the 24-room <a href="https://www.patiodotijolo.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pátio do Tijolo</a>, a breezily modern retreat in the hilly Barrio Alto neighborhood <em>(from about $190</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>a night). </em>A year before Covid,<em> </em>the <a href="https://www.hotelstheone.com/en/lisbon-hotels/the-one-palacio-da-anunciada/booking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One Palacio da Anunciada</a><em> </em>opened near Avenida da Liberdade, the city’s high-end shopping street, with 82 rooms and suites and a swimming pool. “It’s a little resort in the middle of the city, great for kids,” says Irurita <em>(from about $310 a night)</em>. Another of her favorites, the 61-room Palacio Ludovice, is a wine-themed hotel that occupies the 18th-century home of a royal architect (<em>from about $310 a night</em>).</p></div></div></section></article></div>
