    <h1>Instagram and Facebook Blocked and Hid Abortion Pill Providers’ Posts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aid Access, one of the largest abortion pill providers in the United States, said some posts were removed on its Facebook account and blurred out on its Instagram account since November, with more posts blurred in recent days. The abortion pill service said it has been blocked from accessing its Facebook account since November, and its Instagram account was suspended last week, though it has since been restored.</p><p>The Instagram accounts of other abortion pill providers, including Women Help Women and Just the Pill, were also suspended in recent days. The providers said the reason that Meta gave them for the suspensions was that their accounts did not “follow our Community Standards on guns, drugs and other restricted goods.” Both accounts were restored on Thursday.</p><p>The Instagram account of Hey Jane, another abortion pill provider, was recently invisible in Instagram search, said Rebecca Davis, who leads marketing at Hey Jane. Something similar happened in 2023 until Meta reversed it, she said.</p><p>“We know firsthand that this suppression actively prevents Hey Jane from reaching people who are seeking out timely health care information,” Ms. Davis said. “Given Meta’s recent promises around free speech, we’re incredibly disappointed to see how the platform is restricting our free speech.”</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration permits telehealth providers to prescribe online and deliver by mail the prescription drugs that cause an abortion, mifepristone and misoprostol. Twelve states have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" title="">banned abortion</a> and more have placed gestational limits or restrictions on mail-order pills. But providers in states where abortion is legal have been mailing pills to states with bans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/health/abortion-shield-laws-telemedicine.html" title="">under shield laws</a> meant to protect them.</p><p>Sheera Frenkel<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
