    <h1>Israel Bombs Houthi Targets in Yemen After Missile Launches by Militans</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In response to the Israeli strike, Mohammed Abdulsalam, a Houthi spokesman, released a statement saying, “The targeting of Sanaa International Airport and other civilian infrastructure is a Zionist crime against the entire Yemeni people.” He added, “If the Zionist enemy thinks that its crimes will deter Yemen from supporting Gaza, it is delusional.”</p><p>Israel and the Houthis, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/houthi-yemen-red-sea-attacks.html" title="">who act as the de facto government in much of northern Yemen</a>, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in solidarity with Hamas since shortly after the Palestinian militia in Gaza led attacks on Israel on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/issue/world/2024/10/21/the-oct-7-attacks" title="">Oct. 7, 2023,</a> prompting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-oct-7-year-of-war.html" title="">war in</a> the enclave.</p><p>Military analysts have widely deemed the Houthis less powerful than other Iran-backed militias like Hezbollah in Lebanon or Hamas in Gaza. But Israel may be turning more attention to the Houthis now as the last major Iranian proxy threatening its borders, after reaching a cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah last month and largely undermining Hamas’s ability in Gaza over more than a year of war.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu, referring to Iran’s proxies and the toppled government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, said: “The Houthis, too, will learn what Hamas, Hezbollah, the Assad regime and others have learned. And even if it takes time, this lesson will be understood across the Middle East.”</p><p>The air assault on Thursday, Israel’s fourth in Yemen over the past year, comes a week after Israeli fighter jets flew more than 1,000 miles to bomb sites in the country, including in Sana and on the port city of Salif. The Israeli military said it had struck infrastructure like power plants, as well as fuel and oil tanks.</p></div></div>
