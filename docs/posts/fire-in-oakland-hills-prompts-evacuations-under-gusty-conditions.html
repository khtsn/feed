There were no reports of injuries, and Oakland Fire Department officials said that the forward progress of the wind-driven fire had been stopped.</p><p>Images shared by fire officials showed aircraft flying through billowing smoke, dousing the hillside below as a fire engine fixed its hose on a home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“If air resources don’t get here as quickly as they did, we might have a different report right now,” Damon Covington, the Oakland fire chief, said at a news conference.</p><p>The area has some of the East Bay’s most desirable homes, with those near the top of the Oakland Hills peering over the San Francisco Bay with views of city skylines. But the 1991 blaze also looms in the memories of longtime residents as a deadly threat, especially in an era of climate change that has included some of the most destructive wildfires in California history.</p><p>Arthur Shanks, 45, stood and gazed at the hills from a parking lot near the fire in Oakland, worried about what residents might lose as firefighting helicopters flew overhead. The threat of future fires loomed over his mind.</p><p> “If it’s something that could get out of control, you’re always worried about that,” he said. “That fire in ’91 just kept jumping and jumping around. There’s a possibility that a fire could get started like that.”</p><p>At least 80 firefighters were dispatched to the area on Friday after the call came in at around 1:30 p.m., and officials ordered evacuations of hundreds of homes. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>For a short period, the fire prompted officials to stop traffic on <a href="https://x.com/caltransd4/status/1847393234991141366?s=46&amp;t=8H3FDbkvfJkXNtBv_SrGPg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Interstate 580</a> less than half a mile west of the blaze.</p><p>The National Weather Service <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1290156772382241&amp;set=a.943508447047077" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued red flag warnings for much of the Bay Area</a> this week as forecasters predicted a combination of conditions that made fires more likely. Strong wind gusts, low humidity and dry fuel had fire officials across the region on high alert.</p><p>The fire started just outside a home, and a man who was sleeping inside was able to get away after he heard an explosion that shattered a window, the chief said.</p><p>The cause was still under investigation. Under high-risk conditions like those on Friday, Mr. Covington said, “something as small as a cigarette” would be capable of sparking a blaze.</p><p>Travis Bristol and his wife, Tolani Britton, were on their way home from Costco to their Oakland Hills home around 1:30 p.m. when they spotted a roaring flame and smoke curling through the trees. Because it seemed far away, they didn’t think their home was in danger.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But shortly afterward, helicopters were above their neighborhood ordering them to evacuate.</p><p>“I was absolutely terrified, and I think I’m still shaken,” said Mr. Bristol, 42, an associate professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, adding that he and his wife were thankful that their two children were in schools out of the area.</p><p>As the windy conditions grew worse, the utility company Pacific Gas &amp; Electric began pre-emptively cutting off power to some customers beginning on Thursday evening. On Friday afternoon, more than 35,000 customers in the state were without power, according to Poweroutage.us, which tracks utility data.</p><p>Strong winds were expected in the East Bay until at least 11 p.m. on Friday, and until Saturday morning in other parts of Northern California. Winds blowing from offshore could reach up to 35 miles per hour through the evening, potentially making it more difficult for firefighters to stop the blaze.</p><p>The National Weather Service also warned that “critical fire conditions” were possible in Southern California through Saturday, with the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountain ranges expected to see wind gusts of up to 50 miles per hour.</p><p>October has become ever more dangerous in California as heat waves continue deeper into the fall season and landscapes become ever more parched months after the last major rainfall.</p><p>Erin McCann<!-- -->, <!-- -->Coral Murphy Marcos<!-- --> and <!-- -->Corina Knoll<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
