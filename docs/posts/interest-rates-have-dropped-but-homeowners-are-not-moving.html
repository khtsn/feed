His answer was maybe a bit too frank.</p><p>“Great question,” Glenn Kelman, the C.E.O., began on the call on Aug. 6, “Plan B is to drink our own urine or our competitors’ blood.”</p><p>A little more than a minute later, he corrected himself, saying that he shouldn’t have used those exact words. But to the analysts on the call, his point was clear: The housing economy is in trouble, and a major reason has been soaring interest rates, which hit a high-water mark of 7.79 percent last fall.</p><p>Since then, the 30-year mortgage rate has dipped into the low 7s, then the high 6s and as of last week, it fell to 6.35 percent. The drop — coupled with a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/business/economy/fed-minutes-cut-likely.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">likely</a>” rate cut by the Federal Reserve at their upcoming meeting in September — should spell good news for the housing economy, but a major structural problem remains. Close to 60 percent of homeowners have outstanding mortgages that are locked in at rates below 4 percent, according to recently released <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/mortgage-rate-lock-in-housing-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> from Redfin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If a homeowner sold and bought a new home in a comparable neighborhood, they would forego a low rate for another that is at least 2.5 percentage points higher. For many homeowners, that simply doesn’t make sense — a phenomenon that economists call the “golden handcuffs.”</p><p>While the recent dip in the mortgage rate has been significant — over 1 point in less than a year — I interviewed seven economists, as well as finance and real estate experts, who say it’s not enough.</p><p>“It’s a drop in the bucket,” said Sam Khater, the chief economist of Freddie Mac.</p><h2 id="link-6e473ed6">A Sisyphean Battle</h2><p>The recent decrease in rates is equivalent to a 2 percent reduction in the price of the home, according to Daniel McCue, a senior research associate at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p><p>The math is as follows: Take a house priced at the national median, which is around $430,000. The recent drop in interest rates would have shaved $66 off the monthly payment of around $3,435, Mr. McCue estimates. Had the interest rate not dropped, that $66 in savings is equivalent to buying the same house for around $424,000.</p><p>While that may sound significant, Mr. McCue points out that this year alone, the price of homes has inched up over 4.5 percent, according to the <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/indicators/sp-corelogic-case-shiller-us-national-home-price-nsa-index/#overview" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Case-Shiller index</a>. Mr. McCue estimates that rates would need to drop almost another half point — down to around 6.09 percent — for homeowners to get back to the payments they would have had in the first month of 2024.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He paints a picture of a Sisyphean battle: Rates have come down, reducing the cost of a monthly mortgage, but even as they fall, prices continue to rise, negating any savings.</p><p>“The bottom line,” said Mr. McCue, “It’s not enough to kind of make up for these rising prices.”</p><h2 id="link-838ad6b">Sidelines</h2><p>As many as 800,000 fewer moves occurred last year, a direct result of what economists call the “rate lock effect” or the “golden handcuffs,” according to a <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32781/w32781.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paper</a> published last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.</p><p>Growing families have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/02/realestate/housing-market-rates-prices-slow.html" title="">postponed</a> moving to more spacious homes. Households hoping to trade up have held off. And a lot of people have been sitting on the sidelines, waiting and watching.</p><p>Yet people are itching to pack their bags, according to a <a href="https://point.com/blog/point-movers-study-housing-gridlock-report-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> of over 1,000 homeowners published by Point, a home equity startup, on Wednesday.
