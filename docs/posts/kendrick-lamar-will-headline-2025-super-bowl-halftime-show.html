It is the second time that the rapper from Compton, Calif., will take part in the event, but will be his first as the headline act.</p><p>The booking comes amid a busy year for the rapper. Earlier this spring, Lamar and Drake traded bars in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-drake-beef.html" title="">high-profile beef</a>, which resulted in Lamar’s hit song “Not Like Us.”</p><p>“Rap music is still the most impactful genre to date,” Lamar said in a statement. “And I’ll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.”</p><p>The league announced Lamar as the performer during the opening Sunday of its season, when the majority of its teams will play their games.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He last performed on the Super Bowl stage in 2022, as part of the event’s first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/13/arts/music/super-bowl-halftime-show-review.html" title="">showcase for hip-hop music</a>, led by the West Coast superstars Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, as well as Eminem, 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige.</p><p>“Kendrick Lamar is truly a once-in-a-generation artist and performer,” Jay-Z, the founder of Roc Nation, said in a statement. “His deep love for hip-hop and culture informs his artistic vision. He has an unparalleled ability to define and influence culture globally. Kendrick’s work transcends music, and his impact will be felt for years to come.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
