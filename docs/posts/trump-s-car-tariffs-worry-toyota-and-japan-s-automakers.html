So, as the tariff deadline approaches, Japan is now preparing for a blow that could be devastating not only to the profits of the nation’s automakers but to its overall economy.</p><p>With Japan’s economy already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/business/japan-2024-gdp-yen.html" title="">stifled</a> by inflation, some economists estimate that if Mr. Trump’s automotive tariffs take effect as threatened, they could wipe out 40 percent of potential economic growth this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Toyota vehicles at the Toyota Kaikan Museum.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fred Mery/Bloomberg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Trump has long had a combative relationship with Japanese car companies. In the 1980s, when he floated the possibility of a presidential run, Mr. Trump railed against auto giants from Japan, once telling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/politics/china-trade-donald-trump.html" title="">Oprah Winfrey</a> that they come to the United States and “knock the hell out of” local manufacturers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Shortly after Mr. Trump was first elected in 2016, Toyota came forward with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/trump-abe-meeting-japan-trade-defense.html" title="">plans</a> to invest $10 billion in the United States. Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe — who was considered a skilled Trump whisperer — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/world/asia/japan-trump-shinzo-abe.html" title="">leveraged</a> the president’s love of adulation and secured a promise not to impose additional duties on Japanese cars.</p><p>Japan’s success in fending off tariffs the first time around was part of the reason many leaders in the automotive industry were sanguine — and even hopeful — about another Trump term. The other reason, especially for Toyota, involved electric vehicles, which Mr. Trump had mostly ridiculed before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-buy-tesla-elon-musk.html" title="">recently</a> declaring himself a fan of Tesla, the company run by his close adviser Elon Musk.</p><p>In the early 2020s, when many of its competitors rushed into electric vehicles, Toyota held firm to the hybrid gas-electric cars it had pioneered decades earlier. The company argued that the world was not fully ready for electric vehicles. They were expensive for consumers and the infrastructure needed to charge their batteries remained incomplete.</p><p>Automakers were also mostly selling electric vehicles at a loss. The prospect of Mr. Trump’s rolling back initiatives intended to rapidly spur the transition to electric cars was seen as a way for Toyota to buy time, given that it had only one mass-market electric vehicle available in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan with President Trump in 2018.

Much of this lobbying came via Toyota’s network of car dealerships, some of which, after being prompted by Toyota, conveyed their concerns about a swift transition to electric vehicles to elected officials, according to correspondence viewed by The New York Times.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A spokesman for Toyota said providing customers with affordable vehicles and a variety of options was the best way to reduce emissions as soon as possible, which is the company’s goal. “A consumer-driven market will bring more stability and healthy competition to the auto industry,” he said.</p><p>At the January dealership meeting in Texas, leaders of Toyota’s North America business said that they believed the company had held firm during the presidency of Joseph R. Biden Jr., and that they were now hopeful they had more “like-minded politicians” in positions of power, according to two people who attended the event who were not authorized to talk publicly.</p><p>The next month, Mr. Trump outlined plans for tariffs that could hit exports of cars from Canada, Mexico and likely Japan.</p><p>The Trump administration’s plans for tariffs have shifted often. But the prospect of new taxes on foreign-made cars is already weighing on Japanese auto companies and some of their dealerships in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>In Maine, Adam Lee is the chairman of Lee Auto Malls, one of the state’s largest auto dealership groups.

Executives at Nissan and Honda have warned that Mr. Trump’s tariff plans would carve deeply into their earnings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For Japan, whose top export is cars, a 25 percent tariff on automobile exports to the United States could reduce the country’s gross domestic product by around 0.2 percent this year, according to estimates from Japan’s Nomura Research Institute.</p><p>Given that Japan’s economy has a potential growth rate of only around 0.5 percent this year, a 0.2 percent hit to G.D.P. would represent a “considerable blow,” according to the research institute.</p><p>For now, some Japanese car companies are trying to accelerate shipments to the United States before April 2. They are also beginning preparations to ramp up production to the extent they can at the 24 manufacturing plants they operate inside the United States.</p><p>Over the past seven decades, Toyota has invested more than $50 billion in the United States, and it will continue to deepen those investments, a spokesman for the company said. Including in the United States, where it directly employs more than 49,000 people, Toyota’s philosophy has always been to “build where it sells and buy where it builds,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Toyota built nearly half of the 2.3 million cars it sold in the United States abroad last year.

They are hoping lawmakers can help make the case for how much Japanese auto manufacturers invest in the United States and how tariffs could hurt American consumers by raising prices.</p><p>So far, Japanese officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/japan-trump-tariffs-auto-steel-trade.html" title="">failed</a> to gain promises of exemptions from tariffs.</p><p>Three people involved in the lobbying efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, say they are repeatedly asked: Are there any new investments they can commit to or ones in the pipeline they can repackage as inspired by the new president?</p><p>At the moment, the people said, they do not have new large projects to show.</p><p>Most Japanese automakers do not have excess production capacity in the United States, according to Michael Robinet, a vice president at the automotive intelligence provider S&amp;P Global Mobility. That means that if they want to manufacture more vehicles, they would have to build new factories.</p><p>But factories would take years to build and demand significant investments from companies currently facing a “highly unstable trade environment,” Mr. Robinet said. “Automakers are not going to make decisions that have lots of zeros behind them unless they know that they have a solid business case,” he said. “And right now they don’t.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Venezuelan Oil:</strong> President Trump threatened tariffs against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/trump-threatens-tariffs-against-countries-that-buy-venezuelan-oil.html">countries that bought oil from Venezuela</a>, claiming that the South American country “purposefully and deceitfully” sent criminals and murderers into America.</p></li><li><p><strong>Japan’s Automakers:</strong> Toyota and other Japanese automakers thought a second Trump administration could be good for them.
