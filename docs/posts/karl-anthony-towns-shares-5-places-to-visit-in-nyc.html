He is already a fan favorite in the five boroughs, recently earning the nickname the Big Bodega, a clever play on his size, and his New York and Dominican roots.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“You know you’re stepping into holy ground,” he said of playing at the Garden. “It’s called the Mecca for a reason.”</p><p>His tenure so far in New York has not been all business. Mr. Towns and his girlfriend, the model Jordyn Woods, enjoy eating their way around Manhattan, stopping at <a href="https://noburestaurants.com/downtown/home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobu Downtown</a> or <a href="https://www.thecornerstoresoho.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Corner Store</a> in SoHo, or grabbing postgame takeout at <a href="https://www.joespizzanyc.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joe’s Pizza</a>, <a href="https://www.rubyscafe.com/location/soho/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Little Ruby’s Cafe</a> on Mulberry Street or his guilty pleasure, <a href="https://www.empanadamama.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Empanada Mama</a>.</p><p>“Shout-out to Big Mama, holding it down at night,” Mr. Towns said.</p><p>Here are five of Mr. Towns’s favorite places in New York City (sadly, no bodegas).</p><h2 id="link-3b0ff1c8">1. Yankee Stadium</h2></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some of Mr. Towns’s most cherished childhood memories are of the outfield bleachers of the old Yankee Stadium.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>During this year’s playoff run, Mr. Towns was a fixture at the new Yankee stadium.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adrienne Grunwald for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Just as nostalgic as the Garden for Mr. Towns is another iconic city sports cathedral, <a href="https://www.mlb.com/yankees/ballpark" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yankee Stadium</a>. Some of his most cherished childhood memories are of the outfield bleachers of the old Yankee Stadium with his parents, wearing pinstripe uniforms and eating popcorn (still his go-to snack at the ballpark).</p><p>“They didn’t have a lot of money, but my parents made life special for me with the money we did have,” Mr. Towns said. (His mother died in 2020). His favorite moment at the stadium? When the Yankees legend Bernie Williams tossed him a baseball, which he still possesses, from the outfield in the early 2000s.</p><p>During this year’s playoff run, Mr. Towns was a fixture at the stadium, though with slightly better seats. “To watch the Yankees go to the World Series this year was a real treat as a fan,” he said, “and I’m really proud of my Yankees.”</p><h2 id="link-2ecb3c80">2. The Polo Bar</h2></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Everything is nicely branded,” said Mr. Towns of the Polo Bar.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Part of the appeal and experience of the Polo Bar, Mr. Towns believes, is the establishment’s distinguished décor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“<a href="https://www.ralphlauren.ca/global-polo-bar" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Polo Bar</a> is the definition of classic,” Mr. Towns said of the Midtown celebrity hot spot from the all-American fashion designer Ralph Lauren, and one of the toughest reservations in town (30 days in advance is recommended). Part of the appeal and experience is the distinguished décor: the brown saddle leather seats, stained wood-paneled walls and equestrian artwork. “Whatever you imagine a Ralph Lauren Polo restaurant or bar would look like is exactly what he did, and he did it at the highest level,” Mr. Towns said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>With Ms. Woods and his agent, Jessica Holtz, Mr. Towns recently dined at the Polo Bar, and he ordered the chicken paillard and Dover sole. “The service and the food is excellent and everything is nicely branded,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-4e9ab8ec">3.

Pub prices too — $14 cover charge on weekdays and a two-drink minimum.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-16"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dover Street Market is a seven-floor retail oasis of hypebeast brands.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Towns also respects its curated art installations.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The cool kids don’t just shop in Williamsburg or SoHo. <a href="https://newyork.doverstreetmarket.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dover Street Market</a>, which sits on the border of the NoMad and Murray Hill neighborhoods, is a seven-floor retail oasis of hypebeast brands, exclusive collaborations and runway-level looks with prices that have commas.</p><p>Mr. Towns, who listed Marni, Comme des Garçons, Rick Owens and Balenciaga as some of his top designers at the store, also respects its curated art installations that include textured walls and pillars. “Different cuts, different patterns, maybe outside-of-the-box-thinking of fashion,” he said. “I really like that.”</p><p>On a recent visit, Mr. Towns carved out time to grab a coffee at the colorful <a href="https://newyork.doverstreetmarket.com/pages/rose-bakery" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rose Bakery</a> on the store’s ground floor and indulge in a little shopping.
