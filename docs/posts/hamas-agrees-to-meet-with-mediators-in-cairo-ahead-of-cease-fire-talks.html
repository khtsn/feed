mediators before a new round of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-proposal-israel-hamas.html" title="">Gaza cease-fire talks</a>, as the United States, Qatar and Egypt push to reach an agreement they hope can stave off the growing threat of regional war.</p><p>The fighting in Gaza has raged on even as high-stakes efforts for a deal intensify, with Israeli strikes overnight killing dozens, according to Gazan health authorities. On Friday, the Israeli military announced that at least one soldier had been killed and several others wounded in fighting in central Gaza.</p><p>While U.S. officials have insisted there is progress in negotiations, the main warring parties, Israel and Hamas, have been far more pessimistic. In late July, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">stiffened Israel’s position</a> on several key issues, including by demanding a postwar Israeli presence along Gaza’s border with Egypt.</p><p>Hamas said in a statement that its delegation would arrive in Cairo on Saturday evening to “hear the results” of a recent round of discussions between Israel, Egypt and the United States. It said it was willing to move ahead with a proposal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/world/middleeast/gaza-cease-fire-talks-israel-hamas.html" title="">from early July</a>, before Mr. Netanyahu set out his new conditions.</p><p>Negotiators have been pushing for a major summit as early as Sunday to press ahead with the talks. Hamas did not specifically say whether it would participate; its officials did not join a similar round of discussions in Qatar earlier this month, calling it pointless given the new Israeli demands. But the visit to Cairo leaves the door open for further talks.</p><p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken visited Israel, Egypt and Qatar this week to push a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/middleeast/israel-cease-fire-proposal-hamas-blinken.html" title="">bridging proposal</a>,” which aims to close the gaps between Israel and Hamas. But the proposal does not tackle several key sticking points.</p><p>One of the main disputes is over Mr. Netanyahu’s insistence that Israeli forces maintain some presence along the Philadelphi Corridor, a section of the border between Egypt and Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu said that without Israeli oversight, Hamas would quickly use the area to smuggle weapons and rearm itself.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Philadelphi Corridor, a strip of land along Gaza’s southern border.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haitham Imad/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Both Hamas and Egypt have insisted that Israeli troops must leave the area, and Hamas officials have reiterated for months that any cease-fire agreement must lead to a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p><p>Also left unresolved are disagreements over how many Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange for hostages being held in Gaza, and Mr. Netanyahu’s condition that displaced Palestinians returning to northern Gaza be searched for weapons.</p><p>The United States, Egypt, and Qatar are eager to reach a deal they hope can tamp down tensions that have flared across the Middle East since the assassination last month of Hamas’s political leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html" title="">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, in Tehran, hours after an Israeli airstrike <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">killed a senior Hezbollah commander</a> in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.</p><p>Qatar’s prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, was also to arrive in Cairo on Saturday evening to participate in the talks, said an official familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to discuss the leader’s travel. Mr. Al- Thani has been one of the main mediators between Israel and Hamas for the past several months.</p><p>Inside Gaza, witnesses and medics recounted a night of heavy air, artillery, and drone strikes across central and southern parts of the enclave. The Civil Defense agency, a part of the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, also accused Israel of blocking access to some areas, and said the delays had cost some wounded people their lives.</p><p>In a statement on Saturday, the group described its delayed arrival at one family home near the city of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, where it said it found three people dead and was still searching for eight others missing beneath the rubble.</p><p>Israeli forces withdrew on Saturday from the district of Hamad, in Khan Younis, leaving behind scenes of vast destruction documented by Palestinian news outlets, which released images of razed streets covered in rubble and buildings with their facades blown away.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians carrying a body as they inspect damage after Israeli forces’ withdrawal from the Hamad district of Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hatem Khaled/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The ever-dwindling options for refuge have forced nearly 90 percent of Gaza’s nearly two million residents to flee, with many displaced repeatedly since the 10-month war began.</p><p>U.N. officials and aid groups have said that no place in Gaza is truly safe: Israel has vowed to strike Hamas forces wherever they operate, and accuses Hamas militants of camouflaging themselves amid civilian infrastructure.</p><p>On Saturday, Israel issued an evacuation order in parts of central Gaza, one of numerous announcements over the past few weeks calling on Gazans to flee to a ever-shrinking “humanitarian zone” where Israel has pledged they will be safer. The United Nations said on Friday that Israel had issued 12 evacuation orders in August alone, forcing as many as 250,000 people to flee.</p><p>The result has been massive overcrowding in the area that the orders specify as safer, known as Al-Mawasi, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people had already taken shelter.</p><p>Tariq Abutaha, a displaced Gazan in Al-Mawasi, said the streets were so clogged on Saturday that it took him roughly an hour to drive two miles. Mr. Abutaha came to the zone last month from his home in Qizan an Najjar, a southern suburb of Khan Younis.</p><p>“People are packed in meter by meter,” said Mr. Abutaha, adding that he and his family had “been forced to get used to it.”</p><p>Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> contributed reporting from Haifa, Israel.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporting fellow with a focus on international news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman">More about Aaron Boxerman</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
