On Saturday, the Israeli military announced that <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-announces-deaths-of-3-soldiers-killed-fighting-in-gaza-on-friday/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four soldiers had been killed in fighting Friday</a> in central Gaza.</p><p>While U.S. officials have insisted there is progress in negotiations, the main warring parties, Israel and Hamas, have been far more pessimistic. In late July, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">stiffened Israel’s position</a> on several critical issues, including by demanding a postwar Israeli presence along Gaza’s border with Egypt.</p><p>Senior officials involved in the negotiations began arriving in Egypt on Saturday, where mediators have been pushing for a summit as early as Sunday to press ahead with the talks.</p><p>David Barnea, the chief of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, as well as the prime minister of Qatar, one of the main mediators, were expected to attend, said an Israeli official and another official familiar with the matter, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director who has served as America’s top negotiator, will also attend, according to a U.S. official.</p><p>Hamas said in a statement that its delegation would reach Cairo on Saturday evening to “hear the results” of a recent round of discussions between Israel, Egypt and the United States. It said it was willing to move ahead with a proposal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/world/middleeast/gaza-cease-fire-talks-israel-hamas.html" title="">from early July</a>, before Mr. Netanyahu set out his new conditions.</p><p>Hamas did not specifically say whether it would participate; its officials did not join a similar round of discussions in Qatar earlier this month, calling it pointless given the new Israeli demands. But the timing of its visit to Cairo leaves the door open for further negotiations.</p><p>The United States, Egypt and Qatar are eager to reach a deal they hope can tamp down tensions that have flared across the Middle East since the assassination last month of Hamas’s political leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html" title="">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, in Tehran, hours after an Israeli airstrike <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">killed a senior Hezbollah commander</a> in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.</p><p>Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was set to visit the region for the next few days, with stops in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, the U.S. military said in a statement. General Brown will focus on “deterring further escalation of hostilities” alongside American support for Israel’s right to self-defense, the military said.</p><p>One of the main disputes in the cease-fire talks is over Mr. Netanyahu’s insistence that Israeli forces maintain some presence along the Philadelphi Corridor, a section of the border between Egypt and Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu said that without Israeli oversight, Hamas would quickly use the area to smuggle weapons and rearm itself.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Philadelphi Corridor, a strip of land along Gaza’s southern border.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haitham Imad/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Both Hamas and Egypt have insisted that Israeli troops must leave the area, and Hamas officials have reiterated for months that any cease-fire agreement must lead to a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p><p>Also left unresolved are disagreements over how many Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange for hostages being held in Gaza, and Mr. Netanyahu’s condition that displaced Palestinians returning to northern Gaza be searched for weapons.</p><p>Inside Gaza, witnesses and medics recounted a night of heavy air, artillery, and drone strikes across central and southern parts of the enclave. The Civil Defense agency, a part of the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, also accused Israel of having blocked access to some areas, and said the delays had cost some wounded people their lives.</p><p>In a statement on Saturday, the group described its delayed arrival at one family home near the city of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, where it said it had found three people dead and was still searching for eight others missing beneath the rubble. The Israeli military declined to comment on the record.</p><p>Israeli forces withdrew on Saturday from the district of Hamad, in Khan Younis, leaving behind vast destruction reported by Palestinian news outlets, which released images of streets covered in rubble and buildings with facades blown away.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians carrying a body as they inspect damage after Israeli forces’ withdrawal from the Hamad district of Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hatem Khaled/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The ever-dwindling options for refuge have forced nearly 90 percent of Gaza’s nearly two million residents to move from place to place within Gaza, with many displaced repeatedly since the 10-month war began.</p><p>U.N. officials and aid groups have said that no place in Gaza is truly safe: Israel has vowed to strike Hamas forces wherever they operate, and accuses Hamas militants of camouflaging themselves amid civilian infrastructure.</p><p>On Saturday, Israel issued an evacuation order for parts of central Gaza, one of numerous announcements over the past few weeks calling on Gazans to flee to an ever-shrinking “humanitarian zone” where Israel has pledged they will be safer. The United Nations said on Friday that Israel had issued 12 evacuation orders in August alone, forcing as many as 250,000 people to flee. The result has been massive overcrowding in the area that the orders specify as safer, known as Al-Mawasi, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people had already taken shelter.</p><p>Tariq Abutaha, a displaced Gazan in Al-Mawasi, said the streets were so clogged on Saturday that it took him roughly an hour to drive two miles. Mr. Abutaha came to the zone last month from his home in Qizan an Najjar, a southern suburb of Khan Younis.</p><p>“People are packed in meter by meter,” said Mr. Abutaha, adding that he and his family had “been forced to get used to it.”</p><p>Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> <!-- -->Julian E.
