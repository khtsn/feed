Israel’s defensive minister said today that “the next stage of the war against Hezbollah will soon commence.”</p><p>The raids focused on gathering intelligence about Hezbollah positions close to Israel’s northern border, as well as on identifying Hezbollah tunnels and military infrastructure, which officials expect Israel to try to destroy if a broader operation follows. Today, troops were seen gathering at the border.</p><p>Israel’s cabinet also met this evening to discuss whether and when to launch a major ground operation in southern Lebanon, which would be Israel’s first there in nearly two decades. American officials said that they believed that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html" title="">the invasion would be a limited one</a>.</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>U.S. officials have repeatedly warned about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-axis-china-iran-russia.html" title="">strengthening ties between Russia, China, North Korea and Iran</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The longshoremen’s union has not held a strike at all the East and Gulf Coast ports since 1977.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kristen Zeis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-76fd8889">Some of the busiest U.S. ports are set to shut down</h2><p>Dockworkers at every major port from Maine to Texas are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/business/port-strike-dockworkers.html" title="">likely to go on strike at midnight</a>, unless their union and employers make a last-minute deal to resolve a monthslong standoff over wages, benefits and automation.</p><p>The walkout, by members of the International Longshoremen’s Association, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/business/economy/port-strike-ila-dockworkers.html" title="">would cost the economy billions of dollars a day</a>. More than half of the nation’s container imports and exports flow through the East and Gulf Coast ports.</p><p>“Businesses have made preparations that should shield the economy from the blow of a short strike,” my colleague Peter Eavis, who reports on global logistics, told me. However, he added, if the ports are closed for longer than about two weeks, “the economic damage could become serious.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>If a strike goes on that long, Peter said, many experts expect President Biden, who has the authority to order striking dockworkers back to work, to step in. But administration officials have said he is not planning to intervene, and other unions have urged him not to.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The aftermath of Hurricane Helene on Saturday in Swannanoa, N.C.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Belleme for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>On the ground:</strong> Marshall, N.C., a town of about 800 people, was more or less wiped off the map.
