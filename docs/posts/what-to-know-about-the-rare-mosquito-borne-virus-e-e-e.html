It is not contagious from person to person.</p><p>There is no treatment for the disease, and about 30 percent of people who get it die, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/eastern-equine-encephalitis/about/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Many people who survive the illness have continuing neurological problems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-2d067fd8">How common is it?</h2><p>There are only a few cases of the disease each year in the United States, according to the C.D.C., and most of the cases are in eastern or Gulf Coast states.</p><p>The states that have reported cases this year said it was the first time that they had found the virus in residents in years.</p><p>The New Hampshire Department of Public Health <a href="https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/news-and-media/nh-dhhs-identifies-person-infected-eastern-equine-encephalitis-virus-new-hampshire" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Tuesday</a> that an adult in Hampstead who had tested positive for the virus had died. It was the first reported infection in the state since 2014, when the Health Department identified three human cases, including two deaths.</p><p><a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/media/current-news-releases/first-human-case-eastern-equine-encephalitis-vermont-detected-2012" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Earlier this month</a>, the Vermont Department of Health said that a man in his 40s from Chittenden County was the first person identified with the disease in the state since 2012, when two people contracted E.E.E. and died. The Chittenden County resident was hospitalized in July and left the hospital a week later.</p><p>The Massachusetts Department of Public Health <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-human-case-of-eastern-equine-encephalitis-in-massachusetts" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said this month</a> that a man in his 80s who was exposed in Worcester County was the first person identified with the disease in the state since 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There have been around 115 cases of the virus in Massachusetts since 1938, when the virus was first identified, according to <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/eee-eastern-equine-encephalitis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the state’s public health department</a>. There was an outbreak <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/us/eee-mosquito-virus.html" title="">in 2019</a> and 2020 that included 17 cases with seven fatalities.</p><h2 id="link-31d7959d">How to avoid it</h2><p>In areas at high risk of the virus, people can <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reduce their risk of getting bitten</a> by an infected mosquito by staying indoors between dusk and dawn. People who are outdoors should wear long pants and long-sleeve shirts and socks and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-bug-repellent/" title="">use repellent</a>.</p><p>At home, people should make sure their window screens do not have any holes and are attached tightly to doors and windows. They should also remove standing water from their property.</p><p>The virus is most often found in and around freshwater, hardwood swamps. “If you live in an area that has that kind of habitat, you should be more aware that there’s potential for it,” said <a href="https://sph.tulane.edu/trmd/dawn-wesson" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dawn Wesson</a>, an associate professor in the Department of Tropical Medicine at Tulane University in New Orleans.</p><p>The risk of the disease remains until the first hard frost, which kills mosquitoes.</p><h2 id="link-68fcc762">What are the symptoms?</h2><p>Most people who are bit by an infected mosquito and contract the virus do not become ill.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>People who do become ill usually show symptoms starting from four to 10 days after a bite, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/eastern-equine-encephalitis/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C.D.C. said</a>. They can experience fever, chills, body aches and joint pain.</p><p>The infection can also lead to neurological disease, which can include meningitis, and encephalitis, the inflammation of the brain. Symptoms of this type of an infection include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, behavioral changes, drowsiness and coma.</p><p>“Among the 4 to 5 percent that get infected and get the disease, only about a third of those people will get the most severe and awful version of the disease, which is the encephalitis,” said Stephen Rich, a microbiology professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p><h2 id="link-47b2f2fd">How have the affected areas responded?</h2><p>There are 10 municipalities in Massachusetts considered at <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-arbovirus-update#risk-maps-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high or critical risk</a> for E.E.E. A high-risk level means the conditions are likely to lead to a person in the area getting the virus, and a critical-risk level means a person in the area has been identified with it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Officials in Plymouth, Mass., have closed parks from dusk to dawn prevent people from being bit by mosquitoes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Steven Senne/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Dr. Rich, who is also the director of the New England Center of Excellence in Vector-Borne Diseases, said Massachusetts has an especially robust and rigorous surveillance system for finding mosquito-borne viruses. “The absence in any particular state doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not there,’’ he said. “It could be more of a reflection of less robust surveillance.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The town of Plymouth, which is about 40 miles south of Boston, <a href="https://www.plymouth-ma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6479/Plymouth-Park-and-Field-Closures---EEE-Press-Release?bidId=&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawE6szBleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHVdbvPtwReI5sAIQptyX4II3QxxsTlwcUL4b2CNg2LUNyOuujLWcyXVeWg_aem_4Hp7MNdLkRsko3uA93JRsQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Friday</a> that it was closing all parks and fields between the hours of dusk to dawn because of the threat of the disease.</p><p>Oxford, which is 11 miles south of Worcester, <a href="https://www.oxfordma.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=63" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told residents</a> to avoid being outdoors between dusk to dawn.
