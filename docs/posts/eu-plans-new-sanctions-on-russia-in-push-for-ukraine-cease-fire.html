Putin toward peace talks to end the war in Ukraine. The push comes as questions mount about how the United States will approach future sanctions.</p><p>After a call between President Trump and Mr. Putin on Monday, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-cease-fire.html" title="">White House</a> backed off its demand that Russia declare an immediate cease-fire. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-cease-fire.html" title="">said at a news conference</a> that it was unclear whether the United States would join with Europe in stepping up sanctions.</p><p>E.U. nations have imposed extensive sanctions on Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The ones they approved on Tuesday are the 17th set. These take aim at Russia’s so-called shadow fleet — old tanker ships that Moscow uses to covertly transport and sell its oil around the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Officials are already discussing an 18th package. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the E.U. executive arm, <a href="https://europa.eu/newsroom/ecpc-failover/pdf/statement-25-1238_en.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> last week that officials could go after gas pipelines, hit banks and push to further crimp Russia’s global energy sales.</p><p>“It takes two to want peace, and it takes only one to want war,” Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s top diplomat, <a href="https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-272397" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Tuesday. “In order to make Russia want peace, also, we need to put more pressure on Russia.”</p><p>But questions abound about how well sanctions are working — and whether E.U. pressure can force Mr. Putin to change policy.</p><p>Here’s what European Union sanctions on Russia look like, and what’s next.</p><h2 id="link-1a20191e">Sanctions already target individuals and companies.</h2><p>The measures approved on Tuesday <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1249" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">target 189 ships</a> in Russia’s shadow fleet, bringing the total of vessels listed to 342. They add to a wide-ranging set of measures that the European Union has patched together since 2022, hoping to squeeze the Russian economy harder with each package.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Overall, the E.U. sanctions <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions-against-russia/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">target more than 2,400 individuals</a> with restrictions including bank account freezes and travel bans. European officials have already <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-frozen-russian-assets-war-in-ukraine-belgium-euroclear/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frozen</a> more than 200 billion euros, or about $225 billion, of Russian central bank assets. Russia cannot import European luxury goods and is barred from exporting key products like steel and pig iron to the bloc.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ursula Von der Leyen, center, president of the E.U. executive arm, talking with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and President Emmanuel Macron of France at a summit in Albania last week. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ludovic Marin/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Sales of oil and gas — vital to Russia — have been sharply limited, too. The European Union <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/strategy/repowereu-roadmap_en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laid out</a> a plan this month to end Russian gas imports by 2027.</p><p>These efforts have been part of an international push. Major world powers, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/it/ip_22_7468" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including in Europe</a>, have agreed to prevent Russia from selling oil into global markets for more than $60 per barrel. The hope is to keep markets supplied with enough fuel to avert shortages and price spikes while curbing Russian revenues.</p><p>Now, Ms. von der Leyen has suggested the European Union could push to lower that price cap as part of the next set of sanctions.</p><h2 id="link-34e10d99">Yet there are big questions about efficacy.</h2><p>The sweeping sanctions imposed on Russia have inflicted pain — but only up to a point.</p><p>Russia’s economy contracted sharply in 2022, but <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp-growth-annual" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has rebounded</a>, and analysts expect growth continue slowly this year. One reason is <a href="https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/addicted-to-war-undermining-russias-economy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heavy military spending</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Another is that Russia has turned to new markets. Customs data suggests that its commerce with China has reached a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/china-russia-2024-trade-value-hits-record-high-chinese-customs-2025-01-13/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">record high</a>.</p><p>Russian companies have also evaded oil and gas sanctions by investing in the shadow fleet. <a href="https://kse.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Shadow_free_zones_October_2024_final.pdf?mc_cid=01f599cb35&amp;mc_eid=f8dc05b5e6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Estimates</a> by the Kyiv School of Economics late last year suggested that about 70 percent of Russia’s seaborne oil exports traveled on these vessels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Russian soldiers involved in the country’s military campaign in Ukraine were celebrated in a parade on Victory Day in Moscow this month. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maxim Shemetov/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But sanctions have had genuine, lasting consequences. Russia’s revenues from fossil fuel exports have <a href="https://energyandcleanair.org/april-2025-monthly-analysis-of-russian-fossil-fuel-exports-and-sanctions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dropped sharply</a>, trackers suggest. <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/russia/inflation-cpi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inflation</a> has risen amid product and labor shortages, prodding the central bank to push interest rates much higher.</p><p>“Russia’s dependence on military spending, low-tech exports and high inflation may lead to economic stagnation,” Alexander Kolyandr, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a think tank, <a href="https://cepa.org/author/alexander-kolyandr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in an analysis</a> this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“They can’t even cover it with the propaganda anymore,” Ms. Kallas said of the economic fallout. </p><p>The European Union is especially important for Russia: Before the war, it was a major trading partner, and it has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_trade_with_Russia_-_latest_developments" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pulled back sharply</a>. U.S. trade mattered less; only 0.4 percent of America’s exports in 2021 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/business/trump-russia-ukraine-invest.html#:~:text=Before%20its%20troops%20invaded%20Ukraine,the%20same%20amount%20as%20Honduras." title="">went to Russia</a>.</p><h2 id="link-39534233">The next set of sanctions could intensify the damage.</h2><p>The next European sanctions could future-proof efforts to cut off Russian gas supplies. The pipelines they would target, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, are not operational: One <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/world/europe/pipeline-leak-russia-nord-stream.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">was blown up</a> and the second never went into use. But blocking business with them could prevent investments and future contracts.</p><p>“The idea is to dissuade any interest, and notably interest from investors,” Paula Pinho, chief spokesperson for the European Commission, said <a href="https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-272300" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last week</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The gas leak at the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Danish Defense, via Agence France-Presse</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>That could scupper the idea that Europe might return to Russian energy as part of a peace deal.
