Kay Ivey of Alabama, also a Republican, has been in office since 2017 and is barred by term limits from running again. Given the conservative dominance in the state, it is likely that the governor’s mansion will remain in Republican control. It is unclear whether and when other Republicans may enter the race, or if any Democrat will mount a significant challenge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Tuberville’s decision to leave the Senate after a single term makes him the latest lawmaker hoping to trade Washington for a governorship. The governor’s mansion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/14/us/politics/senate-sasse-retirements-midterms.html" title="">can offer more power and opportunity</a>, compared with being one of many in an increasingly polarized and acrimonious Congress.</p><p>Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/michael-bennet-governor-colorado.html" title="">announced in April</a> that he would run for governor there; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/nyregion/new-jersey-democratic-candidates-for-governor.html" title="">two Democratic members of the House</a> are running for governor in New Jersey, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/us/politics/abigail-spanberger-virginia-governor.html" title="">one former member</a> in Virginia.</p><p>Another Republican senator, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, may soon follow Mr. Tuberville’s example. Though Ms. Blackburn has not yet announced a run to succeed Gov. Bill Lee, she has received <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/14/knox-county-mayor-glenn-jacobs-endorses-sen-marsha-blackburn-for-tennessee-governor/77703180007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notable pre-emptive endorsements</a> from some state Republicans.</p><p>Mr. Tuberville was a political newcomer when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/Election-primary-runoff-results.html" title="">defeated Jeff Sessions</a>, who had served as a United States senator and as President Trump’s first attorney general, in the Republican Senate primary in Alabama in 2020.</p><p>He was dogged by <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2020/03/florida-man-or-alabamas-next-senator-tubervilles-residency-roils-campaign.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">questions about his Alabama residency</a> because he owns property in the Florida Panhandle, while members of his family own the home that he listed as his Alabama residence. (Those questions recently <a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2025/04/24/tubervilles-travel-trail-points-to-home-in-florida-not-alabama/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">began to resurface</a> in anticipation of his run for governor, given that the residency requirements <a href="https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/candidates/qualifications-public-office" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are tougher for that position</a>.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ten days after he won his seat in the 2020 general election, Mr. Tuberville <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/us/tommy-tuberville-fact-check.html" title="">attracted national attention</a> for a series of erroneous claims he made in an interview, including misidentifying the branches of government.</p><p>He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html" title="">voted to overturn</a> the results of the 2020 election and opposed most government spending — a striking contrast early in his tenure with Alabama’s senior senator at the time, Richard C. Shelby, a champion of the earmarking process for federal spending. </p><p>Mr. Tuberville tangled with the Biden administration over a Pentagon policy that allowed abortion access for service members. He protested the policy by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/us/politics/tommy-tuberville-military-promotions.html" title="">blocking hundreds of military promotions over a period of 10 months</a>. Some people in Alabama believed that Mr. Tuberville’s action was one of the reasons the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/05/us/politics/huntsville-space-command-colorado-springs.html" title="">scrapped a plan to move</a> the U.S. Space Command headquarters to Huntsville, Ala.</p><p>He has continued to lean heavily on his sports résumé: his website bills his campaign as “Coach for Governor.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Jenner &amp; Block: </strong>A federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-jenner-block-law-firm.html">struck down an executive order</a> that threatened penalties against the law firm, which once employed a top attorney who helped investigate the president alongside the team run by Robert Mueller, who was then the special counsel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Restricting Covid Shots: </strong>The Food and Drug Administration announced that it was likely to limit access to Covid vaccines among healthy children and adults this fall. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/health/covid-vaccine-restrictions-eligibility.html">Here’s what experts expect if the plan goes forward</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Greenhouse Gas Limits on Power Plants: </strong>The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a plan to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/climate/epa-power-plant-rules.html">eliminate all limits</a> on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The Times.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Crypto Dinner:</strong> The Times reviewed a guest list and social media posts to identify who was invited to President Trump’s private event for customers of his cryptocurrency business and a White House tour. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-crypto-dinner-attendees.html">Here are some of them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build-Out of Nuclear Power Plants:</strong> President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/climate/trump-executive-order-nuclear-power.html">accelerating the construction of the plants</a>, including a new generation of small, advanced reactors that offer the promise of faster deployment but have yet to be proven.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ignoring Economic Warning Signs: </strong>The president’s economic policy approach is so far <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/politics/trump-taxes-tariffs-economy.html">rattling markets, businesses and consumers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>MAHA Report: </strong>The G.O.P. chairmen of the House and Senate agriculture committees said they were “troubled” by the Make America Healthy Again Commission’s findings and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/republican-agriculture-pesticides-kennedy-maha-report.html">urged it to use sounder science</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Rare Check on Trump’s Actions: </strong>President Trump has suffered a string of court losses, as federal judges ruled that his administration broke the law on a number of matters. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-administration-courts-judges-law.html">But judicial orders to unwind his actions can be easier said than done</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Report on the Trump Administration</strong></p><p>Hundreds of readers asked about our coverage of the president.
