Only 30 percent of respondents said Mr. Adams should serve out the rest of his term.</p><p>A majority of Black New Yorkers, who have traditionally made up Mr. Adams’s political base and whose support helped propel him to office, also said he should resign. Though the Black residents surveyed were somewhat more supportive of Mr. Adams than the respondents at large, 59 percent wanted him to step down, while 39 percent wanted him to serve out his term.</p><p>The poll also found broad dissatisfaction with the tenure of Mr. Adams, a Democrat. Only 26 percent of New Yorkers surveyed approved of his job performance as mayor, down from 37 percent last November. And nearly half — 47 percent — of respondents said they strongly disapproved of his performance, while just 11 percent said they strongly approved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Adams pleaded not guilty last week to five criminal charges, including bribery and fraud. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html" title="">indictment against him</a> accused him of accepting free or discounted travel and illegal campaign contributions from the Turkish government in exchange for political favors.</p><p>The mayor has resisted growing calls for his resignation from state and local leaders. A number of top city officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/nyregion/nyc-resignations-banks-caban-adams.html" title="">have stepped down</a> in the past month as the investigations surrounding Mr. Adams’s administration have continued to swirl.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>She added: “We must give New Yorkers confidence that there is steady, responsible leadership at every level of government.”</p><p>Since then, Mr. Adams has embarked on a campaign to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/nyregion/eric-adams-black-voters.html" title="">shore up support</a>, speaking at churches across the city and seeking to surround himself with the types of voters who elected him in 2021.</p><p>In public appearances since his arraignment, Mr. Adams has largely avoided talking about the charges he faces. But according to Friday’s poll, nearly three-quarters of New Yorkers have heard either a “great deal” or a “good amount” about the indictment. Only 28 percent said they had heard little or nothing about the charges.</p><p>Most New York residents, 65 percent, said they thought Mr. Adams had done something illegal. Just 8 percent said they thought he had done nothing wrong.</p><p>Mr. Adams’s first term is set to last through the end of next year, and Democrats had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor-democratic-primary.html" title="">lining up to challenge him</a> even before he was indicted. Eighty-one percent of New Yorkers, including 80 percent of Democrats, said they thought Mr. Adams should not run for re-election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The poll also asked respondents whether they thought former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo should run for mayor, as he is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-nyc-mayor.html" title="">reportedly considering</a> doing. Most, 55 percent, said they did not want him to. Mr. Cuomo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-resigns.html" title="">resigned from office in 2021</a> after the New York attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed nearly a dozen women.</p><p>The Marist poll surveyed 1,073 adult New York residents between Sept. 30 and Oct. 1.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
