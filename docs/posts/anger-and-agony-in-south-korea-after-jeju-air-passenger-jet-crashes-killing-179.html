Wails and screams filled the Muan airport on Sunday afternoon. A young woman comforted an older woman weeping about her son. Two crying women embraced each other.</p><p>By Sunday evening, only 65 of the dead could be identified through their fingerprints and other means, officials said. A dozen bodies were so badly damaged that officials could not immediately identify their gender. Those who were identified included a 23-year-old flight attendant and a 78-year-old male passenger.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/29/multimedia/29skorea-crash-ledeall2/29skorea-crash-ledeall2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/29/multimedia/29skorea-crash-ledeall2/29skorea-crash-ledeall2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/29/multimedia/29skorea-crash-ledeall2/29skorea-crash-ledeall2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Three people huddle together on the floor, their faces largely hidden." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/29/multimedia/29skorea-crash-ledeall2/29skorea-crash-airport-scene-kwbg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/29/multimedia/29skorea-crash-ledeall2/29skorea-crash-airport-scene-kwbg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/29/multimedia/29skorea-crash-ledeall2/29skorea-crash-airport-scene-kwbg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/29/multimedia/29skorea-crash-ledeall2/29skorea-crash-airport-scene-kwbg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/767131bb-699d-502f-a96f-feef91b94e9d" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Family members waiting for news at Muan International Airport in South Korea.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

He said five of his relatives had been on the plane returning from a vacation: his wife’s sister, her daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We’re thunderstruck,” he said.</p><p>In a closed area of the airport, officials were working to identify the bodies they recovered from the crash site. When officials posted on the walls of the arrivals hall the names of those confirmed dead, people rushed to check the lists.</p><p>The disaster left South Korea in shock at a time when the country was grappling with a political crisis unleashed by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s ill-fated and short-lived declaration of martial law and his subsequent impeachment this month. Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, an unelected official, rushed to the scene to deal with his biggest challenge since he took office as acting president on Friday.</p><p>The plane crash was especially shocking for the country because it has had no major aviation disaster on this scale after a spate of deadly air accidents in the 1990s and earlier. In the last major aviation accident involving a South Korean airline, a Korean Air jet slammed into a hill in Guam, a U.S. territory in the western Pacific, in 1997, killing 229 of the 254 people on board. In 2013, three people died and scores were injured after an Asiana Airlines flight clipped a sea wall and caught fire on approach to San Francisco. </p><p>It also appeared to have been the first fatal one for Jeju Air, which was established in 2005 and flies to dozens of countries in Asia. Kim E-bae, the chief executive of Jeju Air, bowed as he publicly apologized for the crash. He said that the exact cause of the crash was unclear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Emergency responders were still at the scene 10 hours after the plane crashed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

All passengers were South Koreans, except for two Thai nationals. The jet was landing at Muan, in southwestern South Korea, when it ran into trouble.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Footage of the accident showed a white-and-orange plane speeding down a runway on its belly until it rammed into a barrier at the end of the runway, exploding into a fireball. Local news media cited witnesses describing the sound of the explosion and published photographs of large plumes of black smoke over the site.</p><p>The plane had broken into so many pieces that only its tail was immediately identifiable, said Lee Jeong-hyeon, an official in charge of search and rescue operations at the scene. The two crew members who survived had been rescued from the tail section.</p><p>“We could not recognize the rest of the fuselage,” Mr. Lee said.</p><p>As the death toll climbed, details of what happened in the final moments before the crash began to emerge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An official disclosing some of the names of passengers who died in the crash, at Muan International Airport.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Soo-Hyeon Kim/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>As the plane was preparing to land, the airport warned the pilots about a potential bird strike, said Ju Jong-wan, a director of aviation policy at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. Around this time, witnesses heard loud explosion-like sounds, MBC-TV reported. The channel broadcast footage showing flames trailing briefly from one of the plane’s engines.</p><p>The plane issued a mayday alert shortly after the warning from the airport, then crash-landed, Mr. Ju said. The pilot aborted his first attempt at landing and with permission from the control tower, was landing from the opposite direction when the disaster happened, officials said. Planes were allowed to land from both directions at the airport, they said.</p><p>The muddy tidal flats near Muan and much of the west coast of the Korean Peninsula are favorite resting places for migrant birds. Photographs in local media showed flocks of birds flying near the airport on Sunday. </p><p>Evidence suggested that the aircraft encountered a flock of birds during its approach, leading to suspected bird ingestion into the engines, said Marco Chan, a senior lecturer in aviation operations at the U.K.-based Buckinghamshire New University.</p><p>The damage may have caused a hydraulic system failure, which could explain the inability to deploy the landing gear, Mr. Chan said in an analysis emailed by his university.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The plane also did not appear to have activated its wing flaps, said Keith Tonkin, the managing director of Aviation Projects, an aviation consulting company in Brisbane, Australia, who reviewed video of the crash. That meant it was traveling faster than normal landing speed when it belly flopped on the runway, he said.</p><p>Aviation experts said investigations into the causes of crashes can take years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Temporary housing being set up for the families at Muan International Airport.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

Others grew angry and raised their voices in frustration: “Speak up!” “Print out the names!” Several hours after the crash, people expressed frustration that they had to wait so long for news about their relatives. “Let us have the list so we can at least find a hospital!” one woman shouted.</p><p>People crowded around an official to check if their relatives were on a list of those confirmed dead. Some relatives had given DNA samples to officials at the airport to help identify the bodies.</p><p>In the departures hall, temporary tents were set up on Sunday evening for families of the plane’s passengers and crew. Outside the airport, cars lined up to enter the packed parking lots. Some parked on the shoulders of the roads leading to the terminal, and people continued to stream into the airport through the evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Six hours after they dashed to the airport, Mr. Jang and his wife were still waiting for their relatives to be identified.</p><p>“I’m expecting it to be a long night,” he said.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Yan Zhuang<!-- -->, <!-- -->River Akira Davis<!-- -->, <!-- -->Niraj Chokshi<!-- --> and <!-- -->Sui-Lee Wee<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Choe Sang-Hun is the lead reporter for The Times in Seoul, covering South and North Korea.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/choe-sang-hun">More about Choe Sang-Hun</a></span></p></div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Anger And Agony Over Fiery Crash Of Korean Plane<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/boeing-company">Boeing Company</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
