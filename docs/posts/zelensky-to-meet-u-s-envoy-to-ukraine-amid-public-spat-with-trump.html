There was also hope that it might help defuse tensions between Washington and Kyiv after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-trump-russia-war.html" title="">Mr. Trump labeled Mr. Zelensky a “dictator”</a> and the Ukrainian president accused him of echoing Russian propaganda.</p><p>Whether any progress was made remains unclear: a news conference scheduled for after the meeting was canceled at the request of the United States, according to Mr. Zelensky’s office, although Mr. Kellogg and the Ukrainian leader appeared together for photos.</p><p>Reporters who had gathered for the news conference were told to go home. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv did not immediately comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ukraine, wary of straining ties with Washington, its biggest ally, had suggested that the meeting would aim to stop the feud from escalating into an out-of-control dispute. “It is crucial for us that the meeting and our overall cooperation with America be constructive,” Mr. Zelensky said in his <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rozrahovuyu-na-ukrayinsku-yednist-na-ukrayinsku-horobrist-na-96205" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nightly address</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>But there have been concerns in Ukraine that Mr. Kellogg, a retired U.S. general and longtime adviser to Mr. Trump on security matters, has been sidelined from the administration’s negotiating team, since he was not part of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html" title="">U.S. delegation that met with Russian officials</a> this week to initiate what the White House said were peace talks.</p><p>Mr. Kellogg has said that the United States is <a href="https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/1048871.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conducting separate discussions</a> on a potential peace deal with Russia and with Ukraine and that he is leading the U.S.-Ukraine track while Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, is in charge of the U.S.-Russia track. The two envoys will then return to Washington to compare notes and determine the next steps, according to Mr. Kellogg.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, Steve Witkoff, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser.

Speaking from the city’s railway station upon arrival, Mr. Kellogg said that his mission would be to “sit and listen” to Ukraine’s concerns. He also said that he understood Ukraine’s “need for security guarantees” in any postwar settlement.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Later that day, he met with a series of top Ukrainian officials, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-oleksandr-syrsky.html" title="">Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky</a>, the head of the Ukrainian army; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/russia-ukraine-kharkiv.html" title="">Gen. Kyrylo Budanov</a>, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency; and Andriy Yermak, the head of Mr. Zelensky’s office.</p><p>Beyond discussing a possible path to a peace deal with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Kellogg had been expected to address a potential agreement that would grant the United States access to Ukrainian natural resources as compensation for past aid and, possibly, as a guarantee for future assistance. Mr. Trump has insisted that he wants payback for the money that Washington has invested in Ukraine’s defense.</p><p>Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury secretary, presented Mr. Zelensky with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/scott-bessent-us-ukraine.html" title="">a draft of the agreement</a> last week. But Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/world/europe/ukraine-minerals-us-deal-rejected.html" title="">rejected the proposal</a> — an extraordinary demand to grant the United States a 50 percent interest in Ukraine’s natural resources like minerals, oil and gas — because it did not tie resource access to security guarantees for Kyiv.</p><p>Mr. Trump has demanded $500 billion of Ukrainian critical minerals, a request that Mr. Zelensky dismissed as “not serious” during a news conference on Wednesday. But Mr. Zelensky said that Ukraine was still open to striking a deal to trade some of its resources for security guarantees.</p><p>Mr. Trump expressed frustration with Mr. Zelensky’s refusal to sign the deal, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-doge-musk-02-19-25#cm7ctw02v00113b6nc1hmmlc8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">telling reporters on Air Force One</a> on Wednesday night that Mr. Bessent had been “treated rather rudely.” Mr. Trump insisted that he would resurrect the deal with Ukraine’s leader, “or things are going to not make him too happy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In some ways, Mr. Kellogg could be an ally to Kyiv. He has adopted a more aggressive stance toward Russia than Mr. Trump and some of his advisers, proposing that Washington could increase sanctions to push Russia toward a peace deal and favorably viewing the Biden administration’s approval for Ukraine to strike inside Russia with long-range missiles.</p><p>Mr. Kellogg’s three-day visit to Ukraine is unusually long for an American official. Since the war began nearly three years ago, U.S. officials have typically limited their trips to a single day for security reasons.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said on Wednesday that he hoped Mr. Kellogg could talk to civilians and service members to grasp the reality of the war, including through a possible visit to the front line.</p><p>“It’s important to feel the atmosphere on the ground,” Mr. Zelensky said.</p><p>On Mr. Kellogg’s first night in Ukraine, air defense systems worked to repel a large Russian assault on energy infrastructure. The booms of antiaircraft missiles echoed across central Kyiv as the air alert blared for more than seven hours.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
