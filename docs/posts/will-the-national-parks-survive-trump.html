That same year, the most recent for which figures are available, the 325 million visitors to national parks, monuments and historic sites spent an estimated $26.4 billion in surrounding communities. Visits to the parks swelled last year to a <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/socialscience/visitor-use-statistics-dashboard.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">record of nearly 332 million</a>.</p><p>These figures should come as no surprise. Americans love their national parks and visit them avidly. Last year, the National Park Service received the highest rating of all federal agencies in a survey by the independent Pew Research Center, with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/12/americans-see-many-federal-agencies-favorably-but-republicans-grow-more-critical-of-justice-department/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">76 percent</a> of respondents viewing the agency favorably.</p><p>Clearly, America’s national parks have been a golden goose. The question now is whether President Trump will gut them in his effort to slash federal spending. Even before he took office, the Park Service was running lean, on a slim operating budget of about $3 billion. But since January, an estimated 13 percent of its staff has departed through pressured buyouts, early retirements and deferred resignations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>And the outlook for the national parks next year is especially grim. Mr. Trump has proposed hacking the Park Service’s operating budget by roughly 30 percent, which would be catastrophic, and transferring less visited national parks and other Park Service locations to states and tribal governments. Theresa Pierno, the president of the National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy group, has <a href="https://www.npca.org/articles/8495-president-trump-s-proposed-budget-could-decimate-at-least-350-national-park" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> that the system “would be completely decimated” should such cuts be imposed.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Leaving Grand Teton in May. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Will Warasila for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The group <a href="https://www.npca.org/articles/8495-president-trump-s-proposed-budget-could-decimate-at-least-350-national-park" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated</a> that reducing the operating budget by $900 million, as the Trump administration wants to do, would require closing 350 of the 433 parks, monuments, historic sites and other locations overseen by the Park Service.</p><p>Should anything even remotely like that come to pass, we would be witnessing the dismantling of a century-old system that has protected majestic scenery and places of ecological or historical importance from development. It has been a model of stewardship of landscapes that belong to all Americans, and it has been emulated around the world.</p><p>By April, the effects of reduced staffing reportedly had been felt. Arches National Park in Utah had terminated some of its <a href="https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/arches-temporarily-halts-fiery-furnace-permits-and-tours-due-to-employee-shortages/#:~:text=Arches%20temporarily%20halts%20Fiery%20Furnace%20permits%20and%20tours%20due%20to%20employee%20shortages.&amp;text=The%20park%20posted%20a%20notice%20March%2023,in%20place%20to%20support%20normal%20spring%20operations." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ranger-led tours</a>. Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument in Colorado had <a href="https://gazette.com/news/florissant-fossil-beds-national-monument-closes-2-days-a-week-amid-layoffs/article_350a3ffe-f09b-11ef-a84d-5b8877b4f46c.html#:~:text=The%20visitors&#39;%20center%20at%20the%20Florissant%20Fossil%20Beds%20National%20Monument.,-The%20Gazette%20file&amp;text=As%20federal%20layoffs%20impact%20the,11%2C000%20comments%20and%2012%2C000%20shares." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed on Mondays and Tuesdays</a> for lack of staff. Pinnacles National Park in California had canceled its summer ranger programs. Great Smoky Mountains National Park <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2025/03/21/great-smoky-mountains-national-park-makes-changes-amid-federal-cuts/82514066007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had closed</a> several campground and picnic areas. And <a href="https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2025/04/update-interior-secretary-orders-national-parks-be-open-and-accessible" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the list went on</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Inspiration Point.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Will Warasila for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Trump administration, perhaps sensitive to blowback from the millions of visitors who will descend on the parks this summer, has given the Park Service permission to <a href="https://rollcall.com/2025/03/11/workforce-cuts-raise-concerns-over-national-park-upkeep/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hire</a> up to 7,700 seasonal employees. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who oversees the Park Service, has also ordered the agency to ensure that its parks and other sites “provide the best customer service experience for all visitors.” Earlier in the year, he had <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/burgum-promises-to-hire-5000-temporary-park-workers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fired about 1,000</a> probationary park employees as part of the administration’s effort to shrink government to, as he described it, the “right size,” only to be <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21032025/todays-climate-fired-national-parks-workers-reinstated/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordered</a> by a federal judge to reinstate them.</p><p>This patchwork fix may mean that visitors won’t be especially shortchanged this summer, at least in the most visited parks — stuck in long lines to enter, frustrated at understaffed visitor centers and missing out on nature tours and talks offered by park rangers. What visitors will face <em>next</em> summer will depend on the extent to which Mr. Trump eviscerates the Park Service budget.</p><p>There is more at stake, however, than whether tourists have seamless visits. As 18 former top Park Service officials pointed out to Mr. Burgum <a href="https://protectnps.org/2025/05/07/former-nps-directors-and-leaders-to-burgum-ensure-the-protection-of-our-national-parks/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a recent letter</a>, the 1916 law that created the agency prioritizes the protection of the parks’ natural resources over the services it offers to visitors. Those former officials expressed concern that park managers are essentially being forced “to ignore their park resource protection responsibilities in favor of providing for visitor services.”</p><p>Their concerns aren’t exaggerated. Numerous scientific studies of wildlife in the national parks already have been terminated or put in jeopardy — from controlling invasive species like rats to assessing the status of native plants and animals, restoring damaged habitats, and measuring how climate change is affecting ecological diversity. With the departure of many of the researchers who conduct these studies, the Park Service’s institutional memory will be eroded and may be difficult if not impossible to restore.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Swallows flying over Jackson Lake.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Will Warasila for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Yet when I reached out to the superintendents of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, their nonprofit partners, Yellowstone Forever and the Grand Teton National Park Foundation, as well as two local wildlife biologists, to ask their thoughts on the president’s cuts and proposed cuts, they either declined to speak to me for publication or did not return my calls.</p><p>Against this backdrop, it’s instructive to compare Mr. Trump’s plans for the parks to those of another extremely wealthy New Yorker: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/people/john-d-rockefeller-jr.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John D. Rockefeller Jr.</a> A financier and philanthropist, Rockefeller purchased and donated land that helped to create or expand Great Smoky Mountains, Acadia, Shenandoah and Grand Teton National Parks. He provided <a href="https://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/yosemite_nature_notes/9/9-7.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than $1.6 million</a> in 1930 — roughly $30 million today — to save 15,000 acres of sugar pines adjacent to Yosemite that were going to be logged, and he financed the construction of museums in Mesa Verde, Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Parks. His heart was devoted to the commonweal, and he used his money to enhance it.</p><p>Mr. Trump, on the other hand, seems bent on eroding one of the country’s greatest achievements, a national park system open to all. As the Western writer Wallace Stegner once put it, the national parks are “absolutely American” and “the best idea we ever had. “</p><p>Will the millions of Americans who cherish their parks allow Mr. Trump to destroy them?</p></div></div></section></article></div>
