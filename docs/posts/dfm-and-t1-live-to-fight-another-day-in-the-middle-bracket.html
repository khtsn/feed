</span> in two maps to survive in the middle bracket.</p>



<p>Both DFM and Global had strong starts to their respective Kickoff campaigns, opening with wins in the first round but falling to the region&#39;s top-seeded teams. In a series that Global looked to wrap up quickly, DFM pulled off the reverse sweep, winning 2-1 despite a big fragging day from Global.</p>

<p>The series began on Global&#39;s pick of Breeze, a map that DFM had not played since 2024. The Global players stayed on agents they have been playing primarily through Kickoff so far, with <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/872/autumn">

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7754/xavi8k">
		xavi8k	</a>
</span> on Astra as part of a double-orb smokes comp with Omen and Sova rounding out the comp. Meanwhile, DFM played with what could be regarded as a more meta comp, with <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/6672/meiy">
		Meiy	</a>
</span> on Jett while the rest of the squad was rounded out by Astra, Viper, Yoru, and Sova.</p>

<p>Starting on attack, DFM immediately had troubles, unable to fend off the Global retakes but, more importantly, unable to stop <span data-ref-id="8">

</span> Initiator found it easy on the map in his new role, juggling the Controller and secondary Duelist roles for Global. He played a pivotal role in his team entering halftime up 10-2, collecting 25 kills through the first 12 rounds of the map.</p>

<p><em>PatMen was unstoppable on Breeze.</em></p>

<p>DFM continued with the same level of dominance on attack, cruising to a 13-3 win. PatMen set VCT history on the map, finishing with an unreal 32/5 scoreline and a 516 ACS, the highest on a map in VCT history.</p>

<p>Though down in dominant fashion, DFM was not quite out. Its pick of Pearl welcomed upsets, as it did last week against <span data-ref-id="10">

</span> and last year against PRX. DFM got out to a fast start to roll some momentum early, seizing a 6-3 lead on attack. Meiy put on a vintage performance on, dropping 12 kills in the half while <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/29841/caedye">
		Caedye	</a>
</span> had 10 of his own. On the other side of the stage, Global fielded the same comp that it ran on Bind last week, with PatMen on Waylay to form a double-Duelist comp while <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/5796/kr1stal">
		Kr1stal	</a>
</span> was on Fade.</p>

<p>DFM held on to a narrow 7-5 lead entering halftime, and a pistol round win to start its defender side got the ball rolling. DFM used strong defensive principles help reach match point. Fueled by <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/29843/yatsuka">
		yatsuka	</a>
</span>&#39;s Operator and <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13002/akame">
		Akame	</a>
</span>&#39;s Odin, the squad held rock-solid crossfires and pulled off well-coordinated retakes to reach match point up 12-6. While a stretch of three straight Global rounds threatened a comeback, DFM closed out the map </p>

<iframe type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Eu_u_6p4fiQ?si=_v8lnqT9YE26973g&amp;clip=Ugkxp8ed7fYKbQP8kKEy7zTVxBmNu8XL1k1Z&amp;clipt=EJefsQQY3um0BA&amp;showinfo=0&amp;origin=https://www.vlr.gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p><em>Clean three kills from Caedye in mid doors helps DFM shut down the Global comeback.</em></p>

<p>They say all bangers end on Split, and this series looked to live up to that. DFM and Global fielded comps that were similar in principle, with DFM opting for the traditional Viper-Omen pairing with Yoru, Raze, and Fade. Meanwhile, Global added its own twist to that comp, with Astra replacing Omen, Autumn as the solo Duelist on Yoru, and UdoTan&#39;s Vyse instead of Raze.</p>

<p>On defense, DFM did well to shut down portions of the map, but faltered when Global was able to layer several pieces of utility to rush players anchoring. Once on attack, DFM flipped a pistol round win into a strong run in the half. While Global drew blood first on many occasions, it was caught in a few moments of questionable decision-making, resulting in several man-advantage situations going to waste. DFM seized those opportunities, five of them in fact, to reach match point up 12-5. Once again, a late surge from GE threatened a comeback of sorts, but DFM closed it out 13-8 to stay alive in the middle bracket.</p>

<p>PatMen&#39;s series-high 62-kill performance was not enough for Global, nor was Autumn&#39;s 52 kills. As a team, Global had 21 more kills than DFM did across three maps. Meiy led the way for DFM with his own 52 kills, while Caedye had 42.</p>



<p>In another match against a team it is very familiar with, T1 downed DRX 2-0. In DRX, two T1 players went up against their former colors, with <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/485/stax">
		stax	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span> having played for them before. Before this match, both teams survived their first matches in the lower round, with DRX defeating VARREL and T1 beating Gen.G.</p>

<p>The series opened on DRX&#39;s pick of Split, which it has now played in all three of its Kickoff matches. After trying out a Neon-Yoru double-Duelist comp in its opening match, DRX appeared to have settled on a double-Initiator comp with Skye and Tejo. Meanwhile, T1 stuck with its Raze-Yoru double-Duelist comp.</p>

<p>The map hosted a battle between <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/28400/hyunmin">
		HYUNMIN	</a>
</span> and BuZz, the two Duelist players who both played Raze on the map. T1 got off to a quick start, winning four of the first five rounds, forcing an early timeout from <span data-ref-id="18">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/775/termi">
		termi	</a>
</span>. Following the timeout, DRX did well to delay T1&#39;s attack, and entered halftime down just 7-5. </p>

<iframe type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Eu_u_6p4fiQ?si=RT9AVNpiUCR2MZra&amp;clip=UgkxBNtod5kbPqML_DKiC9_572X9RzIaQhfE&amp;clipt=EIXG2AcYh73ZB&amp;showinfo=0&amp;origin=https://www.vlr.gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p><em>T1 enters round 10 with five Sheriffs and walks away with the win.</em></p>

<p>After switching sides, DRX fell victim to the clock on a number of occasions, too. While <span data-ref-id="19">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/29833/izu">
		iZu	</a>
</span>&#39;s Operator managed just three kills on the map, it had a stronger impact, shutting down long sightlines and often serving as the primary barrier to DRX&#39;s attacks.</p>

<p>After struggling to get going in T1&#39;s win over Gen.G, BuZz got off to a quick start, leading T1 a 13-8 win on Split with a team-high 25 kills, while HYUNMIN&#39;s 25 were ultimately not enough.</p>

<p>After stealing DRX&#39;s map pick, T1 entered its own pick of Bind. Again, both teams had near-mirror comps, with Brimstone, Viper, Fade, and Yoru the meta staples. DRX went with HYUNMIN on Raze, while T1 put BuZz on Waylay. DRX grabbed the pistol round to start the map, but an unsuccessful conversion on the would-be bonus round snowballed into a strong T1 run, resulting in the team picking up eight of the next nine rounds. </p>

<p>DRX had little to no answer for T1&#39;s defense, struggling to break it down and trudging along into an 8-4 halftime deficit. DRX picked up yet another pistol round to win its third through two maps and winning two more after failing to convert the would-be bonus round. While DRX put an Operator into <span data-ref-id="20">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/17049/hermes">
		Hermes	</a>
</span>&#39;s hands early, he struggled to have the same impact that iZu had on it.</p>

<iframe type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Eu_u_6p4fiQ?si=1grR0ZByoEO2U4sj&amp;clip=UgkxD2aFZbxzIX9_gnRfMeQutLqJHtr4uBEL&amp;clipt=EOTT8AkYxKj0CQ&amp;showinfo=0&amp;origin=https://www.vlr.gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p><em>BuZz was the tip of the spear for T1 on both maps, with his Waylay on Bind especially spectacular.</em></p>

<p>BuZz led the way for T1&#39;s attack in a dominant way, with a quadra kill helping T1 cruise its way into the sunset and snap up a 13-8 map win and 2-0 series win. The win over DRX is T1&#39;s first in Pacific play and second ever after defeating them in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025/swiss-stage" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> Swiss Stage last year. He had a game-high 44 kills and 1.49 rating, while his Duelist counterpart HYUNMIN had 40 and 1.15 in the loss.</p>
