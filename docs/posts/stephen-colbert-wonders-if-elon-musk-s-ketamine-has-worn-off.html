That’s your job! This isn’t book club — you can’t just read the first seven pages and then be like, ‘I love it. Linda, more rosé.’” <em>— MICHAEL KOSTA, on Marjorie Taylor Greene’s admitting she hadn’t read Trump’s bill in full</em></p><p>“Does anyone in Congress read anything before they vote on it? Are we being governed via Apple user agreement?” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“<em>[imitating Apple user]</em> Yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, yeah, click ‘I agree.’ I just want to download ‘Baby Shark,’ come on. Hold on, wait a second, did I just defund Medicare? Whatever. <em>[sings]</em> Baby shark, do do.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“<em>[imitating Representative Mike Flood]</em> Hey, hey, hey, why are you guys booing me?

It’s not like a 23andMe terms-of-service agreement, where you can just blindly sign it, and now there’s a clone of you who’s a sex slave for an Uzbek oligarch.
