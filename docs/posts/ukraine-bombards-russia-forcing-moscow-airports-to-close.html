At least two people were killed and 14 others were injured, the Russian authorities said.</p><p>The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed to have shot down at least 91 drones in the region around Moscow and more than 240 drones directed at other targets across the country. The Ukrainian military did not have any immediate comment on the strikes.</p><p>In Moscow, at least one residential building was damaged, with its roof charred, after a drone explosion. All four international airports, serving a metropolitan area of 21 million, were forced to suspend operations temporarily because of the attack, the country’s aviation watchdog said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The predawn strikes — just hours before high-level delegations from Kyiv and the United States were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-us-saudi-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">scheduled to meet in Saudi Arabia</a> to discuss a possible path toward ending the war — appeared intended to serve as a reminder that despite suffering attacks and enduring huge losses, Ukraine continues to expand its capacity to hit back at Russia.</p><p>Ukraine has proposed an immediate truce in the air, saying it would immediately stop long-range strikes into Russia if Moscow agreed to an equivalent halt.</p><p>That plan, supported by European nations, including France, is envisioned as a first step in building trust ahead of talks about the overall conflict, in which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/03/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-drones-deaths.html" title="">over a million Ukrainian and Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded</a>.</p><p>Ukrainian officials are expected to raise it again when they meet with U.S. officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In addition to a partial truce in the air, Ukraine was also expected to press the case for a halt to strikes on the Black Sea to gauge whether Moscow was willing to take any steps to end the fighting.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine plans to produce 30,000 long-range strike drones and 3,000 long-range missiles this year, building its domestic arms-making abilities even as U.S. military assistance remains suspended.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Russia has maintained its relentless bombardment of Ukrainian civilian and military institutions over the course of the war. Nearly every night in recent weeks, Russia has launched over 100 drones at targets across Ukraine, including at Kyiv, the capital.</p><p>The assaults — which frequently include a combination of ballistic and cruise missiles in an effort to saturate Ukrainian air defenses — persisted overnight Monday and into Tuesday.</p><p>The Ukrainian Air Force said that the latest attack from Russia included 126 drones and one ballistic missile.</p><p>Explosions echoed across Kyiv around midnight as air defense teams scrambled, and the Ukrainian Air Force said it shot down or disabled most of the drones as well as the missile.</p><p>At least one person was killed when a Russian drone struck a warehouse in Kharkiv and at least 17 others were injured in other attacks across the country, the Ukrainian authorities said. Drones hit the port city of Odesa in southern Ukraine, with the local authorities reporting fires in multiple locations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Since President Trump spoke by telephone with President Vladimir V. Putin on Feb. 12 — the first official contact between the heads of state for the United States and Russia in years — more than 100 civilians have been killed in Russian strikes, according to data compiled by The New York Times based on reports from the Ukrainian authorities.</p><p>The intensifying strikes have been accompanied by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/europe/ukraine-russia-eastern-front-line.html" title="">shifting dynamics on the front lines</a>, with Russian forces, assisted by thousands of North Korean soldiers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/europe/ukraine-russia-north-korea-kursk.html" title="">retaking a large part of the territory in Russia’s Kursk region</a> that had been occupied by Ukrainian forces.</p><p>Kyiv had hoped to use its control of that portion of land as leverage in any negotiations to end the war, but the recent developments may have changed that calculus, because the cost of holding the territory could outweigh any diplomatic gain.</p><p>With the Ukrainian salient in Kursk now collapsed to an area around Sudzha, about six miles across the border, and its supply lines under constant attack, their hold on the area is increasingly precarious.</p><p>The top Ukrainian military commander, Oleksandr Syrsky, said on Monday night that Kyiv was dispatching reinforcements. He rejected Russian claims that a large contingent of Ukrainian soldiers were at risk of encirclement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“A decision was made to reinforce our group with the necessary forces and resources, including electronic warfare and drones,” he said. “Currently, there is no threat of encirclement of our units in the Kursk region.”</p><p>At the same time, there are signs that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/europe/ukraine-russia-eastern-front-line.html" title="">the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine has stalled</a>. Russian forces have not advanced in over a week and Ukrainian forces have engaged in limited counterattacks to regain small patches of land, according to Ukrainian soldiers and military analysts who use combat footage to track the daily movements along the front.</p><p>In Moscow, railway tracks near the Domodedovo airport south of Moscow were damaged. At least 20 cars were burned at a parking lot in the nearby town of Domodedovo, according to Andrei Vorobyev, the region’s governor, who issued <a href="https://t.me/vorobiev_live/8475" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a>. A 38-year-old security guard died on site because of the attack, Mr. Vorobyev said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia. He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.
