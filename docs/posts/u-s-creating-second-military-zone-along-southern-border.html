    <h1>U.S. Creating Second Military Zone Along Southern Border</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A small group of migrants was charged on Monday with crossing into the military zone in New Mexico after an Army helicopter spotted them approaching the border and alerted the Border Patrol.</p><p>“The establishment of a second national defense area increases our operational reach and effectiveness in denying illegal activity along the southern border,” Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the head of Northern Command, said in a statement.</p><p>General Guillot said that “service members who are already detecting and monitoring through stationary positions and mobile patrols nearby can now temporarily detain trespassers until they are transferred to an appropriate law enforcement entity.”</p><p>The new Pentagon directives expand a military presence that has increased steadily along the southern border in recent months, even as crossings have already dropped precipitously during the Trump administration.</p><p>The Pentagon has sent nearly 8,000 active-duty troops to the border, as well as spy planes in the skies and Navy warships offshore, to comply with President Trump’s order in January to increase the military’s role in stemming the flow of migrants into the United States.</p></div></div>
