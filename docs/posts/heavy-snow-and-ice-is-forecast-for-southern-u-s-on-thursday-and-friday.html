The heavier snow is likely to remain in northern Texas and into Oklahoma. The most <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=likely" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">likely</a> snowfall totals in Texas will be between two and four inches, mainly along and north of I-20, in an area that averages less than two inches per season.</p><p>Anticipating the potential effects, Dallas schools will be closed on Thursday and Friday. Gov. Greg Abbott used a news conference on Wednesday to warn drivers: “Be careful. Be cautious.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We’re not used to driving on ice and snow,” he said to his fellow Texans. “We’re not used to driving in conditions like this.”</p><p>More than 1,000 flights scheduled for Thursday were canceled at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/cancelled/today/KDFW" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to FlightAware</a>, a flight tracking website. More than <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/cancelled/today/kdal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">200 flights</a> were canceled at Dallas Love Field Airport. </p><p>As the storm crosses the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday into Friday, any slight change in its path could result in precipitation that differs from the forecast in a given area. A slightly more northern track would shift the heavier snow farther north and lift the line of freezing rain and sleet. A more southern track would do the opposite, bringing the heavier snow deeper into the South and leaving the northern areas dry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Winter precipitation is expected across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas from Thursday night into Friday. By early Friday morning, it will have surged farther east across Tennessee, northern Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. While Tennessee is no stranger to winter storms, some areas, like Memphis, could receive their largest two-day snow total in 40 years.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Forecasters in Nashville reminded locals not to become hung up on the precise amounts, as any snow could cause hazardous travel in the region. In Atlanta, it has been nearly 11 years since a small snowstorm, locally referred to as snowmageddon, shut down the city and became a <a href="https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/weekend-update-buford-calloway/2752754" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">punchline for a “Saturday Night Live” skit</a>.</p><p>While snow has fallen in the city since then, it may still catch people off guard as the type of precipitation changes through the day. What is expected to start as snow Friday morning is likely to turn to sleet and then freezing rain across the Atlanta metropolitan area, turning untreated roads into ice skating rinks by the evening hours.</p><p>Gov. Brian P. Kemp of Georgia declared a state of emergency <a href="https://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2025-01-09/gov-kemp-declares-statewide-state-emergency-ahead-winter-weather" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Thursday</a> because of the forecast and said it would be in place through Tuesday. The governor asked residents to avoid travel as much as possible in the next few days. “Hazardous conditions, including ice and snow, can develop quickly and make travel very dangerous,” he said in a statement. </p><p>Across North Carolina, a similar scenario will begin to unfold around midday Friday and last overnight into Saturday. Accumulations of up to two inches are currently expected in the Mid-Atlantic area east of the Allegheny Mountains.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The storm is then expected to move off the coast, where it will strengthen but remain far enough away to avoid being a major hazard for the Northeast.</p><p>Abnormal cold across the East Coast is expected to continue into next week, allowing for some snow to stick around. And where the snow has melted during the day, it may refreeze at night, creating ongoing transportation hazards.</p><p>Amanda Holpuch<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
