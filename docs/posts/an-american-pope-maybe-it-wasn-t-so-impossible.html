    <h1>An American Pope? Maybe It Wasn’t So Impossible.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there was ever going to be an American pope, Cardinal Robert Prevost — now Leo XIV — was probably going to be it.</p><p>Still, as someone who covered the previous two conclaves and the latter years of the papacy of John Paul II, I’m pretty stunned by Prevost’s election. Common wisdom long held that the European-dominated College of Cardinals would never elect an American. The United States was considered too powerful in the world to also put a man on the throne of St. Peter. At the conclaves that elected Benedict XVI and Francis and at this one, handicappers dutifully put a few Americans on the list of papabili, or possible popes, but usually with the caveat that they were long shots.</p><p>Prevost, 69, defied the odds. A number of factors point to why.</p><p>He was born in Chicago but spent much of his life outside the United States. He lived for two decades in Peru, serving as a missionary, seminary teacher, parish priest and eventually bishop (becoming a naturalized Peruvian citizen). He was also president of a pontifical commission for Latin America, which is home to some <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2014/11/13/religion-in-latin-america/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">40 percent</a> of the world’s Catholics. So for many of the 133 voting cardinals, he might have been seen more as an international clergyman than a Yank.</p><p>In his first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/pope-leo-xiv-speech-transcript.html" title="">speech</a> as pope, from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica, Leo spoke in Italian, as is traditional. He also offered greetings in Spanish — but not English.</p></div></div>
