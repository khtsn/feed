<p>The match began on Haven, which Falcons took 13-6 thanks in part to a dominant first half. Falcons extended their momentum on Split, with a flawless defense setting them up for a 13- win to close out the series.</p>

<p>Falcons will next play against Shopify Rebellion, the 2023 Game Changers Champions, while ALG will look to continue their run in the lower bracket. </p>
