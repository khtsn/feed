    <h1>The Childish Tariff Formula That Will Reshape the Global Economy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lesotho is one of the poorest countries on Earth. Its 2.3 million citizens spend an average of only $3 on American goods and services each year not because they’re trying to cheat the United States but because they have very little money.</p><p>And what of the stuff that Americans buy from Lesotho? Diamonds top the list. We could improve our trade balance with Lesotho by purchasing fewer diamonds, but we can’t mine our own. There are no commercial diamond mines in this country.</p><p>Lesotho is an extreme example, of course. But it is a valuable one all the same. It underscores that the president is lying to the American people.</p><p>Trump said repeatedly on Wednesday that the tariffs are “reciprocal,” but that’s not true. The tariff rates announced by the Trump administration are not related to the tariff rates charged by other countries. They were calculated using a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-03-2025/card/math-behind-new-tariffs-points-to-trade-imbalance-as-key-issue-W4I7vbzaO5qFZS43hAjc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">childish formula</a> based on trade imbalances.</p><p>The White House later said imbalances are a measure of all the ways that other countries cheat the United States. But as Lesotho illustrates, imbalances are a bad measuring stick. Other countries engage in unfair trade practices. So do we. Instead of doing the work to identify and target those problems, the Trump administration has decided to carpet-bomb the global economy.</p></div></div>
