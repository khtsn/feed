Airlines have extended their <em>scheduled</em> flight durations even more than the flights have lengthened in <em>actual</em> duration.

He said airlines had plenty of incentives to be on time, especially on paper.</p><p>“The benchmark for performance set by the Department of Transportation is based on arriving within 15 minutes of your scheduled time of arrival,” he said. And airlines are protective of their reputation; business travelers in particular care about arriving on time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-69ee47bd">When things go wrong, they go really wrong</h2><p>It is less common now for flights to be moderately delayed. About 30 percent of flights last year were delayed by up to one hour, compared with over 45 percent three decades ago.</p><p>At the same time, the percentage of very delayed flights has increased. Whether we use 90 minutes or three hours as a cutoff, the number of meaningfully late flights is likely to set a record this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="blatt-flight-late" data-id="100000009752046" data-source-id="100000009752046"><div slug="blatt-flight-late" data-sourceid="100000009752046" id="embed-id-100000009752046">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Lavanya Marla, a professor of systems engineering at the University of Illinois, said that as airlines have optimized their day-to-day operations, especially with scheduling flight crews, it has also led to more instances of major disruptions that cascade throughout the system.</p><p>“If you build the schedule really well, you’re able to do the same task with fewer crews,” she said. “When it works, it’s fantastic. But when you have an unexpected event happen, you don’t necessarily have slack in the schedule.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A more efficient system allows for more flights without building more runways. But it has also created more traffic for individual flights. The average taxi-out time for LaGuardia Airport flights is now 24 minutes compared with 19 minutes three decades ago. In some ways the small increase is impressive given that LaGuardia departures are up 64 percent in that time while using its same two runways.</p><p>Long taxi times are a small factor compared with flights that don’t depart the gate on time. If your plane does leave the gate on time, you are essentially ahead of schedule. Last year, 75 percent of flights that left the gate exactly on time arrived at their destinations early.</p><p>Patrick Smith, author of the blog <a href="https://askthepilot.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ask the Pilot</a> and a commercial pilot for more than 30 years, said the data reflected his experiences: “If you leave Los Angeles on time, you’re pretty much guaranteed to get to New York a bit early.”</p><p>Right before a flight, he said, pilots are given a timetable based on weather conditions and air traffic. The arrival time on the pilot’s timetable will be different — usually earlier — than the arrival time on your ticket.</p><h2 id="link-35a1feb5">What can you do?</h2><p>A record number of passengers is expected this holiday season. Unfortunately, there are limited options if your goal is to spend as little time traveling as possible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>You could pay for a more expensive seat so that you can deplane faster. You could pay for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/travel/precheck-global-entry-airport-security.html" title="">TSA PreCheck</a> to spend less time getting through security. And you could choose to fly an airline that has a proven record of fewer delays, although it will typically cost more.</p><p>If you don’t want to spend additional money, there is one trend that’s good to know. Flights that take off in the early evening are nearly three times as likely to be significantly delayed as those in the early morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-15"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="blatt-flight-byhour" data-id="100000009755478" data-source-id="100000009755478"><div slug="blatt-flight-byhour" data-sourceid="100000009755478" id="embed-id-100000009755478">
