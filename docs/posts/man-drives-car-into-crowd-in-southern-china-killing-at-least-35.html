    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The police in China said on Tuesday that 35 people were killed after a man drove a vehicle into a crowd of people who were exercising at a sports center in the southern city of Zhuhai, a rare case of deadly violence in a country where police surveillance is ubiquitous.</p><p>Forty-three other people were injured in the crash on Monday evening, the Zhuhai Municipal Public Security Bureau said. The authorities did not explain why the death toll from the attack was released a day later. </p><p>President Xi Jinping of China on Tuesday night ordered local officials to ensure safety and social stability and “strictly prevent extreme cases,” according to state-run news.</p><p>The police detained the driver, who was identified as a 62-year-old man surnamed Fan. He had been driving a small off-road vehicle and rammed it through the gate of the sports center, the police said. Inside his car, he tried to kill himself with a knife, inflicting wounds on his neck that left him in a coma, the police said, and was rushed to a hospital. </p></div></div>
