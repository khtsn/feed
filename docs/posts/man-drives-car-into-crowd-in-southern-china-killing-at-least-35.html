The authorities did not explain why the death toll from the attack was released a day later. </p><p>President Xi Jinping of China on Tuesday night ordered local officials to ensure safety and social stability and “strictly prevent extreme cases,” according to state-run news.</p><p>The police detained the driver, who was identified as a 62-year-old man surnamed Fan. He had been driving a small off-road vehicle and rammed it through the gate of the sports center, the police said. Inside his car, he tried to kill himself with a knife, inflicting wounds on his neck that left him in a coma, the police said, and was rushed to a hospital. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The police said that they were unable to question the assailant while he was being treated. A preliminary investigation, based on witnesses and other evidence, found that he had been unhappy with the division of property after his divorce, the police said.</p><p>The authorities appeared to move swiftly to control the spread of information. Videos of the attack and discussions on social media briefly took over the Chinese internet on Monday night but were swiftly taken down by censors. Local media reports with interviews of witnesses were mostly also removed from the internet by Tuesday evening. The incident occurred on the eve of an annual air show in the city held by the People’s Liberation Army.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A security person stood in guard near the sports center on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kyodo News, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Zixu Wang is a Times reporter and researcher covering news in mainland China and Hong Kong.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zixu-wang">More about Zixu Wang</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
