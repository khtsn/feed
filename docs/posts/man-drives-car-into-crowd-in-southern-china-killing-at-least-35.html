The authorities did not explain why the death toll, one of the country’s highest from a single incident in recent years, was released a day later.</p><p>The high number of fatalities from what appeared to be a deliberate rampage raises questions about the ruling Communist Party’s record on public safety at time when many people across the country are already on edge over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/business/china-property-crisis.html" title="">a debilitating property crisis</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/business/china-gdp-third-quarter.html" title="">a slowing economy</a>.</p><p>President Xi Jinping of China on Tuesday night ordered local officials to ensure safety and social stability and “strictly prevent extreme cases,” according to state-run news reports. Within hours, other top Communist Party officials moved to reassure the public that the authorities would bolster security.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The police detained the driver, who was identified as a 62-year-old man with the surname of Fan. He had been driving a small off-road vehicle and rammed it through the gate of the sports center, where people were exercising, the police said. Inside his car, he tried to kill himself with a knife, inflicting wounds on his neck that left him in a coma, the police said.</p><p>The police said that they were unable to question the assailant, who remained in a coma and was being treated at a hospital. A preliminary investigation, based on witnesses and other evidence, found that he had been unhappy with how assets had been divided after his divorce, the police said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A security person stood near the sports center on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kyodo News, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Under Mr. Xi, China’s most powerful leader in decades, national security has been a cornerstone of policy, increasingly at the expense of the economy and people’s privacy. The party has rapidly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/world/asia/china-surveillance-xi.html" title="">expanded surveillance</a> in recent years, deploying officials and community workers to track residents and head off potential unrest. Many Chinese accept the intrusions as a necessary price for broad social stability.</p><p>Any perceived failure by the authorities to protect the safety of Chinese citizens could erode the party’s legitimacy and add to broader social tensions at a time when the country&#39;s economic prospects are uncertain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“When domestic demand is so weak and the largest property bubble the world has ever seen has popped, the wealth of the vast majority of households is shrinking and that will inevitably cause a lot of social tensions,” said Victor Shih, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of California, San Diego.</p><p>The authorities appeared to move swiftly to control the spread of information, reflecting a longstanding fear of drawing public criticism over how the government handles threats to public safety.</p><p>Videos of the attack and discussions on social media briefly took over the Chinese internet on Monday night but were swiftly taken down by censors. Local media<span>  </span>interviews of witnesses were also mostly removed from the internet by Tuesday evening. The incident occurred on the eve of an annual air show in the city held by the People’s Liberation Army.</p><p>Still, many videos circumvented the reach of Chinese censors and were shared with users on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>The videos, verified by The New York Times, showed what appeared to be the aftermath of the incident, with dozens of people lying motionless on several sides of a path that encircled an outdoor running track. Shoes, pouches and other personal belongings were scattered on the path. Some survivors were shown trying to perform CPR. Others, still covered in blood, sat on the street waiting for assistance. People could be heard on videos calling for help.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Online commenters speculated that the Zhuhai incident was another example of an attack aimed at taking revenge on society, a phrase used to describe the motives of people who carry out attacks on random civilians. Such attacks are usually carried out by individuals with knives.</p><p>In September, a 10-year-old student was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/asia/child-stabbed-japan-china.html" title="">fatally stabbed</a> by a Chinese man near a Japanese school in southern China. In June, two American instructors from a college in Iowa were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/world/asia/jilin-china-stabbings.html" title="">stabbed</a> in northeast China, and a Chinese national who tried to intervene was knifed in the abdomen. In May, at least two people were killed and 21 others injured when an assailant went on a rampage with a knife <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/07/world/asia/china-hospital-knife-stabbing-attack.html" title="">at a hospital</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Flowers and candles were placed outside the sports center on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tingshu Wang/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The sense that the attackers in such incidents are possibly acting out of frustration with a rapidly changing society also points to the country’s relatively low spending on social welfare and mental health services, especially during economic hard times.</p><p>“We saw a similar thing in the U.S. in 2008 and 2009,” Mr. Shih said. “But the difference is that in the U.S. there was a bit of a social safety net, like social security payments for the unemployed to dull the edge of economic hardship. There is nothing like this in China.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>State media reported that more than 300 medical staff from five different hospitals were involved, and residents lined up to donate blood. Officials on Tuesday rushed to signal that the authorities were moving quickly to address broader security concerns. </p><p>Li Qiang, China’s premier, said the government must “investigate hidden risks and social conflicts.” Huang Kunming, the top Communist Party official for the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, where Zhuhai is, called for “greater efforts and more powerful measures” to protect people’s lives.</p><p>John Yoon<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zixu Wang is a Times reporter and researcher covering news in mainland China and Hong Kong.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zixu-wang">More about Zixu Wang</a></span></p></div><div><p>Muyi Xiao is a Times reporter on the Visual Investigations team covering China.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/muyi-xiao">More about Muyi Xiao</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
