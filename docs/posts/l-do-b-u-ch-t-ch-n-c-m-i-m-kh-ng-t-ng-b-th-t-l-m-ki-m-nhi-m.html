It seems like a day does not go by that Kamala Harris isn’t appearing there with <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/19/lizzo-harris-urge-detroiters-to-vote-early/75755983007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lizzo</a> or <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/19/oprah-winfrey-hosts-kamala-harris-livestream-from-michigan/75277940007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oprah</a> or <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/eminem-to-introduce-barack-obama-kamala-harris-rally-detroit-1236186272/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Barack Obama</a>. Donald Trump has been there a lot, even if his message is off-key: At the Detroit Economic Club, he warned the people of Detroit that “our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s our president.” Harris quickly turned that into an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPgQp2VuZwQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ad that focuses on the city’s pride, resilience and remarkable</a> comeback.</p><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BPgQp2VuZwQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It was a good ad. And yet, I can’t help noticing something that isn’t so great for the Harris campaign in the city, and it’s about an economic and educational class divide.</p><p>So much of the excitement around her candidacy comes from the strong network of Black sororities and fraternities that make up the city’s social scene — in other words, college-educated folks. For instance, Harris’s own sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, has rolled out a “take 4 or more in ’24” campaign, getting people to commit to bringing four friends or relatives out to vote.</p><p>But blue-collar Black voters seem to express more skepticism about Harris, if not outright support for Trump. I called one of my cousins in the Detroit area — a member of Sigma Gamma Rho, who has thrown herself into campaigning for Harris — and asked if she had the same impression.</p><p>She mentioned the people she knew who were voting for Trump — a hairdresser, a landscaper, a former flight attendant — and told me that yes, there did seem to be a class divide going on. She’s been giving out Harris pins and wristbands. “I’ve had people give it back to me,” she told me. She surmised that Trump’s blue-collar appeal might be related to the celebrities that he surrounds himself with. At a rally in Detroit last week, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropf27b_Hwg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump brought the rapper Trick Trick and the former boxer Thomas Hearns onstage</a>.</p><p>But another reason comes to mind. Many blue-collar residents of Detroit went to prison at some point in their lives, instead of college. In the aftermath of mass incarceration, there are <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/sites/detroitmi.localhost/files/2018-04/FairChanceOrdinance.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 100,000 adults</a> in Detroit who have been convicted of a felony, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X21001265#:~:text=This%20means%20that%20of%20the,and%20varies%20substantially%20between%20states." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some 19 million around the country</a>. That’s a lot of people, in a state that Trump won by less than 11,000 votes in 2016.</p><p>Last year Michigan <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/16/1219695211/new-michigan-law-means-people-leaving-prison-will-automatically-be-registered-to" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">became the first state in the nation</a> to pass a law that automatically registers people who emerge from prison to vote, and a fair amount of grass-roots effort goes on in Detroit to make sure they do. These former inmates — who often <a href="https://www.crainsdetroit.com/crains-forum/new-michigan-felony-expungement-law-faces-backlog" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggle to get jobs</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/detroit-city-council-supports-bill-help-formerly-incarcerated-find-housing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">housing</a> because of long-ago convictions — don’t love the idea of electing a prosecutor.

All my life, I’ve followed the New York Mets. I read Mets blogs, follow Mets social media. I obsessively follow Mets games. My team gives my life drama without consequences — a swelling sense of well-being when they are good, the glorious highs of a comeback win, the occasional moments of crushing despair and, because they are the Mets, long decades of languishing mediocrity.</p><p>This season was the most fun I’ve ever had as a sports fan. For the first two months of the season, the team was thoroughly bad and demoralized. The next five months, though, were a string of walk-off home runs, miraculous comebacks, clutch pitching and joyous celebrations. When somebody does something tremendous in my workplace, we don’t dog-pile on one another like children and pour sports drinks on people’s heads. Thanks to the Mets, over the past few months, I got to vicariously experience dozens of those celebrations.</p><p>Two things are great about being a sports fan. First, the miraculous win. We humans love a story of triumph over the odds. I’ve forgotten whole years of my life, but I can still tell you all about the astounding Mets comeback win in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. Years hence, I will be able to tell you about this year’s Francisco Lindor home run that launched the Mets over the Braves or the Pete Alonso home run that took them past the Brewers.</p><p>But there is something even better in sports than the comeback. It’s anticipation. It’s hope. It’s the sensation that some great talent has appeared on the scene who will bring you joy for years to come. It’s the rookie who gets off to a sensational start and carries with him bursts of possibility. It’s the free-agent signing that will bring future stardom to your roster. Dreaming about triumphs to come is sometimes more fun than the triumphs themselves.</p><p>The Mets have always had some good players. This time, they have a good organization.</p><p>The owner, the front office, the scouts, the manager — they seem to know what they are doing. Maybe my hopes will be dashed again, Mets style, but it sure is fun to be hoping.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2VhYzIxZjY4LTRmN2UtNTI1NS04OTg3LTc4OTg5YWY4NjExMw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#musk-breaking-voting-law" data-source-id="100000009774422"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-22T09:06:02.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 22, 2024, 5:06 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Makela/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Every vote counts — at least in the swing states.</p><p>Give Elon Musk credit for recognizing the absurd reality of how American presidential elections work and for putting his money where his mouth is. The problem is that he is breaking the law while doing it.</p><p>Musk, Donald Trump’s richest backer, started out offering $47 to any registered voter in Pennsylvania or other swing state who referred another registered voter to sign his super PAC’s petition supporting the Constitution. ($47 — get it? There are few public figures whose belief in their own cleverness diverges as sharply from reality as Musk’s.)</p><p>That raised eyebrows among election-law scholars because it trod close to the line of paying people to register to vote, which is a federal crime. Musk then increased the payout to $100 and offered it to both the referrer and the signer of the petition (not as clever as $47 but easier for his accountants). Now Musk says he is handing out $1 million every day until Election Day — not a typo — to a random registered Pennsylvania voter who signs the petition.</p><p>And that’s where his gimmick crosses the line into clear illegality, according to Rick Hasen, a U.C.L.A. law professor who is one of the nation’s top election-law scholars.</p><p>“There’s no problem with having a lottery, at least from the point of view of election law, to pay people to sign a petition,” Hasen told MSNBC on Monday. “The problem is to sign the petition, you have to be, if you go to their website of his PAC, you have to be a registered voter in a swing state.”</p><p>Hasen first covered the issue <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=146397" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on his blog last Saturday</a>, where he cited 52 U.S.C. 10307(c), the federal law that prohibits paying someone or accepting payment “either for registration to vote or for voting.” The penalty is $10,000 or up to five years in prison or both. There are a few minor exceptions to the law, including driving people to the polls and giving employees paid leave to vote. In its manual, the Justice Department distinguishes acts like these because they are done with the intent of making it easier for someone to vote rather than inducing them to register or vote in the first place.</p><p>Musk’s giveaway looks a lot more like inducing than making easier. In a lottery-addled nation like ours, it’s not hard to imagine hordes of unregistered Pennsylvanians rushing to the D.M.V. in the hope of a million-dollar payday. No word yet from the election-integrity hawks who praised Georgia for its 2021 law barring volunteers from giving water and food to voters waiting in hourslong lines.</p><p>Musk appears to be spending at least $18 million for no clear benefit. That may not be a surprise coming from the man who shelled out north of $40 billion to satisfy a personal grudge against the social media site formerly known as Twitter, but its apparent fecklessness is not an excuse for federal prosecutors to ignore it.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzBlNzA4MjJmLTUxMGYtNTRiZS04OGZhLWU1OGM0YTc2ZWFiZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#philadelphia-mailers-trump" data-source-id="100000009774335"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-21T22:00:05.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 21, 2024, 6:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>People who don’t live in swing states probably don’t realize just how much political junk mail (the old-fashioned paper kind) is being delivered to battleground residents in the final days of the presidential campaign. Some Pennsylvania residents, for example, say they’re getting five or six mailers a day, and a vast majority of them are coming from Republican groups or dark-money groups aligned with the Trump campaign.</p><p>Mintt, a company that tracks direct mail, says that it has collected <a href="https://us18.campaign-archive.com/?u=b230aa6a8b06f74ed1a0c6d2b&amp;id=a1aa1923a0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14,000 different mail cards</a> — currently about 1,000 new ones a day — that have gone to millions of households in nine swing states. Through September, about 96 percent of them were pro-Donald Trump or anti-Kamala Harris. Democrats have started to catch up, but four out of five mailers still come from Republicans, and many of them are going to Democratic neighborhoods.</p><p>What’s the point of snail mail in an era when most people communicate by phone? Political consultants have long believed that direct mail is more engaging and substantial than an overflowing email inbox, and people tend to look at what shows up in their home’s mailbox.</p><p>Judging by some of the mail showing up in largely Black neighborhoods in southwestern Philadelphia, which I’ve been collecting, it’s also very easy to lie with little consequence.</p><p>Many of the mail cards directed to those neighborhoods are all about fear of crime. Just as Trump and his party allies have spent months trying to falsely persuade Americans that they are in grave danger of being shot in the street, the mail fliers make that threat explicit. “Crime is rising, Pennsylvanians are less safe,” said one mailer sent out by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/31/trump-dark-money-group-00161122" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Securing American Greatness</a>, a dark-money group (meaning that contributions don’t have to be disclosed) run by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/23/us/politics/trump-republican-campaigns-cash.html" title="">Taylor Budowich</a>, a former spokesman and former senior adviser to Trump.

She had always wanted a big family but struggled to get pregnant and turned to in vitro fertilization to have her two boys.</p><p>But this pregnancy was not viable: The embryo had attached to scar tissue from a previous C-section, a life-threatening ectopic condition known as “<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10298845/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cesarean-scar pregnancy</a>” for which abortion is the treatment.</p><p>But Florida has a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/us/florida-abortion-ban.html" title="">six-week abortion ban</a> and Palmese was six weeks and five days pregnant. Palmese told me in a phone interview her doctor buried his head into his hands. He told her he had reached out to physicians across Florida but none believed they could help, despite the exception in the Florida law for saving the life of the mother. “Everybody said the same thing,” she recalled. “Unless there’s no heartbeat, there’s nothing they can do for me.”</p><p>Palmese was shocked. “If my life isn’t important, what is important?” she said. “Who’s going to take care of my kids if something happens to me?”</p><p>As Americans vote in the coming days, I hope they’ll remember <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/17/opinion/dobbs-roe-abortion-stories.html" title="">the ordinariness with which women in this country have been stripped of their rights</a>, including the right to life, in just two years. I hope they’ll remember that medical complications with pregnancies occur regularly in the states that have banned abortion, forcing women like Palmese into life-threatening situations.</p><p>In her case, she found the care she needed to save her life in New York, at Northwell’s North Shore University Hospital on Long Island. Dr. Michael Leslie Nimaroff, who treated Palmese, told me it was clear based on medical records shared with him from her doctor at home that Florida had denied Palmese critical care. Dr. Nimaroff seemed to be struggling to come to terms with a political landscape in which doctors are being prevented from saving the lives of their patients.</p><p>“My understanding is I don’t understand it,” he told me. “As a health care provider for women, it’s very hard for us to understand not being able to intervene for the mother’s wellness and safety. It goes against what we’re taught.”</p><p>Palmese declined to say for whom she plans to vote in the presidential election. But she said she plans to vote for a Florida ballot initiative, known as Amendment 4, that would establish a right to abortion in the state before viability. “Yes on Four is my stance on it,” she said. “We need to keep government out of health care.”</p><p>Palmese is just one of an estimated 23 million women of reproductive age living under abortion bans since the fall of Roe v. Wade. Some women have died from the bans, or almost died. Others, like Palmese, have been forced to travel great distances to receive life-saving care.</p><p>So long as the bans remain, they are a threat to the dignity and citizenship of every woman in the United States.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQ3MzMxNzc2LTQ5YzgtNTgxZC1hMDRmLTgyNjNhZjg4ZmQ2Yg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#trump-chances-tipsheet" data-source-id="100000009772412"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy"><img alt="Patrick Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-21T09:04:07.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 21, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fans of both the Pittsburgh Steelers and Donald Trump at Sunday night’s game in Pittsburgh.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gene J.

Here’s what we’re looking at this week:</em></p><ul><li><p>What if undecided voters really aren’t undecided? What if, instead, they’re mostly people who will vote for Donald Trump, but they just don’t want to admit it to pollsters — or themselves?</p></li><li><p>This has been on my mind lately because Kamala Harris and Trump have drawn about as sharp a contrast as I’ve seen in the five presidential races I’ve covered. Harris is campaigning with gusto and her message has been consistent since summer. This is not a complicated choice. I suspect that Harris has won over most of the undecided and swing voters she is going to get, and that Trump is in better shape in the battleground states than the polls suggest — and better positioned to attract late-deciding voters who are often driven by feelings (which I think this year will be about two things: the economy and fear).</p></li><li><p>Why aren’t more “undecideds” saying they’ll vote for Trump? Well, the guy makes it awfully hard for many Nikki Haley Republicans, moderates, independents and others outside his MAGA base to get on the bandwagon with his election-denying, insurrectionist-defending, us-vs.-them bombast. In my three years moderating Times Opinion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/focus-groups" title="">focus groups</a>, I’ve heard embarrassment from some non-MAGA people who voted for Trump. His conduct on Jan. 6, 2021 disgusts many of them. Some are genuinely uncomfortable saying they will vote for him after what he did that day.</p></li><li><p>But at the same time — and this is key — many moderate, independent, swing and undecided voters list the economy as their top issue. And many of them still praise Trump on economic issues. Americans as a rule hate inflation. Many of them fault the Biden-Harris administration. I don’t believe undecided voters who care most about the economy and are pinched by inflation are going to embrace Harris. I see no clear sign in the battleground states that her economic message is convincing large numbers of undecided and swing voters that she will be better on the economy than Trump. Many voters are not looking for a “more of the same” president, and I think her single biggest problem is separating herself from Biden. She hasn’t done it effectively.</p></li><li><p>Harris’s political strategy this week is a signal that her team suspects all of this, too. </p><p>She is campaigning with Liz Cheney in swing states and will be talking about Jan. 6. Maybe Harris and Cheney can turn some of these voters away from Trump, and capitalize on his “enemy within” language and his threats against his critics and opponents. I think Harris is closing out the race with the right issues — the economy, abortion rights, security, Jan. 6 — that resonate with a lot of voters, including suburban women who are crucial to her chances. She’s hoping Michelle and Barack Obama will help with these voters and others, too, when they do their first joint events later this week.</p></li><li><p>Trump’s closing strategy is to make people afraid of a Harris presidency, by maligning her personally or portraying the country as near collapse. He and his allies are bent on making Harris unacceptable to voters.</p><p>If he wins, an under-told story of this campaign may be how effective the Trump camp’s ads on transgender girls and trans rights have been in making Harris look extreme and unacceptable. This week, he is campaigning in North Carolina, Georgia and Nevada, where I expect the fear-mongering to reach a fever pitch with social conservatives, religious voters and some of the Black and Latino men he is trying to win over.</p><p>He knows what he’s doing by sowing anxiety. Harris can’t afford this to be a fear vs. more-of-the-same election.</p></li></ul></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzlkODdlM2M1LWNhODctNTRhOC04ZjI0LTQxNWVkMDM1MTYzNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#luzerne-pennsylvania-harris-support" data-source-id="100000009770622"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farah-stockman"><img alt="Farah Stockman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-18T21:31:13.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 18, 2024, 5:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>I recently spent the night at my aunt Eleanor’s house, in Luzerne County, Pa., in an old coal mining community near the Poconos that has the odd distinction of having voted twice for Barack Obama and then twice for Donald Trump. I knew I’d reached her driveway when I saw a Harris-Walz sign and another that read, “Lock him up,” next to a security camera that she installed to stop her neighbors from tearing them down. So many Trump signs dotted that old country road that you’d think my aunt was the only Democrat in town.</p><p>But she invited nine of her friends over to talk politics with me, including three Republicans who planned to vote for Kamala Harris. They felt just as passionately as my aunt did, but many said they didn’t want to put up signs. One said she and her husband had moved there recently and didn’t want to rock the boat with their neighbors. Another expressed fear of “weird militias.”</p><p>“People are very nervous what’s going to happen,”<strong> </strong>Becky Loftus, a Puerto Rican woman who married a coal miner’s son from the area, told the group. If Harris wins, there will be violence, she said, and if Trump wins, there will be violence. “It’s a no-win situation.”</p><p>They were not unlike Democrats in other places. They hated Trump — his lies, his policies, his character, his hair. They had all gone through the same emotions as every other Democrat I knew: depression after Trump’s debate with President Biden, skepticism that Harris could lead and then absolute elation when she made it a race again after Biden dropped out. Now they were experiencing a new emotion: political dread of Election Day, when, after all that we as a nation have been through, it will still not be over.</p><p>But it felt good anyway, they said, to gather in the same room and be reminded that they weren’t alone. Records show that there are almost the same number of registered Democrats (87,314) as Republicans in the county (87,724) and there are 22,456 unaffiliated with either party.</p><p>There is no doubt that Trump has deep support here. But perhaps not as deep as one would think from counting signs along these old country roads. Let’s remember that yard signs don’t vote. People do.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
