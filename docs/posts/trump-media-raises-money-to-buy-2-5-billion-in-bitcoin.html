The company is planning to raise an additional $1 billion from the sale of bonds that can also be converted into shares at a later date.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001849635/000114036125020420/ef20049689_8k.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement</a> came as the president and his family have become more involved in a number of crypto companies. Mr. Trump owns a little over 50 percent of Trump Media’s stock, making his roughly $2.7 billion stake one of his most valuable investments.</p><p>The sale of the new shares will potentially dilute the value of Trump Media’s stock, including the 115 million shares that Mr. Trump owns. The president’s shares are held in a trust managed by his eldest son, Donald Jr., who also is a Trump Media board member.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As part of the deal, which could close as soon as Thursday, the shares will be sold at $25.72.</p><p>Shares of Trump Media were down over 10 percent at the close of trading on Tuesday. The stock is down 31 percent for the year.</p><p>Trump Media, which has a market value of just over $5 billion, said that with the cash raised from the stock and bond sale it would create one of the largest corporate reserves to invest in Bitcoin. The company is taking a page from the investment strategy made famous by Michael Saylor’s company Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, which was one of the first to invest mightily in Bitcoin as a cash-management technique.</p><p>“We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets,” Devin Nunes, the company’s chief executive officer and a former California congressman, said in a statement.</p><p>The company did not immediately disclose the investors in the deal.</p><p>Trump Media went public a little over a year ago, after completing a merger with a cash-rich shell company. But the company has been losing money ever since, and Truth Social has generated just a few million dollars in advertising revenue, even as the social media platform serves as Mr. Trump’s primary online megaphone for communicating to the public.</p><p>Last quarter, Trump Media recorded a $32 million loss on just $820,000 in revenue from advertising and other sources.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mike Stegemoller, a professor of finance at Baylor University, said Trump Media appeared to be “throwing in the towel” on its original business strategy. He added, “This does not look like a high-growth social media platform.”</p><p>This year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/business/trump-media-financial-services.html" title="">the company began to move</a> away from its reliance on advertising dollars and into crypto and financial services.</p><p>Last month, Trump media <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/trump-media-crypto.html" title="">announced a deal</a> with Crypto.com and an affiliate of Yorkville Advisors, a New Jersey investment firm, to launch a series of exchange-traded funds by the end of the year. The series of E.T.F.s will invest in Bitcoin and so-called America First businesses that are in keeping with President Trump’s campaign pledges.</p><p>The company also said it planned to invest in Bitcoin as part of its corporate cash management strategy, but Tuesday’s announcement moved Trump Media into that strategy in a much bigger way.</p><p>Bitcoin is trading near <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/bitcoin-rises-new-record-high-eclipses-january-top-2025-05-21/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an all-time high</a> and is up more than 50 percent over the past year.</p><p>Both Crypto.com, which is based in Singapore, and Yorkville also will play a role in Trump Media’s new Bitcoin investment strategy, as well as the crypto bank Anchorage Digital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Trump Media also retained Cantor Fitzgerald as its financial adviser. Cantor is the company formerly led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/business/trump-spac-deals.html" title="">has begun to also embrace crypto</a> as an investing strategy.</p><p>Initially a crypto critic, Mr. Trump went on to fully champion the industry during last year’s presidential campaign and vowed that his administration would take a more welcoming approach to digital assets than the Biden administration did.</p><p>Shortly after Mr. Trump returned to office, securities regulators dismissed roughly a dozen lawsuits against and pending investigations of crypto companies. In March, Crypto.com <a href="https://crypto.com/en/company-news/sec-closes-crypto-com-investigation-with-no-action" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it had been notified that an investigation into the platform’s activities had been closed.</p><p>Mr. Trump is estimated to have added billions of dollars to his personal fortune, at least on paper, since the start of his new term, much of it through crypto.</p><p>Last week, the president hosted a dinner at his Virginia golf club, and among the guests were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-memecoin-dinner.html" title="">the highest-paying customers of his personal cryptocurrency</a>, known as $TRUMP. The event helped promote sales of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-crypto-coin-auction.html" title="">memecoin</a>, which was introduced just days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration and has become a vehicle for investors, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/trump-crypto-purchase.html" title="">including many foreigners</a>, to funnel money to his family.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html" title="">World Liberty Financial</a>, a crypto venture largely owned by a Trump family corporate entity, recently pulled in $2 billion from the government of the United Arab Emirates. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/trump-american-bitcoin-crypto.html" title="">American Bitcoin</a>, a crypto firm co-founded by Eric Trump, another of the president’s sons, said this month that it planned to go public, another expansion of the Trump family’s investments across the crypto industry.</p><p>Jason Karaian<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>May 27, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misidentified Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s former role at Cantor Fitzgerald.
