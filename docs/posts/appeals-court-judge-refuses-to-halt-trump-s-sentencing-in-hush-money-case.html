    <h1>Appeals Court Judge Refuses to Halt Trump’s Sentencing in Hush-Money Case</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A New York appellate court on Tuesday declined to halt President-elect Donald J. Trump’s criminal sentencing, dealing a significant setback to his hopes of shutting down the case before returning to the White House.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who is scheduled to face sentencing on Friday, 10 days before being sworn in for a second presidential term, had asked the appeals court to intervene and freeze the proceeding. His lawyers argued that Mr. Trump was entitled to full immunity from prosecution, and even sentencing, now that he was the president-elect.</p><p>The emergency application fell to a single appellate court judge, Ellen Gesmer, who held a brief hearing on Tuesday before denying Mr. Trump’s request within a half-hour.</p><p>At the hearing, Justice Gesmer appeared highly skeptical of Mr. Trump’s arguments, grilling Mr. Trump’s lawyer about whether he had “any support for a notion that presidential immunity extends to president-elects?”</p></div></div>
