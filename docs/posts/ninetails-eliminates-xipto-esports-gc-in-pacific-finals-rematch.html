</span> 2-1 in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581496/xipto-esports-gc-vs-ninetails-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr1" target="_blank">first elimination match</a> of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2596/game-changers-2025-championship-seoul/main-event" target="_blank">Game Changers 2025 Championship</a>, sending their fellow Pacific representatives home and staying alive on their home turf in Seoul. </p>

<p>For Ninetails, this match was for revenge as well as survival, as Xipto had won both of their previous encounters in the upper final and the grand final of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2548/game-changers-2025-pacific" target="_blank">GC Pacific</a>. </p>

<p>Xipto selected <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581496/xipto-esports-gc-vs-ninetails-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr1/?game=240146&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a> to open the series, which came as a surprise considering that Ninetails had an undefeated 11-0 record on the map. While Xipto took an early 3-0 lead after winning the first bonus, Ninetails quickly demonstrated why they were undefeated with 12 consecutive round wins, running the score all the way up to 12-3. The Korean squad could do no wrong on their attack side as they patiently punished Xipto&#39;s constant attempts to push out into A main and added in aggressive set pieces of their own with their ultimates. </p>

<p>Xipto only managed to take one more round before Ninetails promptly ended the affair 13-4. <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/30315/fullmoon">
		FullMoon	</a>
</span> led her side on Vyse as the one most often in position to punish Xipto&#39;s aggression, producing 19 kills, 305 ACS, and 204 ADR, and was only outdone by <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/45029/grahams">
		grahams	</a>
</span> on the other side who put up 21 kills and 331 ACS on Yoru despite the loss.</p>

<p>The second map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581496/xipto-esports-gc-vs-ninetails-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr1/?game=240147&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>. For a moment, Ninetails seemed primed to carry their momentum from Pearl forward as they opened the map with a full eco win in the second round followed by an ace from <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/54175/dana">
		DaNa	</a>
</span> in the third.</p>


<p><em>DaNa mows down all five Xipto members for a clean ace.</em></p>

<p>However, Xipto showed resilience, rallying with an eco of their own in round 7 followed by a decisive B rush in round 8, turning a 3-3 deadlock to 7-3 for their first lead in the series since the beginning of Pearl. They maintained control from there with a second pistol win, widening the gap to 11-5. Ninetails strung together a few rounds to make things slightly dangerous, but Xipto ultimately closed the map in 13-8 fashion. The Duelists grahams and <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/52180/yxqme">
		yxqme	</a>
</span> led from the front, putting up 19 kills apiece and combining for nine first bloods between them.</p>

<p>Both teams brought out unique compositions for the decider on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581496/xipto-esports-gc-vs-ninetails-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr1/?game=242538&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>. Xipto brought out Veto with a composition featuring both Astra and Omen, while Ninetails opted for an aggressive double-Duelist double-Controller composition that lacked any kind of Initiator. </p>

<p>In the end, Ninetails&#39; gameplan proved superior. They leaned heavily into overwhelming site hits on their attack, finding repeated successes for an early 5-0 lead that bloomed into a 9-3 half. By comparison, Xipto struggled to adapt, often finding themselves in disadvantageous retakes after the opposition ran over their anchor players. </p>


<p><em>h4ste clutches out a 1v2 to keep the snowball rolling for Ninetails.</em></p>

<p>The final nail in the coffin was round 14, where Ninetails once again won an eco after losing the pistol and eventually closed out Split 13-5. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/40410/332">
		332	</a>
</span> in particular was a menace on Yoru, putting up a 22/9/1 KDA to top the series 53/36/9.</p>

<p>With this result, Ninetails survive and bring Xipto&#39;s year to an end, but their path forward is steep; their opponent in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581498/mibr-gc-vs-ninetails-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr2" target="_blank">next round</a> of the lower bracket tomorrow will be the GCC 2024 runners-up <span data-ref-id="7">
