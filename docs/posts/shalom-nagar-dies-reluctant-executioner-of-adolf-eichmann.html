He was in his late 80s.</p><p>Mr. Nagar’s death was confirmed by Avigail Sperber, who directed “The Hangman,” a 2010 film about him, with Netalie Braun. Ms. Sperber did not specify where he died. His age has been reported by various sources as 86 or 88.</p><p>For decades — until a radio station identified him in 2004 — Mr. Nagar (pronounced nah-GAR) hid his connection to the Eichmann execution, fearing retribution from neo-Nazis. But the midnight hanging always haunted him.</p><p>On May 31, 1962, he was out walking with his wife, Ora, and his infant son when a police van screeched to a halt and whisked him away. Mr. Nagar knew it meant that the time of Eichmann’s execution had been set and that he was being called back to work to serve as executioner. He persuaded the driver to turn around and assure his wife that he wasn’t being kidnapped.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Before the execution — the only case of capital punishment in Israel’s history — Eichmann asked for white wine and cigarettes; he refused a blindfold.</p><p>Mr. Nagar’s role was to release the trapdoor on the gallows, sending the prisoner plunging 30 feet to his death. But what was worse, Mr. Nagar recalled, was the grisly aftermath: removing the noose and conveying the prisoner’s corpse on a wobbly stretcher to a specially built oven to be cremated.</p><p>“Eichmann’s face was white as chalk, his eyes were bulging and his tongue was dangling out,” Mr. Nagar told <a href="https://mishpacha.com/death-guard/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mishpacha</a> magazine in 2005. “The rope rubbed the skin off his neck and so his tongue and chest were covered with blood.”</p><p>He added: “I didn’t know that when a person is strangled all the air remains in his stomach, and when I lifted him, all the air that was inside came up and the most horrifying sound was released from his mouth — ‘baaaaa!’ I felt the Angel of Death had come to take me too.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Nagar was supposed to accompany the ashes to a port so a Coast Guard vessel could take them to be scattered beyond Israel’s territorial waters, but he was too shaken and was sent home. When he arrived, covered in blood, his wife was stunned.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eichmann in a bulletproof-glass booth at his trial in 1961.

Soon after, his mother remarried, abandoning him and his four siblings. When he was 12, around the time Israel declared statehood, he immigrated, making most of the trip on foot. He enlisted in the Israeli army at 16, serving in a paratroop brigade, and then worked for the police and as a border guard before joining the Israel Prison Service, where he spent 28 years.</p><p>In 1950, Eichmann, the logistical architect of the Holocaust, fled Germany; he was captured a decade later by Israeli secret agents in Argentina, where he had been living incognito.</p><p>Eichmann was flown to Israel, where he stood trial in a bulletproof-glass booth. After he was found guilty in December 1961, he was closely guarded for six months — until his execution — at Ramla, a prison in central Israel, by a 22-man team that included Mr. Nagar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>To prevent a retaliatory attack on Eichmann, all of the guards were Sephardic Jews unrelated to victims or survivors of the Holocaust, and his food was delivered in locked containers.</p><p>“Before I gave him his meal, I had to taste it myself,” Mr. Nagar said. “If I didn’t drop dead after two minutes, the duty officer allowed the plate into his cell.”</p><p>Of all the guards, Mr. Nagar said, he was the only one who didn’t want the job of hangman.</p><p>In the end, that didn’t matter: He was chosen in a lottery.</p><p>The head warden considered him ideal, he said, because he was a decorated soldier and had been an orphan in Yemen during World War II, untouched by the Holocaust.</p><p>Mr. Nagar told the warden that “he should find someone else to do the job,” he recalled.</p><p>“Then he took me and several other guards and showed us footage of how the Nazis took innocent children and tore them to pieces,” he continued. “I was so shaken that I agreed to whatever had to be done.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In a 2004 interview with <a href="https://historama.com/online-resources/articles/israel/shalom_nagar_eichmanns_hangman.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shofar News</a>, he reflected that Eichmann — dead or alive — was frightening. “From a childhood age, I lived alone without parents and without help,” he said, recalling how he went on to do a number of dangerous jobs, including serving in the border guard and dismantling land mines. “I was not a man who got scared. But from him, I was scared.”</p><p>In an official account, another guard was said to have been assigned to simultaneously perform the hanging — to obfuscate responsibility — but Mr. Nagar said he was unaware of any other participant.</p><p>In “The Hangman,” directed by Ms. Braun and Ms. Sperber, and funded by the Foundation for Jewish Culture’s Lynn and Jules Kroll Fund for Jewish Documentary Film, Mr. Nagar says: “We’re in this world as tenants. The only thing we take with us is our good deeds.”</p><p>After leaving the Prison Service, Mr. Nagar lived in Hebron until the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/26/world/west-bank-massacre-overview-least-40-slain-west-bank-israeli-fires-into-mosque.html" title="">1994 terrorist massacre</a> on a mosque by an American-Israeli. Then he moved to Kiryat Arba, a nearby settlement on the West Bank. He returned to his strict religious roots as a Yemenite Jew and became a ritual slaughterer of kosher meat.</p><p>Information about Mr. Nagar’s survivors was not immediately available.</p><p>In discussing the execution with Mishpacha magazine, Mr. Nagar invoked Amalek, the biblical archenemy nation of ancient Israel, to justify his task.</p><p>In spite of the trauma, he said, he appreciated the value of his experience: God “commands us to wipe out Amalek, to ‘erase his memory from under the sky’ and ‘not to forget.’ I have fulfilled both.”</p><p>Jonathan Reiss contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sam Roberts is an obituaries reporter for The Times, writing mini-biographies about the lives of remarkable people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sam-roberts">More about Sam Roberts</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
