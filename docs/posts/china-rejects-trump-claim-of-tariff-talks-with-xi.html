Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Friday morning, the president reiterated that he had spoken with the Chinese president “numerous times,” but he refused to answer when pressed on whether any call had happened after he imposed the tariffs earlier this month.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s comments appeared aimed at creating the impression of progress with China to soothe jittery financial markets, which have fallen amid signs that the world’s largest economies are not negotiating. The S&amp;P 500 is down 10 percent since Mr. Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.</p><p>But his claims of talks have been rejected by Chinese officials, who have repeatedly denied this week that they are actively negotiating with the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“China and the U.S. have not held consultations or negotiations on the issue of tariffs,” Guo Jiakun, the spokesman for the foreign ministry, said in a news conference on Friday. “The United States should not confuse the public.”</p><p>On Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesman for China’s commerce ministry, had said that there were “no economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States.”</p><p>“Any claims about progress in China-U.S. economic and trade negotiations are baseless rumors without factual evidence,” he said.</p><p>Asked in the Time interview if he would call Mr. Xi if the Chinese leader did not call first, Mr. Trump said no.</p><p>“We’re meeting with China. We’re doing fine with everybody,” the president said.</p><p>Mr. Trump also said, without evidence, that he had “made 200 deals.” He added that he would finish and announce them in the next three to four weeks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>With the two governments at an impasse, businesses that rely on sourcing products from China — varying from hardware stores to toymakers — have been thrown into turmoil. The triple-digit tariff rates have forced many to halt shipments entirely.</p><p>Trump officials have argued that the status quo with China on trade is not sustainable. Mr. Trump has rapidly ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese products, from 54 percent on April 2 to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/economy/china-tariffs-145-percent.html" title="">145 percent just one week later</a>. The Chinese government has argued that the actions are unfair and closely matched his moves, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/china-tariffs-125.html" title="">raising its tariffs on American goods to 125 percent</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.
