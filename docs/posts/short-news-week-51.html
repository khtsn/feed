		<p>Riot has unveiled the 2026 EMEA calendar, alongside the introduction of the brand-new EMEA Clash event that will see partnered teams face off against the top Challengers of the region.</p>



<p>The VCT EMEA format remains mostly the same as this year; three regional tournaments with bids straight to three international events. Additionally, a road show has been scheduled following Stage 2, just before Champions.</p>



<p>Riot&#39;s means of integrating a pathway from Challengers to the VCT EMEA has resulted in a new type of event, EMEA Clash. Following Kickoff, the top Challengers teams will have the opportunity to take to the stage against select VCT EMEA teams that miss out on Masters Santiago.</p>

<p>Alongside this change, 2026 will see four Challengers teams qualify for Stage 2 Play-Ins. Three of these teams will hail from placing among the top three in EMEA Challengers 3, with the final slot up for grabs via a Last Chance Qualifier.</p>

<p>Teams can qualify to Challengers 3 via regional paths, or by being among the top eight teams in circuit points.</p>

<p>The dates for each stage of EMEA Challengers are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>EMEA Clash: February 16 - 26</li>
<li>Challengers EMEA Stage 1: March 16 - 31</li>
<li>Challengers EMEA Stage 2: May 18 - 28</li>
<li>Challengers EMEA Stage 3: June 22 - July 6</li>
</ul>



<p>The introduction of Cash Cups has opened up a new path for teams to qualify for Game Changers EMEA 3 Play-Ins, similar to the change in Challengers format. Fully online, the first six Cash Cups will tie into EMEA GC Stage 3, while the other six will offer teams additional opportunities to showcase talent across the year.</p>

<p>The top regional teams will also earn an opportunity to compete in Promotion/Relegation tournaments in EMEA Game Changers. Two of these tournaments will take place in March and June.</p>



<p>Premier will return next year, with two opportunities for teams to promote into Challengers.</p>
