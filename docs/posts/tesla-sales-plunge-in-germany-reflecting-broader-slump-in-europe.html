The U.S. carmaker’s sales in the country have fallen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/business/tesla-germany-elon-musk.html" title="">two months in a row</a>.</p><p>Demand for Teslas has also dropped in other European countries since Mr. Musk became a de facto member of President Trump’s cabinet and ramped up promotion of far-right parties in Europe and elsewhere on X, the social media platform he owns.</p><p>Tesla’s share price has fallen more than 40 percent from its peak in December and erased all the gains made after Mr. Trump won the presidency in November, when investors bet that Mr. Musk could use his influence in the White House to benefit his businesses. Tesla shares were little changed on Wednesday morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In Germany, Mr. Musk’s aggressive promotion of a far-right party ahead of last month’s parliamentary elections and his call for citizens to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/europe/musk-germany-afd-auschwitz.html" title="">move beyond “a focus on past guilt”</a> may have alienated customers.</p><p>Mr. Musk and Tesla are increasingly being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/tesla-charging-stations-arson-boston.html" title="">targeted by activists and vandals</a>. Activists in London have <a href="https://www.instagram.com/everyonehateselon_/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">started a campaign</a> encouraging people to ditch their Teslas and cancel their accounts on X. In Strasbourg, France, an activist group is handing out stickers warning the Tesla chief to “<a href="https://www.stopelon.eu/stickers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stay Away from the E.U.</a>” Over the weekend, Tesla vehicles in a parking lot in southern France were set ablaze, which prosecutors said were “not at all accidental.”</p><p>Demand for Tesla’s cars in France dropped more than 26 percent in February compared with a year ago, according to the PFA automobile organization.</p><p>In Norway, which is within striking distance of its goal to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/08/business/energy-environment/norway-electric-vehicles.html" title="">end sales of combustion engine cars</a> this year, Tesla sales nearly halved in February from a year earlier, according to the Norwegian Road Traffic Information Council. It was the second monthly drop in a row, despite an overall upswing in the number of new cars registered in the country. Tesla’s share of the overall market slipped to 8.8 percent so far this year, down from 20 percent in 2023.</p><p>“The brand has had a unique market position in Norway for several years,” Oyvind Solberg Thorsen, the council’s director, said in a statement. “Whether this will continue remains to be seen, as there is a lot of turmoil and noise surrounding Tesla and Elon Musk.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Tesla’s February sales dropped 48 percent in Denmark and 42 percent in Sweden, despite an overall upswing in the auto markets in both countries.</p><p>Buyers of electric cars in Britain bucked the trend, with Tesla’s February sales increasing 20 percent compared with the same month last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said Wednesday. Despite the rise, Tesla’s sales were slower than those of other electric car brands, and its overall market share shrank three percentage points, to 10.8 percent.</p><p>Some of the sales declines may be explained by customers waiting for an updated version of the Model Y, which begins to roll out in Europe later this month. But that factor alone probably does not explain such huge declines, analysts said.</p><p>Tesla’s woes are not isolated to Europe. In China, Tesla produced almost 50 percent fewer vehicles in February. Mr. Musk’s political activities probably do not play a large role in China, the world’s largest car market, but competition from Chinese automakers like BYD and Xiaomi is intense.</p><p>Mr. Musk has said little about flagging car sales, arguing instead that Tesla’s growth will depend on advances in self-driving technology and a planned “Cybercab” that could steer, navigate and brake without human intervention. He told investors last month that Tesla would begin offering autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, in June.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Tesla also faces serious competition in that nascent business. Waymo, a unit of Google’s parent company, started offering a driverless taxi service with Uber in Austin on Tuesday. Waymo offers similar services in Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco and is planning to offer a commercial service in Atlanta this year and Miami next year.</p><p>Mr. Musk has said Tesla would have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html" title="">driverless cars operating in Austin in June</a> but he has provided few details.</p><p>Some investors want to pressure Mr. Musk to focus more on Tesla rather than his role as director of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Tulipshare, a shareholder advocacy group, is planning to ask investors at Tesla’s next annual meeting to tie Mr. Musk’s pay to his performance on environmental goals, social responsibility and corporate governance.</p><p>“It is time for Tesla’s investors to hold the company’s leadership accountable,” Antoine Argouges, the chief executive of Tulipshare, said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-eddy">More about Melissa Eddy</a></span></p></div><div><p>Jack Ewing writes about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-ewing">More about Jack Ewing</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/european-union">European Union</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/business/tesla-germany-sales-elon-musk.html">97</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/business/tesla-germany-sales-elon-musk.html">97</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Rise of Electric Vehicles</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Electric Cars:</strong> The electronics maker Xiaomi launched its first electric car after just three years of development and delivered 135,000 vehicles, showing how thoroughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/china-xiaomi-apple-electric-cars.html">China has come to dominate the supply chain for electric vehicles</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ending Shift to Electric Cars?:</strong> The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are preparing an unusual legislative maneuver in an effort to eliminate one of the country’s most ambitious climate policies, an order that was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/climate/republicans-california-waiver-electric-cars.html">designed to shift the auto industry toward electric cars</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Self-Driving Cars in China:</strong> Tesla said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/china-tesla-self-driving-musk.html">some drivers in China would be able to use the company’s Autopilot feature</a> on city streets to help with lane changes and other more advanced tasks, a breakthrough for Elon Musk in the country.</p></li><li><p><strong>New Mail Trucks:</strong> They may look like ducks, but new electric mail trucks have a side cargo door and air-conditioning, promising some long-overdue relief for carriers, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/us/usps-new-mail-trucks.html">haven’t had an upgrade since the 1980s</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tax Credit in Jeopardy:</strong> Many car buyers have come to rely on a $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicles to soften the blow of their high prices. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/trump-electric-vehicle-tax-credit.html">But those credits could disappear</a> after President-elect Donald Trump takes office.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
