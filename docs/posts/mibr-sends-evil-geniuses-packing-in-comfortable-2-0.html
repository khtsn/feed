</span> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/428009/leviat-n-vs-mibr-champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff-lr3" target="_blank">tomorrow</a>, while EG has been eliminated and will have to watch <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> from home. </p>

<p>Both squads suffered losses in their opening games, but only one would be able to continue seeking redemption after this match. The two-map series played out on Abyss and Split, where MIBR won Abyss 13-10 and Split 13-3.</p>

<p>The game kicked off on MIBR&#39;s map pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/428007/evil-geniuses-vs-mibr-champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff-lr2/?game=195811&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a>, where they continued to use their standard Ascent-esque composition versus EG&#39;s double-Controller and Vyse. The entire map was a constant back-and-forth riddled with hero plays for both sides—EG led 3-1 early on after a stunning 1v3 clutch from <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/826/supamen">
		supamen	</a>
</span>, but lost to a low buy after <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/5395/cortezia">
		cortezia	</a>
</span> pushed down mid and found a pick on <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/881/yay">
		yay	</a>
</span> to bring the scoreline back to 3-3. The half eventually ended 6-6, with EG finding some success in their site hits but often struggling to find space around the map as <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/8480/aspas">
		aspas	</a>
</span> consistently picked up first kills with the Outlaw and the Operator. </p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/826/supamen">
		supamen	</a>
</span> was the one consistent hero for EG throughout the series.</em></p>

<p>EG started strong in the second half with an eco win in round 13, shutting MIBR out and finding a 10-7 lead. However, that would be the end of their successes as MIBR bounced back with site hits and overwhelming firepower, running away with Abyss and winning it out 13-10. supamen and aspas both led the charge for their teams with 25 kills apiece, but aspas&#39; eight first kills made the difference for his side.</p>

<p>The second map went to EG&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/428007/evil-geniuses-vs-mibr-champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff-lr2/?game=195812&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>. Both sides again kept their previous compositions, with yay on Chamber and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/5957/artzin">
		artzin	</a>
</span> and aspas on Raze and Jett respectively. This time, the map was all MIBR; the Brazilian squad seemed to have a persistent read on what the opposition was trying to do at all times and had the perfect setups to shut them down. Even despite <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3104/potter">
		potter	</a>
</span> using both timeouts in the first half, EG only managed to pick up two round wins, one of them coming off of another supamen 1v3 in the fourth round.</p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/20240/xenom">
		xenom	</a>
</span> locks down B with the support of his team.</em></p>

<p>EG managed to win the second pistol to take their third round of the map, but MIBR immediately won the eco and easily closed Split out 13-3. <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/725/nzr">
		nzr	</a>
</span> led the server by rating with 1.76, 15 kills to 7 deaths, and 188 ADR. artzin&#39;s shotgun and rifle buys on top of aspas&#39; scoped weapons also added chaos to the mix as the former racked up 20 kills and 317 ACS. </p>

<p>MIBR&#39;s win sets up a heavy-hitting matchup tomorrow on Feb. 2 against LEVIATÁN, where aspas and nzr will go up against their former team. The winner will break into the top four and earn their first Championship Point of the season on top of keeping their Bangkok hopes alive. </p>
