About 21 seconds of that answer was aired in a preview of the interview on “Face the Nation.” A different seven-second part of the answer aired the next day in an episode of “60 Minutes.”</p><p>After the interview aired, Mr. Trump sued CBS in Texas, claiming that “60 Minutes” deceptively edited the interview in order to interfere with the election.</p><p>But “60 Minutes” has argued that it did nothing wrong. It’s common practice for news organizations to include an excerpt from a full interview in news articles or TV broadcasts for the sake of concision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>CBS News and the F.C.C. on Wednesday posted the interview transcript nearly simultaneously. In a statement posted on the CBS News website, the company said the transcript shows that the “60 Minutes” broadcast “was not doctored or deceitful.”</p></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-3"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/05/business/media/60-minutes-kamala-harris-interview-transcript.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/0355147ba175e694/2/output-2.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 2"/></a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“As the full transcript shows, we edited the interview to ensure that as much of the vice president’s answers to 60 Minutes’ many questions were included in our original broadcast while fairly representing those answers,” the statement added.</p><p>The F.C.C.’s chairman, Brendan Carr, had requested a transcript of the interview after a news distortion complaint was lodged with that agency. Mr. Carr has said that complaint could come up in the agency’s review of a multibillion-dollar merger of Paramount, CBS’s parent company, with Skydance, a Hollywood studio backed by the tech scion David Ellison.</p><p>Mr. Carr <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1887232039021097265" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> on Wednesday that the agency would seek public comment regarding the news distortion complaint, adding that “the people will have a chance to weigh in.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Anna M. Gomez, a Democratic commissioner on the F.C.C., said in a statement that the transcript and raw footage of the interview “provide no evidence” that CBS violated F.C.C. rules.</p><p>“Having now seen these materials, I see no reason to continue pursuing this investigation,” Ms. Gomez said. “The F.C.C. should now move to dismiss this fishing expedition to avoid further politicizing our enforcement actions.”</p><p>Executives at Paramount <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/business/media/paramount-trump-cbs-news-settlement.html" title="">have been pursuing a settlement in Mr. Trump’s lawsuit</a>, in hopes that it would improve the chances that the company could swiftly close its merger with Skydance.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s lawsuit has led to angst at CBS, where many staff members believe that any settlement would be a symbolic concession to the president and an acknowledgment of wrongdoing by “60 Minutes.” Bill Owens, the executive producer of “60 Minutes,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/business/media/cbs-news-60-minutes-trump.html" title="">said Monday</a> in a meeting with staff that he would not apologize to Mr. Trump as a part of any settlement with the network.</p><p>CBS is not the only news organization that Mr. Carr has scrutinized since Inauguration Day. Last week, Mr. Carr <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/business/media/npr-pbs-fcc-investigation.html" title="">said</a> that he had ordered the agency to investigate NPR and PBS over their use of corporate sponsorships, saying that those networks’ stations were violating rules that prohibited advertising.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>6</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>F.C.C.
