Out of the 252 current cardinals, most appointed by Francis, <a href="https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/documentation/cardinali---statistiche/dashboard-collegio-cardinalizio.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 130</a> can vote. A two-thirds majority is needed to elect a new pope, and cardinals are not allowed to leave the conclave until a successor is named, except in rare cases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Generally, a conclave must begin 15 to 20 days after the pope’s death; this one will start 16 days after Francis died. In the last conclave, in 2013, Francis was elected in two days.</p><p>The word “conclave” — from the Latin “with key” — refers to the isolation imposed on them, which is meant to keep the electoral process from dragging on. The cardinals will stay in Casa Santa Marta, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/04/international/europe/accommodations-improve-for-arriving-cardinals.html" title="">built on John Paul II’s orders</a> to replace the improvised rooming arrangements in the papal palace that had previously housed them.</p><p>During the conclave, onlookers watch a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel to learn if a new pope has been elected. If, after a vote, a two-thirds consensus has not been reached, black smoke is emitted. When a pope has been chosen, the smoke is white.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
