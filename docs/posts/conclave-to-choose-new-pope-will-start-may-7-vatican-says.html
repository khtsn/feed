The meeting, a spokesman for Vatican added, tackled the qualities the new pope must have to respond to these issues. Aside from the candidates’ positions, their age and country of origin will also factor in the deliberations, Vatican experts said.</p><p>Only about 100 of the 130 or so cardinals — those under the age of 80 — and who can vote in the secret ballot participated in the meetings, the Vatican said. Others are set to arrive in Rome in the coming days.</p><p>A two-thirds majority is needed to elect a new pope, and cardinals are not allowed to leave the conclave until a successor is named, except in rare cases.</p><p>Generally, a conclave must begin 15 to 20 days after the pope’s death; this one will start 16 days after Francis died. In 2013, Francis was elected in two days.</p><p>May 7 was chosen in part because it would allow enough time for preparations, Matteo Bruni, the Vatican’s spokesman, said during a news conference. Making arrangements for the gathering in the Sistine Chapel, which includes installing the burners in which the ballots will be burned after each round of voting, will now begin, Mr. Bruni added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>During the conclave, onlookers outside watch a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel to learn if a new pope has been elected. If a consensus has not been reached after a vote, black smoke is emitted. When a pope has been chosen, the smoke is white.</p><p>On May 7, the day will start with a Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica, after which cardinals will enter the Sistine Chapel to vote.</p><p>The word “conclave” — from the Latin “with key” — refers to the isolation imposed on them, which is meant to keep the electoral process from dragging on.</p><p>Most of the cardinals will stay in Casa Santa Marta, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/04/international/europe/accommodations-improve-for-arriving-cardinals.html" title="">built on Pope John Paul II’s orders</a> to replace the improvised rooming arrangements in the papal palace that had previously housed them. But since Francis named many more cardinals than his two predecessors, some have questioned whether there will be enough room for everyone.</p><p>Mr. Bruni did not seem worried. “No one will be left on the street,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/roman-catholic-church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/pope-francis">Pope Francis</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Pope Francis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Unpublished Writings by Francis: </strong>In a foreword to a book, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/us/pope-francis-unpublished-writing.html">he articulated the church’s position on marriage.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Will Francis Be Made a Saint?:</strong> Three of the five popes before Francis have become saints, but merely serving as pontiff is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/world/europe/pope-francis-saint-canonization.html">no longer a guarantee of canonization</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Faithful Descend on St. Peter’s Square:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/world/europe/pope-francis-funeral-st-peters-square.html">Cardinals, royals and heads of state attended Francis’s funeral</a>.
