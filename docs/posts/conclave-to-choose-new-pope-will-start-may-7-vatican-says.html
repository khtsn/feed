    <h1>Conclave to Choose New Pope Will Start May 7, Vatican Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A conclave to elect the next pope will start on May 7, the Vatican said on Monday. Scores of cardinals gathered to decide when cardinal-electors will meet in the Sistine Chapel to vote for a successor to Pope Francis, who died last week at 88.</p><p>Only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/24/archives/voting-for-popes-is-barred-to-cardinals-over-80-prelates-over-80.html" title="">cardinals under the age of 80</a> are eligible to vote in the secret ballot. Out of the 252 current cardinals, most appointed by Francis, <a href="https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/documentation/cardinali---statistiche/dashboard-collegio-cardinalizio.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over 130</a> can vote. A two-thirds majority is needed to elect a new pope, and cardinals are not allowed to leave the conclave until a successor is named, except in rare cases.</p><p>Generally, the conclave must begin 15 to 20 days after the popeâ€™s death. In the last conclave, Francis was elected in two days.</p><p>During the conclave, onlookers watch a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel to know if a new pope has been elected. If, after a vote, a two-thirds consensus has not been reached, black smoke is emitted. When a pope has been chosen, the smoke is white.</p></div></div>
