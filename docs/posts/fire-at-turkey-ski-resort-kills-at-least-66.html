It was not clear how many children were among the dead, but a number were reported by acquaintances.</p><p>The cause of the fire was unclear.</p><p>Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc <a href="https://x.com/yilmaztunc/status/1881692574185877924" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that six prosecutors had been assigned to investigate the blaze and that four people, including the hotel’s owner, had been detained.</p><p>The fire broke out before dawn in the Grand Kartal Hotel in Kartalkaya, 180 miles east of Istanbul, sending large flames from the windows and thick smoke billowing from the roof.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>About 230 guests were believed to be in the hotel at the time, in addition to a number of employees. Some survivors told the Turkish news media of terrifying escapes, exacerbated by a lack of fire alarms or clear fire escapes.</p><p>“The smoke was so intense that we could hardly breathe,” Eylem Senturk, who was vacationing at the hotel with her family, told the state-run Anadolu news agency.</p><p>She and her daughter raced downstairs to an exit, but the smoke was too intense for her husband, she said, so he jumped from a window onto a lower rooftop and then onto a car to reach the ground.</p><p>Ms. Senturk said she had not heard a fire alarm, but realized that the building was burning when she heard people shouting in the hallway and opened the door to see smoke. She did not see any fire escapes, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“If there had been a fire alarm, we could have been faster,” she said. “The lack of a fire alarm and fire escape trapped people.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/21/multimedia/turkey-fire-tfjh/turkey-fire-tfjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/21/multimedia/turkey-fire-tfjh/turkey-fire-tfjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/21/multimedia/turkey-fire-tfjh/turkey-fire-tfjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Several people in firefighting suits and helmets stand inside a charred building." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/21/multimedia/turkey-fire-tfjh/turkey-fire-tfjh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/21/multimedia/turkey-fire-tfjh/turkey-fire-tfjh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/21/multimedia/turkey-fire-tfjh/turkey-fire-tfjh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/21/multimedia/turkey-fire-tfjh/turkey-fire-tfjh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/45c59be0-8c77-5b26-b875-4be039bcb1eb" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dozens of rescuers and fire trucks rushed to the site from surrounding towns.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mert Gokhan Koc/dia Photo, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Another survivor, Muzaffer Cig, also told Anadolu that there was no fire escape. “As there was no fire escape, we ran down the staircase,” he said.</p><p>Speaking to reporters at the scene, Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said that the hotel had been inspected in 2021 and 2024 and was found to have the necessary fire precautions. He also said the building had two fire escapes.</p><p>But no external escapes are visible in aerial footage of the building broadcast on Turkish television after the fire.</p><p>The dozens of deaths in a building surrounded by snow-capped peaks where families had gone expecting good times prompted calls for accountability, but such calls after past disasters have not gone far.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>After powerful earthquakes killed more than 50,000 people in southern Turkey in early 2023, survivors and engineers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/world/middleeast/turkish-builders-come-under-intense-scrutiny-over-shoddy-construction.html" title="">accused contractors and government inspectors</a> of failing to ensure compliance with building codes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/11/world/europe/turkey-earthquake-apartment-building-collapse.html" title="">increasing the death toll</a>. Nearly two years later, however, few people have been held accountable.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The fire on Tuesday started at around 3:30 a.m., when most hotel occupants were asleep, according to news reports. In an effort to evacuate, some strung bedsheets together to make a rope that they used to descend to a lower floor, <a href="https://www.iha.com.tr/video-kartalkayada-otelde-yanginda-can-pazari-yangindan-kurtulmak-icin-carsafla-camdan-boyle-sarktilar" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video footage showed</a>.</p><p>Dozens of rescuers and fire trucks rushed to the site from surrounding towns.</p><p>“When I left my room, I saw the flames at the fourth floor, the floor of the restaurant,” Necmi Kepcetutan, a ski instructor who also worked at the hotel, told the NTV network. “Then it started to swarm the hotel. We helped around a dozen or more people to evacuate, since we know the hotel very well.”</p><p>“People were screaming to be rescued,” he added.</p><p>Two people — a guest and a hotel employee — died after jumping from the building, the area’s governor, Abdulaziz Aydin, told Anadolu.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The fire took place on the same day that an explosion injured four people at another Turkish ski resort, in the central province of Sivas, its governor’s office said <a href="http://www.sivas.gov.tr/basin-aciklamasi-yildiz-dagi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a>.</p><p>The reason for the explosion was unclear.
