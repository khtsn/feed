Read more about this project in a </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/opinion/what-to-eat-on-a-burning-planet.html" title=""><em>note</em></a><em> from Eliza Barclay, Opinion’s climate editor.</em></p><p>“Industrial agriculture” is a phrase used to signify “bad,” evoking toxic chemicals, monoculture crops, confined animals, the death of the small family farm and all kinds of images people don’t like to associate with their food. Factory farms are a constant target of environmentalists, documentarians, animal rights activists, spiritual leaders like Pope Francis and the Indian mystic Sadhguru, and leftist politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders.</p><p>Even the manosphere podcaster Joe Rogan has called for banning them, while Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald Trump’s pick for health secretary, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/rfk-jr-corn-trump.html" title="">has blamed</a> industrial agriculture for making us sick and fat. The United Nations has pointed out that it does $3 trillion in damage to the global environment a year.</p><p>Agriculture in general does have real environmental downsides. It’s the leading driver of water pollution and shortages, deforestation and biodiversity loss. It generates <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-ghg-emissions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one-fourth</a> of the greenhouse gases that heat up the planet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And it’s eating the earth. It has already overrun about <a href="https://www.fao.org/sustainability/news/detail/en/c/1274219/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two of every five acres</a> of land on the planet, and farmers are on track to clear an additional <a href="https://www.wri.org/research/global-land-squeeze-managing-growing-competition-land" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dozen</a> Californias worth of forest by 2050. That would be a disaster for nature and the climate, because the carbon dioxide released by converting wild landscapes into farms and pastures is already the most damaging source of agricultural emissions, worse than methane from cow burps or nitrous oxide from fertilizer.</p><p>But industrial agriculture in particular has one real upside: It produces enormous amounts of food on relatively modest amounts of land. And that will be agriculture’s most vital job in the coming decades. The world will need even more enormous amounts of food by 2050, about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=108060#:~:text=Under%20medium%20population%20growth%2C%20production,calories%20from%20a%202011%20baseline." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">50 percent more calories</a> to adequately feed nearly 10 billion people. The inconvenient truth is that factory farms are the best hope for producing the food we will need without obliterating what’s left of our natural treasures and vaporizing their carbon into the atmosphere.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
