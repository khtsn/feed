The number of burglaries, robberies, car thefts and larcenies also dropped in 2024, Commissioner Tisch and Mayor Eric Adams said during a news conference.</p><p>But two crime categories — sexual assaults and felony assaults, a major crime category defined as an attack in which a dangerous weapon is used or a serious injury results — continued to buck the trend. There were 29,417 felony assaults last year, the highest number in at least 24 years and a 5 percent increase from 2023.</p><p>For the mayor, the decline in several major crime categories was an opportunity to tout his policies at a time when he is trying to persuade New Yorkers to re-elect him, even as he faces criminal prosecution and a perception that the leadership of the Police Department descended into dysfunction under his watch.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I was clear from Day 1, not only on the campaign trail, but when I became mayor, the prerequisite to our prosperity is public safety, and I was committed to driving down crime,” Mayor Adams said. “We’re the safest big city in America. The numbers are clear.”</p><p>The department said it had received 1,748 complaints of sexual assault, nearly half of which were connected to domestic violence incidents, Commissioner Tisch said.</p><p>The number of rapes was the highest since 2020, though it was slightly lower than in 2019, when the department received 1,771 complaints of sexual assault, according to department figures. About a quarter of the rapes reported last year occurred in the Bronx.</p><p>The announcement of a drop in crime comes as headlines have been dominated by terrifying incidents, such as the killing of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/nyregion/woman-set-on-fire-debrina-kawam.html" title="">Debrina Kawam,</a> a 57-year-old woman who was burned to death on the F train three days before Christmas, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtpNeGTXkA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the shooting of 10 people outside a club in Queens on New Year’s Day.</a> Mr. Adams acknowledged on Monday that reporting a drop in most crime categories may not comfort many New Yorkers who are fearful of being randomly attacked on the subway or on the street.</p><p>“These high-profile random acts of violence have overshadowed our success,” he said. “We have to deal with the perception.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Commissioner Tisch, whom Mayor Adams appointed on Nov. 20, said she had issued an order for 200 officers to patrol the city’s trains. More officers will be deployed to subway platforms in the 50 highest-crime stations in the city, she said.</p><p>“We know that 78 percent of transit crime occurs on trains and on platforms, and that is quite obviously where our officers need to be,” Commissioner Tisch said. “This is just the beginning.”</p><p>Mayor Adams said that kind of presence “will allow New Yorkers to feel the omnipresence” of the police “and feel safe.”</p><p>The number of sexual assaults was down during the first part of 2024 but began to rise later in the year. Commissioner Tisch attributed that increase in part to a rise in the number of sexual assaults connected to domestic violence incidents and a change in state law in September that expanded the definition of what constitutes rape.</p><p><a href="https://nyassembly.gov/Press/?sec=story&amp;story=108933" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Under the law,</a> the definition was expanded from strictly vaginal penetration by a penis to include acts of oral, anal and vaginal penetration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Felony assaults have been persistently high since 2020, however. </p><p>Commissioner Tisch pointed to recidivism, citing police figures that showed a large increase in the number of people arrested three times for the same crime.</p><p>Mayor Adams cited mental health as a factor in many of these crimes. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/29/nyregion/nyc-mentally-ill-involuntary-custody.html" title="">has directed the police and emergency medical workers to hospitalize people</a> they deemed too mentally ill to care for themselves, even if they did not pose a danger to others.</p><p>On Monday, he broached that issue again as he pointed to recent random acts of violence committed by people who appeared to have “severe mental health issues.”</p><p>“The many cases of people being pushed on the subway tracks, of women being punched in the face,” he said, “it’s the same profile.”</p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/new-york-city/new-york-governor-mental-health-laws-violence-subway/6093302/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has called on state legislators to pass a law</a> that would allow hospitals to force more people into mental health treatment. Mayor Adams supports that plan, though the New York Civil Liberties Union said it <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/press-release/nyclu-on-gov-hochul-push-to-increase-involuntary-commitments" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“threatens New Yorkers’ rights and liberties.”</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Christopher Herrmann, an associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that while mental health is an important factor, other societal ills can drive felony assault numbers up.</p><p>“Is it housing insecurity? Are there food shortages? Is it the economy? We need to consider all of it,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Herrmann said crimes like assaults and robberies are the type “that really fuel public fear.”</p><p>“It’s just more of a reason we’ve got to get those numbers under control,” he said.</p><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Cramer is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and crime in the city and surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-cramer">More about Maria Cramer</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
