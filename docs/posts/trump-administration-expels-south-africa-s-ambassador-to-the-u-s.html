    <h1>Trump Administration Expels South Africa’s Ambassador to the U.S.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first indication of Mr. Rasool’s fate came as Secretary of State Marco Rubio flew back from the Group of 7 allies meeting in Canada on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Rubio wrote <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1900655283380146267" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> that South Africa’s ambassador was a “race-baiting politician who hates America” and Mr. Trump. He added, “We have nothing to discuss with him and so he is considered PERSONA NON GRATA.” That designation requires South Africa to end Mr. Rasool’s role as ambassador.</p><p>Mr. Rubio made his comments above a repost of an article from Breitbart, a right-leaning news site, about remarks Mr. Rasool made on Friday via video link to an institute in Johannesburg. The article quoted Mr. Rasool as saying Mr. Trump was leading a “supremacist” movement against “the incumbency, those who are in power,” in South Africa.</p><p>The <a href="https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> says a host country “may at any time and without having to explain its decision” declare “any member” of a diplomatic mission to be persona non grata, which is Latin for an unwelcome individual. The convention states that in case of such a designation, “the sending state shall, as appropriate, either recall the person concerned or terminate his functions with the mission.”</p><p>Mr. Rubio <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1887288685517021298" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declined last month</a> to attend a meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 20 nations, criticizing the South African hosts for having a focus of the meeting be on “solidarity, equality and sustainability.” Other countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/africa/south-africa-g20-rubio.html?" title="">did not follow Mr. Rubio’s boycott</a>. </p></div></div>
