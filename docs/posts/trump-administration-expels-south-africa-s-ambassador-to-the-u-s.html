The move comes during a low point in the relationship between the two countries, with Mr. Trump having accused Mr. Ramaphosa’s government of discriminating against South Africa’s white minority and siding with one of America’s enemies, Iran.</p><p>A statement from Mr. Ramaphosa’s office called for “the established diplomatic decorum” to be maintained.</p><p>“South Africa remains committed to building a mutually beneficial relationship with the United States of America,” the statement said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The first indication of Mr. Rasool’s fate came as Secretary of State Marco Rubio flew back from the Group of 7 allies meeting in Canada on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Rubio wrote <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1900655283380146267" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> that South Africa’s ambassador was a “race-baiting politician who hates America” and Mr. Trump. He added, “We have nothing to discuss with him and so he is considered PERSONA NON GRATA.” That designation requires South Africa to end Mr. Rasool’s role as ambassador.</p><p>Mr. Rubio made his comments above a repost of an article from Breitbart, a right-leaning news site, about remarks Mr. Rasool made on Friday via video link to an institute in Johannesburg. The article quoted Mr. Rasool as saying Mr. Trump was leading a “supremacist” movement against “the incumbency, those who are in power,” in South Africa.</p><p>The <a href="https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> says a host country “may at any time and without having to explain its decision” declare “any member” of a diplomatic mission to be persona non grata, which is Latin for an unwelcome individual. The convention states that in case of such a designation, “the sending state shall, as appropriate, either recall the person concerned or terminate his functions with the mission.”</p><p>Mr. Rubio <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1887288685517021298" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declined last month</a> to attend a meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 20 nations, criticizing the South African hosts for having a focus of the meeting be on “solidarity, equality and sustainability.” Other countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/africa/south-africa-g20-rubio.html?" title="">did not follow Mr. Rubio’s boycott</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/trump-south-africa-aid-white-landowners.html" title="">signed an executive order</a> last month prioritizing the resettlement in the United States of Afrikaners, a white minority ethnic group in South Africa that descended from European colonizers. Mr. Trump referred to them as “victims of unjust racial discrimination,” falsely claiming that the South African government had seized their land. Mr. Trump’s order came after South Africa’s president had signed a new land reform bill into law.</p><p>Mr. Trump also ordered the federal government to cut off all aid to South Africa.</p><p>Despite the hostility with the White House, Mr. Ramaphosa has said that he wants to repair the relationship and maintain strong ties with the United States, which is South Africa’s second-largest trading partner. His government has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/africa/south-africa-trump-trade.html" title="">preparing a trade proposal</a> to offer to Mr. Trump that it hopes will convince him that a relationship with South Africa would benefit America.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Eligon is the Johannesburg bureau chief for The Times, covering a wide range of events and trends that influence and shape the lives of ordinary people across southern Africa.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-eligon">More about John Eligon</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Congress Cedes Power:</strong> On spending, oversight and other issues, Republican lawmakers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-republicans-congress-power.html">willingly turned over their constitutional powers</a> over to the Trump White House.</p></li><li><p><strong>Obscure Laws, ICE Agents and Fear:</strong> President Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trump-crackdown-dissent.html">clamping down broadly on dissent</a> using the tools of the federal government.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Big Bet:</strong> President Trump’s simultaneous trade wars with Canada, Mexico, China and the European Union amount to a huge economic and political gamble: that Americans will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-manufacturing-economy-risk.html">endure months or years of economic pain</a> in return for the distant hope of re-industrializing the American heartland.</p></li><li><p><strong>Birthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court:</strong> Trump administration lawyers have asked the justices to lift a nationwide pause on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-birthright-citizenship-supreme-court.html">the president’s order ending birthright citizenship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shake-Up at the I.R.S.:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-irs-lawyer-doge.html">replaced the top lawyer at the Internal Revenue Service</a>, a move that came as officials sought to gain access to the agency’s data.</p></li><li><p><strong>E.P.A.: </strong>Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/climate/epa-zeldin-rollbacks-pollution.html">reframed the purpose of the E.P.A</a>., saying his agency’s mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel Ban:</strong> The fate of thousands of Afghans waiting to reach the United States after serving with American troops was thrown into limbo after Trump took office.
