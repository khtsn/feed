    <h1>Steak Fries: Deservedly Reviled or Underappreciated Edible Spoon?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Steak fries. Two words, so promising apart, so dreadful together.</p><p>Plank-like in shape and wan in complexion, they sit uncomfortably between genus “fry” and genus “baked potato,” lacking the crunch of the former and the richness of the latter. So totally have they lost the war for the American palette that every encounter with a steak fry is like meeting a Visigoth.</p><p>One gapes and wonders, how are you still here?</p><p>That question sprang to mind during a recent visit to <a href="https://parkavekitchenbydb.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Park Ave Kitchen by David Burke</a>, a Midtown restaurant that, despite the name, is on Lexington Avenue. Steak fries are rarely spotted these days at upscale venues, and Park Ave Kitchen has a considered, of-the-moment menu, with entrees like bison short ribs and black sea bass tikka masala.</p><p>“I noticed them two weeks ago,” said the owner David Burke, on the phone one recent afternoon. “I was at the restaurant and I said, ‘What’s with the steak fries?’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02fd-steak-fries2-wckt/31fd-steak-fries2-wckt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02fd-steak-fries2-wckt/31fd-steak-fries2-wckt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02fd-steak-fries2-wckt/31fd-steak-fries2-wckt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A chef in a New York Rangers cap and a black apron tosses steak fries with various accompaniments in a steel prep bowl." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02fd-steak-fries2-wckt/31fd-steak-fries2-wckt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02fd-steak-fries2-wckt/31fd-steak-fries2-wckt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02fd-steak-fries2-wckt/31fd-steak-fries2-wckt-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 683w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02fd-steak-fries2-wckt/31fd-steak-fries2-wckt-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1366w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/e20784b1-5b37-52c6-a673-e88e641ca9fd" decoding="async" width="600" height="900"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Park Avenue Kitchen by David Burke, the chef William Lustberg put steak fries with copious trimmings on the menu.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Heather Willensky for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He had originally posed the question to Park Ave Kitchen’s chef, William Lustberg, but rather than paraphrase his answer, Mr. Burke suggested we get the guy on the phone.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Thirty seconds later, Mr. Lustberg had joined the call.</p><p>“They’re just not as common any more and I think they should be,” he said, sounding anything but defensive. “I would love to be part of bringing back steak fries.”</p><p>That’s going to be a chore. The U.S. market for French fries <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/north-america-french-fries-market-A05950" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is expected to reach $10 billion next year</a>, and on the list of favorite variants — there are <a href="https://www.foodrepublic.com/1526614/different-types-french-fries-explained/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least 30</a> — steak fries rank at or near the bottom, way behind the ubiquitous <a href="https://www.lambweston.com/products/32l.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">straight cuts</a>, crinkle cuts and waffle cuts. Among wholesale distributors, they command a mere 2 percent of the total fry market by pound, according to Circana, a market research company.</p><p>This is a product long past its heyday. Steak fries were a staple of chains like the <a href="https://www.groundround.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ground Round</a>, a Howard Johnson’s offshoot and children’s party mecca beloved for a menu overstuffed with mid-price American fare as well as its free peanuts, the shells of which could be tossed on the floor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Park Avenue Kitchen fries come with bacon, shishito peppers and several other accompaniments. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Heather Willensky for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Ground Round filed for bankruptcy in 2004 and its intellectual property rights were purchased in 2023 by the husband and wife team of Joe and Nachi Shea. The couple are about to open a Ground Round in Shrewsbury, Ma., and the logo and color scheme are back, as is ice cream in miniature baseball helmets. The peanuts are gone. So are the steak fries.</p><p>“Honestly, it wasn’t even a consideration,” said Joe Shea in a phone interview. “We are really engaged with our guests and we’ve been doing polling and asked, ‘What would you like to see on the menu?’ And not a single person mentioned steak fries.”</p><p>The sinking profile of steak fries is, in part, a matter of economics, said Neil Doherty, senior director of global culinary strategy at Sysco, the food supply giant. Because of their bulk, steak fries don’t cover the plate very well, which means the appearance of a hearty serving costs more. Steak fries also have what he called “poor hold time,” a polite way of saying they get soggy fast and must be tossed out sooner.</p><p>New fry varieties have debuted in recent years, pushing steak fries even further down the list. Sysco alone has created red battered jumbo crinkle cuts and something called <a href="https://foodie.sysco.com/january-2025-new-cutting-edge-solutions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imperial swirl fries</a>, which have a “distinctive ‘lock washer’ shape,” according to the company’s website.</p><p>Then there’s the matter of tastes, which have evolved from the era when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/dining/christmas-prime-rib.html" title="">prime rib and baked potatoes</a> were a standard pairing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The steak fry was perfect for people in the ’70s and ’80s who really liked that potato feel,” said Mr. Doherty. </p><p>When steak fries turn up in restaurants today it often feels as though management forgot to think about which fry to serve.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>With a lower ratio of crisp to creamy, steak fries have trailed their skinny cousins in popularity.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jimena Peck for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But look hard enough, and pockets of hardcore steak fry partisans can be found around the country. In Cheyenne, Wyo., there’s <a href="https://www.2doorsdown.net/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2 Doors Down</a>. When it opened in 2009, the owner and operator, Jerry Inniss, asked two French fry distributors to audition their wares, and issued a special instruction. Bring steak fries and nothing else.</p><p>Mostly, he wanted to stand out with a unique offering, he said. Before opening, he spent two weeks in a kitchen, devising what he calls a proprietary mix of spices. He won’t discuss it, other than to say it’s reddish brown in hue and that diners often ask for a side order of it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“They might want to add it to their burger,” he said. “They might be taking it home to season other things. I don’t know.”</p><p>A bottomless order of these fries costs $5.25, and Mr. Inniss sells a ton and a half of them a week. They have become a menu centerpiece, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-fries-from-every-state-2016-7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anointed Wyoming’s best fries</a> by Business Insider in 2016 and regularly winning the Wyoming Tribune Eagle’s “Best of the Best” plaque for fries.</p><p>For sheer steak fry ardor, though, there’s no beating <a href="https://www.redrobin.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Red Robin</a>, the national burger chain, based in Greenwood, Colo. The company operates and franchises nearly 500 restaurants in the United States and Canada, and every one of them is avidly waving the steak fry banner. Three people in the company’s product development kitchen spend much of their day conceiving new sauces in which to dunk those fries.</p><p>Not all of them leave the test area.</p><p>“We tried beer cheese and barbecue sauce and burnt ends, on steak fries,” said Andrew Birkbeck, a Red Robin culinary product developer. “Didn’t work.”</p><p>Mr. Birkbeck was standing in the kitchen of the Red Robin in Secaucus, N.J., at 10 a.m. one recent Saturday. He’d flown in from Colorado to fry up a batch of steak fries and show off the chain’s most popular sauces. He fried them for five minutes in soybean oil and then threw them in a basket and carried them to a table in the dining room, where he had set up a flight of sauces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The key to a successful steak fry presentation is sauces and other fixings.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jimena Peck for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“All right, starting here, this is our signature Whiskey River BBQ sauce,” he said, going clockwise around a small plate. “Next to it, that is our sweet and spicy ketchup that we make in house. Has cayenne, garlic, sugar and vinegar in it. Then we have our campfire mayo, which is barbecue sauce and mayonnaise, then our housemade ranch dressing, and finally our poppy seed honey mustard.”</p><p>Dunk a salted, fried potato in these sauces and your head will spin, blissfully. Amid this riot of flavor, the upside of a steak fry becomes obvious. It is basically a sauce delivery vehicle, an edible spoon. Serving steak fries with nothing more than salt and pepper misunderstands their purpose and highest, best use.</p><p>Maybe the steak fry never failed us. Maybe we failed the steak fry.</p><p>Exactly, said Mr. Lustberg, the chef, one evening in mid March back at Park Ave Kitchen. Wearing chef’s whites and a New York Rangers cap, he was seated in front of a silver serving pan filled with $18 Midtown hipster fries, as the restaurant calls them.</p><p>He had nostalgia in mind when he added steak fries to the menu in January, but this dish is squarely in the more-is-better school of contemporary cooking. The fries are buried under Camembert, grated Parmesan, charred shishito peppers, parsley, chile oil and bacon cured with maple syrup.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“And those are slices of preserved lemon,” he said, with evident pride, “because you need some bits of acidity.”</p><p>This ensemble of ingredients proves that as a solo act, steak fries are decidedly underwhelming. In a symphony, they shine.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Segal is a business reporter for The Times, based in New York.<span> </span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Food and Dining</h2><h3>Keep tabs on dining trends, restaurant reviews and recipes.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>‘Yes, Chef,’ You Say?</strong>: The phrase has become popular in casual conversation thanks to “The Bear,” and offers a lens into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/business/yes-chef-french-brigade-system.html">shifting hierarchies in kitchens</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Is the Doggy Bag Dead?:</strong> Restaurateurs are noticing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/dining/restaurant-leftovers.html">that </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/dining/restaurant-leftovers.html">diners seem increasingly uninterested</a> in taking home leftovers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Making Eggs Count</strong>: With prices continuing to rise, <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/article/how-to-cook-breakfast-less-eggs">here are five tips to stretch those precious orbs of protein</a> in the morning.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Eating in New York City</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>The End of Dimes Square?</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/dining/dimes-square.html">One denied permit for sidewalk seating</a> has raised questions about the future of the downtown destination for hip, young New Yorkers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ha’s Snack Bar</strong>: The new Manhattan restaurant has plans to scale up, but it’s already turning heads with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/dining/has-snack-bar-review.html">freewheeling takes on French and Vietnamese flavors</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>If You Have to Ask, You Aren’t Invited</strong>: In New York, members-only clubs and private restaurants have become powerhouses for socializing and networking. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/nyregion/harlem-dinner-parties-nyc-chefs-alexander-smalls.html">But there are some spaces you can’t buy your way into</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>New York’s Finest</strong>: From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-nyc-pizza-pizzeria.html">pizza</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-bagels-nyc.html">bagels</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-nyc-sandwiches.html">sandwiches</a>, we’re searching all five boroughs for the food that defines the city.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
