    <h1>Who Is Massad Boulos, the Lebanese American Tycoon and Trump Adviser?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Born in Lebanon, Mr. Boulos hails from an influential Greek Orthodox family from the northern Lebanese town of Kafaraka, known for its olive oil. The family has played a role in local and national politics for nearly a century.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://elmarada.org/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84%D8%B3-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%88%D9%81-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B4%D8%AD-%D9%88%D8%A3%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%A7/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brief forays</a> into Lebanese politics himself, Mr. Boulos has said he is not affiliated with any political party inside the country, according to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tiffany-trump-father-law-political-ties-lebanon-hezbollah-1967352" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Newsweek</a>. He is considered, however, to have close ties to the country’s Christian elite, and has <a href="https://www.aljadeed.tv/news/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA/342498/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%AC%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%89-%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labeled himself</a> as a friend of Suleiman Frangieh, who has previously been named by Hezbollah leaders as the group’s top pick for Lebanon’s president, and is closely allied with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.</p><p>The United States has labeled Hezbollah, both a militia and a political party, as a terrorist group, and Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p><p>Mr. Boulos did not respond to a request for an interview.</p><p>After studying in Texas, Mr. Boulos went on to build his wealth in West Africa. He became the chief executive officer of SCOA Nigeria, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/SCOA:NL?embedded-checkout=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an automotive conglomerate</a>. He also runs Boulos Enterprises, a Nigeria-based <a href="https://www.boulos.ng/about-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">company</a> that distributes and assembles motorcycles, tricycles and power bikes.</p><p>Mr. Boulos’s ascendancy from businessman to a close confidant of Mr. Trump has landed a diverse portfolio on his desk. In September, when Mr. Boulos had been busy campaigning in Michigan for Mr. Trump, he also met with Mr. Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. At the time, Mr. Boulos <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/middleeast/trump-palestinians-abbas-gaza-war.html" title="">told The Times</a> the meeting was “purely personal,” though Palestinian officials described it as part of an outreach effort to Mr. Trump. Mr. Boulos had previously helped deliver a letter from Mr. Abbas to Mr. Trump in July, in which Mr. Abbas wished Mr. Trump well after an assassination attempt against him that month.</p></div></div>
