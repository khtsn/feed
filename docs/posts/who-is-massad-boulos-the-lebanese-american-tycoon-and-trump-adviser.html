Trump’s selection of Massad Boulos as a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs may put Mr. Boulos, an automotive tycoon who is also Mr. Trump’s in-law, in a position to exert considerable influence over U.S. policy in the Middle East.</p><p>Mr. Boulos, whose son is married to Mr. Trump’s daughter Tiffany, was picked by Mr. Trump on Sunday for a role that could prove pivotal as the Trump administration faces myriad crises in the region: a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/middleeast/lebanon-israel-ceasefire-hezbollah.html" title="">tenuous cease-fire</a> in Mr. Boulos’s native Lebanon; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/unrwa-aid-gaza.html" title="">a humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip</a>; and a civil war in Syria, mostly dormant for years, that has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/middleeast/syria-war-aleppo-rebels-government.html" title="">rapidly escalated</a> in recent days.</p><p>For Mr. Boulos, once a relatively obscure entrepreneur, his appointment followed a meteoric rise to prominence in recent months.</p><p>During the election campaign, he helped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-arab-american-jews.html" title="">garner support</a> for Mr. Trump among Arab Americans in Michigan, a key battleground state. He has become a familiar face on Lebanese television, spreading the incoming Trump administration’s message. And he has acted as something of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/middleeast/trump-palestinians-abbas-gaza-war.html" title="">de facto liaison</a> between Mr. Trump and Middle Eastern leaders, including Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Born in Lebanon, Mr. Boulos hails from an influential Greek Orthodox family from the northern Lebanese town of Kafaraka, known for its olive oil.

He is considered, however, to have close ties to the country’s Christian elite, and has <a href="https://www.aljadeed.tv/news/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA/342498/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%AC%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%89-%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labeled himself</a> as a friend of Suleiman Frangieh, who has previously been named by Hezbollah leaders as the group’s top pick for Lebanon’s president, and is closely allied with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.</p><p>The United States has labeled Hezbollah, both a militia and a political party, as a terrorist group, and Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p><p>Mr. Boulos did not respond to a request for an interview.</p><p>After studying in Texas, Mr. Boulos went on to build his wealth in West Africa. He became the chief executive officer of SCOA Nigeria, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/SCOA:NL?embedded-checkout=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an automotive conglomerate</a>. He also runs Boulos Enterprises, a Nigeria-based <a href="https://www.boulos.ng/about-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">company</a> that distributes and assembles motorcycles, tricycles and power bikes.</p><p>Mr. Boulos’s ascendancy from businessman to a close confidant of Mr. Trump has landed a diverse portfolio on his desk. In September, when Mr. Boulos had been busy campaigning in Michigan for Mr. Trump, he also met with Mr. Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. At the time, Mr. Boulos <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/middleeast/trump-palestinians-abbas-gaza-war.html" title="">told The Times</a> the meeting was “purely personal,” though Palestinian officials described it as part of an outreach effort to Mr. Trump. Mr. Boulos had previously helped deliver a letter from Mr. Abbas to Mr. Trump in July, in which Mr. Abbas wished Mr. Trump well after an assassination attempt against him that month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>After Mr. Trump announced he had selected Mr. Boulos as a senior adviser, some politicians in Lebanon suggested the appointment may elevate the issues facing the crisis-hit country on the White House agenda.</p><p>Lebanon’s caretaker economy minister, Amin Salam, said the appointment was a “historic opportunity,” noting in a post on social media on Sunday that Lebanon and the wider Arab world “have never been closer to the White House and the center of decision-making than they are today.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Euan Ward is a reporter contributing to The Times from Beirut.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward">More about Euan Ward</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Transition: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Targeting the N.I.H.:</strong> The National Institutes of Health has been called “the crown jewel of the federal government.” But when President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans take charge, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/health/nih-trump-kennedy-bhattacharya.html">the agency may face a reckoning</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Support for Patel:</strong> Several Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/trump-kash-patel-fbi-republicans.html">fell in line</a> behind Trump’s plan to choose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/politics/kash-patel.html">Kash Patel</a> to lead the F.B.I., defending the president-elect’s right to install a loyalist who has vowed to exact revenge on Trump’s adversaries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Roles for In-Laws:</strong> Trump tapped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/trump-massad-boulos-middle-east.html">Massad Boulos</a>, the father-in-law of his daughter Tiffany, as a senior adviser covering Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.
