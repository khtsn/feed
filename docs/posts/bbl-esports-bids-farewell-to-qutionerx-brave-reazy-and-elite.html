Today, we gave one to my colleague Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court.</p><blockquote><p><em>What scenario could lead to the presidential race being contested where the Supreme Court of the United States would get involved? — Stephanie, Calabasas, CA.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Adam:</strong> There are countless ways in which the outcome of the election could effectively be decided by the Supreme Court, but almost all of them hinge on three factors in combination: a very tight race in one or more battleground states that could determine the national result where voting procedures are open to plausible legal challenge.</p><p>All those factors were present in Bush v. Gore, the 2000 decision that delivered the presidency to George W. Bush. They may recur this year, but that is hardly certain, as the 2020 election demonstrated. That year, in a brisk and dismissive order, the Supreme Court refused to throw out the results in four battleground states that Donald Trump had lost. There is little reason to think the court is eager to get involved this year, either.</p><p>Indeed, some justices may be reminded of the election administrator’s prayer: “Lord, let this election not be close.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/2024-election-questions.html" title="">You can send us your questions here</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At its core, the case was about whether the Clean Water Act of 1972 allowed the E.P.A. to impose generic prohibitions on waste water released into the Pacific Ocean and to penalize the city.
