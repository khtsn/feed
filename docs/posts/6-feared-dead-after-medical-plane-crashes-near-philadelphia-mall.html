The patient had been treated at Shriners Children’s in Philadelphia, the hospital’s spokesman, Mel Bower, said in a statement.</p><p>Mexico’s <a href="https://x.com/SRE_mx/status/1885542363684348160" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foreign Ministry said</a> that all six people on the plane were Mexican nationals.</p><p>Several people injured in connection with the crash were taken to Temple Health, said Jennifer Reardon, a spokeswoman for the hospital. Three were released after treatment, and three others remained hospitalized, she said, without elaborating on whether they had been on the plane or on the ground.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The plane had a planned stop in Missouri for fuel before its final destination, Tijuana International Airport, Mr. Gold said. He added that he would not release any names until family members were notified.</p><p>Mr. Gold said that based on the intensity of the crash and the debris field, “We are doubtful that there are any survivors.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Emergency workers at the scene of a plane crash in Northeast Philadelphia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matt Rourke/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The plane took off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport and was en route to Springfield-Branson National Airport in Missouri when it crashed, the <a href="https://x.com/FAANews/status/1885490090878607836" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Aviation Administration said</a>. It crashed about three miles away about 6 p.m. near Cottman and Bustleton Avenues, across from the Roosevelt Mall, the local authorities said.</p><p>“Several dwellings and vehicles were impacted,” Mayor Cherelle Parker of Philadelphia said at a news conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>She told residents not to touch anything that looked like debris and to stay inside if possible. Shelter was being provided for residents at Samuel Fels High School, about two miles from the crash site, she added.</p><p>It is unclear why the plane crashed. The jet plummeted to the ground within a minute of takeoff, <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/medevac-learjet-55-crashes-near-philadelphia/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Flightradar24</a>, an aviation tracking website. Data broadcast by the plane indicated that at one point, it was descending at 11,000 feet per minute, according to the website.</p><p>An air traffic controller tried several times to communicate with the pilot after the jet took off but got no response, according to an audio transmission.</p><p>After a long silence, a controller said: “We have a lost aircraft. We’re not exactly sure what happened, so we’re trying to figure it out.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Killiom Pontes, 38, a manager of a cellphone store less than a mile from the crash site, said that the impact had caused the windows of the business to shake.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“‘What the hell just happened?’” he recalled saying to himself. “At first, I thought it was an earthquake, but then we saw the big boom.”</p><p>Mr. Pontes said he drove to the scene, which he described as in a busy commercial area. He started streaming live video of flames and debris.</p><p>“I saw a big hole in the ground,” he said. “I was in shock how much debris there was.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Roosevelt Mall’s owner, Brixmor Property Group, said the plane had crashed in front of the shopping center.</p><p>“At this time, we’re not aware of any injuries or damage at the property, which has been evacuated,” the spokeswoman, Kristen Moore, said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Debris from the plane that crashed in Northeast Philadelphia on Friday night. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Wisniewski/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Jet Rescue Air Ambulance conducts 600 to 700 flights a year and specializes in critical care patients, Mr. Gold said.
