He started recording an Instagram Live video of flames and debris.</p><p>“I saw a big hole in the ground,” he said. “I was in shock how much debris there was.”</p><p>A representative for the mall’s owner, Brixmor Property Group, confirmed Friday night that the plane had crashed in front of the mall.</p><p>“At this time, we’re not aware of any injuries or damage at the property, which has been evacuated,” the spokeswoman, Kristen Moore, said in a phone interview. “We’re just working with local law enforcement as they secure the site and emergency crews responding to the scene.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Debris from the plane that crashed in Northeast Philadelphia on Friday night. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Wisniewski/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Earlier, there was confusion as to how many people were aboard the plane.</p><p>A statement from the F.A.A. posted on X at <a href="https://x.com/FAANews/status/1885490090878607836" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">7:47 p.m.</a> that two people were on board.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>A post on X from the U.S. transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, at <a href="https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/1885490535256740323" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">7:49 p.m.</a> said that six people were reportedly on board.</p><p>The F.A.A. updated its statement at 8:40 p.m. to say that six people were on board.
