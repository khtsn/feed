He was 81.</p><p>His brother, Thomas Holland, said he died in a hospital from complications of heart surgery.</p><p>Mr. Holland was in his late 20s and contributing to Playboy and a few of New York City’s underground papers, including The New York Review of Sex and Politics and The East Village Other, when he was invited to be part of an experiment at The New York Times.</p><p>In 1970, the paper had introduced what it called an Op-Ed page — the name referred to its placement opposite the editorial page — as a forum for essays and ideas. The art director of this new page, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/business/media/jean-claude-suares-daring-illustrator-of-the-timess-op-ed-page-dies-at-71.html" title="">Jean-Claude Suares</a>, was another veteran of the underground presses; while working at The Times, he was also designing Screw magazine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>For The Times, Mr. Suares wanted to commission standout art to accompany the writing, but he didn’t want to illustrate the themes of the articles literally. He was an admirer of Mr. Holland’s work and recruited him, along with other notable insurgents, including Ralph Steadman, the British caricaturist who had been illustrating Hunter Thompson’s gonzo adventures, and a coterie of European political cartoonists.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/11/multimedia/11Holland-Subb-kvht/11Holland-Subb-kvht-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/11/multimedia/11Holland-Subb-kvht/11Holland-Subb-kvht-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/11/multimedia/11Holland-Subb-kvht/11Holland-Subb-kvht-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A black-and-white drawing of a man with a thick handlebar mustache holding people like marionettes on strings, which he holds in both hands.

Another image — of a fearsome figure with a belt cinched around his upper arm, pulling it tight with his teeth and brandishing a spoon at the gaping mouths sprouting from the skin below (to accompany another article on welfare) — was rejected, but ran later with an essay by a heroin addict. As the Watergate scandal unfurled, he rendered President Richard M. Nixon in myriad ways: atop a teetering stack of faceless, stumbling underlings, his coattails aloft, for instance, and as a grim collection of heads resembling the statues on Easter Island.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Outcast” (1974) was one of many images of Richard M.

He read about charcoal drawings in how-to-draw books he checked out from the library, and he soaked charcoal briquettes in lighter fluid and tried to make drawings that way.

A year later, the box was returned, much battered, with a rejection letter from Mickey Mouse.</p><p>After high school, he moved to Chicago, where he swept floors in a tattoo parlor before finding a job doing paste-up work for a catalog company.
