He said he did not have details about the ages of the victims.</p><p>The search for the missing person was focused on the Sandusky River, Mr. Sanchez said. Fremont is about 40 miles southeast of Toledo.</p><p>The mayor said it was not common for people to be crossing where the pedestrians were struck, though additional specific details about the location were not immediately available.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Law enforcement authorities did not respond to requests for comment. It was not immediately clear which train line was involved.</p><p>David Tucker III, 20, was fishing by the Sandusky River when he heard the train approaching the bridge and sounding its horn, he said.</p><p>As the train neared, it continued to sound its horn, until finally the engineer just held down the horn, Mr. Tucker said.</p><p>Mr. Tucker then saw what he estimated were four or five people “drop straight into the water,” from the train trestle, he said. The fall was about 20 feet, Mr. Tucker said.</p><p>He could see only their feet as they floated down the river. Mr. Tucker called 911 at 7:25 p.m., he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His father, David Tucker Jr., had just returned home from work and also said he had heard the train sound its horn.</p><p>“I looked out my back window, and I could see people in panic,” he said, adding he also heard the train “slam its brakes.” He immediately called his son because he knew his son was fishing at the river.</p><p>According to the Tuckers, the victims appeared to be crossing the train trestle to reach the other side. The trestle has a no trespassing sign, they said.</p><p>Yan Zhuang<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
