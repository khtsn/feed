    <h1>Ukrainian Women Are Traveling to the Front Line to Keep Love Alive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Everything happened so fast. On their first in-person date, they went to see a play, and she whispered in his ear, “I think I’ve fallen in love with you.” Soon after, they were married. And shortly after that, he was sent back to the front.</p><p>When Damina Serbyn and Roman Myronenko met at a theater in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, last year after a short online courtship, they dreamed of spending their lives together in domestic bliss. But with Mr. Myronenko fighting Russian forces on the front line, that has yet to happen. Ms. Serbyn lives alone, and has to travel for hours every two weeks to see her husband, a deputy commander of a drone battalion based near the northeastern city of Kharkiv.</p><p>On a recent cold winter evening, she was on a train rolling into Kharkiv that was carrying other women coming to see their loved ones at the front — a dangerous journey to a city that has come <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/europe/kharkiv-ukraine-russia-photos.html" title="">under constant attack</a> by missiles and drones. When the door opened, Ms. Serbyn jumped off the train and into her husband’s arms, kissing him.</p><p>When she is away, he does not feel like he is truly living, said Mr. Myronenko, 38. Ms. Serbyn, also 38, is a clerk with the government gas company. “Without her, nothing makes sense,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">the war</a> drags on, and as Russian forces make <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/11/world/europe/russia-pokrovsk-advance.html" title="">steady advances into Ukraine</a>, soldiers are fighting with little hope of being demobilized any time soon and returning home to their loved ones. Many women, determined to maintain their relationships and keep their families strong, make risky trips to areas near the front, often taking children along.</p><p>Some travel to places like Kharkiv, which are usually more dangerous than the cities and towns where they live. Others travel to frontline bases, where they are often in even more peril.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/xxukraine-dates-02-gzfc/xxukraine-dates-02-gzfc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/xxukraine-dates-02-gzfc/xxukraine-dates-02-gzfc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/xxukraine-dates-02-gzfc/xxukraine-dates-02-gzfc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Three people sitting at a table.

In civilian life, Mr. Kapustin was a mechanic; in the war, he often has to tow broken vehicles from perilous positions facing Russian forces, she said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“My son and Ihor are all I have,” Ms. Kapustina said. Before she began making regular trips to the front, she said, “I felt like we were getting too used to living without one another.”</p><p>Yulia Hrabovska, 35, a voice actress from Kyiv, was four months pregnant when her husband, Volodymyr Hrabovsky, went to war. When she visits him near the front line, they usually stay indoors and try to have a homey life — lying in bed or watching a movie together. Sometimes she cooks his favorite banana pancakes. “We try to imagine that for these two days, there is no war,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yulia Hrabovska, a voice actress, cooking pancakes with her husband, Volodymyr Hrabovsky.

If we will all survive, I will kiss him.”</p><p>Mr. Hrabovsky was thinking of kissing her, too, while holding her hand in her parents’ garden and listening to the Russian tanks.</p><p>They did survive and kiss, and have been dating ever since.</p><p>Ms. Hrabovska said the news that her husband was going to deploy to the front came just after she got pregnant.</p><p>“Those were very difficult days,” she said. “It was scary to imagine the baby growing up without a father.” But then she said realized that other women were going through the same thing. “Other girls manage it somehow, so I will, too. There are a lot of us.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Kharkiv, close to the battle lines and full of soldiers, has become a hot spot for frontline dates.
