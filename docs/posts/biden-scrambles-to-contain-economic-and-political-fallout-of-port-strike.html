It’s only fair that workers, who put themselves at risk during the pandemic to keep ports open, see a meaningful increase in their wages as well.”</p><p>The labor dispute between the roughly 45,000 workers and the port operators has forced Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris into a complicated position. A prolonged strike could send chills across the U.S. economy, creating shortages, layoffs and even higher prices for consumers just weeks before the presidential election.</p><p>The strike began after a monthslong impasse between the longshoremen and the port operators. The workers had pushed for wage increases that exceeded what the group representing the operators had offered. The union is also fighting automation at its ports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Biden has said he would not use a federal labor law to force the workers back to work, despite pressure from Republicans to contain the potential economic pain.</p><p>Invoking the almost 80-year-old law, known as the Taft-Hartley Act, could alienate unions and diminish crucial support among labor groups in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan just before the presidential election.</p><p>“He believes in collective bargaining, and that’s how a deal is going to be made,” said William Brucher, a professor focusing on labor studies at Rutgers University. If Mr. Biden were to use the law to intervene, “there will be really negative political consequences not only for him and his legacy but also Vice President Harris and her presidential campaign.”</p><p>During a previous labor dispute that would have frozen rail traffic in 2022, Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/us/politics/rail-strike-biden.html" title="">called on Congress to intervene</a> to avert a potential strike. But that was under the authority of a federal law that specifically governs labor relations in the railroad industry, meaning the White House is left with few options for this labor dispute, Mr. Brucher said.</p><p>That decision in 2022 prompted some union members to criticize Mr. Biden, who has called himself the “most pro-union president in American history.” Mr. Biden has since held a number of events, however, to spotlight policies that benefit unions. The Harris campaign has also focused on using Mr. Biden in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/us/politics/harris-biden-campaign-strategy.html" title="">a careful and targeted way</a> to bolster support among unions in critical swing states.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Without congressional intervention, Mr. Biden has had to use his bully pulpit to push both sides to the bargaining table to work out a deal. Even before the International Longshoremen’s Association union walked off the job, Mr. Biden had dispatched administration officials to try to broker a deal.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, and his National Economic Council adviser, Lael Brainard, gathered on Monday with members of the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents port operators. Mr. Zients and Ms. Brainard “urged them to resolve this in a way that accounts for the success of these companies in recent years and the invaluable contributions” of the longshoremen, according to the White House.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s top aides, including Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, and Julie Su, the acting labor secretary, have been in contact with both the workers and port operators. Senior administration officials made calls to leaders on both sides of the talks on Tuesday.</p><p>But those efforts still cannot force the two sides to work out an agreement.</p><p>“They have mediators, and they offer their services to bring the two sides together and hammer out an agreement and help with the trading of offers,” Mr. Brucher said. “They can’t force an agreement; it’s more forcing the two sides to bargain.”</p><p>The Biden administration and outside analysts have found that a strike lasting just a few days would have minimal impact.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But a stoppage lasting weeks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/business/economy/port-dockworkers-strike-economy.html" title="">could have an effect on the availability of goods and the underlying economy.</a> A strike could cost the economy $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion, or a 0.1 percent hit to U.S. annualized gross domestic product, every week as truckers and other workers dependent on the ports are furloughed and manufacturers experience delivery delays, according to Oxford Economics analysts.</p><p>While those losses would be reversed once the strike was over, it would take a month to clear the backlog for each week of the strike, the analysts estimated.</p><p>The potential sign of inflation has already caused alarm among some lawmakers. Republicans on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent a letter to Mr. Biden last month warning of “dire impacts to our supply chains, our economy and the American consumer.”</p><p>“If a strike should occur, we urge the administration to utilize every authority at its disposal to ensure the continuing flow of goods and avoid undue harm to American consumers and the nation’s economy,” the members wrote in the letter.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent, covering President Biden and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs">More about Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span> of the New York edition<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
