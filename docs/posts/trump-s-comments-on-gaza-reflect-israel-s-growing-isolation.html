He was also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-netanyahu.html" title="">careful to present a united front</a> with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s latest comment followed a coordinated effort by Britain, Canada and France to criticize Israel’s decision to expand its operations in Gaza. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/world/middleeast/israel-allies-denounce-gaza-offensive.html" title="">a joint statement</a> last week, the three countries — which had broadly supported Israel’s right to respond to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">Hamas-led attack on Israel</a> in October 2023 — said the expansion was “wholly disproportionate.” All three countries warned of concrete repercussions if Israel did not change course.</p><p>Britain has since suspended trade negotiations with Israel. It also placed sanctions on Israeli extremists leading efforts to force Palestinians from land in the Israeli-occupied West Bank — one of its most consequential moves against Israeli interests since it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-icc-warrants-britain.html" title="">dropped its opposition</a> last year to an arrest warrant issued against Mr. Netanyahu. Separately, France is organizing a conference, which will be held in June in partnership with Saudi Arabia, to discuss the creation of a Palestinian state — an outcome Mr. Netanyahu has vowed to oppose.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has remained defiant, accusing Britain, Canada and France of “emboldening Hamas.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ronen Zvulun/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Still, all of these countries continue to support Israel in many practical ways, not least through military, economic and intelligence partnerships.</p><p>The United States continues to supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, helping to sustain the military operations in Gaza. The U.S. secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, visited Israel on Sunday and Monday, meeting with Mr. Netanyahu and other leaders, and attended a ceremony in honor of two Israeli Embassy staff members <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/israeli-embassy-shooting-washington-dc.html" title="">killed in an attack</a> in Washington last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Britain and France helped protect Israel last year during huge barrages of ballistic missiles from Iran, and they would most likely do so again.</p><p>Moreover, they remain wary and have sometimes been critical of some of the moves made against Israel by other countries, including the push to charge Israel with genocide.</p><p>But the shift in the tone of their messaging, coupled with some small practical limits on Israeli interests, indicates that Israel’s strongest partners are beginning to lose patience with Mr. Netanyahu.</p><p>So far, Israel appears unmoved. Responding to the European threats, Gideon Saar, the Israeli foreign minister, said that his country would take its own “unilateral measures” if further steps were taken.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In Gaza, Israeli troops have continued to advance, and officials say the military now controls roughly 40 percent of the territory. The Israeli Air Force continued to strike targets in Gaza on Monday, including a school-turned-shelter that Israel said was used by militants.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Seeking food in Gaza City this past week.
