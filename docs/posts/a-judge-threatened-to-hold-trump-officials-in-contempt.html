And he said he would begin a contempt investigation unless the White House did what it has failed to do for more than a month now: give the men who were deported a chance to challenge their removal.</p><p>Boasberg’s threat came one day after another federal judge announced that she was beginning her own inquiry into whether the White House had violated a Supreme Court ruling. In that case, the administration argued that the courts did not have the power to compel officials to secure the release of a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.</p><p>Chris Van Hollen, one of Maryland’s senators, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/16/us/trump-news/42c578eb-6954-5048-a290-79e1431cce69?smid=url-share" title="">traveled today to El Salvador in hopes of meeting with that man</a>, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. He said the Salvadoran vice president had told him that Abrego Garcia remained in custody only because the Trump administration was paying to keep him there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-1ec3a386">Trump is pushing law firms to do his bidding</h2><p>Over the last month, some of the nation’s biggest law firms have agreed to provide President Trump with nearly $1 billion in free legal work. To the firms, the terms seemed straightforward: In return for escaping punishing, retributive executive orders, they would do pro bono work on uncontroversial causes like helping veterans.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/law-firms-deals-trump.html" title="">Trump had a more expansive view of the arrangement</a>. Over the last week, he has suggested that the firms could negotiate trade deals, and help him revive the coal industry. White House officials believe the firms could even be called upon to defend the president and his allies. One lawyer involved in the agreements suggested that the deals could unravel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Taiwan is home to TSMC, the world’s largest chip manufacturer. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ann Wang/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Copycat medications have spawned a multi-billion-dollar industry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hilary Swift for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dana Scruggs for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-6e7e2e0f">The partnership behind ‘Sinners’</h2><p>The director Ryan Coogler and the actor Michael B.
