    <h1>Supreme Court Deals Blow to E.P.A. in Dispute Over Federal Water Rules</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the majority, said the E.P.A. was entitled to impose specific requirements to prevent pollution but not to make polluters responsible whenever water quality generally falls below the agency’s standards.</p><p>“When a permit contains such requirements,” he wrote, “a permittee that punctiliously follows every specific requirement in its permit may nevertheless face crushing penalties if the quality of the water in its receiving waters falls below the applicable standards.”</p><p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett M. Kavanaugh joined the majority opinion, and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch joined most of it.</p><p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett dissented, joined by the court’s three-member liberal wing — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p><p>Justice Barrett said the agency was entitled to supplement specific requirements for water discharge with more general standards based on changes to water quality. The need for the second kind of regulation, she wrote, quoting from the government’s lawsuit, “is on display in this case — discharges from components of San Francisco’s sewer system have allegedly led to serious breaches of the water quality standards, such as ‘discoloration, scum and floating material, including toilet paper, in Mission Creek.’”</p></div></div>
