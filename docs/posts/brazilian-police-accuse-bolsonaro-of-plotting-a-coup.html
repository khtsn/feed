Mr. Bolsonaro narrowly lost to the current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist, but claimed the election had been fraudulent.</p><p>Brazil’s federal police urged prosecutors to charge Mr. Bolsonaro and three dozen others, including members of his inner circle,<span>  </span>for the crimes of “violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, coup d’état and criminal organization.”.</p><p>The police did not provide any specifics about Mr. Bolsonaro’s actions that led to their recommendations. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The announcement comes two days after four members of an elite military unit, including a former top aide to Mr. Bolsonaro, were arrested and accused of<span>  </span>planning to Mr. Lula shortly before he took office in January 2023.<span>  </span></p><p>The police have already recommended criminal charges against Mr. Bolsonaro in two separate cases: an effort to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-charges-covid.html" title="">falsify his Covid-19 vaccination records</a> and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-police-embezzlement.html" title="">plot to embezzle jewelry</a> that he received as gifts from foreign leaders while in office.</p><p>Federal prosecutors will now decide whether to pursue charges in any of these cases.

Mr. Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, calling the investigation political persecution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Although the police in Brazil can make recommendations about criminal prosecutions, they do not have the power to formally charge Mr. Bolsonaro. The country’s top federal prosecutor, Paulo Gonet, must now to decide whether to pursue charges against Mr. Bolsonaro and compel him to stand trial before the nation’s Supreme Court.</p><p>More than a year before Brazil’s 2022 elections, Mr. Bolsonaro began loudly sowing baseless doubts about the security of the nation’s voting machines, warning that he could be defeated only if they were rigged in his opponent’s favor.</p><p>When Mr. Bolsonaro narrowly lost the vote, he declined to formally concede. His supporters soon set up camps outside military headquarters, calling on the military to overturn an election that they claimed had been stolen from Mr. Bolsonaro.</p><p>Then, in an episode <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/world/americas/brazil-us-capitol-riots.html" title="">reminiscent of the attack on the U.S. Capitol</a>, they invaded and vandalized Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices just days after Mr. Lula took office, hoping to provoke a military intervention.</p><p>The episode alarmed many in Brazil, a country that was ruled by a brutal military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985.</p><p>In June, Brazil’s electoral court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/world/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-banned-office.html" title="">barred Mr. Bolsonaro running for office</a> until 2030, ruling that he had violated the law when he summoned diplomats to the presidential palace and made baseless claims that the nation’s voting systems were likely rigged against him.</p><p>Paulo Motoryn<!-- --> contributed reporting from Brasília.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
