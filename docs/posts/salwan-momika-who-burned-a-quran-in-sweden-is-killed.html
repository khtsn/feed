Mr. Momika had been set to appear in Stockholm District Court on Thursday on charges related to the 2023 incident, which resulted in protests in Sweden and across the Muslim world.</p><p>The Stockholm police, who declined to confirm that Mr. Momika had been killed, said that there had been a shooting late on Wednesday in Sodertalje, a city near Stockholm, and that a man had died. The prosecution authority then confirmed that Mr. Momika was that man.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Momika’s defense attorney, Anna Roth, said he had received death threats. The authorities did not say if they believed the killing was connected to Mr. Momika’s burning of the Quran.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers in Sodertalje, south of Stockholm, on Thursday, following the shooting of Mr. Momika.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jonas Ekströmer/TT News Agency, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Momika, a Christian, had set the Quran ablaze during Eid al-Adha, a major Islamic holiday, outside a mosque in Stockholm. He said that he was trying to raise awareness about the mistreatment and killing of Christian minorities by Islamists in some parts of the Muslim world.</p><p>“I am warning the Swedish people about the dangers of this book,” Mr. Momika had said through a megaphone outside the mosque.</p><p>The response from the Muslim world was swift and furious, with much of the criticism aimed at the Swedish authorities for not stopping the burning.</p><p>In Iraq, several hundred people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/world/middleeast/iraq-sweden-embassy.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">stormed the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad</a> and set parts of it ablaze. Iraq expelled Sweden’s ambassador and directed its ambassador to Sweden to withdraw from its embassy in Stockholm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Egypt called the Quran burning “<a href="https://twitter.com/MfaEgypt/status/1674172031787474944" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a disgraceful act</a>.” And Morocco recalled its ambassador in Sweden, <a href="http://www.mapnews.ma/en/actualites/politics/burning-holy-quran-very-high-instructions-hm-king-commander-faithful-swedens" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its state news agency</a> reported.</p><p>The Swedish authorities had condemned Mr. Momika’s actions at the time, but the police granted a permit for his planned demonstration after a Swedish court ruled that banning it would impinge on the right to freedom of speech.</p><p>The permit, however, did not allow him to burn objects, and Mr. Momika was subsequently charged with agitation against an ethnic or national group in four incidents of kicking, stamping on and burning a Quran. He also made speeches with derogatory statements directed against Muslims and Islam, according to the indictment.</p><p>“The fact that statements are made in a large square and disseminated is a prerequisite for incitement to racial hatred,” said Anna Hankkio, a Swedish prosecutor who initially brought the charges against Mr. Momika. “It is up to the district court to assess whether the burning of the Quran can also be considered incitement against a group of people.”</p><p>Later that summer, Mr. Momika again burned Qurans, according to the indictment.</p><p>The Quran burnings — and the resulting horror and outrage from the Muslim world — sparked debates in Sweden, which has struggled with whether to allow such protests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Before Mr. Momika burned the holy book, Swedish authorities had denied other anti-Quran protests, citing concerns about disruption to public order. After the burning, Sweden’s foreign ministry called Mr. Momika’s action Islamophobic, and officials warned that such protests could affect the country’s national security policy. The domestic security agency briefly raised its terrorism threat to its most severe designation.</p><p>Salwan Najem, who joined Mr. Momika in some protests and was also accused of burning a Quran, was a co-defendant in the case that was to be decided on Thursday. He is now set to receive his verdict on Feb. 3, the Stockholm District Court said <a href="https://www.domstol.se/nyheter/2025/01/domen-om-koranbranningarna-uppskjuten/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Najem expressed fear, <a href="https://x.com/NajemSalwan/status/1884852309512843599" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posting a link on X</a> to a story about Mr. Momika’s killing.</p><p>“I am next,” he wrote. </p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Young Haitians’ Lives Disrupted: </strong>Robbed of their education and their prospects for the future, legions of Haitian children are the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/americas/haiti-children-schools.html">overlooked victims of the gang violence that has crippled the country</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cracking a Vast Art Fraud: </strong>In a remote Canadian city, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/canada/norval-morrisseau-art-fraud.html">a hardened detective and an angry rock star</a> brought down two criminal rings that had produced thousands of fake paintings sold as works by a celebrated Indigenous artist.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drawing a Window Into the Middle East: </strong>The French cartoonist Riad Sattouf’s saga of his parents’ failed bicultural marriage, with its harsh depiction of life in rural Syria, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/world/europe/riad-sattouf-cartoons-france-syria.html">has become a literary sensation</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside the Gaza Truce Negotiations: </strong>The Qatari prime minister, working with both the Biden administration’s envoy and a representative for Donald Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/gaza-truce-negotiations.html">formed an unlikely partnership to seal the cease-fire deal</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jair Bolsonaro’s Stay-Out-of-Jail Card: </strong>The former Brazilian president, squeezed by criminal investigations, is looking to President Trump, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to shift his nation’s politics — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-trump-us.html">and maybe keep him a free man</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
