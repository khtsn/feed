He had expressed anti-Islam views and said he was trying to raise awareness about the mistreatment of Christian minorities by Islamists in some parts of the Muslim world.</p><p>Many Muslims were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/sweden-denmark-quran-burnings.html" title="">angry with the Swedish authorities</a>, who did not act to stop his protest. Although the authorities condemned Mr. Momika’s anti-Muslim actions, they said that Swedish free speech laws meant they had little power to intervene.</p><p>A permit obtained for Mr. Momika’s gathering, however, had said that demonstrators were not allowed to burn objects in Stockholm. Mr. Momika was charged with agitation against an ethnic or national group, said Rasmus Oman, the prosecutor assigned to the case.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
