There’s no trees. It’s just water. There’s nothing left. We have one suitcase, really. And so trying to figure out four people and a dog out of one suitcase is just surreal. When it comes to where we’re going to go from here, I guess anywhere but here. I don’t see anything to go back to. The firefighters are telling us it’s going to be at least six months before we see our house again. And, frankly, I doubt very much that it’ll be that fast.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/01/multimedia/01nat-helene-aftermath-bhql/01nat-helene-aftermath-bhql-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Hurricane Helene left Aaron Smith, his wife, two sons and dog with nothing but a single suitcase.

Roy Cooper of North Carolina said at a news conference, adding that 92 search-and-rescue teams were working across the state.</p><p>More than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/us/helene-destruction-florida-north-carolina.html" title="">130 people across six states</a> died as a result of the storm, and the toll was expected to rise. Almost a third of those killed were in the county surrounding Asheville, N.C., where an unknown number of people were still unaccounted for on Tuesday.</p><p>The military has joined the relief and rescue efforts across the Southeast. Maj. Gen. Todd Hunt, the head of the North Carolina National Guard, said 800 soldiers were on duty as of Tuesday morning, pushing into more cutoff parts of the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In South Carolina, nearly a thousand National Guard soldiers were on the ground, along with 18 chain-saw teams, Gov. Henry McMaster said at a news conference. “Things are getting better,” he said, “but we’re not out of the woods yet.”</p><p>Persistent power outages caused by toppled trees were still a “choke point,” he added.</p><p>Rescue efforts were complicated by the many roads that had, until recently, served as lifelines for small mountain towns. Hundreds were flooded, destroyed or blocked by debris. In some parts of the Carolinas, power remained scarce after flooding from the storm <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/climate/helene-hurricane-power-carolinas.html" title="">submerged electrical substations</a>, and cellphone service was spotty or nonexistent in some places.</p><p>President Biden plans to visit North Carolina and South Carolina on Wednesday. He also said that he planned to visit Florida and Georgia as soon as possible.</p><p>Helene made landfall in northwestern Florida late Thursday as a Category 4 storm, with winds of 140 miles per hour. It caused record-breaking storm surges in the Tampa Bay region, flash flooding in Atlanta and power outages as far north as Cincinnati.</p><p>Across the South, strong winds toppled trees. Tornadoes destroyed homes. Flash floods overwhelmed entire neighborhoods, and landslides destroyed public infrastructure, including for drinking water, which remains a key concern for emergency workers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Water systems in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/asheville-hurricane-helene-damage.html" title="">rapidly growing city of Asheville</a> were badly damaged, and officials said that restoring the full system could take weeks. Emergency crews were trucking in drinkable water for the city’s 94,000 residents.</p><p>“This crisis will likely be a sustained crisis, because of water system issues,” Mr. Cooper said on Tuesday.</p><p>The Gilded Age-era Biltmore Estate in Asheville, one of the region’s best-known landmarks and tourist attractions, was <a href="https://www.biltmore.com/weather-update/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed indefinitely</a> to assess property damage, its owners said on Monday.

The university’s buildings were not badly damaged, <a href="https://twitter.com/UncAvl/status/1841190021099110740" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a statement from the school</a>, but the campus has been without power, water and internet service since last week.</p><p>More than 1.5 million electricity customers from Florida to West Virginia were still without power on Tuesday afternoon, according to the tracking site <a href="http://poweroutage.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poweroutage.us</a>.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Mark Barrett<!-- --> from Gerton, N.C.; <!-- -->Zolan Kanno-Youngs<!-- --> from the White House; <!-- -->Eduardo Medina<!-- --> from Asheville, N.C.; and <!-- -->Ivan Penn<!-- --> from Los Angeles.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jacey Fortin covers a wide range of subjects for the National desk of The Times, including extreme weather, court cases and state politics all across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jacey-fortin">More about Jacey Fortin</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>18</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Rescuers Push Through Helene Debris to Find Missing People and Restore Power<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
