That country is the company’s second-largest market after the United States and it produces more cars there than anywhere else.</p><p>Tesla has built largely self-sufficient supply chains in the United States and China, a rarity in a world of interconnected trade. As a result, the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese goods, and the continuing threat to put them on Mexican and Canadian products, might help Tesla by hurting its competitors more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Although there is no evidence that Mr. Musk is shaping trade policies, the tariffs are one of several measures adopted by the Trump administration that may benefit Tesla at the expense of its rivals. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/trump-lutnick-tariffs-reduction-canada-mexico.html" title="">paused 25 percent tariffs</a> on most autos and parts made in Canada and Mexico, but the reprieve expires in a month, leaving automakers in the United States that depend on foreign supply chains in a state of uncertainty.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Tesla factory in Austin, Texas, in 2023.

And it is attempting to cut or eliminate loans and subsidies that competitors like Ford Motor and Rivian are using to finance electric vehicle and battery factories.</p><p>Mr. Musk has said next to nothing about trade or the administration’s crusade to promote fossil fuels and impede sales of electric vehicles, which could also hurt Tesla. And his support of Mr. Trump has inspired protests at Tesla dealerships and weighed on Tesla’s share price. But his position as a de facto member of Mr. Trump’s cabinet gives him influence that far exceeds any other auto executive.</p><p>“Conflict of interest is putting it very mildly here,” said John Helveston, an assistant professor at George Washington University who teaches engineering management.</p><p>Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. A White House official said that its policies predated Mr. Musk’s support for Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protest against Elon Musk outside of a Tesla dealership in Irvine, California in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Frederic J.

Mr. Musk’s personal wealth is tied up in Tesla stock, which has been on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/tesla-stock-elon-musk-trump.html?timespastHighlight=tesla,sales,china?timespastHighlight=tesla,sales,china" title="">steep decline.</a></p><p>When Tesla began mass-producing electric cars at a factory in Fremont, Calif., in 2012, it designed a supply chain that was less dependent on imports than virtually all of its competitors. Electric vehicles were a new technology then, forcing Tesla to largely develop its own sources of batteries, motors and other components.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An assembly line at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif., in 2018.

Tesla opened a factory in Shanghai six years later under <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/world/asia/elon-musk-tesla-china.html" title="">unusually favorable conditions</a>. Beijing changed ownership rules so that the company could set up without a local partner, a first for a foreign automaker in China. The Chinese government also ensured low-interest loans, access to top leaders and even changes that Tesla had sought on emissions regulations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But Mr. Musk kept supply chains for the Chinese and U.S. factories relatively separate, unlike other auto companies that depend heavily on imported parts.</p><p>“He set himself up nicely in the event that trade goes sideways and tariffs go higher,” said Michael Dunne, a longtime China automotive consultant. “And that serves him well today.”</p><p>Today, the cars made in Shanghai are sold in Europe, Southeast Asia or in the domestic Chinese market — but not in the United States.</p><p>The cars Tesla sells in the United States are made at factories in Fremont and Austin, Texas. Tesla also produces charging equipment for its proprietary charging network — the nation’s largest — in Buffalo, N.Y. Tesla regularly tops an annual ranking by Cars.com, an online shopping site, of how much of a vehicle is American-made.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tesla superchargers at an electric vehicle charging station in Baker, California in 2024.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Blake/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Tesla is in a good position” to withstand tariffs, said Patrick Masterson, who oversees compilation of the data that goes into the Cars.com ranking. “Their domestic production is robust.”</p><p>Tesla is still vulnerable to tariffs on goods from China and Mexico because a quarterof the components and materials in the car, measured by value, is imported, according to data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. But electric vehicles made by Tesla’s competitors are much more vulnerable to tariffs.</p><p>General Motors’ Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle, for example, is made in Mexico. With a starting price of $34,000, the battery-powered Equinox is a threat to the Tesla Model Y, which starts at $45,000 before government incentives. The Trump administration’s 25 percent tariff will erase most of that advantage, assuming it stands.</p><p>The risk to Tesla in China is harder to gauge. So far, Chinese leaders appear to see Mr. Musk’s role in the Trump administration as a plus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/business/economy/trump-china-trade-deal.html" title="">viewing him as a potential point of contact</a>.

With sales plummeting in Europe and weakening in China, however, Tesla production in Shanghai fell 50 percent in February from a year earlier. Chinese automakers like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/12/business/byd-china-electric-vehicle.html" title="">BYD</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/china-xiaomi-apple-electric-cars.html" title="">Xiaomi</a> are introducing new models that rival Tesla in features like autonomous driving.</p><p>Tesla’s prestige and leverage in China may be diminished as a result.</p><p>“Tesla can no longer control China,” said Jia Xinguang, an independent automotive analyst in Australia. “But China, by contrast, can control Tesla.”</p><p>Still, China would likely think twice before targeting Tesla and Mr. Musk because doing so could make it more difficult to attract foreign investment, said Wang Yanhang, a fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University in Beijing who tracks trade issues. “China will not shoot itself in the foot,” he said. “It is the last option.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lei Jun, the CEO of Xiaomi Group, speaking at the launch of Xiaomi’s new electric vehicle in Beijing, in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andres Martinez Casares/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>China has so far steered clear of autos when retaliating against the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese goods, instead <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/americas/tariffs-mexico-canada-china-trump.html" title="">raising duties on U.S. agricultural products</a> like chicken and wheat.</p><p>Tesla has quietly fought at least one potential tariff on Chinese materials that would have a direct impact on its competitiveness.</p><p>China is the main source of high-purity graphite, an essential material for batteries. In December, a group of companies that are trying to produce battery-grade graphite in the United States accused China of dumping and asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to impose punitive duties that could be more than 800 percent.</p><p>At a hearing on the issue in January, Tesla hired a prominent Washington law firm to argue its case, and four Tesla executives spoke, according to <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/701_731/pub5585.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public documents</a>. Tesla is “pushing back because they don’t see an alternative to the Chinese graphite,” said Iola Hughes, head of research at Rho Motion, which tracks the battery industry.</p><p>Last month, the trade agency said there was a “reasonable indication” that Chinese exports of graphite were harming U.S. producers. The agency has not issued a final decision. Mr. Trump’s rhetoric on trade has not included any mention of graphite.</p><p>Joy Dong<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-23"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Ewing writes about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.<span> </span></p></div><div><div><p>Mara Hvistendahl is an investigative reporter for The Times focused on Asia.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mara-hvistendahl">More about Mara Hvistendahl</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.
