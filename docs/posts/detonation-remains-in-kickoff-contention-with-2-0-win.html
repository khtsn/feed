		<p>DetonatioN FocusMe has defeated Global Esports 2-0 in the Pacific Kickoff lower bracket. They will next play against Paper Rex with hopes of extending their run at the event and qualify to the organization&#39;s first-ever Masters event. Global Esports is now eliminated from Kickoff contention, returning to VCT until the Stage 1 after the conclusion of Masters: Bangkok. </p>

<p>The match began with Abyss, a 13-8 win for DetonatioN on their map pick. Global&#39;s map choice, Split, went the distance, with DFM taking the map 14-12 in overtime, ending the series 2-0 and eliminating Global. </p>
