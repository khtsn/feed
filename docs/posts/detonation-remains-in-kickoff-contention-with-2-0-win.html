</span> with hopes of extending their run at the event and qualifying to the organization&#39;s first-ever <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters tournament</a>. Global Esports is now eliminated from Kickoff contention, returning to VCT until Stage 1 after the conclusion of Masters: Bangkok. </p>

<p>Global Esports descended to the lower bracket after <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/437224/global-esports-and-rrq-take-first-wins-of-2025" target="_blank">defeating Team Secret</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/440246/talon-overcomes-global-esports-in-kickoff-debut" target="_blank">losing 2-1 to TALON</a>, one of four teams to receive a bye due to their 2024 performance. DetonatioN, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/437224/global-esports-and-rrq-take-first-wins-of-2025" target="_blank">lost to Rex Regum Qeon</a> in their opening series. This set the teams up for an elimination series against each other, a matchup that has happened only twice in the past during the VCT Pacific regular season. The South Asian organization came out on top on both occasions, with <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/314326/global-esports-vs-detonation-focusme-champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-1-w4" target="_blank">the most recent encounter</a>, back in April, ending 2-1. </p>

<p>In terms of the map veto, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/278/detonation-focusme/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2024-09-01&amp;date_end=2025-01-26" target="_blank">DFM had the clear upper hand</a>. Global Esports was forced to take away their permaban, Haven, which let DFM pick Abyss as the opening map. DetonatioN&#39;s only win in their previous series was Abyss, and, during the off-season, the Japanese lineup <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/418814/detonation-focusme-vs-trace-esports-valorant-radiant-asia-invitational-ubsf/?game=191223&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">defeated the Kickoff China finalists</a> on the map. GE, meanwhile, had lost Abyss on both of their previous series, including a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430516/global-esports-vs-team-secret-champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff-ur1/?game=196416" target="_blank">13-3 loss against Team Secret</a>. Global chose Split as the second map, arguably <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/matches/918/global-esports/" target="_blank">the team&#39;s best in this map pool</a>, but also a strong pick for DetonatioN, with their most recent showing being <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/418816/detonation-focusme-vs-paper-rex-valorant-radiant-asia-invitational-ubf/?game=191228" target="_blank">a 15-13 win against Paper Rex</a>. This left Lotus as the decider, a map which both teams have played once since the conclusion of VCT 2024. </p>

<p>The match began with <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430528/global-esports-vs-detonation-focusme-champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff-lr1/?game=196454&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a>, where DetonatioN set off to a strong start. After winning the pistol, the Japanese lineup strung together a series of rounds, eventually forcing Global to use their timeout after 6-0. The pause paid off, but DetonatioN continued their round streak, taking advantage of <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/6672/meiy">
		Meiy	</a>
</span>&#39;s 5 first kills and their double-controller, double-initiator composition to completely shut GE out of the first half.</p>

<p><em>DetonatioN continues extending their lead just as Global regains hope with the pistol round win.</em></p>

<p>Back from the break, Global overwhelmed the defense on the A site for their pistol round, with the round going GE&#39;s way after a clutch from <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/5796/kr1stal">
		Kr1stal	</a>
</span>. DFM further extended their lead during the bonus round, and an ace from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4052/jinboong">
		Jinboong	</a>
</span> gave DetonatioN map point, also helping DFM stack up important ultimates. Global continued with a better prepared attacking half, countering their opponent&#39;s ideas and bringing multiple rounds back from the brink. In the end, however, the Japanese org&#39;s lead was too large to overcome, and a successful 1v2 from Meiy concluded the map 13-8 in DFM&#39;s favor.</p>

<p><span data-ref-id="6">

</span> had a stand-out attacking half. He contributed to DFM&#39;s 10-2 half with 13 eliminations, earning himself a 1.62 rating on Omen. “He was not nervous today, he had confidence,” Meiy said after the series regarding his teammate.</p>

<p>Heading into Split, <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/13002/akame">
		Akame	</a>
</span> recovered the pistol round from a solid plan by GE with a triple kill to take the first point. Global bounced back with the bonus round, taking the lead after denying Meiy any value from his early Showstopper. Back-to-back 4Ks from Akame saved DFM from a significant round deficit. Global&#39;s attack continued finding value, but key mistakes from South-Asian org and giving away the first death three more times than they found an entry kill let DFM keep the score close, sending the map to the break at 6-6.</p>

<p><em><span data-ref-id="8">

		Akame	</a>
</span> arguably won four rounds for his team on his own, keeping the series from going to the decider.</em></p>

<p>DetonatioN broke the tie in the second half after the second pistol win, with Akame and Meiy&#39;s contributions eventually helping set the score 9-6. Global Esports remained in the series with three rounds of their own, capped off with a <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/7437/kellys">
		kellyS	</a>
</span> ace against DFM&#39;s mid-B push. Akame continued providing value to his team, winning a 1v2 to reach double digits, but GE equalized the following round, forcing out the Japan-based organization&#39;s second timeout. Individual heroics from DFM kept Global from winning the map, taking Split to overtime. Meiy continued the hero plays, following up a 4K to stop GE&#39;s attack with a 3K, leaving his team in a 2v1 to end the map 14-12. </p>

<p>“I&#39;m relieved we came back on Split,” Meiy said after the series. </p>

<p>DetonatioN will <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430531/detonation-focusme-vs-paper-rex-champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff-lr2" target="_blank">next play against Paper Rex</a> in order to extend their Kickoff stay. “We need confidence,” Meiy said regarding the match. “We need to play as we do in practice,” he added. </p>
