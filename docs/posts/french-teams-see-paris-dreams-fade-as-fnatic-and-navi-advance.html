</span> just days before, FNATIC fell to the first round of the lower bracket. It is a place that FNATIC has been before. During <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2276/vct-2025-emea-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Kickoff</a>, the squad suffered an opening upset loss to that same BBL squad to be knocked down to the lower bracket, but eventually finished fourth and missed out on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>. Having already qualified for Champions on points, the stakes aren&#39;t quite as high this time around for FNATIC, but a share of the $250,000 prize pool is still on the line.</p>

<p>On the other side of the stage is a Karmine Corp squad that has not qualified for an international event this year, let alone sniffed the upper bracket of the playoffs at any stage of the season. Still, the organization had Champions Paris highlighted as its event of the year. That&#39;s because the event is set to be hosted at the organization&#39;s resident arena, Les Arènes de Grand Paris Sud, in Evry-Courcouronnes, France. The team knew it needed a deep lower-bracket run to qualify for the event. </p>

<p>The series opened on Karmine Corp&#39;s pick of Haven. Last year, the map was one of FNATIC&#39;s best, highlighted, of course, by its trend-setting double Duelist Iso-Yoru comp. However, FNATIC opted for a more original comp, featuring Killjoy and Neon. Up against them was KC&#39;s own iteration of a double Duelist comp, pitting <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/10307/marteen">
		marteen	</a>
</span> on his staple Yoru and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/5654/avez">
		Avez	</a>
</span> on Phoenix.</p>

<p>The pair combined for 25 kills on attack, but could only build a 7-5 lead by halftime. That was thanks in part to veteran player <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4/crashies">
		crashies	</a>
</span>&#39;s efforts, as he finished with a team-high 15 kills on that side of the map. FNATIC began its attack side with its usual slow, methodical approach, which got them the first three rounds of the half and an 8-5 lead.</p>

<p>However, a Karmine Corp timeout saw the defenders pivot, shutting down this attack to win four of the next five rounds and threatening to steal FNATIC&#39;s map pick. The flash-heavy comp did well to disrupt the sightlines of the slow-paced FNATIC attack.</p>

<p>Facing map point down 12-10, FNATIC fought back to force overtime, but they&#39;d only get that close. Two clean rounds from Karmine Corp in overtime gave them a 14-12 win in a showdown between two pairs of fraggers. marteen and Avez combined for 47 kills for KC, while FNATIC&#39;s crashies and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span> had a joint 45.</p>

<p>FNATIC&#39;s pick of Corrode was next, and while FNATIC had a more meta comp with Omen, Viper, and Vyse, Karmine Corp&#39;s agent select raised eyebrows. A zero-Duelist, double Controller, triple Initiator comp displayed one of the most unique Corrode approaches that any team has taken since the map&#39;s arrival. Both teams had success on the defender side, with KC jumping out to win eight of the first 10 rounds of the map, entering halftime with an 8-4 lead. </p>


<p><em>A crucial attack-side win from <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/458/chronicle">
		Chronicle	</a>
</span> to get FNATIC on the board.</em></p>

<p>On attack, the lack of a clear-cut Duelist seemed to hinder KC&#39;s ability to enter site, which FNATIC capitalized on. They had an eight-win defense half of their own, which brought the two teams to overtime once more. FNATIC winning an attack round to start overtime spelled the beginning of the end. FNATIC dropped just two bodies in two rounds of overtime to seal their map pick 14-12 and move to the decider map of Bind.</p>

<p>Bind has proven to be streaky since its reintroduction to the map pool earlier this year, and this series was no different. Both teams traded punches in the first half, as FNATIC, on attack, won the opening four rounds, only to be met with six straight KC rounds. Switching sides and going up against a zero-Sentinel comp with a 7-5 lead, KC looked to seize the momentum, but it was FNATIC that did just that. FNATIC won eight of the next nine rounds to close the series in dominant fashion, winning 13-8.</p>

</span> and BBL Esports securing top three, Vitality would have needed a top-two finish to secure qualification.</p>

<p>The series opened on Vitality&#39;s pick of Haven. <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/312/sayf">
		Sayf	</a>
</span>, who <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/534671/sayf-returns-to-team-vitality-as-sixth-man" target="_blank">returned</a> to Vitality&#39;s active roster ahead of playoffs, had an immediate return to action, replacing <span data-ref-id="13">

		KovaQ	</a>
</span>. He played Iso in the team&#39;s double Duelist comp, but this day&#39;s Haven appeared to be more defender-sided.</p>

<p>The three-site map proved to be tough to break down for both teams. NAVI managed just six attack-sided rounds with its single Duelist comp, which would have incited hope for Vitality&#39;s two Duelists switching sides.</p>


<p><em>&#34;Look at me <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/18677/ruxic">
		Ruxic	</a>
</span>, I am the danger.&#34; - Hiro, probably</em></p>

<p>On its attacker side, Vitality appeared disconnected, disjointed, and unable to attack. NAVI won seven of the next eight rounds post-halftime to cruise to a 13-7 win, stealing Vitality&#39;s map pick away. Duelist player <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/25906/alexiiik">
		alexiiik	</a>
</span> was on a heater, averaging a kill per round to finish a map-high 20/13 while Ruxic finished with a 1.39 rating, the game&#39;s highest.</p>

<p>The focus then shifted to NAVI&#39;s pick of Bind, a map that they have had a love-hate relationship with in Stage 2. A 15-13 series-deciding loss to FNATIC and a 13-5 win over GIANTX marked the team&#39;s only two appearances on the map this year. It hasn&#39;t been a ban of theirs, however. In six Stage 2 matches, NAVI has picked the map twice, floated it as the decider twice, and had it banned against them twice. In five matches, Vitality has played Bind twice and lost both times. They&#39;ve also banned it twice.</p>

<p>The map, as the earlier series in the day proved, has been somewhat defender-sided as of late. Both teams went for a double-Controller comp, with NAVI opting for a double-Initiator look and Vitality picking up a Sentinel.</p>

<p>NAVI had a dominant defense in the first half, threatening to make the series a quick one. Ruxic and Hiro, who were heroes on Haven, combined for 31 kills in the half, helping NAVI to a 9-3 lead. The pistol, anti-eco, and bonus rounds to open attack spelled danger for Vitality, but they would not go down without a fight.</p>

<p>Facing match point at 12-3, Vitality fought back. They won eight straight rounds, seemingly heating up at the right time. NAVI had trouble getting into site, only ever planting the spike three times during that run. At 12-11, a handful of crucial duels and a perfect Viper&#39;s Pit from hiro spelled the beginning of the end, giving NAVI a 13-11 win.</p>

<p>Vitality&#39;s 2025 season ends with the loss, while NAVI moves on to play <span data-ref-id="16">

<p>With a win against GIANTX and NAVI tomorrow, FNATIC and Natus Vincere could decide EMEA&#39;s four Champions representatives. While FNATIC has sealed Champions qualification, a Team Heretics loss could spell disaster, as they already trail Team Liquid in points, and could fall behind the surging BBL. </p>

<p>The Stage 2 playoffs will continue with the following matches:</p>
