But if funded, the maximum value would represent more than a sixfold increase in spending to detain immigrants. It is the latest indication that President Trump and his administration are laying the groundwork to rapidly follow through on his promise for a mass campaign to rid the country of undocumented immigrants.</p><p>The sprawling request to contractors was posted last week with a deadline of Monday. In the last fiscal year, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/crec/2024/03/22/170/51/CREC-2024-03-22-bk2.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">D.H.S. allocated</a> about $3.4 billion for the entire custody operation overseen by ICE.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>ICE is already expecting a large windfall from the <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/senate_amendment_h_con_res_14.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">G.O.P. budget plan</a>, which Senate Republicans approved on Saturday. That measure lays out a significant spending increase for the administration’s immigration agenda — up to $175 billion over the next 10 years to the committees overseeing immigration enforcement, among other things. The $45 billion request to contractors would put ICE in a position to more readily spend those funds.</p><p>The request also invites the Defense Department to use its own money for immigrant detention under the same plan.</p><p>“This is D.H.S. envisioning and getting ready to unroll — if it gets the money — an entirely new way of imprisoning immigrants in the U.S.,” said Heidi Altman, the vice president for policy at the National Immigration Law Center.</p><p>Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, has insisted repeatedly that a major part of raising <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/22/us/trump-deportation-flights-maps.html" title="">deportation numbers</a> will require, among other things, more detention beds and funding. The request is the first concrete step toward ICE being able to quickly scale up detention. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tom Homan, the Trump administration’s border czar, has insisted that he needs more detention beds and funding to raise deportation numbers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“Our level of success depends on the resources I have,” he said in an interview in February. “The more money we have, the more beds we can buy.” </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Typically, detention contracts go through a lengthy process for each facility, and ICE specifies the type, size and location. (A <a href="https://sam.gov/opp/7e6e095983064363938daab9bb2e11c1/view" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">request from February</a>, for example, sought up to 950 beds in the Denver area.) But this latest request is what is known as a bulk or blanket purchase agreement. It essentially creates a Rolodex of every detention facility and all auxiliary services and then allows ICE to place individual orders as more funding comes through.</p><p>Kevin Landy, the director of detention policy and planning for ICE under President Barack Obama, said that the government’s request was a clear sign that the Trump administration was looking to spend money quickly. “What’s going on is the administration is very concerned that they don’t have enough detention capacity to accomplish their immigration enforcement needs,” he said.</p><p>Immigrant detention is already above capacity, and reports have emerged of <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article303485356.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overcrowded facilities</a>. Last year, Congress provided funding for ICE to detain a daily average of 41,500 people. As of March 23, the <a href="https://www.ice.gov/detain/detention-management" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detained population</a> was about 47,900.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="fundedbedsupdate" data-id="100000010088534" data-source-id="100000010088534"><div slug="fundedbedsupdate" data-sourceid="100000010088534" id="embed-id-100000010088534">

Instead, they can operate under the less rigorous standards the agency uses for contracts with local jails and prisons. These facilities typically do not include comprehensive medical care, like access to mental health services, nor do they offer access to information about immigrants’ legal rights.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Homan had previously said that he was seeking to lower detention standards, and that he would do away with some of the government oversight and inspections intended to ensure compliance.</p><p>Even under existing standards, government inspections for years have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/us/politics/private-prisons-immigrants-detention-trump.html" title="">found evidence of negligence</a> at private detention facilities, including lack of access to medical care and unsanitary conditions, and problems that may have led to deaths of detainees.</p><p>In response to concerns, Congress in 2019 <a href="https://www.aila.org/library/congress-authorizes-ombudsman" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">created the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman</a>, an independent department to provide a recourse for detainees to address concerns and to inform them of upcoming hearings or the status of their removal process. But the Trump administration recently <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-gutting-dhs-civil-rights-branch/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gutted the department</a>.</p><p>Now, under the new request from the government, such services will be back in private hands, a development that former government officials and immigrant advocates denounced.</p><p>“They’re going to end up paying more for oversight that is less independent and likely less efficient,” said Deborah Fleischaker, a senior D.H.S. official during the Biden administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-670145e1">Private companies were already gearing up</h2><p>The government’s request is staggering not only for its size and scope, experts said, but also for the speed at which submissions were due.
