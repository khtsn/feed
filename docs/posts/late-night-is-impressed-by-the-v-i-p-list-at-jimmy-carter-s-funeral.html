It was also a rare gathering of everyone in the Marvel presidential universe.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Biden, Obama, Bush and Clinton were in the front row, while Trump sat in the back with an iPad and a bag of Cheerios.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“A lot of people were surprised that Melania showed up because they thought Trump’s plus-one would be Elon Musk.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“So yeah, it’s a seating chart so awkward that it probably had them asking ‘Is there any extra room in that coffin?’” <em>— DESI LYDIC</em></p><p>“I don’t know how you measure the life of a man, whether through their personal accomplishments or the lives they touched, but if you measure a life by the V.I.P. guest list at your funeral, then Jimmy Carter was a <em>[expletive]</em> pimp!” <em>— DESI LYDIC</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-7779fa2a">The Punchiest Punchlines (Great-Grandbaby Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“As wildfires still wreak havoc in Southern California, President Biden used a briefing on the fires to brag that he is now a great-grandfather.
