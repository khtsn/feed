Four civilians were reported to have been killed by gunfire in the unrest, according to local media reports.</p><p>Thousands of protesters, led by Bushra Bibi, Mr. Khan’s wife, had gathered in the capital since Monday night. They vowed to stage a sit-in at a major town square near important government buildings, demanding Mr. Khan’s release. He has been in jail since last August on charges that his party claims are politically motivated.</p><p>Pakistan, an impoverished, nuclear-armed nation of 241 million people with a struggling economy, has been in a constant state of political turmoil since Mr. Khan’s removal from office in 2022 following a parliamentary no-confidence vote. Since then, he has accused the powerful military of orchestrating his removal and has led a protest campaign to reclaim power through public rallies.</p><p>The political crisis intensified after general elections earlier this year. Mr. Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, claimed victory in the elections and accuses the current civilian government of being a puppet of the military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The crackdown by paramilitary troops and police began shortly before midnight on Tuesday. Authorities turned off streetlights at the protest venue and ordered nearby shops, cafes and markets to close. The protesters, most of whom had come from the neighboring Khyber-Pakhthunkwa province, quickly dispersed as security forces used tear gas and rubber bullets, officials said. Mr. Khan’s supporters claimed that security forces had opened fire on the protesters, which the security officials deny.</p><p>By 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi appeared before journalists at the protest venue and announced that the area had been cleared. Officials said at least 500 protesters were arrested.</p><p>Ms. Bibi and Ali Amin Gandapur, a political ally of Mr. Khan who has led previous protests, managed to evade arrest and escaped to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which is controlled by Mr. Khan’s party. Mr. Gandapur serves as its chief minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bushra Bibi, wife of jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, and supporters of Khan’s party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) attending a rally demanding his release, in Islamabad, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Waseem Khan/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The protesters’ “hasty retreat,” as described by Dawn, one of Pakistan’s leading English dailies, surprised many and disappointed Mr. Khan’s supporters. For days, Ms. Bibi had vowed not to leave Islamabad unless her husband was released. “I will stay here till my last breath,” she declared in a speech earlier on Tuesday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Tensions were high in the capital, with security officials ordered to use lethal force, if necessary, to protect key buildings. A day earlier, security officials said that three paramilitary troops had been killed during the unrest after being run over by a vehicle.</p><p>After the crackdown, Mr. Khan’s party called off the protest and accused security forces of killing dozens of protesters. The claim could not be independently verified and was denied by officials. Local media, citing hospital sources, reported that four civilians had died from gunshot wounds and dozens had been injured. Dozens of security officials were also injured in the clashes.</p><p>The country’s information minister, Attaullah Tarar, said that protesters had fled in disarray, leaving behind vehicles and even their shoes. “The miscreants had made big claims but failed,” he said.</p><p>On Wednesday, the authorities began removing roadblocks. The protest site was strewn with debris and trash, and several vehicles lay damaged. A truck used by Ms. Bibi had been burned to a char.</p><p>The political crisis has left Islamabad’s residents frustrated, with frequent protests and blockades disrupting daily life. Anticipating the protest, the authorities blocked major roads and suspended internet and cellular services in parts of the city. Schools, closed since Monday, are scheduled to reopen on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Political analysts and rights groups condemned the violence and called for dialogue.</p><p>“The government and the opposition, the PTI, must immediately engage in purposeful political dialogue — both on the floor of the house and among political parties,” the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said in a statement. “It is high time they agree on a peaceful way forward instead of inciting their supporters and bringing the country to a standstill.”</p><p>Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States and now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a public policy think tank in Washington, echoed the sentiment. He noted that the political crisis had led to repeated conflicts.</p><p>“The solution to Pakistan’s problems lies in grand reconciliation among political parties and the state’s permanent institutions,” Mr. Haqqani said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
