One option examined by the White House is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/tariffs-estimates-consumers.html" title="">a 20 percent flat tariff</a> on all imports, which advisers have said could help raise more than $6 trillion of revenue for the U.S. government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But advisers have also discussed the idea of assigning different tariff levels to different countries, depending on the trade barriers they impose against American products. They have also said that some countries might avoid tariffs entirely by striking trade deals with the United States.</p><p>A White House official cautioned that the decision was not set in stone and that the president would make the final decision.</p><p>By Tuesday morning, the president’s comments appeared to leave markets uneasy. Stocks edged down at the start of trading, with the S&amp;P 500 opening about 0.4 percent lower after a choppy day yesterday that ended with the index registering its worst month and quarter since 2022.</p><p>Investors are still seeking clarity on the scope of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, and the economic uncertainty surrounding a global trade war has fueled stock market volatility in recent weeks. Mr. Trump plans to unfurl his tariff plans on Wednesday at an event in the Rose Garden with his cabinet, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.</p><p>Danielle Kaye<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tony Romm is a reporter covering economic policy and the Trump administration for The Times, based in Washington.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tony-romm">More about Tony Romm</a></span></p></div><div><p>Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.
