    <h1>Markets Remain Uneasy as Trump Prepares to Impose Sweeping ‘Reciprocal’ Tariffs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Trump said he has settled on a final plan for sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs, but he declined to reveal the details ahead of an announcement in the Rose Garden at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, a move that appeared to rattle markets and governments around the world.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump said the U.S. would be “very nice, relatively speaking,” in imposing tariffs on a vast array of countries — including U.S. allies — that he believes are unfairly inhibiting the flow of American exports.</p><p>“That word reciprocal is very important,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “What they do to us, we do to them.”</p><p>The administration has been weighing several different strategies for the tariffs in recent weeks. One option examined by the White House is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/tariffs-estimates-consumers.html" title="">a 20 percent flat tariff</a> on all imports, which advisers have said could help raise more than $6 trillion of revenue for the U.S. government.</p></div></div>
