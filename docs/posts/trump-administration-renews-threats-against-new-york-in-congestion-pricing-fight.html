Kathy Hochul of New York that she had until May 21 to explain why his department should not make good on its threats. Penalties for not ending the tolls would begin May 28.</p><p>“The federal government sends billions to New York — but we won’t foot the bill if Governor Hochul continues to implement an illegal toll to backfill the budget of New York’s failing transit system,” Mr. Duffy said in the letter. “We are giving New York one last chance to turn back or prove their actions are not illegal.”</p><p>Federal transportation officials have said that congestion pricing exceeded the scope of the federal program that authorized it, and that a toll on motorists should not subsidize mass transit improvements instead of roads. But the federal judge presiding over a number of lawsuits challenging the toll <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/nyregion/congestion-pricing-lawsuits-judge.html" title="">has already rejected</a> key arguments in those cases. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that operates congestion pricing, filed its own suit to prevent the Trump administration from interfering with the program almost immediately after Mr. Duffy sent a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/19/nyregion/congestion-pricing-termination-letter.html" title="">Feb. 19 letter</a> seeking to kill the tolls. The case is expected to wend through the courts until the fall, which means <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/nyregion/mta-congestion-pricing-dot.html" title="">the tolls could stay active</a> for at least several more months.</p><p>The heightened threats come after Governor Hochul and the authority twice defied demands earlier this year to stop the tolls. The program, which began on Jan. 5, was approved by the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-federal-approval.html" title="">in November</a> after years of planning and review, and some legal experts have argued that the Trump administration does not have the authority to unilaterally revoke its authorization.</p><p>Congestion pricing — designed to reduce gridlock, cut pollution and fund critical transit projects — charges most drivers $9 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street during peak traffic times. </p><p>In a statement, Governor Hochul reiterated her support for the program and said the tolls would continue. “I repeat: congestion pricing is legal — and it’s working,” she said.</p><p>Janno Lieber, the head of the M.T.A., said in a statement that the authority was evaluating its legal options, noting that its case defending the program was already in front of a federal judge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Duffy sent the letter a day after his latest deadline to end congestion pricing, Easter Sunday, passed with the tolls remaining in place.</p><p>The threats include pausing financial support and approval for a number of unspecified roadway construction plans in Manhattan that are funded by the Federal Highway Administration, a division of Mr. Duffy’s department. Safety-related projects would not be affected, Mr. Duffy wrote, but continued noncompliance could lead to funds being withheld from projects elsewhere in the city and state.</p><p>Withholding federal funding would increase financial pressure on New York and M.T.A. leaders. In addition to the money raised from congestion pricing, M.T.A. officials are seeking support for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/nyregion/mta-budget-congestion-pricing.html" title="">the agency’s next $68 billion capital plan</a>.</p><p>Mr. Duffy’s latest warning comes amid increased federal scrutiny of New York’s transportation infrastructure. Last week, the federal government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/nyregion/trump-penn-station-nyc.html" title="">declared it was taking over</a> the renovation of Pennsylvania Station, pushing out the M.T.A., which had led the project. Mr. Duffy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/nyregion/trump-mta-funding.html" title="">has also been critical</a> of safety issues on the subway, even though crime in the system has been declining.</p><p>President Trump has long vowed to kill congestion pricing, claiming, without providing evidence, that it would harm the local economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>More than three months after the tolling began, there is evidence that it is working as intended.</p><p>From January to March, about 5.8 million fewer vehicles entered the tolling zone compared with the same time period in recent years, representing a 12.5 percent drop in traffic, according to an amended complaint that the authority filed in federal court last week.</p><p>The traffic reduction has already translated into noticeably faster commutes, both inside and beyond the tolling zone, according to <a href="https://shoshanavasserman.com/files/2025/03/NYC_Congestion_Pricing_2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an analysis</a> of Google data by researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Yale and Stanford.</p><p>The warning from the Trump administration is not the first the city has received from federal transportation officials. In the 1980s, Washington briefly threatened to withhold funding for the Williamsburg Bridge over safety issues, recalled Samuel I. Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner who supports congestion pricing.</p><p>But the broad threat from Mr. Duffy on Monday went much further, Mr. Schwartz said.</p><p>“I’ve never seen such a blanket cessation of federal funds threatened,” he said. “This is very serious. Our infrastructure really doesn’t care what goes on in Washington. It will continue to age and crumble.”</p><p>Mr. Duffy’s latest letter, however, drew skepticism from some transit supporters.</p><p>Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for Riders Alliance, an advocacy group that backs congestion pricing, said that Mr. Duffy’s repeated threats have undermined his position.</p><p>“As a parent, the secretary surely knows that a thrice-extended deadline is a dead letter,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stefanos Chen is a Times reporter covering New York City’s transit system.</p></div><div><p>Winnie Hu is a Times reporter covering the people and neighborhoods of New York City.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Iran Nuclear Talks</strong><strong>: </strong>As the administration grapples with how to stop Iran’s nuclear program, it has so far left a trail of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-negotations.html">mixed messages, conflicting signals and blustering threats</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Housing Aid:</strong> The White House is considering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/housing-aid-hud-federal-budget.html">deep cuts to federal housing programs</a>, including a sweeping overhaul of aid to low-income families, in a reconfiguration that could jeopardize millions of Americans’ access to rental assistance funds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Standoff Over Transgender Athletes:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-sues-maine-trans-athletes-womens-sports.html">sued Maine</a> over policies that allow some transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports, just days after also threatening to cut off funding to the state’s public schools and lunch programs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disinformation Office Shuttered:</strong> Secretary of State Marco Rubio shut down a State Department office that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-rubio-state-department-foreign-disinformation.html">tracks and counters global disinformation</a>, including campaigns by rival powers of the United States and terrorist groups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Deals With Law Firms:</strong> To avoid retribution, some of the nation’s biggest law firms agreed to deals with President Trump to provide free legal services for uncontroversial causes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/law-firms-deals-trump.html">Now he wants more from them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Changing Briefing Room: </strong>For decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/15/us/trump-white-house-briefing-room-new-media.html">the seating chart in the White House press briefing room has been controlled</a> by an independent organization.
