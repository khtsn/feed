But one humble house in Chicago could have sticker shock thanks to being the childhood home of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/americas/pope-candidate-cardinal-robert-francis-prevost.html" title="">the first American pope</a>. Call it a papal price bump.</p><p>Moments after white smoke emerged from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel to signal the selection of a new pope, the price on a modest brick house in Dolton, Ill., 30 minutes south of downtown Chicago, went up. How much is still to be decided, but the world discovered that Pope Leo XIV once lived in the humble house on 141st Place.</p><p>Offers began flooding in to Steve Budzik, a real estate broker who had fielded a handful of offers in recent months for the house that he originally listed for $199,000. The owner has pulled it off the market as the two evaluate the potential windfall, he said. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>It’s unclear exactly when Pope Leo XIV, who was then Robert Prevost, lived in the home, but his father owned it from before Leo’s birth in 1955 until selling it in 1996, when Leo was working in Peru.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert Prevost, now Pope Leo, as a baby with his brother Louis, who was a toddler, and their mother, Mildred. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via John Joseph Prevost</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert Francis Prevost as a child.

Then, they got eight or nine offers for the home in rapid succession, some offering above the asking price.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The seller, he said, told him to pull the house off the market so that they can learn more about Leo’s time there, including what room he slept in and what the interior looked like before it was renovated. They are considering returning the home to the original floor plan, Mr. Budzik said. He said he hoped to get the input of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/pope-leo-xiv-brother-john-prevost.html" title="">Leo’s older brother</a>, who lives nearby.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The average price of a home in Dolton, Ill., where Pope Leo lived as a child, is $150,000.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Budzik said he had sold homes ranging from $77,000 to $1.25 million, but that now there was no comparison to working with this property.</p><p>“I’m honored,” he said. “Wow, this is amazing. This is exciting.”</p><p>Even without its famous former resident in Vatican City, the three-bedroom, two-bath house could draw a tidy profit for the current owner: The home was purchased for just $66,000 in 2024, according to property records. The average home price in Dolton, a community of about 20,000 people just south of Chicago, is $150,000, according to data from Zillow.com. </p><p>Celebrity connections alone can’t guarantee the value of a house. Sometimes, homes with famous former residents see price swings in both directions. The Tudor-style house in Queens, where President Trump spent the first four years of his life, was purchased in 2014 by a cash buyer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/nyregion/donald-trump-childhood-home-sold.html" title="">for $2.14 million</a>. But it then fell into disrepair, and in March, was sold for just $835,000.</p><p>Susan C.
