Engelmayer</a>, “an activist posing as a judge.”</p><div><p>Judge Engelmayer said in his decision that there was a risk of “irreparable harm” in allowing Treasury access by political appointees and “special government employees,” which includes Mr. Musk and members of his team. Access to those systems, he said, could leave highly sensitive financial information vulnerable to leaks and hacks.</p><p>In a separate statement, the White House called the judge an “activist” and the ruling “absurd and judicial overreach” for effectively locking the treasury secretary out of his role.</p><p>“These frivolous lawsuits are akin to children throwing pasta at the wall to see if it will stick,” Harrison Fields, a spokesman, said in a statement. “Grandstanding government efficiency speaks volumes about those who’d rather delay much-needed change with legal shenanigans than work with the Trump administration of ridding the government of waste, fraud, and abuse.”</p><p>Mr. Musk said on X that the Treasury Department and his team had agreed upon a list of adjustments to be made to the payroll system that were “obvious and necessary changes,” including incorporating a do-not-pay list and mandating categorization codes and notes in comment fields outlining reasons for payments.</p><p>In response to a post from the conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk, who said the Trump administration should consider defying the order if it becomes permanent, Mr. Musk suggested without evidence that the judge’s decision was part of a “super shady” scheme to protect scammers.</p><p>The judge’s decision barred Mr. Musk and his team from access to the systems at least until Friday, when a hearing before a different judge was scheduled in the matter. Those workers who have been allowed access since Jan. 20 must “destroy any and all copies of material downloaded from the Treasury Department’s records and systems,” according to the order.</p><p>It was unclear if the Trump administration and Mr. Musk’s team would take steps to comply with the emergency order.</p><p>Last month, just after President Trump took office, a top Treasury Department official, David Lebryk, refused to give Mr. Musk’s team access to the government’s payment system. He was placed on administrative leave and later announced his retirement.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjA3ZmU5MjktYTBmOS01ZmU0LThkNzQtNGJjZTVlZWZiNDkw"><div id="607fe929-a0f9-5fe4-8d74-4bce5eefb490" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/08/us/trump-administration-news#607fe929-a0f9-5fe4-8d74-4bce5eefb490"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erica-l-green"><img alt="Erica L.

That access was ultimately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html" title="">granted</a> by the newly confirmed Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent.</p><p>But other than vague assurances that the new arrivals at Treasury’s door had proper clearances, there was no description of how their work would be secured — and plenty of reason to believe that it would make it easier for Chinese and Russian intelligence services to target Treasury’s systems.</p><p>That was the central argument made by 19 attorneys general as they sought a temporary restraining order to get Mr. Musk’s workers out of the Treasury systems. And the federal judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, endorsed it on Saturday, limiting access to existing Treasury officials until a hearing next week in front of a different federal judge.</p><p>In the days before the order, concerns over the potential security vulnerabilities created by Mr. Musk’s project, which he has called the Department of Government Efficiency, were rampant. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/07/doge-treasury-payments-system-warning/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Washington Post reported</a> that a subcontractor to Booz Allen Hamilton, the firm that runs much of the Treasury’s threat detection center, had issued a written warning; it was retracted after its contents were leaked. And outside experts have described, in detail, what could happen when an outsider gains sudden access to a locked-down system.</p><p>Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert at Harvard and author of a series of books on security vulnerabilities, including “Click Here to Kill Everybody,” called the entry of Mr. Musk’s force “the most consequential security breach” in American history.</p><p>Mr. Schneier noted that the intrusion came “not through a sophisticated cyberattack or an act of foreign espionage, but through official orders by a billionaire with a poorly defined government role.”</p><p>Mr. Musk, of course, is attuned to cybersecurity issues. Starlink, the satellite system run by his company SpaceX, kept Ukraine in communications after the Russian invasion and is considered highly secure. So are the reusable rocket operations of SpaceX, which China’s space engineers have been eager to replicate.</p><p>So federal officials say that they have been shocked by the carelessness with which Mr. Musk’s workers pierced government systems, including two that are repositories of millions of sensitive records: Treasury and the Office of Personnel Management, both of which have been major targets of China’s intelligence services.</p><p>The Treasury Department has been a frequent target because of its data on sanctions, financial markets and payment systems.</p><p>During the Obama administration, Chinese intelligence services pierced the Office of Personnel Management’s files on the security clearances of more than 20 million Americans. American officials assume Chinese agents combined that data with stolen records from Starwood hotels and Anthem health system to draw a picture of where the officials were traveling and who they worked with.</p><p>“Foreign adversaries typically spend years attempting to penetrate government systems like these, using stealth to avoid being seen,” Mr. Schneier said. “In this case, external operators with limited experience and minimal oversight are doing their work in plain sight and under massive public scrutiny,” with high-level access to “America’s most sensitive networks.”</p><p>Mr. Musk’s group says that it is using “radical transparency” as it examines the spending patterns of government agencies. But little is known about how those on his team are getting access to information or whether they are making changes to systems that might introduce security vulnerabilities. The Trump administration has not revealed the names of most of the young Musk recruits nor explained what kinds of clearances they have.</p><p>In a letter this week to Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who raised concerns about the cost-cutting team’s work, Jonathan Blum, a Treasury official, said there was no reason for concern.</p><p>“Treasury has no higher obligation than managing the government’s finances on behalf of the American people,” he wrote, “and its payments system is critical to that process. In keeping with that mission, Treasury is committed to safeguarding the integrity and security of the system.”</p><p>He said the protections in the system were “robust and effective” and under constant review.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYjRiZTgyY2ItMmMwOC01NjQxLTg5YWYtZmM2YzBiOTNmMmUy"><div id="b4be82cb-2c08-5641-89af-fc6c0b93f2e2" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/08/us/trump-administration-news#b4be82cb-2c08-5641-89af-fc6c0b93f2e2"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sara-ruberg"><img alt="Sara Ruberg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-sara-ruberg/author-sara-ruberg-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-sara-ruberg/author-sara-ruberg-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-sara-ruberg/author-sara-ruberg-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-08T20:43:17.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 8, 2025, 3:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The lawsuit that President Trump brought against Twitter, Inc. after he was banned from the platform following riots on Jan. 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol has been dismissed, according to court documents.

The State Department indicated this week that it plans to move forward with weapons sales to Israel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The State Department has given Congress formal notification that it plans to move forward with sales of more than $8 billion in weapons to Israel, bypassing an informal review process that was still ongoing in one House committee.</p><p>The move took place just two days after President Trump met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and said the United States would “take over” the devastated Gaza Strip and turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East.”</p><div><p>The State Department formally notified Congress of its intention on Thursday. That same day, the Pentagon put out two news releases, one saying it was selling to Israel 3,000 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles worth $660 million, and another saying it was sending $6.75 billion of bombs and guidance kits. The Pentagon did not issue a news release for the sale of artillery shells, which as a direct commercial sale did not require the department to put out a detailed statement. Together, all the sales are worth more than $8 billion.</p><p>The Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/us/politics/us-weapons-israel.html" title="">announced the $8 billion sale in early January</a>, then sent the entire package to the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for informal review. During that process, lawmakers can ask the State Department detailed questions about the sales before making a decision on whether or not to approve them.</p><p>The two top Republican lawmakers on the committees gave their approval, and a Democratic senator eventually did too, but Representative Gregory W. Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, decided to use the review process to ask more questions.</p><p>The State Department moved ahead with the package after it had sat in informal review for more than 20 days, the typical amount of time granted to senior lawmakers for their consideration of such cases.</p><p>The sales will almost certainly continue unhindered, since Congress would need to muster a two-thirds vote in both houses to halt the orders.</p><p>Following the announcement that the sales would move ahead despite his hold, Mr. Meeks sharply criticized what he characterized as an erosion of longstanding precedent, accusing the Trump administration of sidelining Congress in its decision to proceed with the arms transfer.</p><p>“I continue to support Israel’s critical military needs as it faces a range of regional threats,” Mr. Meeks said in a statement. But his backing, he made clear, was not unconditional. He had engaged in what he described as “close consultation” with administration officials on the sales, raising a number of concerns — only to find his inquiries met with silence. The administration, he said, had failed to provide meaningful documentation or justification for its decision.</p><p>The administration’s move to carry out the sales was lawful, but Mr. Meeks said it showed “blatant disregard of longstanding congressional prerogative.” More than a bureaucratic slight, he argued, it was a fundamental challenge to the balance of power among coequal branches of government.</p><p>In 2019, during his first administration, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/arms-sales-saudi-arabia.html" title="">declared an “emergency”</a> over Iran, allowing Mike Pompeo, then the secretary of state, to move forward with sending weapons to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia despite the fact that Congress was still asking questions about the arms in the initial review process. Mr. Pompeo’s move led to an investigation by the State Department’s inspector general.</p><p>Thursday’s notification was sent absent an emergency declaration. In 2023, the Biden administration used a similar mechanism to circumvent congressional oversight for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/world/middleeast/biden-us-israel-weapons-sale.html" title="">arms sales to Israel</a> by invoking the same emergency provision.</p><p>Separate from the $8 billion package, Congress is reviewing a request by Israel for a license to buy 5,000 assault rifles from American gun makers. The State Department could soon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/us-israel-assault-rifles.html" title="">submit more requests for assault rifle licenses</a> to Congress for informal review. During the Biden administration, the State Department held up a license that would permit Israel to buy 24,000 U.S.-made assault rifles. In direct commercial sales, a foreign country asks the State Department for a license to buy weapons from a company.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzI1YjhiZWRmLTA1NjUtNWJmYi1iYzc4LWZlYzdhYWY3OGI4Nw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/08/us/trump-administration-news#courts" data-source-id="100000009978848"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/devlin-barrett"><img alt="Devlin Barrett" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-08T17:05:58.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 8, 2025, 12:05 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Thurgood Marshall U.S. Federal Courthouse in New York.

U.S. District Judge Paul A.

Vought, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/russell-vought-omb-senate-vote.html" title="">confirmed by the Senate one day earlier</a> to lead the Office of Management and Budget, as the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p><p>The appointment echoed a move from President Trump’s first administration, when he named Mick Mulvaney, who then led the budget office, as the bureau’s acting director to carry out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/magazine/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-trump.html" title="">efforts to shrink and hobble</a> it.</p><div><p>The agency, created by Congress in 2011 as a financial industry watchdog, cannot be closed without congressional action, but its director can freeze most of its actions by halting enforcement, weakening or repealing regulations and softening its supervision of banks and other lenders.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the budget office confirmed Mr. Vought’s appointment. Just days earlier, President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/business/cfpb-rohit-chopra.html" title="">fired the agency’s Biden-era leader</a>, Rohit Chopra, and replaced him with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Mr. Bessent immediately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/scott-bessent-consumer-bureau-trump.html" title="">ordered the agency’s employees to halt</a> nearly all of their work.</p><p>On Friday night, the home page of the consumer bureau’s website was updated with a “404: Page not found” message. The change came hours after Elon Musk, the head of the government efficiency program, posted “CFPB RIP,” with an emoji of a gravestone, on his social media platform X. Several members of Mr. Musk’s team arrived at the consumer bureau on Friday morning and gained access to its headquarters and computer systems.</p><p>Despite the disruption of the bureau’s home page, the rest of its website remained online, including its database of more than 10 million customer complaints about financial services companies. On Saturday morning, the database was still accepting new complaint submissions.</p><p>The consumer bureau’s staff union <a href="https://nteu335.org/2025/02/07/cfpb-union-nteu-335-spies-dodgy-doge-bros/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a public statement on Friday</a> about the arrival of Mr. Musk’s associates. It named three of them and warned about the billionaire’s “power grab” and attempt to “defang the only agency that checks the greed of payment providers, as well as auto lenders like Tesla,” a reference to the electric car company run by Mr. Musk. (The union’s post was briefly taken offline; a union spokeswoman said that was caused by a technical error.)</p><p>Representatives of the consumer bureau did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Employees at the bureau spent Friday nervously tracking the Musk team’s arrival and worrying about what it foreshadowed, according to three current and former agency employees. Their agency — created in the aftermath of the housing crisis and Great Recession to increase regulation of mortgage lenders, banks and other financial companies — has long been a target of Wall Street and Republican lawmakers, who have frequently called for its elimination.</p><p>Congress has never mustered the votes to kill the bureau, which has also survived two key Supreme Court cases that tried to wipe out the agency on constitutional grounds. Both times, the court preserved the bureau, though justices scaled back its independence by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/cfpb-supreme-court.html" title="">giving the president the power to fire</a> the agency’s director.</p><p>Mr. Vought was an author of Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for radically remaking the federal government. A section of Project 2025 devoted to the consumer bureau called it a “highly politicized, damaging and utterly unaccountable federal agency” and said it should be abolished by Congress.</p><p>Several Republican lawmakers — led by Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Keith Self, both of Texas — have already introduced legislation seeking to cut the consumer bureau’s funding to $0. (The agency is directly funded by the Federal Reserve, outside the usual congressional appropriations process. The bills would prevent the agency from requesting money from the Fed for its operations.)</p><p>More than 80 House Democrats <a href="https://democrats-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=412878" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent a letter</a> on Friday to Mr. Bessent demanding answers to questions about his order to freeze the bureau’s operations.</p><p>“We urge you to immediately rescind what appears to be an illegal stop work order,” they wrote.</p><p>Madeleine Ngo<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzg5NGI5ZGRkLWNmNTctNWEwMS1iYjQ4LTg2NDA1MDk3ZTU2MA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/08/us/trump-administration-news#usaid-workers-trump" data-source-id="100000009976952"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karoun-demirjian"><img alt="Karoun Demirjian" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephanie-nolen"><img alt="Stephanie Nolen" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/22/reader-center/author-stephanie-nolen/author-stephanie-nolen-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/22/reader-center/author-stephanie-nolen/author-stephanie-nolen-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/22/reader-center/author-stephanie-nolen/author-stephanie-nolen-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-08T14:18:11.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 8, 2025, 9:18 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Signage removed and covered up with tape and plastic sheeting at the U.S. Agency for International Development headquarters in Washington on Friday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathan Howard/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The thousands of people who work for the U.S. government’s main agency for humanitarian aid and disaster relief have been on the front lines of efforts to fight famine, contain virulent infectious diseases like H.I.V. and Ebola, and rebuild infrastructure in impoverished and war-torn countries.</p><p>On Friday evening, just hours before the vast majority of them were set to have been suspended with pay or laid off, a court issued a limited, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates/judge-will-freeze-elements-of-trump-plan-to-shut-down-usaid?smid=url-share" title="">temporary order</a> against the Trump administration’s moves to shut down the agency.</p><div><p>The order was a temporary reprieve to approximately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates/judge-will-freeze-elements-of-trump-plan-to-shut-down-usaid?smid=url-share" title="">2,700 direct hires</a> of the U.S. Agency for International Development who were on administrative leave or set to be placed on leave by midnight Friday. For the past two weeks, they and the contractors who work for the agency had been in the throes of a collective panic as the Trump administration began to lay off staff and signaled it planned to decimate the agency.</p><p>But the U.S.A.I.D. work force, and the aid industry that relies in large part on the agency’s funding, is still acutely in limbo. On Saturday, U.S.A.I.D. informed employees affected by the order that employees already on administrative leave would be reinstated until the end Friday, Feb. 14, and that no one else would be suspended with pay during that period, according to a copy of the notice viewed by The New York Times. But those employees could still have to wait for weeks, months, or potentially even longer, for a verdict. The case, which was brought on behalf of unions representing the workers, is expected to go to the Supreme Court, and it is unclear whether the jobs will ever exist again.</p><p>The Trump administration’s announcement this week that U.S.A.I.D. would dismiss almost all of its contractors and that most Foreign Service officers and other direct hires would be put on indefinite administrative leave set off a panic around the globe, as Americans posted in missions abroad scrambled to dismantle and reassemble their lives.</p><p>The announcement gave Foreign Service officers just 30 days to depart their posts and return to the United States if they wanted the U.S. government to pay for their relocation, forcing nearly the entire diplomatic staff to plan the sort of swift exit that normally only takes place during coups and wars.</p><p>Many employees with children had to decide whether to pull them out of school immediately, or leave families behind until the end of the school year. Some with medical conditions, including late-stage and high-risk pregnancies, worried about the dangers of traveling and the status of their health care. Several agonized over what to do about pets, because it was not possible to procure the paperwork necessary to enter the United States in just a few weeks.</p><p>The reductions at U.S.A.I.D. appear to have been driven largely by Elon Musk, the tech magnate President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-pentagon.html" title="">deputized to make budget cuts across the government</a>, and Pete Marocco, the State Department’s director of foreign aid, whom Secretary of State Marco Rubio appointed this week to run the day-to-day business of U.S.A.I.D.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, on Wednesday, after stop-work orders for U.S.A.I.D. programs were sent out. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sandile Ndlovu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Rubio, who has assumed overall authority of U.S.A.I.D., tried to tamp down the fears, encouraging people to apply for waivers to delay travel and arguing that the Trump administration was “not trying to be disruptive to people’s personal lives.”</p><p>But as stop-work orders and reports of massive cuts at the agency rippled across the global aid industry, and scores of nongovernmental organizations and consulting firms that relied on the agency’s funding laid off staff, the agency’s workers braced for its potential end.</p><p>One American posted to a U.S.A.I.D. mission in Africa said that he and his wife, a Foreign Service officer, had both been suspended.</p><p>“Two weeks ago we were two gainfully employed people with onward assignments, and now we’ve seen the entire industry decimated and we’re returning to the U.S. without jobs,” he said.</p><p>He, like many others, spoke on the condition of anonymity, as those still on the agency’s payroll have been instructed not to publicly discuss the changes underway. Employees fear that flouting the order could jeopardize whatever benefits they might still be eligible for, such as pensions and severance pay — though it was unclear if the Trump administration would honor such obligations.</p><p>On Thursday, a subset of U.S.A.I.D. employees began receiving notices that they had been deemed “essential,” meaning they would not be suspended or laid off — for now.</p><p>“This is your formal notification that you are expected to keep working, effective immediately, and until notified otherwise,” the emailed notification said, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times.</p><p>It was not immediately clear how many employees had been deemed essential. On Thursday afternoon, senior U.S.A.I.D. leaders were told that the Trump administration planned to reduce the agency’s staff to about 290, according to three people informed directly about the details of the call. By Friday morning, however, senior agency officials were being told that the number of retained employees was 611, according to two people familiar with the internal guidance.</p><p>Some speculated that the number of people retained might climb slightly higher, as bureau and regional leaders fought to preserve as many positions as possible to continue the agency’s lifesaving work.</p><p>Either way, the cuts to a work force of more than 10,000 promised to be drastic.</p><p>“What is happening is devastating, it’s hard to put it into words, but it’s devastating,” said Maria Carrasco, who had worked for the aid agency or projects abroad it had funded for the last 25 years, she said, before being terminated with other contractors last week. “We are people who put our sweat and tears in to these organizations, because we believe in the ultimate goal of helping people. And now it’s been erased.”</p><p>The moves against the U.S.A.I.D. work force began in earnest on Jan. 28, four days after <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/24/g-s1-44643/trump-foreign-aid-assistance-pause" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the stop-work orders were issued</a>.</p><p>Samantha Cooper, a contractor whose employment was terminated, had been working in maternal and child health and nutrition at the aid agency, and was set to begin a new job this past Monday in the Office of H.I.V./AIDS. Within days, she went from being excited about an upcoming career milestone to straining to make ends meet.</p><p>“I’m having to file for unemployment, which doesn’t even cover rent; food stamps, which — that’s fine, it at least gets me groceries,” she said in a telephone interview. Her medical coverage ran out on Friday last week.</p><p>Ms. Cooper, who is based in Tulsa, Okla., said she felt luckier than most.</p><p>“I have co-workers that are going through I.V.F., and they’ve lost all their benefits; people going through cancer treatments and with parents on hospice — and they were the breadwinners,” she said. “I feel privileged to say this is only what I’m struggling with. I know there are so many others having to deal with that, and it is literally going to break them.”</p><p>That was the fear for one Foreign Service officer in Asia who discovered this week that an immediate family member needed to be evacuated for a life-threatening health condition, only to be told by superiors that amid the dissolution of U.S.A.I.D., there was no funding available for emergency medical travel. Their only option, the officer was told, would be to immediately return to the United States, where they have nowhere to live, and leave their belongings and pets behind.</p><p>Another Foreign Service officer working at a mission in Africa wrestled with how to break the news to her two young children.</p><p>She also worried that she and her spouse, who also works in development, would have to live off the savings they had hoped to put toward a house if they both soon found themselves out of work.</p><p>“It just feels like the entire sector is sinking, and so how am I going to find a job?” she said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, like others, for fear of retaliation. “All I know is development, all I know is public health — I’ve dedicated my life to this. What other skills do I have?”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Food aid provided by U.S.A.I.D. in South Sudan in 2023. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The decimation of U.S.A.I.D. has set off a domino effect, as contractors, nongovernmental organizations and consulting firms that rely on funding from the agency for their projects also are forced to make cuts. At least 10,000 American jobs in the sector have already disappeared, according to InterAction, which represents a number of organizations specializing in foreign aid.</p><p>“It’s the evisceration of the sector,” Tom Hart, the president and chief executive officer of InterAction, said.</p><p>Employees of nongovernmental organizations and companies that rely on U.S.A.I.D. funding said they had effectively been blocked from accessing any funding through the agency’s accounting system, and in some cases, had months of expenses with no guarantee that the federal government would reimburse them.</p><p>Resonance, a development consulting firm that employed about 150 people around the world, is an example of a small company taking a big hit. The firm did about 75 percent of its business with U.S.A.I.D. before the contraction. It has bills going back to November that the agency has yet to cover, Steve Schmida, its co-founder, said in an interview.</p><p>“We’re being forced to carry a huge amount of cost with no clarity if and when we will get paid or reimbursed,” Mr. Schmida said, adding that he had to lay off almost 90 percent of his U.S.-based staff. He is going without pay for three months to help free up funds to keep his business afloat, he said.</p><p>But as news of the drastic staff reductions took hold, he was losing hope that the government would ever cover the funding his firm had been promised.</p><p>“It’s just been a catastrophe,” he said of the U.S.A.I.D. cuts, adding: “I think it’s dawning on everyone that this is over.”</p><p>Edward Wong<!-- --> contributed reporting from Bangkok and <!-- -->Chris Cameron<!-- --> from Washington.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQ0ZjVhYTk3LTUzYTUtNWJmOS1hMTA1LTE0NzMyYTEyNjQ4MA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/08/us/trump-administration-news#national-weather-service-cuts-trump" data-source-id="100000009778983"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/camille-baker"><img alt="Camille Baker" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/18/reader-center/author-camille-baker/author-camille-baker-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/18/reader-center/author-camille-baker/author-camille-baker-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/18/reader-center/author-camille-baker/author-camille-baker-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-08T10:00:21.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 8, 2025, 5:00 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Center for Weather and Climate Prediction headquarters in College Park, Md.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael A.

Grant, pushed by calls for a storm warning system, formally established the country’s first meteorological service as part of the U.S. Army.</p><p>This service was part of the Department of Agriculture and later moved to the Department of Commerce. In 1970, the National Weather Service was officially established when President Richard Nixon created NOAA, aimed at providing “better protection of life and property from natural hazards,” within Commerce.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Ironton, a freight schooner that plunged to the bottom of Lake Huron in 1894 during rough seas.

Many of its more than 4,000 employees work from 122 forecast offices across the country, where they continuously monitor local conditions, issue multiple daily forecasts and release warnings ahead of dangerous weather.</p><p>Its staff also operates some additional offices with a specialized remit, including one that is tasked with monitoring flooding, units that advise air traffic controllers, and the National Hurricane Center.</p><p>By its own estimate, the Weather Service collects over six billion weather observations a day. To create a forecast, a meteorologist at a local office may analyze some of those data points, consult weather models and make judgments based on expertise.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A tornado destroyed an apartment complex in Tuscaloosa, Ala., in 2011.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Martin/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>But the service’s mission goes beyond forecasting. In April 2011, after a large — and accurately predicted — tornado outbreak killed more than 300 people across the South, the department began providing advice to emergency agencies and public officials. It started telling people what to do with the information its forecasts were providing.</p><p>Rob Dale, the deputy emergency manager for Ingham County, Mich., works closely with the Weather Service. “Michigan State University’s in our jurisdiction, and they send a meteorologist out to every football game here, just to monitor the lightning threat or severe weather threat,” Mr. Dale said. “There’s someone right in the room as we go through the decision-making process.”</p><p>The Weather Service provides its forecasts and warnings to the public free of charge. NOAA’s observational data, from the agency’s vast network of satellites, buoys, weather balloons and sensors, is also available at no cost; companies like AccuWeather, Google and Apple use it to power their weather products.</p><p>The Weather Service estimates that its services cost every American resident $4 per year.</p><h2 id="link-6aab67">How the Weather Service could change</h2><p>The chapter of the Project 2025 document that includes proposals for NOAA describes the agency as a “colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,” and calls for it to be “broken up and downsized.”</p><p>It proposes that the Weather Service focus on its data-gathering services and “fully commercialize” its forecasting operations.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s nominee for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, a billionaire Wall Street executive, told senators during his confirmation hearing in late January that he did not agree with Project 2025’s proposal to dismantle NOAA and eliminate many of its functions. He also said, during questioning from Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, that he would maintain the Weather Service.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary nominee, at the White House this month.

During his first term, he nominated Barry Myers, the former chief executive of AccuWeather, one of the nation’s largest private weather forecasters, to lead NOAA.</p><p>Mr. Myers remained unconfirmed by the Senate for more than two years. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/barry-myers-noaa-nomination.html" title="">withdrew</a> from the process in 2019, criticizing Democrats who had voiced concerns over his possible conflicts of interest.</p><p>(In a <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/press/accuweather-does-not-support-project-2025-plan-to-fully-commercializing-nws-operations-noaa-has-critical-role-in-american-weather-enterprise/1670156" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> last year, AccuWeather appeared to distance itself from Project 2025’s proposal to fully privatize the weather system. “AccuWeather does not agree with the view, and AccuWeather has not suggested, that the National Weather Service (NWS) should fully commercialize its operations,” its chief executive, Steven R. Smith, said. The public-private partnership approach in forecasting “has saved countless lives,” he said.)</p><p>Mr. Trump’s influence on the Weather Service was felt elsewhere during his first term. In a 2019 episode that came to be known as “Sharpiegate,” Mr. Trump was at odds with government meteorologists over the forecast for Hurricane Dorian. After he included Alabama on a list of states that he claimed would be hit by the storm, a Weather Service office in Birmingham clarified on social media that the hurricane would not affect the state. Days later, during a news briefing, Mr. Trump brandished an illustration of the storm’s path that had been altered with a thick black marker to include Alabama.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/climate/trump-neil-jacobs-noaa-sharpiegate.html" title="">Bowing to pressure</a>, Neil Jacobs, then NOAA’s acting administrator, issued a <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/statement-from-noaa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> that supported Mr. Trump’s assertions and criticized the Alabama forecasters for their post. An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/climate/noaa-sharpiegate-ethics-violation.html" title="">investigation</a> found Dr. Jacobs had violated the agency’s policy for scientific integrity in issuing the statement.</p><p>This week, Mr. Trump nominated Dr. Jacobs to the post of NOAA administrator again.</p><h2 id="link-809313d">The future of weather</h2><p>If confirmed, Dr. Jacobs would lead NOAA at a time when the balance of its public-private partnership may already be in flux. Studies show extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more intense <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/climate/climate-disasters-cop29-election.html" title="">as a result of climate change</a>. At the same time, weather models <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/science/google-ai-weather-forecast.html" title="">driven by artificial intelligence</a> have demonstrated an ability to produce forecasts that are more accurate than traditional weather models.</p><p>A crop of private companies that use A.I. to build their forecasts is leading the charge to adopt the technology more widely. Companies are now increasingly operating their own weather observation instruments, though many also still use NOAA data. In recent years, NOAA, too, has begun supplementing the data it collects with data purchased from the private sector.</p><p>In Michigan, Mr. Dale worries that commercializing the Weather Service’s forecasting could set up a pay-to-play system for lifesaving warnings. “If someone says, ‘Hey, if you want a tornado warning for your county, you’re going to have to pay us, $100,000 a year,’ that’s just not viable,” he said. There’s no spare money in most county budgets these days to do something like that.”</p><p>Louis Uccellini, who was the Weather Service director between 2013 and 2022 and described himself as “one of the biggest supporters” of the private sector’s role in weather, said he believed not all the department’s work could be successfully contracted out. “Public service is not measured by the bottom line,” he said, “but by how well we serve society with the resources allocated by Congress.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FjMGFjMGY4LTdmN2YtNTdiMi1iZjI5LTFmOGI0M2YxNDUyMQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/08/us/trump-administration-news#rubio-usaid-africa-cuts" data-source-id="100000009978229"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/edward-wong"><img alt="Edward Wong" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/multimedia/author-edward-wong/author-edward-wong-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/multimedia/author-edward-wong/author-edward-wong-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/multimedia/author-edward-wong/author-edward-wong-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-08T05:10:22.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 8, 2025, 12:10 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Food aid provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development being distributed in South Sudan in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The U.S. ambassador to Mozambique, <a href="https://mz.usembassy.gov/ambassador-peter-hendrick-vrooman/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peter H. Vrooman</a>, has sent an urgent cable to Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that the forced withdrawal from Mozambique of all employees of the main U.S. aid agency would result in a “major vulnerability.”</p><p>The move would make it impossible, he said, for the U.S. government to properly manage $1.5 billion in aid programs, much of it delivering lifesaving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/health/trump-usaid-pepfar.html" title="">humanitarian assistance</a>.</p><div><p>The cable, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, said the absence of experienced agency employees in Mozambique would leave in limbo 114 active funding awards and 225 more junior workers, likely local citizens, “that will all require management and supervision.”</p><p>The cable paints a picture of chaos about to descend on the U.S. diplomatic mission and vulnerable citizens of Mozambique because of the imminent departure of the experienced aid workers, many of whom are Foreign Service officers with many years or decades of service.</p><p>“As a result, we are unable to put in place sufficient protections, procedures and management to prevent fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement,” Mr. Vrooman wrote in the cable, which is labeled “sensitive but unclassified.”</p><p>Other chiefs of missions across Africa are sending similar cables to Mr. Rubio in a rare coordinated effort, said a person with knowledge of the cables.</p><p>Mr. Rubio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/usaid-trump-musk.html?" title="">announced on Monday that he would be acting administrator</a> of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or U.S.A.I.D., ending its independent status, and was appointing Pete Marocco, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/01/peter-marocco-trump-usaid" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">divisive</a> State Department official who worked in the first Trump administration, to oversee daily operations.</p><p>The move came after a task force led by Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser to President Trump, worked with Mr. Marocco to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-rubio-foreign-aid.html" title="">force drastic cuts to the agency</a>, freeze much of its technology infrastructure and lock workers out of electronic systems, essentially halting the agency’s operations in advance of complete dismantlement.</p><p>The top officials then ordered all U.S.A.I.D. employees around the world — more than 10,000 workers — to go on leave as of Friday and said all direct hires must return to the United States within 30 days. Those orders have now been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates#judge-will-freeze-elements-of-trump-plan-to-shut-down-usaid" title="">temporarily blocked by a judge</a>.</p><p>On Jan. 20, Mr. Trump signed an executive order halting foreign aid as his major foreign policy action, and Mr. Rubio has said officials will do a 90-day review of all such aid. The total government budget for U.S. foreign aid across several agencies, much of it humanitarian assistance, is about $60 billion per year, less than 1 percent of the federal budget.</p><p>In the cable from the embassy in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, Mr. Vrooman, a diplomat of nearly 35 years who has also served as ambassador to Rwanda, argued for Mr. Rubio to allow five aid agency employees to be exempted from the forced departure “to complete required property and management controls and contract wind-down operations, if ordered, in a manner that safeguards U.S. national interests and minimizes legal liabilities” to the U.S. government.</p><p>Mr. Vrooman also argued for exemptions to eight health positions to try to keep lifesaving humanitarian assistance programs running. Mr. Rubio has granted a waiver to the blanket foreign aid halt for such programs, but many American officials say they cannot keep the programs running for various reasons. The absence of the necessary health employees “will jeopardize the effectiveness of the waiver to save lives,” Mr. Vrooman wrote, in bold letters.</p><p>He noted that U.S.A.I.D. supports 40 active lifesaving and emergency active field programs, and that in Mozambique more than two million people depend on the provision of antiretroviral drugs to prevent the spread of H.I.V., AIDS and strains of tuberculosis.</p><p>One U.S.A.I.D. program that requires an experienced manager to be present in Mozambique provides essential treatment for 389,000 people living with H.I.V., Mr. Vrooman noted.</p><p>He also wrote in the cable that U.S.A.I.D. families with school-age children should be allowed to stay in the country until mid-June, when the school year ends. Mr. Vrooman did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzJhYmExNDBkLTk1N2YtNTkzZi05ZDVmLTc5MGM2MmEzYTg4NQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/08/us/trump-administration-news#trump-fires-the-nations-archivist-in-latest-round-of-personnel-purge" data-source-id="100000009978227"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erica-l-green"><img alt="Erica L.

It has been an honor serving as the 11th Archivist of the United States. I have zero regrets — I absolutely did my best every day for the National Archives and the American people.”</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a post on social media, Sergio Gor, who runs the presidential personnel office, confirmed Ms. Shogan’s dismissal.</p><p>Ms. Shogan, the first woman appointed to the typically apolitical role, was something of an unusual target for Mr. Trump. She was not involved in the criminal investigations into Mr. Trump’s handling of classified documents, and was not the leader of the Archives when it raised concerns about Mr. Trump.</p><p>She had also had high-profile clashes with the Biden administration. Last year, she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/politics/equal-rights-amendment-constitution.html" title="">blocked attempts</a> by Democratic lawmakers to add a 28th amendment, the Equal Rights Amendment, to enshrine gender equality into the Constitution. Ms. Shogan refused to publish the amendment on the grounds that it had not met the necessary requirements, even after President Joseph R. Biden, who appointed her, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/equal-rights-amendment-constitution-biden.html" title="">declared that it did</a>.</p><p>But her affiliation with an agency despised by Mr. Trump appeared to be all the justification he needed to dismiss her. The Archives, which is responsible for issuing and preserving the nation’s records, alerted the Justice Department in early 2022 about Mr. Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents after it learned that he had taken more than a dozen boxes of presidential records to Mar-a-Lago, his private residence and club in Florida, after he left office.</p><p>Ms. Shogan began leading the agency in May 2023. But on the day that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/us/politics/trump-national-archives.html" title="">his electoral win was slated to be certified</a> last month, Mr. Trump vowed that he would replace Ms. Shogan during an interview with a conservative radio host who told Mr. Trump his “problems” with the documents case came about because the archivist at the time “hated you.”</p><p>“I think I can tell you that we will get somebody — yes,” Mr. Trump said. “We will have a new archivist.”</p><p>The F.B.I. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/us/politics/trump-fbi-subpoena.html" title="">executed a search warrant</a> at Mar-a-Lago in 2022 after trying for more than a year to get Mr. Trump to return documents. The case eventually led to Mr. Trump’s being charged by the special counsel Jack Smith with mishandling classified documents and obstructing the Justice Department investigation.</p><p>The case was ultimately dismissed last year by a judge Mr. Trump had appointed on the grounds that Mr. Smith had been unlawfully appointed to his job.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FjY2ViZTkyLTg2N2UtNTAyYy05NDVkLTU2MThmY2I2MWI4NA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/08/us/trump-administration-news#medical-research-funding-cuts-university-budgets" data-source-id="100000009978172"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christina-jewett"><img alt="Christina Jewett" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/22/reader-center/author-christina-jewett/author-christina-jewett-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/22/reader-center/author-christina-jewett/author-christina-jewett-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/22/reader-center/author-christina-jewett/author-christina-jewett-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sheryl-gay-stolberg"><img alt="Sheryl Gay Stolberg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/26/multimedia/author-sheryl-gay-stolberg/author-sheryl-gay-stolberg-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/26/multimedia/author-sheryl-gay-stolberg/author-sheryl-gay-stolberg-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/26/multimedia/author-sheryl-gay-stolberg/author-sheryl-gay-stolberg-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-08T02:13:36.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 7, 2025, 9:13 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Peter Kwong, the head of a team working on the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine, in a lab of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shuran Huang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The nation’s universities and academic medical centers were reeling on Saturday from a directive by the Trump administration to slash funding for medical research, a decision that doctors and scientists said would have a devastating effect on studies aimed at finding treatments for diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.</p><p>The change is aimed at reducing the amount of tax dollars that universities spend on overhead costs. The National Institutes of Health, which announced the move Friday evening, said <a href="https://x.com/NIH/status/1888004759396958263" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$9 billion of $35 billion</a> — or about 26 percent — of grant dollars distributed last year had gone to overhead.</p><div><p>The new policy, which takes effect on Monday, will cap “indirect funds” for costs like buildings, utilities and support staff at 15 percent and is aimed at saving $4 billion.</p><p>Dr. David J. Skorton, president of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said the policy would sharply cut funds to universities and medical centers that do N.I.H.-funded research, likely limiting the number of studies that could go forward.</p><p>“These are real consequences, longer waits for cures and for diagnosis, slower scientific progress, losing out to competitors around the world, and fewer jobs,” he said, adding: “Those who are facing any health challenges will suffer from less biomedical research.”</p><p>Dr. Robert Lefkowitz, a Duke University professor of medicine who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2012, said that indirect funds pay for the purchase and maintenance of highly sophisticated microscopes that enable him to examine the structure of molecules.</p><p>That fundamental research, he said, has made it possible to develop lifesaving medicines for cancer and other diseases. No single researcher, or even a group of researchers, could afford the upkeep on the equipment without the federal dollars tacked onto their grants to support it, he said.</p><p>“I think the American people need to understand how devastating it would be if this goes through,” Dr. Lefkowitz said. “A lot of research would just have to stop; I can’t imagine that the shortfall could be met from other sources.”</p><p>The N.I.H. funding <a href="https://www.unitedformedicalresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/UMR-NIHs-Role-in-Sustaining-the-US-Economy-2024-Update.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also supports</a> about 412,000 jobs, from research assistants to grant managers to people who dispose of toxic chemicals, according to United for Medical Research, an organization of universities and health advocates. </p><p>The leading category of study at the National Institutes of Health is cancer research, an area that has produced breakthrough drugs that have significantly extended survival for people with certain blood cancers and skin cancers. Close behind is infectious disease research, an area that produced the mRNA technology that rapidly produced vaccines against Covid in 2020.</p><p>Advances in sequencing the human genome supported in part by the institutes also led to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/04/cystic-fibrosis-trikafta-breakthrough-treatment/677471/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">therapies</a> for people with cystic fibrosis who expected to die in their 30s, but are now living into their 60s.</p><p>Still, the Trump administration has been sharply critical of what it derides as “woke” policies and cultures at universities, which have been bracing for a hit to their budgets. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s policy blueprint for a Republican presidency, called for capping research funds, saying they were sometimes used to fund diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Cutting such costs would “reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,” Project 2025’s authors said.</p><p>Elon Musk, who is running President Trump’s government efficiency program, hailed the announcement of the cuts on social media. He suggested that some elite universities devote much more than 30 percent of their grant dollars to administrative costs.</p><p>“Can you believe that universities with tens of billions in endowments were siphoning off 60% of research award money for ‘overhead’?” Mr. Musk wrote on X, his social media platform. “What a ripoff!”</p><p>While some elite universities do have large endowments, Lawrence O. Gostin, an expert in public health law at Georgetown University, said indirect costs are a lifeline for smaller academic institutions, including historically Black colleges, that depend on federal dollars and conduct medical research on tight margins, often losing money.</p><p>“This would be catastrophic,” Professor Gostin said. “It would mean that, at the most extreme, universities wouldn’t be able to even take N.I.H. money, and would have to stop doing essential research, including research on pediatric cancer and heart disease and dementia and a whole range of other things. At the very best, they would be hemorrhaging money.”</p><p>He called the policy “literally the opposite of the mission of the N.I.H., which is to advance research, not to make it difficult or even unaffordable.”</p><p>The administration has said the changes taking effect Monday will apply to existing grants. That will be jarring, said David A. Baltrus, a University of Arizona associate professor whose lab is developing antibiotics for crops.</p><p>“I think it’s going to destroy research universities in the short term, and I don’t know after that,” he said. “They rely on the money. They budget for the money. The universities were making decisions expecting the money to be there.”</p><p>Dr. Baltrus said that his research is focused on efforts such as keeping E. coli bacteria out of crops like sprouts and lettuce. He said the policy change would force his university to make cuts to support staff and other overhead costs.</p><p>An N.I.H. <a href="https://x.com/NIH/status/1888004759396958263" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media post</a> said the change could save the federal government as much as $4 billion and sharply cut payments to Harvard, Yale and Johns Hopkins, which have overhead rates above 60 percent of their grant sums.</p><p>The institutes are currently supporting about 11,000 research projects in cancer research. Infectious disease research is a close second, with nearly 9,000 projects underway. Much of the research the institutes fund is meant to discover how diseases work — in the interest of finding cures.</p><p>Dr. Skorton, a cardiologist and the president of the medical school association, said the N.I.H. has helped drastically change the fate of people with congenital heart disease, the most common birth defect. He said when he was born in 1949, 80 percent of people with the condition died before adulthood. Now, 90 percent of them survive.</p><p>The N.I.H. funds also support medical equipment suppliers and janitorial services nationwide, with $6.8 billion going to California, $5 billion to New York, $4.5 billion to Massachusetts and $3.8 billion to North Carolina.</p><p>The proposal may tee up a potent test for Republican lawmakers who have largely avoided direct challenges to the Trump administration.</p><p>Republican-leaning states reap millions from the institutes, including about $1 billion each to Florida, Missouri and Tennessee, <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to N.I.H. data</a>. North Carolina researchers were awarded $3.7 billion in grants last year.</p><p>Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said in a statement late Friday that the move could “dismantle the biomedical research system, stifle the development of new cures for disease and rip treatments away from patients in need.”</p><p>“Just because Elon Musk doesn’t understand indirect costs doesn’t mean Americans should have to pay the price with their lives,” Ms. Murray said in a statement. Her state gets about $1.5 billion in N.I.H. funds.</p><p>The institutes spent about $35 billion in 2023 on about 50,000 competitive grants to about 300,000 researchers at 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions nationwide, according to the Trump administration. Of that, about $26 billion directly funded research and $9 billion covered indirect costs.</p><p>The indirect costs pay for buildings, utilities, lab equipment, cleaning costs and “research administration,” which includes the work of safety and regulatory committees that are mandated by the federal government, as well as animal caretakers and other support staff.</p><p><a href="https://www.unitedformedicalresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/UMR-NIHs-Role-in-Sustaining-the-US-Economy-2024-Update.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One study found</a> that every dollar the institutes spend generates $2.50 in additional spending economic activity.</p><p>Dr. Norman Sharpless, a former director of the N.I.H.’s National Cancer Institute, said he expected a forceful response from universities.</p><p>“I think it’ll be a very swift legal response from the university counsels across the country,” Dr. Sharpless said. “I do think it will get enjoined, but hopefully it will lead to a discussion of what indirect costs ought to be. And that’s a healthy discussion to be having.”</p><p>He said 15 percent in indirect costs would be too low in high-cost cities with key research centers such as New York City, San Diego and Boston. “Because you’re effectively saying you can’t do science in Manhattan,” he said.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
