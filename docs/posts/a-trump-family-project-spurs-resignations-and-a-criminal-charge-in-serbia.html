And the inquiry came after a plucky group of cultural preservationists in Serbia stood up to their own government and, by extension, the close relatives of the powerful American president.</p><p>President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has a deal with the Serbian government to build <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/politics/trump-kushner-serbia-hotel.html" title="">a half-billion-dollar hotel and apartment complex</a> in the center of the capital, Belgrade. The project also involves the Trump Organization, run by the president’s sons Eric and Donald Jr., as the luxury hotel will bear the Trump brand.</p><p>In November, one week after Mr. Trump won re-election, the Serbian government greased the skids by declaring that the site — a bombed-out building that serves as an icon to Serbians’ suffering during a 1999 conflict — was no longer considered a culturally protected asset. That paved the way for the Trump family project.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Dozens of architects and cultural historians at the state-run Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments cried foul, accusing the government of violating the law. Several days after the government’s decision, they fired off a letter saying the property’s status as an “immovable cultural property” could be revoked only if a team of the institute’s experts approved it. And they hadn’t.</p><p>“From the beginning, we knew it was a political decision,” said Estela Radonjic Zivkov, the institute’s former deputy director. She said she was pressured by state intelligence officers not to challenge the government on this case, a clear sign of Serbian leaders’ intense interest in the project. She did so anyway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“From the beginning, we knew it was a political decision,” said Estela Radonjic Zivkov, the former deputy director of the Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments in Serbia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vladimir Zivojinovic for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Now, seven months later, the Trump family project has become both a Serbian scandal and a glaring example of just how far a foreign government was willing to go to further the financial interests of Mr. Trump’s family. And it underscores recurring concerns that the family’s business dealings have become harder to separate from Mr. Trump’s official decisions.</p><p>“Even the appearance that U.S. foreign policy might be getting harnessed for the president’s personal financial benefit flies in the face of how we have always understood public service,” said Daniel I. Weiner, a government expert with the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>If foreign leaders believe they can sway Mr. Trump by lining his family’s pockets, Mr. Weiner added, that can distort their own decisions.</p><p>Serbian college students who have been leading mass protests against Aleksandar Vucic, the country’s strongman president, have seized on the development as an example of what they see as their government’s corrupt ways. In late March, thousands demonstrated at the site.</p><p>Last month, they and other critics celebrated a surprise victory.</p><p>Serbia’s organized crime prosecutor charged Goran Vasic, Ms. Zivkov’s boss and the director of the cultural institute, with abuse of power. The prosecutor’s office said Mr. Vasic had admitted falsifying a document to justify stripping the site of its protected status.</p><p>No one knows how far the inquiry will go. But one question that has been publicly raised is whether Sinisa Mali, Serbia’s powerful finance minister, <a href="https://vreme.com/en/vesti/direktorka-zavoda-za-zastitu-spomenika-podnela-ostavku-zbog-generalstaba/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pressured cultural heritage officials to either back the project or resign.</a> Mr. Mali has ties to the White House through Ric Grenell, Mr. Trump’s longtime ally and current envoy for special missions.</p><p>Mr. Mali has declined to comment on the project, citing the continuing investigation. Affinity Partners, Mr. Kushner’s company, says the deal is under review. Mr. Vucic, Serbia’s president, has minimized the criminal inquiry, saying “there was not any kind of forgery.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-e89cc56">A Choice Location</h2><p>The Trump family’s plan calls for a hotel and apartment towers on a piece of prime real estate, across the street from the government’s ornate headquarters in downtown Belgrade.</p><p>It would replace the ruins of what is known as the General Staff building, part of a military complex that was heavily damaged in NATO bombs in 1999. It was declared a protected cultural asset six years later.</p><p>Vujo Ilic, a political scientist at the University of Belgrade, said Mr. Vucic “has a political interest to have this project developed in order to get some more access to Trump’s administration.”</p><p>Faced with the ouster of his prime minister in March and calls for special elections, Mr. Vucic is eager to demonstrate that he has credibility with world leaders, Mr. Ilic said. Other bilateral issues are also at play, including U.S. tariffs and support for Serbia’s bid to join the European Union.</p><p>Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, has said that “everything President Trump does is to benefit the American people.” Mr. Vucic’s office did not respond to a request for comment, but the Serbian leader said last year that he “died laughing” at the notion that “I used this for political influence on Trump.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>In April, Mr. Vucic flew to Florida with the stated hope of meeting with the president. He succeeded in meeting only with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s now-disbarred former lawyer. Serbia’s state broadcaster said Mr. Vucic suddenly fell ill and had to cut his trip short.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters gathered in Belgrade to demonstrate against the Trump family’s hotel project in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrej Isakovic/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Still, the Serbian president highlighted two visits from Mr. Trump’s eldest son this year. “A cordial conversation with Donald Trump Jr., the son of U.S. President Donald Trump, about bilateral relations between Serbia and the U.S.A.,” Mr. Vucic said after a March 11 meeting.</p><p>The next month, he posted a photo of himself checking out a roasting pig he would serve at dinner with Mr. Trump’s son. In mid-2024, he called a visit from Mr. Kushner “inspiring.”</p><p>“It’s really important for Vucic to emphasize how close he is to Trump for domestic audiences,” said Mr. Ilic. “Meeting the Trump family is the closest thing to basically meeting Trump.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>As far back as 2013, Donald Trump was eyeballing the Belgrade site for a hotel. The idea arose again in his first term as president. Mr. Grenell, then Mr. Trump’s troubleshooter for the fractious relationship between Serbia and Kosovo, encouraged Serbian leaders to consider redeveloping the site with American investment.</p><p>After Mr. Trump lost re-election in 2020, Mr. Grenell urged Mr. Kushner to take up the project and served as an early intermediary. Mr. Grenell met with the Serbian president in 2022 and 2023 and posted images of himself on social media with Mr. Mali in 2021.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia meeting with Ric Grenell in 2020.

Mr. Grenell could not be reached for comment.</p><p>By May 2024, the Serbian government struck a deal with a company affiliated with Mr. Kushner.</p><p>It agreed to give the developers a 99-year, no-cost lease that could be converted to ownership, also free of charge, according to a draft agreement reviewed by The New York Times. In return for contributing the land, the Serbian government will receive 22 percent of the development’s profits, according to people familiar with the deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>A Serbian minister publicly thanked Mr. Mali for “the energy and effort he has invested” in the project.</p><h2 id="link-6e0eeb3">An Early-Morning Call</h2><p>There was a hitch: The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments wasn’t going along. Dubravka Djukanovic, an architect and college professor who led the institute, was opposed to changing the site’s protected status.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The staff of the state cultural preservation institute accused the government of illegally approving the project.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vladimir Zivojinovic for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In an interview, she said that the complex, which was designed by a renowned Serbian modernist architect, should instead be restored and put to public use.</p><p>In June 2024, she said, she was summoned to a meeting with Mr. Mali, the finance minister. Olivera Vuckovic, the director of a parallel city institute, was also summoned, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of job repercussions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Mr. Mali had a blunt message, that person said: Get behind the project or resign.</p><p>Ms. Djukanovic said that she swiftly resigned because of the meeting with Mr. Mali, but declined to give further details because of the investigation. Ms. Vuckovic could not be reached for comment.</p><p>The issue simmered for another six months, until after Mr. Trump won re-election. On Nov. 14, the Serbian government announced it had revoked the site’s protected status.</p><p>At the cultural institute, Ms. Zivkov, then the deputy director, said the staff immediately got to work on a letter saying that the government had “grossly violated the Law on Cultural Heritage.” If the government trampled its own law in this case, the letter said, “any cultural property that inconveniences an investor or poses a political or other obstacle may be erased in the same way.”</p><p>As she was getting ready for work at 7:30 a.m. on Nov. 18, Ms. Zivkov said, she got a call from officers of the Security Information Agency, the state’s intelligence and national security arm. They were at the institute waiting for her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Zivkov said intelligence agents “strongly advised” her to back off.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vladimir Zivojinovic for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>In two follow-up phone calls, she said, they “strongly advised” her to back off. Undaunted, she sent off the letter — signed, she said, by every one of the institute’s 50-some experts — to the government and the Ministry of Culture.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Europa Nostra, a leading nonprofit cultural heritage organization in Europe, took the same stance, <a href="https://www.europanostra.org/europa-nostra-statement-protecting-belgrade-generalstab-is-a-matter-of-law-and-public-interest/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying hundreds of experts and numerous groups</a> agreed that the fate of the site “should not be guided by short-term political and/or commercial interests but by the respect of the rule of law.”</p><p>It is unclear whether it was the letter from the institute’s staff that prompted the criminal investigation. The institute’s director was temporarily detained for questioning, then charged with abuse of power in mid-May. He has not yet appeared in court. Ian Brekke, the top lawyer for Affinity Partners, Mr. Kushner’s firm, flew to Belgrade right after that news broke, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential business matters. Serbian officials told him the controversy boiled down to a simple administrative error, the person said, but Mr. Kushner’s team is still assessing the situation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the prosecutor’s inquiry has moved forward. Ms. Zivkov, now a principal conservator at the institute, said she was interviewed at the end of May.</p><p>According to the prosecutor’s office, there are 34 other names on their list for questioning.</p><p>Eric Lipton<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon LaFraniere is an investigative reporter focusing on the Trump administration.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
