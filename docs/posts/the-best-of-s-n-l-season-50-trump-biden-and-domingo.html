That will be the job of some future recapper to decide. (Hopefully.) For now, join us as we look back at the most memorable moments of the past season of “S.NL.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-bBL0303Kw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-616613a0">Political impressions of the season</h2><p>After abundant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/arts/television/snl-2024-election-harris-trump.html" title="">speculation</a> about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/arts/television/snl-maya-rudolph-jim-gaffigan-kamala-harris-tim-walz.html" title="">who would play</a> the Democratic presidential and vice-presidential nominees, the results — with Maya Rudolph as former Vice President Harris and Jim Gaffigan as Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota — were mostly lackluster. The performances were too amiable and not particularly satirical (much like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/arts/television/saturday-night-live-kamala-harris.html" title="">the real-life Harris’s own appearance</a> on the show).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>James Austin Johnson has remained a dependable President Trump. But we’ll give the edge this season to the “S.N.L.” alums Dana Carvey, who finally found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-bBL0303Kw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a funny way to play President Biden</a>, and Mike Myers, who seemed to be having the time of his life <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8E3arXq75Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">skewering Elon Musk</a>. Two ’90s-era “S.N.L.” stalwarts remaining relevant? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlSSqOV0tEk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">No way! Way</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-208196bd">Inexplicable viral phenomenon of the season</h2><p>Was it funny when a quartet of bridesmaids (played by Ariana Grande, Ego Nwodim, Sarah Sherman and Heidi Gardner) sang an off-key rewrite of Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” about a marriage-wrecking hunk named Domingo (Marcello Hernández)? Sure. Did anyone expect it to lead to countless TikTok tributes, two additional sketches this season (including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLKJwP1wdqA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one on the 50th anniversary</a>) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGS_Muyld1A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an appearance by Hernández</a> as Domingo at one of Carpenter’s concerts? Probably not.</p><p>The Domingo phenomenon was mostly espresso and not too depress-o. But if next year brings more sketches or a line of Domingo-branded male enhancement pills, it will probably have gone too far.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3c200c2b">Opening monologue of the season</h2><p>It seemed like tempting fate when Bill Burr was offered what had been the ceremonial Dave Chappelle post-election weekend hosting slot; in return, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBqAEKxzOmg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Burr delivered a somewhat polarizing stand-up monologue</a> that both was and was not about the recent re-election of President Trump. (As one representative line went: “Ladies, enough with the pantsuit, OK? It’s not working. Stop trying to have respect for yourselves. You don’t win the office on policy. You got to whore it up a little.”)</p><p>When Chappelle returned, the weekend before Trump’s second inauguration, he proved worth the wait, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57pGarTBJrU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a powerful, 17-minute monologue</a> that touched on everything from the death of President Carter to the Los Angeles wildfires to the war in Gaza. At its memorable conclusion, Chappelle implored Trump and the American people: “Do not forget your humanity, and please have empathy for displaced people, whether they’re in the Palisades or Palestine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-3ac5521">50th anniversary celebration of the season</h2><p>To borrow a phrase, everyone involved with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/arts/television/saturday-night-live-50th-anniversary-special.html" title="">“SNL50: The Anniversary Special”</a> went all-out, and it had everything: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNt1l2Kkfe4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Will Ferrell in booty shorts</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScFh0zNE0aE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sabrina Carpenter duetting with Paul Simon</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8GbTZ8v1-w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maya Rudolph dressed as a heroin shot</a>; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGKJeeLgulo/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jack Nicholson</a> an airdate that inexplicably preceded the actual 50th anniversary of the show’s debut broadcast by more than eight months.</p><p>Yet, for all the hype and the many demographic demands that the (three-and-a-half hour) anniversary show had to satisfy, it delivered a classic “S.N.L.” experience: overly ambitious while feeling as if it had been written earlier that morning. And while it would be folly to pick one segment to summarize the entire night, we’ll just arbitrarily pick the “Close Encounter” sketch with Meryl Streep, who was a long-awaited and perfect match for Kate McKinnon’s oddball energy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-e92c404">TV parody of the season</h2><p>Arriving just days after the third-season finale of “The White Lotus,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_1GzmjOvKQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The White Potus”</a> was a timely and topical sendup of that much-discussed HBO comedy-drama that managed to touch all the bases. The “S.N.L.” lampoon nailed the breezy cinematography and melodramatic tone of its source material, managed to draw a few salient parallels between the “White Lotus” characters and the current Trump administration and brought back some welcome alumni (like Alex Moffat as Eric Trump and Beck Bennett as Vladimir Putin).</p><p>The segment also proved unexpectedly controversial when the “White Lotus” cast member Aimee Lou Wood called it “mean and unfunny” for how she was depicted (as played by Sarah Sherman with a set of prosthetic teeth). <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/sarah-sherman-snl-feature-awards-insider" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sherman sent Wood</a> a conciliatory bouquet of flowers, saying, “I feel terrible that anyone would feel bad.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-2019f396">Musical inspiration of the season</h2><p>Bob Dylan, who hasn’t performed on “S.N.L.” since Season 5, proved to be an unlikely muse in Season 50.</p><p>He was the motivation for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHyEQkfpWW4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this charmingly freewheeling sketch</a> that imagined a red-carpet premiere for the biopic “A Complete Unknown” attended by Dylan (Johnson) and his youthful portrayer Chalamet (Chloe Fineman). He also inspired the real-life Chalamet’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6dCTnnoVsI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">performances</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6dCTnnoVsI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dylan songs</a> on the show a few weeks later.</p><p>And while it’s too soon to say whether Jane Wickline will go on, like Dylan, to win 10 competitive Grammy Awards and the Nobel Prize for Literature, her own offbeat musical ramblings about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryWROo9IiKA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mprkxTmMeAo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the trolley problem</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc1JmvC13Z8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a baby shoe found at the Central Park Zoo</a> have become a welcome part of the “S.N.L.” fabric. We’ll check back on her progress in another 50 years.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Dave Itzkoff is a former Times culture reporter.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
