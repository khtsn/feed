But it was still lashing parts of southern Japan with torrential rain, and the risk of life-threatening landslides and floods was rapidly increasing, the Japan Meteorological Agency <a href="https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/information/#area_type=offices&amp;info_id=20240828213755_0_VPZJ50_010000&amp;format=text&amp;area_code=460100" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a>.</p><p>The powerful storm had sustained winds of up to 97 miles per hour early Thursday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/29/climate/hurricane-categories-scale-saffir-simpson.html" title="">equivalent to a Category 2</a> hurricane, <a href="https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.

About 253,000 people are without power, service provider Kyushu Electric Power Transmission and Distribution said.</p><p>On Wednesday, the authorities issued rare emergency warnings for the storm in Kagoshima Prefecture. They are the highest category of warnings possible in Japan, are usually only issued once every few decades in a given region, and indicate the possibility of large-scale disaster, <a href="https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/kishou/know/faq/faq18.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the Japan Meteorological Agency.</p><p>Toyota announced that it would pause production at all 14 of its Japan factories starting Wednesday evening, to protect its workers.</p><p>Over Tuesday and Wednesday, the storm moved sluggishly past the Amami Islands, south of the mainland, before heading north toward Kyushu. Its slow pace means it has lashed some areas with rain for hours, and some parts of southern Kyushu have received nearly two feet of rain so far, the meteorological agency said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hisako Ueno is a reporter and researcher based in Tokyo, writing on Japanese politics, business, labor, gender and culture.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hisako-ueno">More about Hisako Ueno</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
