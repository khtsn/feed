He sent the fingerprint card to NamUs, which then sent it to an expert analyst at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The analyst matched the prints in 53 minutes, Mr. Holmes said. The authorities located a relative of Mr. Grubb’s, who confirmed his identity and provided documents. Officials said Mr. Grubb’s immediate family members have all died.</p><p>Mr. Grubb was a member of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard in the early 1970s and spent some time in Colorado, Mr. Holmes said. An unspecified “police interaction” in 1975 there returned a match for his fingerprints, which were listed in the Automated Fingerprint Identification System.</p><p>The police are working with the relative to have Mr. Grubb’s remains buried in a family plot.</p><p>Mr. Holmes credited Trooper Keck’s “good, old-fashioned police work” in helping crack the case.</p><p>“He went back,” Mr. Holmes said. “He challenged the assumptions that we had lost the fingerprints.”</p><p>Trooper Keck said he was grateful to have played a “tiny part” in the case. “I hope that this brings closure to the family,” he said.</p><p>Much remains unclear about Mr. Grubb’s death, including why he was at the cave, Mr. Holmes said.</p><p>He said that Mr. Grubbs was dressed in light clothing, and there were signs he had attempted to start a fire. Though there was snow on the ground, there were no signs he was prepared for the conditions. There was no food or camping gear found at the time, Mr. Holmes said.</p><p>“The rest of it is still a question mark for us,” Mr. Holmes said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
