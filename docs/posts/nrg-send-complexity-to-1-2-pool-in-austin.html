More than one colleague described him as the Energizer Bunny. He wears slim-fitting dress shirts, slim-cut trousers and chunky, stylish eyeglasses. Having worked as a banker in Europe for 25 years, he now comes off as a stranger in his own country: He speaks fluent Italian and sometimes struggles to come up with the American word or phrase to describe something.</p><p>He led the way past the old, idle equipment to a prized new machine, a German-made sample warper that cost $300,000.

But so far, the country’s textile manufacturers say they haven’t seen much benefit to their bottom lines or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/scott-bessent-us-textile-industry.html" title="">a change in public perception</a>.</p><p>It feels like a long shot. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/style/made-in-america-flannel-shirt.html" title="">The U.S. textile industry has been in secular decline</a> for half a century, as apparel production moved to lower-cost countries like China and Vietnam. The domestic supply chain for wool is nearly extinct: Perhaps fewer than five woolen mills capable of spinning yarn, weaving fabrics and finishing fabrics are still operating. Mr. Long’s firm, <a href="https://americanwoolen.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Woolen Company</a>, is one of them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For Mr. Long, the stakes are personal. His investors include his father, his in-laws and his Italian wife, whom he persuaded to sell everything they owned and relocate to the United States.</p><p>He bought the plant from Loro Piana, the Italian luxury firm renowned for making some of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/12/style/loro-piana-baby-cashmere-traceability.html" title="">the world’s most beautiful fabrics</a>. After 25 years, the company had closed it and laid off all the workers because many of its customers had gone out of business. If the fashion industry’s most celebrated weaver couldn’t make the economics work, how would one man with no experience?</p><p>“I put my family in a very uncomfortable situation,” Mr. Long said. “I put <em>myself</em> in an uncomfortable situation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Long, 54, is the custodian of roughly 475,000 square feet of manufacturing space in Stafford Springs, Conn., including a wool mill dating from 1842; a trolley depot built in 1899; and the original Warren mill from 1853.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-32a74a88">‘Soup and sauces, or textiles?’</h2><p>On Good Friday, Mr. Long took the train three hours to Kennedy Airport in New York and boarded a plane for Venice. He was traveling to spend the Easter holiday with his wife and two children, before flying back to his spartan rental apartment in Hartford, Conn.</p><p>To understand why Mr. Long is currently living apart from his family — and why he commutes 4,000 miles to see them every other month — it is helpful to rewind a decade or so, to 2013.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That fall, at a cafe in Milan, Mr. Long was having a drink with an Italian colleague from the world of investment banking. The colleague, he remembers, said something like: “Our client has a textile mill in Connecticut that they’re looking to sell. You’re American. Would you happen to know anybody who would want to buy it?”</p><p>Mr. Long was restless in his finance career and during his years in Europe had become enamored with Italian craft manufacturing. His investment portfolio included a Tuscan winery, and he was trying to wrangle the funds to buy a distressed firm in the region of Veneto that made fish soups and sauces.</p><p>Riding home on his bicycle after the drink, Mr. Long wondered: “‘Do I want to do fish soup and sauces, or do I want to do textiles?’”</p><p>He spent the next six months reading everything he could about textile manufacturing and made five trips to see the mill, which is 30 minutes northeast of Hartford in the small town of Stafford Springs. A woolen mill had operated there since 1842. Loro Piana, which bought the facility in 1988, poured more than $30 million into the operation to modernize the machinery, and brought over from Italy a textile engineer, Giuseppe Monteleone, to train the local workers and run the plant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/02/ST-AMERICAN-WOOLEN-vids-44356-cover/ST-AMERICAN-WOOLEN-vids-44356-cover-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/02/ST-AMERICAN-WOOLEN-vids-44356-cover/ST-AMERICAN-WOOLEN-vids-44356-cover-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/06/02/141110_1_ST-AMERICAN-WOOLEN-vids-44356_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Fabric being washed before it is dyed and finished.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Had Mr. Long been evaluating the deal with the cold eye of a banker, he might have run away. But a dream had taken hold in him, and despite everything going against U.S. textile manufacturers, he couldn’t shake it. In his envisioning, he would turn a commodity product — fabric for clothing — into a specialty good, as he’d seen European brands do with success. He would “tell the world that made in America in textiles and apparel can work.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Most of all, Mr. Long bet that big apparel brands like J. Crew, Brooks Brothers and Ralph Lauren would see the value of American production, sign on as customers and make his 19th-century woolen mill — and the broader U.S. textile industry — prosperous again.</p><p>So in the fall of 2014, Mr. Long and his wife, Federica Zagolin, settled with their children in a suburb of Boston, and he began commuting three hours each day to and from Stafford Springs. (Ms. Zagolin did not return an interview request for this article.)</p><p>Mr. Long found himself the custodian of roughly 475,000 square feet of manufacturing space. Next to the local bank and one block from the town hall are several brick buildings that run up a gentle hill like a living history museum: a wool mill dating from 1842; a trolley depot built in 1899 that is now used as an equipment warehouse; and another production building from 1853, which houses a yarn-spinning plant.</p><p>There is also the more modern weaving plant built by Loro Piana in another part of town. Mr. Long even owns two reservoirs, with rights to divert water from a brook for use in his factory.</p><p>Immediately, Mr. Long felt the weight of responsibility owed to the town, the mill and the work force of about 50 men and women, many of whom had been laid off by Loro Piana and called back to work by American Woolen.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-15"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left: bales of raw wool, fabric dyes, and the drying and inspecting of the fabric — always by hand — when it&#39;s completed. </span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The first reality check came when none of Loro Piana’s existing clients agreed to work with American Woolen. “Everybody told us they were buying from us,” Mr. Long said. “Nobody did.”</p><p>He poured all his energy and boyish charm into winning new contracts, imagining that many would jump at the chance to work with a local mill and attach a “Made in the U.S.A.” label to their designs. Instead, he found himself sitting in the lobbies of New York fashion brands with his sample book of fabrics waiting for meetings that sometimes never came.</p><p>“I’d be told by the secretary, ‘It’s been three hours. I don’t think they’re going to see you,’” Mr. Long said, laughing.</p><p>The apparel industry is fickle, competitive and, above all, cost conscious. Every few months, Mr. Long said, American Woolen would get interest from brands like J. Crew, Brooks Brothers and Timberland, all of which eventually became clients. But these labels and their competitors were also getting cheaper fabric abroad, or buying Italian fabric because “Made in Italy” tends to be more of a selling point for U.S. consumers — a problem Loro Piana probably faced when it tried to sell American-made fabrics from the Connecticut mill.</p><p>With payroll to meet, drafty factory buildings to heat and very little revenue, American Woolen was bleeding money every month. This went on for years.</p><p>The issue was never quality: Many American Woolen workers were trained by Loro Piana on expensive Italian machines and are experts at producing luxurious fabric. And Mr. Long had succeeded in luring Mr. Monteleone, 62, the gifted engineer, back from Italy to run the mill as vice president of production operations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Inside those old buildings, Mr. Long had what amounted to a Ferrari, certainly as compared with the fallen state of many U.S. textile mills, but he couldn’t seem to make the fashion industry care.</p><p>“The low point — and this was a low point — came in 2017 at a trade show in Chicago,” he said. “A suit manufacturer looked at me and said: ‘Jacob, you know what we need from you? We need an Italian-designed cloth offered at a Chinese price point, but made in America.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Everybody told us they were buying from us,” Mr. Long said, referring to Loro Piana’s former clients at the mill. “Nobody did.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-79373392">In the red</h2><p>Mr. Long is nothing if not persistent. His father, John H.

And he beat everybody. He was that way about everything. He would work and work and work.”</p><p>The elder Mr. Long says he has watched how the mill has stressed and aged his son.</p><p>“He’s had the unenviable task of nobody wanting to listen to his story,” the father said. “I’ve watched his hair gray.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>By 2020, six years into his quixotic decision to uproot his life and buy an old mill, Mr. Long’s hard work had yielded little gains.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-24"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/02/ST-AMERICAN-WOOLEN-vids-28368-cover/ST-AMERICAN-WOOLEN-vids-28368-cover-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/02/ST-AMERICAN-WOOLEN-vids-28368-cover/ST-AMERICAN-WOOLEN-vids-28368-cover-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/06/02/141113_1_ST-AMERICAN-WOOLEN-vids-28368_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A worker tacking fabric—that is, sewing it together — before applying a flannel finish.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>That same year, the coronavirus pandemic forced American Woolen to shut down, while two important clients, Brooks Brothers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/business/j-crew-bankruptcy-coronavirus.html" title="">J.
