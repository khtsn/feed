Turow had successfully defended him in an earlier, less grave case, but this time he was clearly guilty.</p><p>It was a tragedy on many levels. But what struck Turow about the conversation was the mother’s fierce, primal love for her son despite everything. “She was just torn apart,” he said.</p><p>That memory was floating in the back of his mind as he conceived his latest novel, “Presumed Guilty,” about a high school student accused of murdering his girlfriend on a camping trip gone awry. The plot was inspired, too, by the 2021 <a href="https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/gabby-petito-brian-laundrie-case-details" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">murder of Gabby Petito</a>, killed by a boyfriend whose parents closed ranks to protect him.</p><p>“I’ve always been struck by how terrible it is, what a shattering experience, for a parent when a child gets accused of a serious crime,” Turow said. “They think, ‘Is my love for this child so huge that I can’t recognize that he or she is a monster?’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Presumed Guilty” is Turow’s 13th novel, and the third to feature the former prosecutor (and now former judge) Rusty Sabich.
