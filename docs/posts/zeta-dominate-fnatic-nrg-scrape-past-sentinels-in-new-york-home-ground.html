<p>NRG entered the series in control, only forfeiting the pistol and two more rounds on Pearl as they racked up round after round. Come halftime, NRG led by four as Sentinels prepared to recover from an 8-4 deficit.</p>

<p>Even after their opponents stole away the pistol courtesy of a 1v3 from <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2172/brawk">
		brawk	</a>
</span>, Sentinels remained vigilant and composed, taking away four rounds of their own. NRG answered back with a single round to cement an 11-8 scoreline, but were unable to stave off what looked like a comeback from SEN City.</p>

<p>In the end, it was <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11494/keiko">

</span> that gifted NRG the two openers that helped them convert a 12-11 lead into a victory. The battle of the Waylays ended up with <span data-ref-id="6">

<p>ZETA continued their Cinderella run by steamrolling FNATIC on Bind after amassing an early 8-0 lead. Fans eagerly anticipating another 1-11 comeback were left to the dregs of their imagination as ZETA crushed any hopes of recovery.</p>

<p>Top performers <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1960/eko">
		eKo	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/34776/absol">

</span> put up masterclasses on Waylay and Raze, both ending the map positive across the board. <span data-ref-id="12">

		kaajak	</a>
</span>, who looked comfortable against Cloud9 an hour earlier, were unable to keep up with ZETA, the latter going 0-4 in first interactions.</p>

<p>Every 1v1 scenario ended in a ZETA win as each and every player was also able to attain a multikill at some point across the map. While all ZETA players ended Bind above a 1.10 rating, only <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4/crashies">
		crashies	</a>
</span> was able to scrape by with a 1.01, <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/438/boaster">
		Boaster	</a>
</span> only managing to attain a 0.17 with a 3-14 K/D.</p>

<p>ZETA will now have to prove themselves in a three-map series against NRG tomorrow should they wish to advance to Sunday&#39;s grand finals.</p>
