Kennedy Jr. pick federal health officials for the incoming Trump administration has petitioned the government to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine, which for decades has protected millions of people from a virus that can cause paralysis or death.</p><p>That campaign is just one front in the war that the lawyer, Aaron Siri, is waging <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/childhood-diseases-vaccines-preventable.html" title="">against vaccines of all kinds</a>.</p><p>Mr. Siri has also filed a petition seeking to pause the distribution of 13 other vaccines; challenged, and in some cases quashed, Covid vaccine mandates around the country; sued federal agencies for the disclosure of records related to vaccine approvals; and subjected prominent vaccine scientists to grueling videotaped depositions.</p><p>Much of Mr. Siri’s work — including the polio petition filed in 2022 — has been on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network, a nonprofit whose founder is a close ally of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Siri also represented Mr. Kennedy during his presidential campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Kennedy, President-elect Donald J. Trump’s choice for health secretary, has said that he does not want to take away access to any vaccines. But as he prepares for his confirmation hearing and plans a fresh health agenda, his continuing close partnership with Mr. Siri suggests that vaccine policy will be under sharp scrutiny. It is a chilling prospect to many public health leaders, especially those who recall the deadly toll of some vaccine-mitigated diseases.</p><p>At the Trump transition headquarters in Florida, Mr. Siri has joined Mr. Kennedy in questioning and choosing candidates for top health positions, according to someone who observed the interactions but insisted on anonymity to disclose private conversations. They have asked candidates about their views of vaccines, the person said.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has privately expressed interest in having Mr. Siri serve in the Health and Human Services Department’s top legal job, general counsel. However, Mr. Siri has suggested he may have more influence outside the administration. At his law firm, Siri &amp; Glimstad, he oversees about 40 professionals working on vaccine cases and policy.</p><p>“Somebody on the outside needs to be petitioning them,” he <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-399-face-the-facts/id1227863378?i=1000677916588" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on a podcast</a> in late November.</p><p>Either way, it’s clear that his voice will be heard at the highest levels.</p><p>“I love Aaron Siri,” Mr. Kennedy said in a clip played <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-highwire-with-del-bigtree/id1227863378?i=1000677916588" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on a recent episode</a> of a podcast hosted by Del Bigtree, who is Mr. Kennedy’s former campaign communications director and the founder of the Informed Consent Action Network, which describes itself as a “medical freedom” nonprofit. “There’s nobody who’s been a greater asset to the medical freedom movement than him.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Like Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Siri insists he does not want to take vaccines away from anyone who wants them. “You want to get the vaccine — it’s America, a free country.” he <a href="https://www.sirillp.com/aaron-siri-testimony-at-arizona-state-senate-ncswic-hearing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Arizona legislators</a> last year after laying out his concerns about the vaccines for polio and other illnesses.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert F.

Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kennedy, said Mr. Siri has been advising Mr. Kennedy but has not discussed his petitions with any of the health nominees. She added, “Mr. Kennedy has long said that he wants transparency in vaccines and to give people choice.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>If the Senate confirms Mr. Kennedy as health secretary, he will oversee the F.D.A. In that capacity, he could take the rare step of intervening in the F.D.A.’s review of the petitions.</p><p>Vaccines undergo <a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/vaccines-101/how-are-vaccines-made/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extensive testing</a> before they are approved, and are monitored for safety after they come on the market. The process of taking an established drug off the market can be lengthy. The F.D.A. would need to outline a new safety concern in writing and give the vaccine’s maker a chance to respond. The F.D.A. would then hold a hearing and render a decision. If the company did not agree with the outcome, it could sue.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Kennedy have spoken about vaccines, the president-elect told Time magazine <a href="https://time.com/7201565/person-of-the-year-2024-donald-trump-transcript/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an interview</a> published Thursday. Mr. Trump pledged to do “very serious testing” and to get rid of some vaccines “if I think it’s dangerous, if I think they are not beneficial.”</p><p>During an appearance last weekend on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Mr. Trump said he was open to a review of vaccines and autism. But he singled out the polio vaccine as a potential exception.</p><p>“The polio vaccine is the greatest thing,” Mr. Trump said. “If someone told me get rid of the polio vaccine, they’re going to have to work really hard to convince me.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Public health experts describe the <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/e68bd8b142eb7bf0/914e0b90-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polio petition</a> as troubling. In 2022, an unvaccinated man in New York became paralyzed <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37435800/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after contracting polio</a>, and experts say the virus is still circulating worldwide.</p><p>“It’s an airplane ride away,” warned Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a Vanderbilt University vaccine scientist who was subjected to one of Mr. Siri’s lengthy depositions.</p><p>Some vaccine scientists credit Mr. Siri for drilling into the details of vaccine research that he cites to make his arguments. In some cases, he aligns with vaccine scientists, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1448370/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including a team</a> that in 2004 called for an independent body to review vaccine safety outside agencies that fund or approve them.</p><p>Dr. Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said Mr. Siri raises “points that are worthy of exploration,” such as his concern about the safety of aluminum in vaccines.</p><p>“There are issues that he raises, such as this one, that really deserve to be studied carefully,” Dr. Salmon said. “But it’s got to be done carefully — it’s hard to do.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Yet Mr. Siri’s ascent is concerning to some doctors, who note that it comes at a time of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">falling vaccination rates</a> in the United States and a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=Measles%20cases%20in%202024&amp;text=There%20have%20been%2016%20outbreaks,59)%20were%20outbreak%2Dassociated." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rise in cases of measles</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">whooping cough</a>. His detractors say he twists snippets of science to make questionable claims that will deepen vaccine hesitancy, threatening the system of childhood vaccines that is credited with saving millions of lives.</p><p>One critic is Dr. Stanley Plotkin, who in the 1960s <a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/history/stanley-plotkin-md/overview" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">invented the vaccine that eliminated rubella</a>, a disease that killed thousands of newborns. Dr. Plotkin, who was subjected to a nine-hour deposition as an expert witness in a lawsuit brought by Mr. Siri, said having Mr. Siri in a position of influence “would be a disaster.” He added: “I find him laughable in many ways — except, of course, that he’s a danger to public health.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Del Bigtree, who is Mr. Kennedy’s former campaign communications director and the founder of the Informed Consent Action Network, during an anti-vaccine rally outside the New York State Capitol in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Desiree Rios for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-5fb00020">A fruitful alliance</h2><p>Mr. Siri first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/nyregion/new-york-court-rules-against-flu-shot-mandate-for-young-children.html" title="">made news in a vaccine case</a> in New York City in 2015, challenging a rule that required preschool children to get an annual flu shot. He delayed the rule for several years, but lost the case on appeal.</p><p>The work caught the attention of Mr. Bigtree, a former television producer who was winding up a national bus tour for the movie “<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/04/01/vaxxed-autism-movie-review/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe</a>,” which was pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival over the concerns of public health leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Bigtree has said on his podcast that he had realized that he needed a capable lawyer to advance his campaign challenging vaccine safety. Through his nonprofit, which flourished during the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Bigtree began funding Mr. Siri’s legal efforts, paying his law firm $5.3 million in 2022, the most recent year records are available.</p><p>Over the years, Mr. Siri has <a href="https://www.sirillp.com/aaron-siri/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped clients avoid</a> vaccination requirements. He won a case seeking a religious <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/us/politics/mississippi-childhood-vaccine-mandates.html" title="">exemption from vaccines</a> in Mississippi schools, and convinced a judge to <a href="https://www.sirillp.com/newsmax-aaron-siri-discusses-san-diego-judges-ruling-against-student-vaccine-mandate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strike down</a> a Covid vaccine mandate in San Diego public schools.</p><p>In 2017, Mr. Siri and Mr. Bigtree joined with Mr. Kennedy to meet with the government’s top vaccine experts, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who has since retired from government service, and Dr. Francis Collins, then director of the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>Afterward, N.I.H. leaders worked through Mr. Kennedy’s relatives to introduce him to Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert who had a daughter with autism. Dr. Hotez said he tried to explain that researchers believe autism is largely genetic and is observed in early fetal development, before vaccines are administered. “R.F.K. Jr. was deeply dug in,” Dr. Hotez said. “He wasn’t interested in information and the science.”</p><p>In 2018, Mr. Siri’s star rose with vaccine skeptics after he deposed two renowned vaccine scientists: Dr. Plotkin and Dr. Edwards, who helped create vaccines for whooping cough and flu and one to prevent infection with a deadly bacterium, Haemophilus influenzae type B.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Siri grilled them each for more than eight hours for two separate cases, one in Tennessee, the other in Michigan. Mr. Bigtree later posted <a href="https://thehighwire.com/ark-videos/the-deposition-of-stanley-plotkin/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">snippets</a> of both depositions online, which made the doctors pariahs among vaccine skeptics.</p><p>“You’re taking the leaders in vaccinology,” Dr. Edwards said, “the people that have spent their whole lives studying these vaccines and seeing their impact, you’re marginalizing and making them look like they are prostitutes of pharma.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy, who is also a lawyer, <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/eba04919a69cf77b/2e2b69ad-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joined Mr. Siri and others</a> in pushing the Tennessee case forward, accusing a doctor of malpractice for giving a boy a measles, mumps and rubella shot in 2001 that <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/william-yates-hazlehurst-autism-childhood-vaccine-injury-liability/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">they claimed</a> caused his autism. They sought $75 million to cover his lifetime care.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy sat through the trial and at the end, in early 2022, delivered closing arguments to the jury.

Given the known risks of polio causing paralysis that can seize major organs and kill people, such work is considered unethical.</p><p>“You’re substituting a theoretical risk for a real risk,” said Dr. Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. ”The real risks are the diseases.”</p><p>Mr. Siri’s petition to withdraw the polio vaccine also claims that the manufacturer “only assessed safety for up to three days after injection,” and therefore did not meet the F.D.A.’s standard for safety.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Ayman Chit, head of vaccines for North America at Sanofi, which makes the polio vaccine that is subject to the petition, said the vaccine has been widely used in North America and Europe and studied carefully in trials with as long as six months of safety follow-up.</p><p>Dr. Chit said development of the vaccine began in 1977 and included more than 300 studies before and after it was approved. He said more than 280 million people had received the vaccine worldwide. </p><p>Mr. Siri has also pushed to eliminate secrecy around government decision making.
