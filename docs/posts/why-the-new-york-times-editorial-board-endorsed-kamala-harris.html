She has the New York Times’ editorial board’s endorsement. Hi, I’m Kathleen Kingsbury and I oversee the opinion report at the New York Times including its editorial board. With all the discussion about presidential endorsements this fall, I thought it would be helpful to explain how and why the New York Times’ Editorial Board weighs in on political races. First, it’s important to remind you that News and Opinion are separate at the times. The teams do not coordinate editorially at all. The Times first endorsed a candidate for president in 1860. In that incredibly consequential race on the cusp of an American Civil War, the board recommended voters choose Abraham Lincoln for the White House. This year, the Editorial Board has worked hard to explain the stakes in this election. We’ve said over and over and over again how Donald Trump is temperamentally and morally unfit to be president. Like for all of our editorials, the board has done reporting. We’ve done research on their policy positions. We’ve had deep discussions. We’ve relied on long standing values and precedents. We got the input of our publisher, A.G. Sulzberger. I myself attended both Trump and Harris rallies, spoke to dozens of American voters, and attended both parties political conventions. We concluded, as all voters should, that Vice President Harris is qualified for the job and Donald Trump is not. I invite you to read or listen to our editorial. “There’s Only One Patriotic Choice for President,” on the times website. And please remember to vote in November.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="playlist-block"><div id="Opinion"><p>Recent episodes in</p><!-- --> <p><span>Opinion</span></p></div><div><p>Opinion Video features innovative video journalism commentary — argued essays, Op-Ed videos, documentaries, and fact-based explanation of current affairs.
