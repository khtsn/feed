    <h1>A Caller Told 911 a Bear Had Chased Him Off a Cliff. The Police Say It Was Murder.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The 911 caller in rural Tennessee told a dispatcher on Oct. 18 that he had been injured when a bear chased him off a cliff and into water. But when emergency workers arrived, the authorities said, they found something entirely different.</p><p>There, near a bridge on the scenic Cherohala Skyway, which runs through the town of Tellico Plaines, they found the body of a man who they said had been killed, according to the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office. He had the identification of someone named Brandon Kristopher Andrade, the name given by the 911 caller.</p><p>But soon, they said, they learned that the body was not that of Mr. Andrade, that Mr. Andrade’s I.D. had been stolen, and that a parolee with a long criminal history named Nicholas Wayne Hamlett, 45, had used that identity.</p><p>On Friday, Sheriff Tommy J. Jones II of Monroe County said that a warrant had been issued for Mr. Hamlett’s arrest on a first-degree murder charge and that he was on the run. He is considered “armed and dangerous,” according to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1044339927707394&amp;set=pcb.1044341157707271" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a>.</p></div></div>
