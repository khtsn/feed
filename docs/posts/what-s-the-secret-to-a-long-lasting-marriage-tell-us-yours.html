    <h1>What’s the Secret to a Long-Lasting Marriage? Tell Us Yours.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marriage is one of life’s most significant commitments, impacting the way we grow and navigate the world. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/fashion/weddings" title="">Weddings section</a> has spent decades chronicling the stories of couples who found each other in extraordinary — and sometimes very ordinary — ways. Many of these relationships have stood the test of time, enduring personal reinvention, global crises, health issues and life’s other trials and triumphs.</p><p>So what’s the secret to a long-lasting marriage?</p><p>We’re looking for couples from all walks of life — whether they were featured in a Times wedding announcement or not — who have faced challenges, embraced change and found ways to sustain their love for 30 years or more. </p><p>Selected couples will be interviewed and photographed as a part of an upcoming project. We look forward to hearing from you.</p></div></div>
