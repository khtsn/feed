The mosque was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/07/world/hindu-militants-destroy-mosque-setting-off-a-new-crisis-in-india.html" title="">destroyed in 1992</a> by Hindu nationalists, which set off widespread violence in the country that killed thousands of people, primarily Muslims.</p><p>The new temple was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/asia/india-ram-temple-ayodhya.html" title="">dedicated this past January by Narendra Modi</a>, India’s hard-line Hindu nationalist prime minister, at a ceremony that was also followed by widespread anti-Muslim violence. Ankur Vaidya, the chairman of the board of trustees for the group organizing the parade, the Federation of Indian Associations, said on Wednesday that a model of a temple — measuring 8 feet by 8 feet by 16 feet — would be driven down Madison Avenue on the float.</p><p>But he noted that the model was not being advertised as depicting the temple in Ayodhya.</p><p>“This is being mixed into a jambalaya of assumptions,” Mr. Vaidya said, although he added that the Ayodhya temple was important to Hindus, and that the float was a special addition to this year’s parade because “the temple opened this year.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>In <a href="https://iamc.com/anti-muslim-float-at-india-day-parade/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a letter</a>, a coalition of Muslim American and Indian American groups have asked Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul to prevent the float from appearing in the parade. At a news conference on Wednesday, the groups called the float an affront to American values.</p><p>“Think about it. This is happening in New York City,” Husnaa Vhora, a representative of the Indian American Muslim Council, told a crowd gathered near City Hall. “For it to happen anywhere in the United States is appalling, but for it to happen in New York City, the Big Apple, the melting pot, amplifies the sentiment.”</p><p>Another speaker, Eklan Singh, a member of the Dalit Solidarity Forum, said that the idea of celebrating images of the Ram Temple in a Manhattan parade felt like “mocking the Statue of Liberty.”</p><p>The uproar over the scheduled appearance of what Muslims see as a symbol of bigotry in <a href="https://fianynjct.org/india-day-parade/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sunday’s parade</a>, which marches down Madison Avenue in Manhattan, appears to have caught some elected officials in New York off guard.</p><p>Mr. Adams has participated in the India Day Parade in the past, including in <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPRAFq1Uey9uAYNf8KFc8lEek2rsUcjJRsVF_t6SC1ru9TnAS4KSit9O8_dd7K1Xw?pli=1&amp;key=dXlSNjlMd1Z1MDhTMnhTRjJZWkNfU1pabzBYVEhR" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2023</a> and <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNOMOB9ObvJpiAyDzf0Zs8zKJdY738OxwH6jZXqBIGfqRF59Mhwx-h3Nf3lZVLjOg?key=MmIwWFRnVFFfRmZhQ3JGRFR1RHlQejNweXBtU0x3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2022</a>. On Wednesday, he said he had not been invited to this year’s event “but I don’t support hate, and I’ve made that clear.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>“I want to send the right symbolic gesture that the city is open to everyone and there’s no room for hate,” Mr. Adams said at a news conference. “And if there is a float or a person in the parade that is promoting hate, they should not.”</p><p>When asked at a news conference on Tuesday if he was sufficiently attuned to the concerns of Muslim New Yorkers, Mr. Adams appeared dismissive.</p><p>“I’m not going to be judged by man,” <a href="https://x.com/danarubinstein/status/1823389595943481468" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the mayor said</a>. “God judges me.”</p><p>But on Wednesday, the mayor softened his language, saying he had “a long record on standing up on behalf of the Muslim community” in New York.</p><p>On Wednesday, parade organizers said Mr. Adams had been invited to march.</p><p>“Maybe he hasn’t gotten the invitation request we submitted, which is a possibility,” Mr. Vaidya said. “We don’t know how their internal system works so I don’t know whether they have seen it or not.”</p><p>The inclusion of the float has been advertised in fliers on and offline by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America, an offshoot of India’s Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a right-wing nationalist organization. <a href="https://www.vhp-america.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An image posted online</a> by the group showed a sketch of the float, surrounded by people dancing and celebrating. The organization did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Vaidya declined to say outright whether the float depicted the temple in Ayodhya. He also rejected the idea that the temple or depictions of it were anti-Muslim or meant to celebrate the destruction of the mosque.</p><p>“Even if it said this was the Ayodhya temple, if we go down that path, there is a much broader discussion that follows,” he said, pointing to both the site’s religious significance to Hindus and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/world/asia/india-court-acquits-ayodhya.html" title="">an Indian court ruling</a> in 2020 that acquitted all suspects in the mosque’s demolition.</p><p>“In the Hindu scriptures, Ayodhya is the birthplace of the Lord Rama,” Mr. Vaidya said. “The intent is to showcase in a small way a temple that was inaugurated there by the community, for those that want to come and see what a miniature glimpse of it looks like.”</p><p>In <a href="https://iamc.com/anti-muslim-float-at-india-day-parade/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the letter</a> to the mayor and the governor, the coalition called the float “hateful and bigoted” and said its inclusion in a parade in New York City was “an affront to American values and to harmony and peaceful coexistence among our diverse communities.”</p><p>“It emboldens Hindu extremists to advance their supremacist agenda in the United States and glorifies acts of violence, injustice and discrimination against Muslims,” the letter said. “We implore you to take immediate and decisive measures to prevent the inclusion of a polarizing and divisive float in the parade.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The coalition was joined in its efforts last week by three members of the City Council, Shekar Krishnan, Shahana Hanif and Zohran Mamdani, who wrote their own letter to Mr. Adams.</p><p>“As proud Indian American and Bangladeshi American, Hindu and Muslim elected officials representing New York City communities, we welcome the celebration of Indian culture and heritage on the streets of our great city,” <a href="https://x.com/Hindus4HR/status/1823347207761752233" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">they wrote in the letter</a>. “However, such public celebrations should not include symbols of division or bigotry.”</p><p>The India Day Parade began more than four decades ago and describes itself as the largest such parade outside of India. Organizers say the event attracts over 100,000 Indian Americans each year and features Bollywood celebrities and sports stars.</p><p>The temple that is slated to be depicted in this year’s parade was built on the site that was once home to the Babri Mosque, which was built in the late 1520s by the Emperor Babar. But Hindus believe that the mosque was built on the site of an even earlier temple. In 1992, the mosque was destroyed by what <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/07/world/hindu-militants-destroy-mosque-setting-off-a-new-crisis-in-india.html" title="">The Times described</a> as “a screaming mob of thousands of Hindu militants” who destroyed the building “with sledgehammers and their bare hands.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In 1992, Hindu nationalists tore down a mosque in an episode that led to waves of violence and deaths in India. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sunil Malhotra/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>India’s prime minister at the time, P.V.
