Trump lost the 2020 election.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“In the debate, you were asked to clarify if you believe Trump lost the 2020 election. Do you believe he lost the 2020 election?” “I think that Donald Trump and I have both raised a number of issues with the 2020 election, but we’re focused on the future. I think there’s an obsession here with focusing on 2020. I’m much more worried about what happened after 2020, which is a wide-open border, groceries that are unaffordable. And look—” “Senator, yes or no? Did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?” “Let me ask you a question. Is it OK that big technology companies censored the Hunter Biden laptop story, which independent analysis have said cost Donald Trump millions of votes?” “Senator Vance, I’m going to ask you again, did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?” “Did big technology companies censor a story that independent studies have suggested would have cost Trump millions of votes? I think that’s the question.” “Senator Vance, I’m going to ask you again. Did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?” “And I’ve answered your question with another question. You answer my question and I’ll answer yours.” “I have asked this question repeatedly. It is something that is very important for the American people to know. There is no proof, legal or otherwise, that Donald Trump did not lose the 2020 election.” “You’re repeating a slogan rather than engaging with what I’m saying, which is that when our own technology firms engage in industrial scale censorship, by the way, backed up by the federal government, in a way that independent studies suggest affect the votes, I’m worried about Americans who feel like there were problems in 2020. I’m not worried about this slogan that people throw, ‘Well, every court case went this way.’ I’m talking about something very discrete: a problem of censorship in this country that I do think affected things in 2020, and more importantly, that led to Kamala Harris’s governance, which has screwed this country up in a big way.” “Senator, would you have certified the election in 2020, yes or no?” “I’ve said that I would have voted against certification because of the concern that I just raised. I think that when you have technology companies—” “The answer is no.” “When you have technology companies censoring Americans at a mass scale in a way that, again, independent studies have suggested affect the vote, I think that it’s right to protest against that, to criticize that. And that’s a totally reasonable thing.” “So the answer is no. And the last question, will you support the election results this time and commit to a peaceful transfer of power?” “Well, first of all, of course we commit to a peaceful transfer of power. We are going to have a peaceful transfer of power. I, of course, believe that peaceful transfer of power is going to make Donald Trump the next president of the United States. But if there are problems, of course, in the same way that Democrats protested in 2004 and Donald Trump raised issues in 2020, we’re going to make sure that this election counts, that every legal ballot is counted. We’ve filed almost 100 lawsuits at the R.N.C. to try to ensure that every legal ballot has counted. I think you would maybe criticize that. We see that as an important effort to ensure election integrity, but certainly we’re going to respect the results in 2024. And I feel very confident they’re going to make Donald Trump the next president.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/us/politics/Vance_Cover/Vance_Cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">During an interview with Lulu Garcia-Navarro, host of “The Interview,” Senator JD Vance of Ohio repeatedly dodged a question on whether he believed Donald J.

Trump allies had maintained that documents on the laptop linked President Biden to corrupt business dealings, but those claims were unfounded.</p><p>“Senator Vance, I’m going to ask you again,” Ms. Garcia-Navarro said. “Did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?”</p><p>“Did big technology companies censor a story that independent studies have suggested would have cost Trump millions of votes?” Mr. Vance replied.</p><p>“Senator Vance,” Ms. Garcia-Navarro continued. “I’m going to ask you again, did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?”</p><p>“And I’ve answered your question with another question,” Mr. Vance said. “You answer my question and I’ll answer yours.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On her fifth request for a yes-or-no answer, Ms. Garcia-Navarro pointed out that there was “no proof, legal or otherwise,” of election fraud.</p><p>Mr. Vance dismissed that as “a slogan.”</p><p>“I’m not worried about this slogan that people throw, ‘Well, every court case went this way,’” Mr. Vance said. “I’m talking about something very discrete — a problem of censorship in this country that I do think affected things in 2020.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/multimedia/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/multimedia/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/multimedia/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Senator JD Vance of Ohio stands on the debate stage in front of a thin microphone as he looks to his left." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/multimedia/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/multimedia/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/multimedia/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/multimedia/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv/11pol-interview-vance-ltgv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“There’s an obsession here with focusing on 2020,” Mr. Vance said. “I’m much more worried about what happened after 2020, which is a wide-open border, groceries that are unaffordable.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>During his 90-minute debate with Mr. Walz, Mr. Vance twice refused to answer a direct question about whether Mr. Trump had lost the 2020 election. It was widely considered his weakest debate moment and may have turned off voters. In CNN’s <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/se/date/2024-10-01/segment/02" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">focus group</a> of seven undecided Michigan voters who watched the debate, the only person who settled on a pick after the event said he would support Vice President Kamala Harris specifically because of Mr. Vance’s refusal to acknowledge the 2020 election results.</p><p>Mr. Vance’s interview with The Times covered a range of subjects, including his conversion to Catholicism and the backlash over his attacks on “childless cat ladies.” But the exchange on the 2020 results showed he still had not found an answer to put the last election behind him. Acknowledging the truth that Mr. Biden won, of course, would discredit Mr. Trump’s claims and risk angering the former president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump has anchored his party to this issue — and raised concerns about the reaction that could follow the results on Nov. 5 — by continuing to dispute the 2020 contest.</p><p>Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge in a podcast interview last month that he had indeed “lost by a whisker,” but then insisted during his debate with Ms. Harris on Sept. 10 that “that was said sarcastically.”</p><p>“Look, there’s so much proof,” Mr. Trump said during the debate, after refusing to acknowledge his defeat. “All you have to do is look at it. And they should have sent it back to the legislatures for approval. I got almost 75 million votes.”</p><p>Mr. Trump received 74.2 million votes, but the presidency is decided by the Electoral College, not a nationwide popular vote. Still, Mr. Biden received 81.3 million votes.</p><p>Three weeks later, at the vice-presidential debate, Mr. Vance was asked directly by Mr. Walz whether Mr. Trump lost.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Tim, I’m focused on the future,” Mr. Vance told him. “Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?”</p><p>“That is a damning non-answer,” Mr. Walz shot back.</p><p>In his Times interview, Mr. Vance said he would not have voted to certify the 2020 results, and added that “we commit to a peaceful transfer of power” in 2024.</p><p>“If there are problems, of course, in the same way that Democrats protested in 2004 and Donald Trump raised issues in 2020,” Mr. Vance said, “we’re going to make sure that this election counts.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael C.
