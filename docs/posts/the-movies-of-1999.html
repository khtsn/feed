    <h1>The Movies of 1999</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>Do you remember 1999? The vibes were peculiar. On the one hand, politicians and pundits talked ceaselessly about “building a bridge to the 21st century” and entering the new millennium (even though <a href="https://clintonwhitehouse5.archives.gov/Initiatives/Millennium/when.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">technically it wouldn’t start till 2001</a>). On the other hand, fear lurked around all corners, mostly thanks to new technologies. The internet was still a place you wouldn’t dare use your real name, for reasons that were never totally clear. And the much-hyped Y2K bug left a lot of us wondering if society as we knew it was about to end because of faulty computer code, or something. (I recommend the delightful documentary “<a href="https://www.hbo.com/movies/time-bomb-y2k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time Bomb Y2K</a>” for reliving that weird moment.)</p><p>That collective mood — one of hope and fear mashed together — made 1999 an incredible year at the movies. Just look at the list: “Fight Club.” “The Matrix.” “Toy Story 2.” “Eyes Wide Shut.” “Office Space.” “Shakespeare in Love.” “Magnolia.” “The Green Mile.” “The Blair Witch Project.” “Being John Malkovich.” “The Virgin Suicides.”</p><p>There’s a feeling of danger in a lot of these movies, alongside a fixation on sex appeal and youthful ennui. You could go down to the movie theater and see a great rom-com like “You’ve Got Mail,” “Runaway Bride” or “Notting Hill,” a teen classic like “10 Things I Hate About You” or “American Pie,” a campy horror adventure like “The Mummy” or a sexy take on a classic novel like “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” which has one of the best casts of all time.</p><p>It’s striking to see how many of these movies are still beloved by both audiences and critics. Some of that has to do with eccentric creative visions. In 1999, studios still took chances on very peculiar movies instead of leaning on blandly imagined sequels to rake in megabucks. Yes, unsurprisingly, “Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace” ruled the box office. But the No. 2 film of the year was “The Sixth Sense,” from M. Night Shyamalan, which introduced a new and exciting voice through a totally new story.</p></div></div><div><div><p>There are other factors, too: 1999 was an inflection point in the industry, in which venerable masters like Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese were working alongside young upstarts like Paul Thomas Anderson, Spike Jonze, Sofia Coppola and the Wachowskis. And though we weren’t yet living in a world in which everyone carried a high-definition video camera in their pocket, recording technology was becoming cheaper, lighter and more accessible. That meant you could start shooting a movie like “The Blair Witch Project” with a paltry $35,000 in your pocket and turn it into $250 million.</p><p>Over on The Times’s Culture desk, we’ve been talking about 1999 all year. Our “Class of 1999” series examines some of the movies, celebrities and ideas that emerged a quarter-century ago, and how they remain significant today. I kicked off the series by writing about how the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/movies/the-matrix-ai-film.html" title="">opening scene in “The Matrix”</a> proved remarkably prescient. My colleague Maya Salam had a fascinating essay on how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/movies/blair-witch-project-reality-anniversary.html" title="">“The Blair Witch Project” foreshadowed our age of misinformation</a>. Melena Ryzik profiled the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/movies/haley-joel-osment-sixth-sense.html" title="">breakout star of “The Sixth Sense,” Haley Joel Osment,</a> and his post-child-star career.</p><p>What’s been amazing about revisiting the films of 1999 is realizing that, for as much as the world has changed, a lot has stayed the same. Looking at a few of this year’s biggest movies — “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” “Twisters,” “A Quiet Place: Day One” — I think that mix of optimism and fear set the tone for the 21st century more than any of us expected.</p><h3 id="link-1439ed98"><span><strong>THE WEEK IN CULTURE</strong></span></h3><p>Film and TV</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gena Rowlands in 2014.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Pizzello/Invision, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A party at the Loft, a nightclub on Martha’s Vineyard.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriela Herman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kamala Harris at a rally yesterday in Raleigh, N.C.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><ul><li><p>Kamala Harris laid out an economic agenda <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/kamala-harris-raleigh-nc-economy.html" title="">focused on bringing down the cost of living</a>, pledging at a North Carolina rally to advance “economic security, stability and dignity” for the middle class.</p></li><li><p>Harris’s plans call for building more housing, subsidizing first-time home buyers and increased tax credits for parents.

A combination of Italian deli favorites like chunks of salami, marinated artichoke hearts, roasted peppers and provolone cheese, this hearty mix is lightened by juicy ripe cherry tomatoes along with fresh basil and parsley. Dan also adds a can of butter beans, but if you can’t find them, canned chickpeas work just as well. For the best flavor, let the salad sit in the fridge for at least an hour before serving; this gives it — and the cook — ample time to chill before dinner.</p><h3 id="link-490546c"><span><strong>T MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photograph by Collier Schorr.

The ultrathin patty offers a wider platform for toppings and maximizes umami flavor. But achieving the perfect smash is easy if — and only if — you have the right equipment. After much trial and error, I’ve found that a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-grill-press-for-smash-burgers/" title="">stainless steel grill press</a> is the best tool for the job. And it’s not just great for burgers. Use it to make evenly toasted grilled cheeses, griddled cinnamon rolls, crispy asparagus spears, smashed mini potatoes and more. — <em>Maki Yazawas</em></p><h3 id="link-d9f2895"><span><strong>GAME OF THE WEEK</strong></span></h3></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Aaron Judge</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Hooley/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>New York Yankees vs. Detroit Tigers, M.L.B.:</strong> Comparisons to Babe Ruth can feel like sacrilege to baseball fans — especially Yankees fans — but Aaron Judge has earned it.
