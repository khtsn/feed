Legislators and activists are pushing prosecutors to pursue criminal charges. Children are suing governments, arguing that their right to a healthy environment is being trampled on.</p><p>Welcome to the new universe of climate litigation, where the courts have become one of the most important battlegrounds in the fight over the greenhouse gas emissions warming the planet.</p><p>Around the world, both innovative and old-school legal arguments are being used to go after companies and governments to seek redress or forestall future harms. At the same time, the fossil fuel industry and its allies have powerful new legal grounds at their disposal to challenge climate rules. A number of cases could be taken up by the highest courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and The Hague.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>There are myriad lawsuits, which fit into several important categories.

The vast majority of those were filed in just the past nine years since the signing of the 2015 Paris accord, the landmark agreement among nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>About 40 percent of the lawsuits examined by the group sought compensation for climate-related damage to the environment or communities. Others challenged what they called misleading advertising claims, or alleged that the companies had failed to sufficiently reduce their emissions.</p><p>So far, no oil and gas company has had to pay liability claims exclusively for damage associated with climate change, according to Oil Change International. But, it says, such lawsuits could dissuade investment in fossil fuel infrastructure by increasing the financial risks.</p><p>The cases include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A major victory for environmentalists:</strong> A court in the Netherlands ruled in 2021 that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/business/royal-dutch-shell-climate-change.html" title="">Royal Dutch Shell must reduce its emissions</a> by 45 percent by 2030. The case was filed by Milieudefensie, the Dutch wing of Friends of the Earth. Similar cases have since been filed in other European countries. The company, now known as Shell, has appealed. A Shell spokeswoman said the company believes that “smart policy from government and action from all sectors” is the way forward on climate change, rather than court action.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><ul><li><p><strong>A Peruvian suing in Germany:</strong> With the help of a German nonprofit, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/09/magazine/climate-change-peru-law.html" title="">Peruvian farmer, Saúl Luciano Lliuya</a>, sued the German electricity producer RWE in 2015, alleging that the company’s emissions contributed to the melting of a glacier near his home and that the company should help pay for a dam to protect him and his neighbors from flooding. His case was dismissed, but Mr. Lliuya is expected to appear at an appeals court hearing in Germany next year.</p><p>The company expects the suit to be dismissed again, a spokeswoman said on Thursday, in line with decisions by German courts in suits against car companies that relied on similar claims.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Saúl Luciano Lliuya in Peru.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Luka Gonzales/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-5f403350">Cities and states are among the plaintiffs.</h2><p>In the United States, more than two dozen of the lawsuits against oil companies have been filed by state and local governments.</p><p>Many argue that the oil companies knew about the dangers of climate change for years, but concealed that information. The approach is similar to those of past lawsuits that led to landmark settlements with tobacco and opioid companies. Major cases include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Deception claims in Hawaii:</strong> A case filed by the City and County of Honolulu against Sunoco and other companies alleges that they deceived the public about climate change. This case was filed in Hawaii state court, but the companies argue that the regulation of interstate pollution is governed by federal, not state, law.</p><p>The case could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. In June, the Supreme Court asked the solicitor general, who supervises government litigation, for her input, a sign it could take up the case. If the jurisdiction question is taken all the way to the Supreme Court, it may not bode well for environmentalists, given the court’s majority of conservative justices.</p><p>In a filing to the Supreme Court in February, lawyers for Sunoco and the other companies wrote that the cases “present a serious threat to one of the nation’s most vital industries” and that allowing them to proceed was a “blueprint for chaos.” The company declined to comment on Thursday.</p></li><li><p><strong>Massachusetts’ Exxon Mobil suit:</strong> The case that might be closest to trial is in Massachusetts, where in 2019 then-Attorney General Maura Healey sued Exxon Mobil, arguing that the company had violated consumer protection laws by misleading customers and investors about its role in climate change. The company did not respond to a request for comment.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators in Brussels marched in favor of an ecocide law last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicolas Maeterlinck/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-15ce9c45">Should there be criminal charges?</h2><p>There are growing calls for prosecutors to consider criminal charges related to climate change.</p><p>This year, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, both Democrats, <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/_big_oil.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called on</a> Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate oil companies for what they called a “decades-long disinformation campaign” about the effects of fossil fuels.</p><p>In a recent <a href="https://journals.law.harvard.edu/elr/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2024/04/02_HLE_48_1_Arkush-Braman.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paper</a> in The Harvard Environmental Law Review, David Arkush, of the advocacy group Public Citizen, and Donald Braman, a law professor at George Washington University, argued that in the United States, fossil fuel companies could be charged with types of homicide short of first-degree murder based on claims of deception about climate change.</p><p>There has been movement on criminal cases elsewhere:</p><ul><li><p><strong>“Ecocide” as a crime in Belgium: </strong>This year, the country’s Parliament codified ecocide, defined as unlawful acts committed with knowledge of a substantial likelihood of serious damage to the environment, as a crime. And this week at The Hague, ecocide was formally introduced for consideration by member states at the International Criminal Court.</p></li><li><p><strong>Complaint in Paris against TotalEnergies:</strong> In May, environmental groups filed a complaint against the board of directors and main shareholders of TotalEnergies, arguing they should be held criminally liable for decisions that contributed to climate change. The alleged offenses included deliberately endangering the lives of others and involuntary manslaughter, among others. The company did not respond to a request for comment.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mine in Montana, a major coal-producing state.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Louise Johns for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-6a4f9d9b">Young people push for ‘climate rights.’</h2><p>The nonprofit law center Our Children’s Trust says it has filed climate lawsuits and legal actions in all 50 states.</p><p>Its most well-known case is Juliana v. United States, in which 21 young people argue that the government violated their constitutional rights by failing to protect the environment. It’s become a model for similar cases abroad, including a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/world/asia/south-korea-climate-action-verdict-youth.html" title="">victory for environmentalists in South Korea</a>.</p><p>The Juliana case has been wending its way through the courts for nearly a decade. In 2020, an appeals court threw it out entirely, concluding that the courts were not the right venue for the grievances. But on Thursday, the plaintiffs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/climate/juliana-lawsuit-supreme-court.html" title="">filed a petition</a> with the Supreme Court to send the case back to trial.</p><p>Other prominent cases from the same organization include:</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-15"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><ul><li><p><strong>A win in Montana coal country:</strong> A judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/14/us/montana-youth-climate-ruling.html" title="">last year ruled</a> that the state had violated its Constitution by not considering climate change when approving fossil fuel projects. Montana is a major coal- and gas-producing state. The attorney general has filed an appeal, and business groups have filed briefs supporting the state.</p><p>A spokesman for the attorney general, Austin Knudsen, called the case a “publicity stunt” and said Our Children’s Trust was “exploiting young Montanans in an effort to get attention and raise money for their political activism.”</p></li><li><p><strong>A Hawaii settlement:</strong> In June, Gov. Josh Green <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/climate/hawaii-youth-climate-lawsuit.html" title="">announced an agreement</a> with youth plaintiffs who had sued the state’s Transportation Department over its use of fossil fuels.

The decision is expected to lead to a torrent of cases challenging environmental regulations. There are already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/climate/supreme-court-epa.html" title="">significant challenges</a> to federal rules on issues like air pollution, many from Republican-led states and industry groups.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karen Zraick covers legal affairs for the Climate desk and the courtroom clashes playing out over climate and environmental policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karen-zraick">More about Karen Zraick</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/environmental-protection-agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/exxon-mobil-corporation">Exxon Mobil Corporation</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/international-criminal-court">International Criminal Court</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/royal-dutch-shell-plc">Shell Plc.</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Climate and the Environment</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Climate F.A.Q.:</strong> Do you have questions about climate change? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/climate/climate-change-faq.html">We’ve got answers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Climate Lawsuits: </strong>Lawsuits against fossil fuel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/climate/climate-lawsuits-major-cases.html">companies are piling up</a>.
