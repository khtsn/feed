He ignored fines and then fired X employees in Brazil so courts couldn’t hold them accountable. And then, after Brazil&#39;s Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/world/americas/brazil-elon-musk-x-blocked.html" title="">ordered X blocked</a> in the country, he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1829961684661780830?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> that Brazilians use software to circumvent the ban, despite the risk of large fines that a judge has threatened to impose for doing so.</p><p>Now he is defying the Brazilian government again. Starlink — the satellite-internet service controlled by Mr. Musk that has 250,000 customers in Brazil — told the country’s telecom agency on Sunday that it would not comply with orders to block X, the agency’s president said.</p><p>The retort further escalated a dispute that has already had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/technology/x-blocked-brazil-reactions.html" title="">consequences for millions of Brazilians</a> and for Mr. Musk’s business — and it suggested that Mr. Musk is not prepared to back down anytime soon.</p><p>The move also illustrated the sheer power of Mr. Musk and his business empire. Having built or bought leading companies with increasing control over how people connect and communicate, Mr. Musk is trying to leverage that influence to confront authorities and challenge laws he does not like.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Musk, X and SpaceX, the Musk-controlled company that runs Starlink, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/22/world/americas/brazil-alexandre-de-moraes.html" title="">Alexandre de Moraes</a>, the Brazilian Supreme Court justice who has led the action against X, froze Starlink’s assets in Brazil last week and blocked it from carrying out transactions in the country. He did so to try to collect on more than $3 million in fines against X for ignoring his orders to suspend accounts. Justice Moraes has accused X of spreading disinformation and hate speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Starlink, which arrived in Brazil in 2022, has given remote communities in the Amazon rainforest fast internet connections for the first time.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor Moriyama for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Sunday, Starlink informed Brazil’s telecom agency, Anatel, that it would not block X until Brazilian officials released Starlink&#39;s frozen assets, Anatel’s president, Carlos Baigorri, said in an interview <a href="https://g1.globo.com/politica/politico/noticia/2024/09/01/starlink-informa-ao-presidente-da-anatel-que-nao-vai-cumprir-decisao-de-moraes-sobre-suspensao-do-x.ghtml?UTM_SOURCE=copiar-url&amp;UTM_MEDIUM=share-bar-app&amp;UTM_CAMPAIGN=materias" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broadcast by the Brazilian outlet Globo News</a>.</p><p>Mr. Baigorri said he had received that response from Starlink’s lawyers. “Let’s wait and see if they formalize this in the records,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Baigorri said he had informed Justice Moraes “so that he can take the measures he deems appropriate.” Mr. Baigorri said his agency could revoke Starlink’s license to operate in Brazil, which would “hypothetically” prevent the company from offering connections to its Brazilian customers.</p><p>Yet Starlink could try to continue to provide service in Brazil without a license, though that would violate Brazilian law. Unlike traditional internet providers, which typically work with a series of internet-infrastructure companies to deliver connections, Starlink essentially connects its satellites directly to customers’ antennas. That could leave fewer ways for regulators to try to disrupt service.</p><p>If regulators revoked Starlink’s license and the company didn’t halt its service, Anatel could seize Starlink’s equipment at 23 ground stations it has in the country, which help improve the quality of its internet connections, Mr. Baigorri told Globo News.</p><p>Starlink has petitioned Brazil’s Supreme Court to unblock its assets, but the court quickly <a href="https://noticias.stf.jus.br/postsnoticias/stf-rejeita-acao-contra-bloqueio-de-contas-da-starlink/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dismissed the request</a>. Starlink has said that it would provide free internet service to its customers in Brazil while it is blocked from making transactions.</p><p>Mr. Musk has <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1829307275309093121?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> the financial sanctions on Starlink “absolutely illegal,” saying that Justice Moraes was punishing shareholders of SpaceX for the actions of X, a separate company. Mr. Musk said he owned 40 percent of SpaceX. He controls a majority of voting shares, according to company filings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Starlink has exploded in popularity in Brazil since it arrived in 2022. The service is particularly well suited to Brazil’s vast rural areas and the Amazon rainforest. Communities across the Amazon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/02/world/americas/starlink-internet-elon-musk-brazil-amazon.html" title="">including remote Indigenous tribes</a>, have used Starlink to log on with fast internet connections for the first time, transforming their way of life.</p><p>Starlink has also been a major business success for Mr. Musk and SpaceX. The company dominates the satellite-internet market and has said that it has more than three million customers in 102 countries.</p><p>Mr. Musk flew to Brazil in 2022 to announce Starlink’s arrival there alongside the country’s conservative then-president, Jair Bolsonaro. Mr. Musk said Starlink would provide internet connections to 19,000 rural schools in Brazil. Mr. Bolsonaro gave Mr. Musk a medal and called him a “true legend of freedom.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Brazilian Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered X blocked, accusing the platform of spreading disinformation and hate speech.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eraldo Peres/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Brazilian officials have since said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/technology/elon-musk-world-leaders.html" title="">they have no record</a> of Starlink providing internet to the schools. Mr. Baigorri, who helped approve Starlink’s entry into Brazil, told The Times in February that he never knew of any actual plans to connect the schools. “I don’t really think that it even existed,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Musk on Sunday shared a post that lauded him for providing internet to 19,000 Brazilian schools.</p><p>By Sunday evening, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/technology/x-blocked-brazil-reactions.html" title="">X had been blocked across Brazil</a>, aside from customers of Starlink.</p><p>The blackout is the result of a monthslong dispute between Mr. Musk and Justice Moraes. For years, the justice has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/world/americas/brazil-x-ban-free-speech.html" title="">carrying out a sweeping campaign</a> to clean up the Brazilian internet, in part by ordering social networks to suspend accounts that he says spread disinformation, hate speech or threats to democracy. He has often issued those orders under seal and with no explanation for why an account should be taken down, according to leaked copies of the orders.</p><p>Many of his orders have targeted prominent right-wing lawmakers and pundits, making Justice Moraes a top enemy of Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters. In April, Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/07/world/americas/brazil-politics-elon-musk-republicans.html" title="">began criticizing the judge</a> in posts on X, calling him a dictator and accusing him of illegally censoring conservative voices.</p><p>In recent weeks, X began ignoring orders from Justice Moraes to block X accounts. Justice Moraes then threatened to arrest X’s legal representative in Brazil. Mr. Musk responded by pulling X’s team from the country.</p><p>On Friday, Justice Moraes ordered Anatel to block X across the nation of 200 million because the company lacked a physical presence in Brazil. He also said that people in Brazil who use privacy software called virtual private networks, or VPNs, to circumvent the blackout and use X could face fines of nearly $9,000 a day, more than what the average Brazilian earns a year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>On Saturday, X began publishing sealed orders from Justice Moraes that directed X to suspend certain accounts. Mr. Musk shared the posts and criticized Justice Moraes, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1830062141744853281?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">adding</a> “Karma’s a b*tch bro.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Nicas is the Brazil bureau chief for The Times, based in Rio de Janeiro, where he leads coverage of much of South America.<span> </span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The World of Elon Musk</h2><h3>The billionaire’s portfolio includes the world’s most valuable automaker, an innovative rocket company and plenty of drama.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Brazil Blocks X: </strong>The social network <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/world/americas/brazil-elon-musk-x-blocked.html">began to go dark across Brazil</a> after the nation’s Supreme Court blocked X because Elon Musk refused to comply with court orders to suspend certain accounts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tesla’s Superchargers: </strong>Musk’s plan to open Tesla’s well-regarded charging network to electric vehicles from other carmakers is proceeding slowly. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/business/energy-environment/tesla-electric-vehicle-charging.html">Nobody is entirely sure why</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Twitter Blue’s Chaotic Revamp: </strong>The overhaul of the subscription service that lets users buy verified badges was the first big test for Musk as the platform’s new owner. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/technology/elon-musk-twitter-blue.html">It didn’t go well</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leaving San Francisco: </strong>X, founded in San Francisco as Twitter, is moving its headquarters to Texas as a shadow of its former self. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/technology/elon-musk-x-san-francisco.html">City officials are far from heartbroken</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Musk’s Trump Talk on X: </strong>Problems in the livestream of Musk’s chat with Donald Trump renewed questions about X’s ability to handle big events, but it also showed how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/elon-musk-x-donald-trump.html">the platform can still grab attention</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></article></div>
