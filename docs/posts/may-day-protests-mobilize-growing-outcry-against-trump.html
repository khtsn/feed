The event was one of more than 1,000 protests in cities across the country, organized by a coalition of grass-roots activist groups known as <a href="https://www.fiftyfifty.one/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">50501</a> to coincide with traditional May Day labor rallies.</p><p>A separate effort, billed as a National Law Day of Action, brought legal professionals to the Supreme Court and other locations to push for judicial independence and oppose the Trump administration’s efforts to weaponize the Justice Department and intimidate law firms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Large crowds were anticipated in New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, where police closed streets. The area around City Hall in Philadelphia will also be shut down for an evening event where Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, is slated to speak.</p><p>A rally in downtown Los Angeles focused largely on migrant rights. Jose Servín, 31, held a sign that read, “Come for one of us, come for all of us.” Mr. Servin is an organizer representing a statewide coalition of advocacy groups marching on Thursday.</p><p>“I found a place here where I can succeed, where I can thrive, where I can plant roots,” said Mr. Servín, who immigrated as a child. “And I’m going to fight like hell to protect that.”</p><p>Organizers in small towns say they are also expecting dozens, if not hundreds, of participants at protests in front of municipal buildings and public schools, with some wearing red to indicate support for public education. In Norman, Okla., and Sauk City, Wis., demonstrators planned to stand on bridges and display signs for motorists.</p><p>The Trump administration has engaged in efforts to quell dissent in corporate America, the civil service, universities and the media. But in recent weeks, demonstrations opposing Mr. Trump’s agenda, governing style and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-100-days-president-power-law.html" title="">expansion of executive power</a> have increased in size and frequency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Town halls have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/republicans-congress-town-halls-trump.html" title="">unruly</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/nyregion/mike-lawler-town-hall-trump.html" title="">combative</a>, pushing many Republican lawmakers to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/gop-town-hall.html" title="">avoid facing voters</a> altogether. And collective efforts by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/university-leaders-letter-trump.html" title="">universities</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/unions-cities-nonprofits-sue-block-trump-workforce-cuts-2025-04-29/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nonprofit groups</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/business/economy/government-union-trump-musk.html" title="">unions</a> and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/law-firms-perkins-coie-trump.html" title="">some law firms</a> have slowly started to build momentum against the administration.</p><p>Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat who first ran for office in 2018 because of his revulsion to Mr. Trump’s first term, called for an even larger outcry during a speech on Sunday in New Hampshire. He is expected to join the Chicago protests.</p><p>“It’s time to fight everywhere and all at once,” he said. “Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. But I am now.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katie Benner is a correspondent writing primarily about large institutions that shape American life.</p></div><div><p>Orlando Mayorquín is a Times reporter covering California.
