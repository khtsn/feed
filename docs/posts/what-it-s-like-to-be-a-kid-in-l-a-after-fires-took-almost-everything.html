His sister, <strong>Kayla</strong> <strong>Odom</strong>,<strong> </strong>is 12 and in middle school. They are living in a vacation rental after their house burned down, and doing school online.</p><p><strong>Phoebe Hanelin</strong>, 10, is also in fourth grade. Her school, Marquez Charter Elementary, burned down in the Palisades fire. Her home, which was just across the street, is gone. Phoebe’s older sister, <strong>Abigail Hanelin</strong>, is a sophomore at Palisades Charter High School. Part of her school burned, and now all their classes are online.</p><p><strong>Lily Yadegar</strong>,<strong> Alessandra Santini</strong> and <strong>Yasmine Santini</strong> are friends who also go to Pali High. Lily is 14. Alessandra and Yasmine, both 17, are twins. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Their homes survived, but they spent more than a week evacuated, staying in hotels and rented houses. The three girls wanted to do something for their friends and neighbors, so they started a GoFundMe to help rebuild their school and a donation drive to help their classmates.</p><h2 id="link-c82363">What was it like leaving home?</h2><p><strong>Ivy </strong>said it was “very, very scary” when the fire came. The power went out. Then the cats started meowing.</p><p>“My dad said that our house wouldn’t burn on fire,” Ivy said. “But I just knew right before our house would go on fire, because it looked like the fire was, like, right next to our backyard.”</p><p><strong>Kurtis </strong>left his house in Altadena in the middle of the night with his mom, older brother and older sister. He could see the fire getting bigger and bigger. Later, they learned that their house was gone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ivy and Ruby Van Kline are twins living with their grandparents right now.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lily Yadegar and her friends Alessandra and Yasmine Santini organized a donation drive to help their classmates.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I went back to sleep. I woke up. My whole life broke,” Kurtis said.</p><p>“I thought we were going to be OK.”</p><p>Though<strong> Yasmine </strong>and<strong> Alessandra</strong> are twins, the teens responded differently the night of the Palisades fire. Alessandra cried. She packed baby photos and her perfume collection.</p><p>She also got the clothes. “We share our clothes majority of the time, even though she doesn’t ask me, and sometimes I don’t ask her,” Alessandra said.</p><p>Yasmine brought stuff she thought everyone else would forget about, like medicine and food. “And then I brought my baby blanket and my baby stuffed elephant that I’ve always had,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-13535334">What are your days like right now?</h2><p><strong>Ivy, Ruby</strong> and their parents are staying with their grandparents in West Los Angeles. They like that the house is big and has stairs.</p><p><strong>“</strong>You can go down them and up them, and I could even do splits down them,” Ruby said.</p><p><strong>Kurtis and Kayla </strong>are doing school online. Their mom decided to keep them home while she figures out where they are going to live. When Kurtis isn’t doing school work, he plays cards with his family and talks to his friends on his tablet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kayla Odom, 12, is living in an apartment after her family’s house burned down.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jet Crawford, right, was in kindergarten at a charter school in Altadena that burned.

He wonders how his mom can afford to replace his soccer cleats and other sports equipment.</p><p>His sister, <strong>Kayla</strong>, says she is shy and worries that she might have to go to a new school. “It’s just going to be awkward for me,” she said.</p><p><strong>Ivy and Ruby</strong> were excited about their 6th birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese this weekend, where they hoped to see friends from their old school. And Ruby is looking ahead to a milestone at her new school: “Going outside in the big kid area when I’m a big kid and going on the monkey bars.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kurtis is worried about how his mother will replace everything that was lost.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jet has been upset after the fire, his mom said.

When she asked him about the fire, he buried his head in the cushions of their new couch.</p><p>“It’s broken,” he said. “Mommy’s house.”</p><p><strong>Lily </strong>misses driving to school with Alessandra and Yasmine, and stopping at Starbucks along the way.</p><p>“Our whole lives, we’ve been looking forward to going to high school together,” Lily said. “It’s just sad.”</p><p>Remote learning reminds <strong>Abigail</strong> of the pandemic, when she was in middle school. This time, it feels worse. Back then, middle schoolers all across the country were in the same boat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“It was fine in Covid because it was everybody. But now it’s just one school,” she said.</p><h2 id="link-6264ca76">What was special about your home and your school?</h2><p><strong>Kurtis</strong> will miss the house where he got to know his grandma. His grandparents bought it about 50 years ago after moving to California from Haiti.</p><p><strong>Phoebe </strong>used to walk to school by herself sometimes. Now she can’t.
