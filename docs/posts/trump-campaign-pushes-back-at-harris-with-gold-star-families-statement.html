    <h1>Trump Campaign Pushes Back at Harris With Gold Star Families’ Statement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Trump campaign then released the statement signed by family members of 7 of the 13 U.S. troops killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/04/us/politics/kabul-airport-attack-report.html" title="">by a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate</a> at the Kabul airport during the withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago.</p><p>The statement spoke of the heroism of the troops killed at Abbey Gate, and the grief that the family members have felt in the three years since their loved ones were killed. But it also sought to blame Ms. Harris for the politicization of the cemetery, asserting that it was the vice president who had “disgracefully twisted” Mr. Trump’s visit “into a political ploy,” and effusively praised Mr. Trump’s leadership, with the family members of the troops asserting that “if he were still commander in chief, our children would be alive today.”</p><p>It made no reference to the altercation with the cemetery official, nor the insults directed against her afterward. It also made no mention of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/us/politics/trump-arlington-cemetery.html" title="">concerns by the family of a Green Beret</a> — as well as <a href="https://greenberetfoundation.org/andys-fund/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Green Beret Foundation</a>, a veterans’ charity — about the Trump campaign filming his gravesite. Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano, who earned Silver and Bronze Stars during his service, died by suicide in 2020. Other family members of troops buried in Section 60 at Arlington have expressed outrage at the incident.</p><p>Mr. Trump and his campaign also posted videos from the family members on social media that similarly attacked Ms. Harris and praised Mr. Trump, and on Sunday evening published a <a href="https://youtu.be/NV62aJFT0EA?si=rFivkiWUFyggI-XS" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaign ad</a> that included those remarks. Some of those family members had defended Mr. Trump’s visit to Arlington in previous statements last week, and some family members were also given <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gold-star-families-rnc-gop-convention-b8d043475a5cb8cb7735c366ba75502d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speaking roles at the Republican National Convention in July</a> where they criticized the Biden administration’s handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p><p>The former president and his aides have given contradictory explanations for why they had filmed the cemetery. Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, had initially said that the campaign had permission to take photos and video — a notion that statements by the cemetery and the Army had rejected because that would be prohibited by law.</p></div></div>
