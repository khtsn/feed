    <h1>Trump’s Win Is Likely to Prolong Gaza Talks Uncertainty</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even Hamas, the Palestinian armed group, seemed to keep its options open about how Mr. Trump might act once in power. “Our stance on the new American administration will depend on its positions and practical policy toward the Palestinian people and its legitimate rights,” Hamas said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>People interviewed in Gaza on Thursday were divided over whether they thought Mr. Trump would be willing or able to help Israel and Hamas reach a cease-fire deal.</p><p>“I believe Trump will focus on economic growth and strategic deals with Arab countries,” said Muhanned al-Farra, 38, who owned an auto repair shop in Rafah, in southern Gaza, before he fled to Khan Younis with his family. “I hope his election will bring positive change.”</p><p>Others were more doubtful. Mohammed al-Amassi, 28, who fled to Deir al Balah from his home in Gaza City earlier in the war, said he thought the election result meant “grim times ahead for us, no doubt.”</p><p>He pointed to Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/world/middleeast/trump-israel-support.html" title="">record of support for Israel</a> and said he feared a new term would see him “going even more in Israel’s direction, with no thought for the hopes or dreams of Palestinians in Gaza or the West Bank.”</p><p>The election of Mr. Trump appeared to immediately relieve the pressure on Mr. Netanyahu — at least for now — to reach a truce in Gaza under the terms backed by President Biden and regional mediators.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has resisted months of efforts by Biden administration officials to agree to the proposed cease-fire, refusing to clearly commit to permanently ending the war and stipulating continued Israeli control of Gaza’s border with Egypt. Hamas has rejected both those positions.</p><p>With Mr. Biden now officially a lame duck leader, those attempts are likely to lose their teeth, according to Mr. Stephens.</p><p>“I don’t see how the Biden administration would have the leverage to make this work, and I’m not sure the Israelis — or at least Netanyahu — are that interested in moving it forward,&#34; he said.</p></div></div>
