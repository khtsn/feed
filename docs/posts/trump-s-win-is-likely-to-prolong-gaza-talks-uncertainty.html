Trump’s election victory is plunging efforts to reach a cease-fire in Gaza into further uncertainty, after a year of failed attempts by the Biden administration floundered because of irreconcilable demands from Israel and Hamas.</p><p>For months, leaders across the region — in Israel, Lebanon, Gaza and Qatar — have taken a wait-and-see approach to the U.S. election. It is unclear what will come next, but any firm advancement on a cease-fire, if there is one at all, would most likely be delayed until after Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January, analysts said.</p><p>The sense was that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel “was waiting for the results of the U.S. presidential election to make a move,” said Michael Stephens, a Middle East expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research group. “Why would he give Biden anything now?”</p><p>More than 43,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, including thousands of women and children, according to health officials in the enclave, and Gazans had been skeptical about whether Mr. Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/gaza-us-election-harris-trump.html" title="">would do much to improve their situation</a>. The war was set off the Hamas-led attack last October in which the Israeli authorities said roughly 1,200 people in Israel were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The site of a strike in central Gaza.

As part of the proposed accord, the phases would see Israel end the war against Hamas, withdraw from Gaza and release Palestinian prisoners; Hamas would free the 101 hostages still held there. (Proposals for a short-term truce were rejected by Hamas, which demanded an end to the war as a condition for agreeing to a deal.)</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has welcomed the election of Mr. Trump, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/world/middleeast/trump-israel-support.html" title="">a staunch defender of Israel during his first term</a>. He was one of the first to congratulate Mr. Trump on his victory, and spoke to him on Wednesday evening. The two agreed “to work together for the sake of Israel’s security,” according to a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office.</p><p>But how Mr. Trump might rearrange the chessboard is still unclear. He has expressed broad support for Israel’s right to defend itself after the Oct. 7 attacks.</p><p>At the same time, he has called on Israel to “finish up” the campaign — a position that would clash with many in the hard-line Israeli government who support indefinite Israeli control in Gaza.</p><p>“I’m not going to start a war,” Mr. Trump told supporters in his victory speech. “I’m going to stop wars.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump in the White House in 2020.

Mohammed al-Amassi, 28, who fled to Deir al Balah from his home in Gaza City earlier in the war, said he thought the election result meant “grim times ahead for us, no doubt.”</p><p>He pointed to Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/world/middleeast/trump-israel-support.html" title="">record of support for Israel</a> and said he feared a new term would see him “going even more in Israel’s direction, with no thought for the hopes or dreams of Palestinians in Gaza or the West Bank.”</p><p>The election of Mr. Trump appeared to immediately relieve the pressure on Mr. Netanyahu — at least for now — to reach a truce in Gaza under the terms backed by President Biden and regional mediators.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has resisted months of efforts by Biden administration officials to agree to the proposed cease-fire, refusing to clearly commit to permanently ending the war and stipulating continued Israeli control of Gaza’s border with Egypt. Hamas has rejected both those positions.</p><p>With Mr. Biden now officially a lame duck leader, those attempts are likely to lose their teeth, according to Mr. Stephens.</p><p>“I don’t see how the Biden administration would have the leverage to make this work, and I’m not sure the Israelis — or at least Netanyahu — are that interested in moving it forward,&#34; he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Nov. 7, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the role of Benjamin Netanyahu.
