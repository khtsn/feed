		<p>After the conclusion of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2682/vct-2026-americas-kickoff" target="_blank">VCT Americas Kickoff</a> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/596427/mibr-vs-nrg-vct-2026-americas-kickoff-lbf" target="_blank">Lower Final</a>, the 12-team field for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2760/valorant-masters-santiago-2026" target="_blank">Masters Santiago</a> was set, meaning an on-stage draw was held to determine the opening matchups for the event&#39;s Swiss Stage.</p>

<p>Masters Santiago was set to take on the same format as the second Masters events of previous years, with an eight-team Swiss Stage between the second and third seeds set to cut the field into four for each region&#39;s top seeds.</p>

<p>The rules for the draw were as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Four #2 seeds in Pool A</li>
<li>Four #3 seeds in Pool B</li>
<li>#2 seeds are drawn against #3 seeds, with no regional matchups in the first round.</li>
<li>If a regional matchup is drawn, the team will be placed into the next eligible slot.</li>
<li>If a regional matchup is still possible by the third #3 seed drawn, the teams will be placed into the only remaining eligible matchup.</li>
</ul>

<p>The draw was as follows:</p>



<p>The draw brings forward a handful of eye-catching matchups. The new owners of the top two on the VCT best-of-five kills record leaderboard will go head-to-head as <span data-ref-id="8">

</span> look set for a crash-course collision. Meanwhile, T1 and Team Liquid will meet for the first time in VCT, as will XLG and NRG. In a matchup that has been seen in four different international events since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Shanghai</a>, G2 and PRX will go head-to-head in a matchup of two teams who have never looked more similar in playstyle.</p>

<p>Play in Santiago will begin on February 28 at the Espacio Riesco, with the Swiss Stage running until Mar 4. The  playoffs will run from March 6 to March 15, with the four top seeds from each region revving into action against the four survivors of the Swiss Stage.</p>
