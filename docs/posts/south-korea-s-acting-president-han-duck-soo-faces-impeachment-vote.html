But Mr. Han’s tenure would also prove short-lived, as opposition lawmakers voted on Friday to impeach Mr. Han as well. </p><p>This was the first time South Korea had impeached an interim leader. It raised fresh questions about who was in charge of the government and military in one of Washington’s most important allies, at a time when the country is grappling with North Korea’s nuclear threats and economic challenges at home. The political uncertainty has pushed business and consumer confidence lower and caused the currency, the won, to plunge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The latest impeachment “suggests to the world the possibility that Korea’s political unrest could be prolonged and worsen,” Jeong Hoiok, a professor of political science at Myoungji University in Seoul, said in an email. This would cause “significant harm to the diplomacy and economic status that Korea has built so far.”</p><p>Mr. Han’s impeachment meant that the finance minister and deputy prime minister, Choi Sang-mok, would be next in line to be named acting president. But like Mr. Han, Mr. Choi has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment.html" title="">no electoral mandate</a>.</p><p>The move to impeach Mr. Han on Friday came after he refused to appoint three judges to fill vacancies in the Constitutional Court, the body that will be deciding whether to reinstate or formally remove Mr. Yoon.</p><p>At the heart of the matter is how the court might rule on Mr. Yoon’s impeachment. Six or more justices out of the nine-member court must vote in favor of impeachment to remove Mr. Yoon from office. The top court currently has only six justices, after three others retired earlier this year, meaning that the impeachment could be overturned with just one dissenting voice in Mr. Yoon’s trial.</p><p>The opposition had pushed for Mr. Han, as acting president, to sign off on nominees to fill the bench in the Constitutional Court. But Mr. Yoon’s governing party argued that only an elected president had the power to appoint justices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Han said on Thursday that he would not appoint the nominees unless the rival parties came to an agreement on whether he had the authority to do so as the acting president, and on who should be appointed as justices. </p><p>An acting president should “refrain from exercising the president’s own significant powers, including the appointment of constitutional institutions,” said Mr. Han, a career bureaucrat.</p><p>Park Chan-dae, the opposition Democratic Party’s floor leader, said to reporters on Thursday that Mr. Han’s words were “not those of an acting president, but of one who is admitting to insurrection.”</p><p>The opposition has accused Mr. Han of aiding Mr. Yoon in his brief declaration of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment-yoon-explained.html" title="">martial law</a> on Dec. 3. Lawmakers accused Mr. Yoon of perpetrating an insurrection by sending troops into the National Assembly to block them from voting down his martial law and to detain his opponents. </p><p>The Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether to reinstate or remove Mr. Yoon. Mr. Yoon’s trial started on Friday. He did not attend court, but was instead represented by his lawyers. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Yoon also faces investigations by the police and prosecutors on charges including insurrection, which could lead to ​his arrest. On Friday, the police raided a presidential safe house where Mr. Yoon had allegedly met with officials to discuss imposing martial law, according to the Korean news agency, Yonhap.</p><p>The political crisis has added to worries about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/business/south-korea-economy-martial-law.html" title="">South Korea’s economy</a>, which was already facing slowing growth and worries about exports. On Thursday, the won, one of the weakest currencies in Asia this year, tumbled to levels against the U.S. dollar not seen since the global financial crisis a decade and a half ago. The stock market is about 10 percent lower this year, a sharp contrast to many major indexes, in Asia and elsewhere, that have posted double-digit gains.</p><p>The rival parties had disagreed on how many votes were needed for Mr. Han to be impeached. The governing party maintained that just as in the impeachment of a president, at least two-thirds of the 300-member National Assembly had to vote in favor for the motion to pass. (President Yoon’s party controls 108 seats.) The opposition asserted, however, that a simple majority vote would be enough to remove him from his office as prime minister as outlined by the Constitution. </p><p>On Friday, the speaker of the National Assembly, Woo Won-shik, a member of the Democratic Party, announced that only 151 votes — a majority — were required. Lawmakers from the governing party then shouted that the vote was invalid and that Mr. Woo should resign.<span>  </span></p><p>Professor Cha Jina, a law professor at Korea University in Seoul, said that Mr. Han should be subject to a majority vote because “the acting president in South Korea is not actually the president and is just working in their stead as the prime minister.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
