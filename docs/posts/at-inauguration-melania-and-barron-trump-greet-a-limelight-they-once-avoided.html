But on Monday, the returning first lady and the son she had once shielded from the public eye used Monday’s inauguration to reintroduce themselves.</p><p>One of the biggest changes occurred before they set foot in the capital. Along with the rest of the family, Mrs. Trump has signaled that she will be more unapologetic about the ethical concerns that followed her family through President Trump’s first term. The woman who once abandoned jewelry and skin care lines unveiled her own cryptocurrency, <a href="https://x.com/MELANIATRUMP/status/1881094861279129643" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$MELANIA</a>, hours before Mr. Trump’s swearing-in. So far, both Trumps have shrugged off complaints.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Barron Trump is now treated as an adviser by his father and as something of a next-generation MAGA mascot by his father’s supporters. He pushed his father to join podcasts during the campaign and urged the sort of crypto projects that his parents are participating in. During the launch of Mr. Trump’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, in September, Barron Trump was listed as the project’s “DeFi visionary,” a reference to the branch of crypto known as decentralized finance.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Barron Trump appeared at several inauguration events on Monday, spending time with his father’s defense secretary pick.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Eight years ago, Barron Trump was a 10-year-old who was seen smiling with his sister, Tiffany, as his father was sworn in at the Capitol. On Monday, Barron Trump remained largely by his mother’s side, but the change in him was obvious.</p><p>During the ceremony, Barron Trump took prime position, smiling and clapping alongside Elon Musk, the billionaire who has landed near the center of Mr. Trump’s circle of advisers. He shook former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s hand as he departed the dais in the Rotunda. He was also photographed hobnobbing at a congressional luncheon, speaking with Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Pete Hegseth, his father’s nominee for defense secretary. He also animatedly talked with the billionaire Jeff Bezos, who is the chairman of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post.</p><p>Later, Barron Trump was greeted with a hero’s welcome at a political rally at Capital One Arena in Washington. Whenever his face appeared on the video board, the crowd responded with wild applause.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I have a very tall son named Barron,” Mr. Trump told the crowd. “Has anyone ever heard of him?” His son stood up, gave the crowd a thumbs up, and held his hand to his ear as the applause grew louder. “He knew the youth vote.”</p><p>For her part, Mrs. Trump dispensed with some of the niceties she stuck to as incoming first lady in 2017. She did not arrive at the White House clutching a gift for her predecessor, Jill Biden, as she had done for Michelle Obama, who skipped this year’s inauguration. She and Dr. Biden greeted each other warmly, ignoring some of the slights of inaugurations past. (The Trumps did not attend Mr. Biden’s ceremony.)</p><p>For Mrs. Trump, the last change from 2017 was visual, but no less significant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mrs. Trump has said she’d continue her child-focused initiative from Mr. Trump’s first term.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Wearing a double-breasted navy coat and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/style/melania-trump-hat-inauguration-outfit.html" title="">a wide-brimmed hat</a>, Mrs. Trump now seems less interested in emulating another first lady who had gone before her, as she did with the ode to Mrs. Kennedy eight years ago.</p><p>This time, she called back to one of her own eye-catching ensembles: She had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MelaniaTrump/photos/since-2018-this-custom-designed-hat-has-been-symbolic-of-the-french-state-visit-/493702525445653/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sported a wide-brimmed hat during a state visit</a> by the French in 2018. Her custom-designed white hat back then was the talk of the town while still keeping much of her face shielded from the limelight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mrs. Trump, a former model, has long asked for people to focus on what she does and not what she wears, but has also implicitly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/world/africa/melania-trump-africa-trip.html" title="">invited her observers to do both</a>. (On Monday, her navy hat appeared to have the added effect of physically distancing herself from her husband, who went in for a kiss on the cheek but was stopped by the large brim.)</p><p>Mrs. Trump has signaled that Americans — or Washingtonians, at least — will be seeing more of her than last time, because she plans to spend more time in Washington from the beginning. Mrs. Trump delayed moving to Washington during the first term to make sure her son was properly settled and adjusted.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/us/politics/melania-trump-white-house.html" title="">Last week</a>, she told Fox News that she will be a regular presence in Washington, with plans to spend time in New York and at the family’s home in Palm Beach, Fla. Mrs. Trump has said that she will also continue Be Best, the child-focused initiative she started during the first Trump term.</p><p>Mrs. Trump has made few staffing announcements as she prepared to return to leading the East Wing. In November, she announced that <a href="https://x.com/OfficeofMelania/status/1860031982857507277" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hayley Harrison</a>, a long-serving aide, would assume the role of her chief of staff.</p><p>Maggie Haberman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Maya C.
