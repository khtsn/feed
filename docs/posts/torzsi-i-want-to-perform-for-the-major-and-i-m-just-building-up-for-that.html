<p>The best-of-five series played out on Sunset, Corrode, Haven, and Bind, with FNATIC picking Sunset and Haven and DRX picking Corrode and Bind. DRX took Sunset 13-8, while FNATIC won Corrode 13-3, Haven 13-11, and Bind 13-4. </p>

</span> after winning only one attack round, while FNATIC had avoided it entirely in Paris after mixed results throughout the year. Both teams made corresponding compositional adjustments, with DRX replacing <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/35013/flashback">
		Flashback	</a>
</span>&#39;s Neon with Yoru and FNATIC opting into a double Initiator archetype with Neon, Breach, and Fade.</p>

<p>The map opened with a <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/28400/hyunmin">
		HYUNMIN	</a>
</span> 4K in the pistol and a follow-up 3K in round 4 to get DRX up to 4-1 on their defense. From there, DRX responded well to FNATIC&#39;s persistent attempts at splitting through Mid, at one point holding down B Boba despite their primary weapons being jammed by the enemy Vyse&#39;s Steel Garden and ending the half with an 8-4 advantage.  </p>


<p><em>HYUNMIN fires the opening shot with a 4K that was just 3 HP away from becoming an ace.</em></p>

<p>FNATIC closed the gap to 9-7 in the second half after a pistol of their own, but DRX remained composed, patiently sieging the B site and winning crucial duels to win out Sunset 13-8. The Duelists HYUNMIN and Flashback continued to dish out damage for their side, the former ending with 22 kills and 185 ADR and the latter recording 20 kills and 161 ADR. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542279/fnatic-vs-drx-valorant-champions-2025-lbf/?game=233499&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Corrode</a> was another map FNATIC hadn&#39;t yet played in this tournament, but few would know it from the result. The EMEA squad mounted a complete snowball on their attack side, winning 10 consecutive rounds for an 11-1 lead at halftime. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4/crashies">
		crashies	</a>
</span> in particular could do no wrong, ending the half with a 16/4/1 KDA on Fade. </p>


<p><em>A 1v3 from crashies keeps the snowball rolling.</em></p>

<p>A pistol and a round rollback for DRX due to <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1916/free1ng">
		free1ng	</a>
</span> disconnecting in round 15 delayed the inevitable as FNATIC won the map 13-3. crashies ended 18/6/2 with 186 ADR and a 1.78 rating, while <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/458/chronicle">
		Chronicle	</a>
</span> followed with a similar 18/9/4, 189 ADR, and 1.60 rating. </p>

<p>The closest map of the four was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542279/fnatic-vs-drx-valorant-champions-2025-lbf/?game=233500&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a>, where FNATIC notably came back from a 10-1 deficit the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542264/fnatic-vs-drx-valorant-champions-2025-ubqf/?game=233457&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">last time</a> these two teams faced. </p>

<p>Like Sunset, DRX made one agent swap by putting Flashback on Yoru instead of Neon. DRX led first with their newly equipped flashes, winning the first pistol and exploiting Chronicle&#39;s Viper wall on the C site to take a 5-0 lead. After a timeout at 4-0, FNATIC adapted, demonstrating strong B retakes and suffocating A Long traps to rally back to 6-6 at the half. </p>

<p>DRX won the second pistol but immediately lost the anti-eco, spurring FNATIC on to 10-7 and then 12-8. DRX managed to get the score back to 11, but a decisive C hit from FNATIC closed out Haven in regulation at 13-11. </p>


<p><em>Sharp Sheriff shots from Chronicle pave the way for a major eco round win.</em></p>

<p><span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9554/kaajak">
		kaajak	</a>
</span> and crashies stood apart from the rest statistically with 20 kills apiece, with many of those kills being critical first and midround picks. kaajak on Yoru collected six total first kills and ended with a server-high 1.40 rating. </p>

<p>The final map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542279/fnatic-vs-drx-valorant-champions-2025-lbf/?game=233501&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>. In a manner reminiscent of Corrode, FNATIC once again utterly steamrolled their opponents on the attack side, converting the bonus and applying constant pressure on both extremities of the map. Even close rounds went their way, with <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/438/boaster">
		Boaster	</a>
</span> winning a narrow 1v1 with his Operator at 6-1. The only two rounds that DRX were able to win in the half were both thanks to heroics from HYUNMIN, who found an ace in round 5 and some quick shots in round 12. </p>


<p><em>Boaster lands the shot moments before perishing to free1ng&#39;s Snake Bite.</em></p>

<p>The final nail in the coffin was hammered in by Chronicle as the veteran found four impressive kills to get FNATIC to a 11-3 lead that turned into a quick 13-4 finish. </p>

 
<p><em>Chronicle decimates the last hopes of DRX.</em></p>

<p>Chronicle and kaajak led together with 17 kills each on Bind, but it was crashies who had the performance of the day with 65 kills to only 39 deaths and a 1.22 rating over the course of the series. </p>

<p>DRX ends their season at third place internationally, remaining without a trophy but securing a remarkable achievement after qualifying to the event as Pacific&#39;s fourth seed. Meanwhile, FNATIC climb one step higher to their first-ever Champions grand final; the kings of EMEA will seek revenge against NRG tomorrow with the right to lift Valorant&#39;s most coveted trophy on the line. </p>

<p>“FNATIC always [comes back],” Chronicle said in the post-match interview on the team&#39;s recovery following their loss to NRG. “I hope NRG will not forget about it tomorrow.” </p>

<p>Boaster chimed in with a more passionate challenge for their final opponents: “NRG, we&#39;re coming for you, and we&#39;re going to be ready tomorrow…when you&#39;re in bed, having nightmares about us, you know we&#39;re gonna be ready.”</p>
