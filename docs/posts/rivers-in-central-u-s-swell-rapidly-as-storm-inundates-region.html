Forecasters warned that the floods might continue well into next week, with rivers not expected to crest in some places until Tuesday or Wednesday.</p><p>“We’ll be dealing with the river flooding the next couple days, even the next couple weeks in some places,” said Colby Pope, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Little Rock, Ark.</p><p>Emergency workers reported water rescues in Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Texas. Officials in Kentucky issued evacuation orders for two small towns, Butler and Falmouth, along the Licking River. And the National Weather Service issued flash flood emergencies for Memphis and the Little Rock area.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The storm has killed people across four states, including a 9-year-old boy who was swept away by floodwaters in Frankfort, Ky., and Chevy Gall, a firefighter with the Beaufort-Leslie Fire Protection District in Missouri, who died in a crash while driving to help rescue people from the floods.</p><p>Some of the heaviest rain so far has fallen in Arkansas and in southern Missouri. In Lonsdale, Ark., <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LonsdaleVolunteerFireDepartment/posts/pfbid057Q9H9oC1w2W4q6pUBwpviG4pgddCjBiQDR97xYGpjA6SSxwhnwYEEPueoLbEvX6l" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">firefighters said</a> on Saturday that they were trying to help 10 people and 65 horses evacuate a flooded horse training center. In West Plains, Mo., Mayor Mike Topliff said that some buildings had taken on water after several inches of rain fell in a few hours. He said there were nine water rescues in his city, and at least one person had died.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/05/multimedia/05nat-storm-hqfm/05nat-storm-hqfm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/05/multimedia/05nat-storm-hqfm/05nat-storm-hqfm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/05/multimedia/05nat-storm-hqfm/05nat-storm-hqfm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A flooded road with two yellow trucks and a van driving through it." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/05/multimedia/05nat-storm-hqfm/05nat-storm-hqfm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/05/multimedia/05nat-storm-hqfm/05nat-storm-hqfm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/05/multimedia/05nat-storm-hqfm/05nat-storm-hqfm-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/05/multimedia/05nat-storm-hqfm/05nat-storm-hqfm-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f2ee499c-fba1-5e09-8da1-9832a229a3dc" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Flooding on Interstate 40 on Saturday in Memphis. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brad J.

In Cabot, in rural Central Arkansas, some homes had become small islands, surrounded by floodwaters on all sides.<span>  </span>More than 100,000 customers were without power in the state as of Saturday evening, according to poweroutage.us.</p><p>In Jacksonville, not far from Little Rock, Tonya Coosenberry stood on her front porch wrapped in a blanket, watching the road in front of her house disappear beneath the water. “This is probably the worst flooding we’ve had in nearly 15 years,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Saturday, wet weather stretched from East Texas to New York, and federal data showed rivers rising rapidly in some parts of the region.</p><p>The Black River near Poplar Bluff, Mo., surged from four feet to a flood stage of nearly 17 feet overnight. The river is expected to continue rising there through Sunday morning, with an evening crest expected just below record levels. Emergency responders, including an urban search and rescue team, were waiting in Poplar Bluff on Saturday, preparing to help evacuate people if needed.</p><p>Elsewhere, water levels were increasing quickly on the Kaskaskia River in Illinois, the Mississippi River along the Missouri-Kentucky border and the Ohio River along the Illinois-Kentucky border. Many highways have closed in Indiana and Ohio, though some rivers there are not expected to reach peak levels for several more days. The Spring River in Hardy, Ark., was already at a major flood stage on Saturday, reaching the second-highest crest <a href="https://water.noaa.gov/gauges/hdya4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ever recorded there</a>.</p><p>The ground is saturated and can no longer absorb the rain, which means it “has nowhere to go and it runs off and creates more flooding,” said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A flooded home in Cabot, a rural township northeast of Little Rock, Ark.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Nostrant/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The stormy weather is expected to shift east on Sunday, giving the central United States a break. While there’s a chance for rain along the East Coast, the heaviest rains are expected in the southeast from the Gulf Coast to the Southern Appalachians. In northern Kentucky, another inch or two of rain is still expected before the long stretch of bad weather finally clears, said Nate McGinnis, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Wilmington, Ohio. But the flood risk is not as high as it was on Friday and Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Still, places across the storm’s path, including Louisville, Ky., and Memphis, have prepared for conditions to worsen. In Tyrone, Ky., where both roads into town were flooded, residents were evacuating on Saturday by boat as the waters rose. Bud and Tammy Morgan, who were waiting with their pets for an evacuation raft, planned to spend the night at a hotel and hope their home would survive. </p><p>.</p><p>Elsewhere, people were contending with damage that had already been done.</p><p>In Hopkinsville, Ky., in the southwest of the state near the Tennessee line, floodwaters had inundated some homes, leaving mud on the floors and overwhelming losses.</p><p>“Everything is just destroyed,” said Brittanie Bogard, a city councilwoman, who began to cry as she described what she encountered when visiting flooded homes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-11"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-04-04-saturdayrisk" data-id="100000010092016" data-source-id="100000010092016"><div slug="2025-04-04-saturdayrisk" data-sourceid="100000010092016" id="embed-id-100000010092016">

The county jail also sits right next to the river.</p><p>“We were just inches away from evacuating around 550 inmates,” he said. “But fortunately last night, that’s when the water started receding.”</p><p>Many of the towns experiencing flooding are accustomed to high water and seemed to be taking the conditions in stride.</p><p>In Cairo, Ill., which sits at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, pumps were placed around town and a levee gate was barricaded as a moderate, steady rain fell on Saturday morning. Some streets were flooded, but no property damage had been reported.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-15"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-04-02-storm-radar-embed" data-id="100000010087644" data-source-id="100000010087644"><div slug="2025-04-02-storm-radar-embed" data-sourceid="100000010087644" id="embed-id-100000010087644">
