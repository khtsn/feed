The heaviest rain so far, which has caused dangerous flooding, mostly fell in Arkansas and southern Missouri. Recovery efforts have been stunted in some areas by the weather, which may taper off through Sunday.</p><p>Wet weather is expected from East Texas to New York on Saturday, with the heaviest rains in Arkansas, the Missouri Bootheel, western Kentucky and Tennessee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That region has already had days of rain, with some areas recording up to nine inches, well above what many of these places usually receive in the entire month of April.</p><p>The ground is saturated and can no longer absorb the rain, which means it “has nowhere to go and it runs off and creates more flooding,” said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center.</p><p>On Saturday morning, Mr. Pereira said that storms were developing and moving across eastern Oklahoma, northeast Texas, Arkansas and western Tennessee. Some of these areas could see several more inches of rain, he said.</p><p>The storms could also generate damaging winds, unleash large hail and spawn tornadoes. The area at risk for severe thunderstorms stretches from the Sabine River Valley northeast into the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys.</p><p>“Folks are going to have the potential for really all modes of severe weather, from tornadoes to damaging straight-line winds, up to large hail,” said Scott Unger, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Nashville. At times, the hail could be as large as golf balls, he said, with severe weather potentially lasting well into Saturday night.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The National Weather Service also warned of life-threatening flash flooding across the region and urged people to turn around if they came across washed-out roads, adding that most flood deaths occurred in vehicles.</p><p>Cities across the storm’s path, which include Little Rock, Ark.; Jackson, Miss.; and Memphis, are bracing for the worst. Mayor Craig Greenberg of Louisville, Ky., said in a news release that he expected the Ohio River to rise about 30 feet. Officials in St. Louis County, Mo., said that part of Interstate 44 would most likely be underwater by Sunday. Officials in Paducah, Ky., said they were installing floodgates and getting more pump stations.</p><p>In Louisville, Ky., the region’s sewage utility said the sewer system <a href="https://louisvillemsd.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had reached capacity</a> because of heavy rain, and asked customers to refrain from running washing machines and dishwashers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-04-02-storm-radar-embed" data-id="100000010087644" data-source-id="100000010087644"><div slug="2025-04-02-storm-radar-embed" data-sourceid="100000010087644" id="embed-id-100000010087644">
