Forecasters warned that the floods might continue well into next week, with rivers not expected to crest in some places until Tuesday or Wednesday.</p><p>Emergency workers reported overnight water rescues in Texarkana, Texas; Izard County, Ark.; and several places in southern Missouri, including around Cape Girardeau. </p><p>“We’ve got flooded streets everywhere — and lots more rain on the way,” the Texarkana police posted on Facebook.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Friday, the local sheriff in Izard County, in northern Arkansas, was traveling to rescue a family when he crashed his truck on a washed-out road. The sheriff was not injured, but <a href="https://www.facebook.com/izardcountysheriff/posts/pfbid02ji6YVBa1PguT1noB7UpFT8r7hiystvrwhsqHCWSMM9iAppEar8geADjH1Zq3aRdZl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photos showed</a> his truck partially submerged.</p><p>“All county roads will have major damage like this for the coming days that can be hidden by the water,” the department warned, adding that people should stay home if possible.</p><p>The storm has killed people across four states, including a 9-year-old boy who was swept away by floodwaters in Frankfort, Ky., and Chevy Gall, a firefighter with the Beaufort-Leslie Fire Protection District in Missouri, who died in a crash while driving to help rescue people from the floods. “Tonight is a fire chief’s worst nightmare,” the department’s leader said in a statement.</p><p>The heaviest rain so far, which has caused dangerous flooding, mostly fell in Arkansas and southern Missouri. </p><p>Wet weather is expected from East Texas to New York on Saturday, with the heaviest rains in Arkansas, the Missouri Bootheel, western Kentucky and Tennessee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That region has already had days of rain, with some areas recording up to nine inches, well above what many of these places usually receive in the entire month of April. Federal data showed rivers rising rapidly throughout much of the region. </p><p>The Black River near Poplar Bluff, Mo., surged from four feet to a flood stage of nearly 17 feet overnight. The river is expected to continue rising there through Saturday, with an evening crest expected just below record levels.</p><p>Elsewhere, water levels were increasing quickly on the Kaskaskia River in Illinois, the Mississippi River along the Missouri-Kentucky border and the Ohio River along the Illinois-Kentucky border. Many highways have closed in Indiana and Ohio, though some rivers there are not expected to reach peak levels for several more days.</p><p>The ground is saturated and can no longer absorb the rain, which means it “has nowhere to go and it runs off and creates more flooding,” said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center.</p><p>On Saturday morning, Mr. Pereira said that storms were developing and moving across eastern Oklahoma, northeast Texas, Arkansas and western Tennessee. Some of these areas could see several more inches of rain, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The storms could also generate damaging winds, unleash large hail and spawn tornadoes. The area at risk for severe thunderstorms stretches from the Sabine River Valley northeast into the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys.</p><p>“Folks are going to have the potential for really all modes of severe weather, from tornadoes to damaging straight-line winds, up to large hail,” said Scott Unger, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Nashville. At times, the hail could be as large as golf balls, he said, with severe weather potentially lasting well into Saturday night.</p><p>The National Weather Service also warned of life-threatening flash flooding across the region and urged people to turn around if they came across washed-out roads, adding that most flood deaths occur in vehicles.</p><p>Cities across the storm’s path, which include Little Rock, Ark.; Jackson, Miss.; and Memphis, are bracing for the worst. Mayor Craig Greenberg of Louisville, Ky., said in a news release that he expected the Ohio River to rise about 30 feet. Officials in St. Louis County, Mo., said that part of Interstate 44 would most likely be underwater by Sunday. Officials in Paducah, Ky., said they were installing floodgates and getting more pump stations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In Louisville, Ky., the region’s sewage utility said the sewer system <a href="https://louisvillemsd.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had reached capacity</a> because of heavy rain, and asked customers to refrain from running washing machines and dishwashers.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-04-02-storm-radar-embed" data-id="100000010087644" data-source-id="100000010087644"><div slug="2025-04-02-storm-radar-embed" data-sourceid="100000010087644" id="embed-id-100000010087644">
