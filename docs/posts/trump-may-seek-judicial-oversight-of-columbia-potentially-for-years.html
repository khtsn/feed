She said in a statement that “the university remains in active dialogue with the federal government to restore its critical research funding.”</p><p>In a consent decree, a judge ratifies an agreement between two parties — often the United States and an institution under scrutiny. The judge then has power to oversee the agreement, an arrangement that often lasts for years at a time. The administration’s pursuit of a consent decree was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690?st=bkyGS2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported by The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>But if a consent decree is under negotiation, either the administration or the school would probably have to file a lawsuit in federal court, which would serve as a vehicle for turning any deal into an agreement that could be overseen by a judge, said Tobias B. Wolff, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school who specializes in civil procedure and has written about consent decrees.</p><p>“Judges can’t just wave a wand and turn an agreement into a consent decree absent a lawsuit over which the court has proper jurisdiction,” Mr. Wolff said.</p><p>Neither the administration nor the school has filed a lawsuit. It is unclear whether the final version of any agreement would include a consent decree, and the White House has yet to sign off on the possibility of a consent decree, said two administration officials involved in the planning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Administration officials have continued to negotiate with representatives for the school in the weeks since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html" title="">Columbia agreed</a> to overhaul its security practices and protest policies, as well as increase oversight of its Middle Eastern studies department.</p><p>The possible pursuit of a consent decree grew out of a Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/nyregion/columbia-president-armstrong-federal-deposition.html" title="">task force</a> dedicated to rooting out antisemitism, according to some of the people with knowledge of the matter. That task force initially focused on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html" title="">10 universities</a>, including Columbia.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/sean-keveney.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sean Keveney</a>, acting general counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services and a task force member, deposed Katrina Armstrong, Columbia’s former interim president, as part of its ongoing investigation into civil rights violations against Jewish students at the school. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/nyregion/columbia-president-armstrong-federal-deposition.html" title="">leaked transcript of the deposition</a>, Mr. Keveney repeatedly accused Dr. Armstrong, and the university, of not taking allegations of antisemitism seriously enough. </p><p>Michael C.
