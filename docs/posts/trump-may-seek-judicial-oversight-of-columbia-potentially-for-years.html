    <h1>Trump May Seek Judicial Oversight of Columbia, Potentially for Years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A spokeswoman for Columbia would not comment on whether the possibility of a consent decree had been raised. She said in a statement that “the university remains in active dialogue with the federal government to restore its critical research funding.”</p><p>In a consent decree, a judge ratifies an agreement between two parties — often the United States and an institution under scrutiny. The judge then has power to oversee the agreement, an arrangement that often lasts for years at a time. The administration’s pursuit of a consent decree was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690?st=bkyGS2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported by The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>But if a consent decree is under negotiation, either the administration or the school would probably have to file a lawsuit in federal court, which would serve as a vehicle for turning any deal into an agreement that could be overseen by a judge, said Tobias B. Wolff, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school who specializes in civil procedure and has written about consent decrees.</p><p>“Judges can’t just wave a wand and turn an agreement into a consent decree absent a lawsuit over which the court has proper jurisdiction,” Mr. Wolff said.</p><p>Neither the administration nor the school has filed a lawsuit. It is unclear whether the final version of any agreement would include a consent decree, and the White House has yet to sign off on the possibility of a consent decree, said two administration officials involved in the planning.</p></div></div>
