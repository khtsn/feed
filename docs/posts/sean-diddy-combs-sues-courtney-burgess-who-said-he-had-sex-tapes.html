During appearances on true crime podcasts and in an interview on the cable network NewsNation, Mr. Burgess said he had videos of the encounters; in October, he said he testified in front of a grand jury considering additional charges against Mr. Combs.</p><p>Mr. Combs’s lawsuit asserts that such videos do not exist and accuses Mr. Burgess of “fabricating outlandish claims and stirring up baseless speculation” about him. It says the allegations have caused Mr. Combs severe reputational harm and have tainted the pool of jurors who will eventually consider federal charges against him.</p><p>“People who heard and believed Defendants’ lies have accused Combs, on social media that is consumed by hundreds of millions of viewers each and every day, of being a debauched ‘monster’ and a pedophile,” the suit says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Reached by phone on Wednesday, Mr. Burgess said, “I’m standing by my word.”</p><p>“He had a lot of nerve to want to sue somebody when he’s going to rot in jail for all of the things he’s done,” he said.</p><p>In addition to the criminal charges, Mr. Combs faces more than 30 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/sean-combs-diddy-lawsuits-accusations.html" title="">civil suits</a> in which he has been accused of sexual assault. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have said that he has “never sexually assaulted anyone — adult or minor, man or woman.”</p><p>Mr. Combs’s suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, is the first that the music executive has filed himself since a deluge of claims against him began more than a year ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In a video posted online last October, Courtney Burgess and his lawyer, Ariel Mitchell-Kidd, spoke with reporters outside a Manhattan courthouse. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>His suit also makes defamation claims against a lawyer who has represented Mr. Burgess, Ariel Mitchell-Kidd, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdOHSj7cfwo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussed</a> the supposed videos on NewsNation, and names the television network’s owner, Nexstar Media, as a defendant.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a statement, Ms. Mitchell-Kidd called the lawsuit a “pathetic ploy to silence victims and people who stand up for victims.” She went on to say: “I look forward to countersuing and ensuring the court punishes not only Diddy but also his lawyers who filed this pathetic lawsuit for this frivolous and meritless filing.”</p><p>On the day that Mr. Burgess said he testified before a grand jury in Manhattan, he appeared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx3WZMb2v9I" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on a NewsNation program</a> alongside Ms. Mitchell-Kidd and asserted that “two to three” of the celebrities in the videos appeared to be possibly underage.</p><p>Representatives for Nexstar and NewsNation did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the lawsuit.</p><p>Mr. Burgess, who has acknowledged that he did not know Mr. Combs personally, has said that he believed the source of the video footage was Kim Porter, the woman Mr. Combs was in a serious relationship with for many years and with whom the mogul had three children. He said that he received the videos through an intermediary, along with a manuscript of what he described as a rough draft of Ms. Porter’s memoir, which was later sold as a 59-page book on Amazon. Relatives and friends of Ms. Porter, who died in 2018, dismissed it as a fabrication, and Amazon pulled the book from its website.</p><p>The suit accuses Mr. Burgess of profiting from what it called a “fake memoir” and leveraging false claims into internet fame.</p><p>Mr. Burgess has said he testified in front of the grand jury that he had disposed of the original flash drives containing the videos, but that his phone and email may have also contained copies. Ms. Mitchell-Kidd said the government recovered Mr. Burgess’s phone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The suit says Ms. Mitchell-Kidd repeated Mr. Burgess’s claims in a recent documentary about Mr. Combs called “The Making of a Bad Boy,” which began streaming on Peacock this month. In the documentary, Ms. Mitchell-Kidd said Mr. Burgess handed the video over to the government — a statement that, Mr. Combs’s lawyers contend, she knew was false because “no such video exists.”</p><p>Mr. Combs is scheduled to stand trial in May on charges that he ran a criminal “enterprise” that was responsible for coordinating drug-fueled and coercive sexual encounters called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html" title="">“freak-offs.”</a> He contends that all sexual encounters were consensual.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
