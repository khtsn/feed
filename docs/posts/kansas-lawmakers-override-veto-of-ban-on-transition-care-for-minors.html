Laura Kelly, who said it was “disappointing that the Legislature continues to push for government interference in Kansans’ private medical decisions.” Ms. Kelly vetoed similar bills in each of the last two years, and lawmakers had previously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/us/transgender-policies-missouri-kansas.html" title="">failed to override her</a>.</p><p>This time, Republicans in both chambers mustered the two-thirds margin necessary to override her and celebrated the decision as following President Trump’s lead on the issue. Kansas had been among the only states where Republicans hold significant legislative power without such a law.</p><p>“Today, a supermajority of the Kansas Senate declared that Kansas is no longer a sanctuary state” for those procedures, Senator Ty Masterson, the chamber’s president, said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Republican supporters of the measure, which bans hormone treatments, puberty blockers and transition surgeries for transgender patients younger than 18, described it as guarding young people from life-altering choices that they could later regret. Under the new law, doctors who provide those treatments to minors could lose their licenses and be sued by patients or their parents.</p><p>The shift in Kansas comes as President Trump and his administration crack down on gender transitions for minors nationally, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/seattle-judge-trump-trans-youth-hospitals.html" title="">seeking to end funding</a> for hospitals that provide those treatments. The Trump administration has also moved to ban trans women and girls from competing in women’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-order-transgender-athletes-womens-sports.html" title="">sports</a>, to bar trans people from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-transgender-troops.html" title="">serving openly in the military</a>, to house trans women who are federal prisoners with men, and to no longer reflect the gender identities of trans people on passports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

In her veto message, Ms. Kelly said “infringing on parental rights is not appropriate, nor is it a Kansas value,” and warned that enacting the measure could have economic consequences.</p><p>“This legislation will also drive families, businesses, and health care workers out of our state, stifling our economy and exacerbating our workforce shortage issue,” the governor wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The new law comes as part of a broader push by Republicans in Kansas, a state that Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-kansas.html" title="">carried</a> last year by 16 percentage points, to place limits on transgender people. Kansas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/us/kansas-transgender-birth-certificates.html" title="">stopped changing birth certificates</a> to reflect gender identity in 2023 after lawmakers overrode another veto by Ms. Kelly and <a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li_2024/b2023_24/measures/documents/sb180_enrolled.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed a law</a> defining male and female as a person’s sex at birth.</p><p>But as Republicans across the country have moved in recent years to restrict transition treatments for minors, Kansas had remained an outlier on the Great Plains. Bans or severe limits are already in place in three of its four bordering states — Colorado is the exception — and across much of the rest of the Midwest.</p><p>Bans elsewhere have been challenged in state and federal courts with a range of preliminary outcomes. Many expect the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/us/transgender-care-lawsuits-courts.html" title="">U.S. Supreme Court to ultimately decide</a> whether there is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/supreme-court-transgender-case.html" title="">national right</a> to access such treatments.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mitch Smith is a Chicago-based national correspondent for The Times, covering the Midwest and Great Plains.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mitch-smith">More about Mitch Smith</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Hero Runaway Dog:</strong> For months, Scrim ran wild around New Orleans, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/runaway-dog-scrim-new-orleans-hero.html">eluding capture and developing a giant fan base</a>.
