Dr. Evans initially determined that to be their cause of death.</p><p>“Remarkably, Dr. Evans has now changed his mind on the cause of death of three of the babies,” Mark McDonald, a defense attorney for Ms. Letby said during a news briefing in London on Monday. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He said that Dr. Evans had given a new report to the police a few months ago, in which he said that he had revised his opinion on the death of one of the babies, known as Baby C. Dr. Evans has also given public statements since the trial, in which he offered differing accounts of the deaths of two other babies.</p><p>“Despite numerous requests, the prosecution have yet to give this report to the defense,” Mr. McDonald said, citing the filing to the police. The defense plans to argue to the Court of Appeal that Dr. Evans was “not a reliable expert” and, given that he was the prosecution’s lead expert in the cause of death for all of the babies, that all of Ms. Letby’s convictions were therefore in question.</p><p>“This type of application is rarely used, and a judge now must decide if the Court of Appeal will reopen the case,” Mr. McDonald added.</p><p>Dr. Evans could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Ms. Letby, 34, was found guilty of the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of seven others at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015 and 2016.</p><p>During two trials last year and this year, the prosecution told the jury that she had harmed babies through a macabre range of attacks: injecting them with air, overfeeding them with milk, infusing air into their gastrointestinal tracts and poisoning them with insulin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Letby has always maintained her innocence, and at trial, her lawyer argued that she was being scapegoated for “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/30/lucy-letby-an-obvious-target-to-blame-at-hospital-that-failed-babies-court-told" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">serial failures of care</a>” resulting from chronic understaffing at the hospital where she worked.</p><p>The former nurse was handed <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cljyn2e7l3yo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">15 mandatory life sentences</a> and her attempts to appeal her convictions have so far been denied.</p><p>But a growing number of experts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/europe/lucy-letby-uk-trial-questions.html" title="">have raised concerns</a> about the reliability of the evidence used to convict her. Significant questions about the case were first raised in a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/20/lucy-letby-was-found-guilty-of-killing-seven-babies-did-she-do-it" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Yorker</a> article in May, and since then, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/world/europe/lucy-letby-innocent-inquiry-nurse-babies.html" title="">dozens of statisticians</a> and medical experts have highlighted flaws in the evidence that was used in court.</p><p>Nobody ever witnessed Ms. Letby harming a baby. A Court of Appeal <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/R-v-Letby-Final-Judgment-20240702.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruling published in July</a> noted that the case was “circumstantial,” relying on expert medical witnesses, Ms. Letby’s shift patterns and hospital treatment records to prove her guilt.</p><p>A number of medical experts have noted the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/18/insulin-tests-convict-letby-cannot-be-relied-upon/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unreliability</a> of the tests that were used as evidence of insulin poisoning, and challenged whether the prosecution’s own expert witnesses had accurately determined the causes of death of some babies. Statisticians have criticized the way that staffing shift patterns were presented in court, arguing that they presented a skewed sense of Ms. Letby’s presumed guilt and did not include all the shifts when babies died in the unit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Myriad problems plagued the neonatal unit where Ms. Letby worked, including “inadequate” staffing levels and problems with infection control, which were both noted in an official 2016 report.</p><p>In September, Ms. Letby <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3d93kpkl83o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appointed Mr. McDonald as her new defense lawyer</a>, and he said that he planned to apply to Britain’s Criminal Cases Review Commission, which is responsible for investigating claims of miscarriages of justice in the country.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Megan Specia reports on Britain, Ireland and the Ukraine war for The Times.
