The case shocked Britain but has increasingly been viewed by some experts as a possible miscarriage of justice.</p><p>Dr. Dewi Evans, a retired pediatrician, was the prosecution’s lead expert witness and had testified in court that air had been injected down the nasal gastric tube of three babies in Ms. Letby’s care, leading to their deaths.</p><p>“Remarkably, Dr. Evans has now changed his mind on the cause of death of three of the babies,” Mark McDonald, a defense attorney for Ms. Letby said during a news briefing in London on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I have never known in 26 years of being a barrister an expert to change their mind a year after the convictions on the cause of death in what they said to the jury,” Mr. McDonald later added. “That is astonishing.”</p><p>He said that Dr. Evans had given a new report to the police a few months ago, in which he said that he had revised his opinion on the death of one of the babies, known as Baby C. Dr. Evans has also given public statements since the trial, in which he offered differing accounts of the deaths of two other babies.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
