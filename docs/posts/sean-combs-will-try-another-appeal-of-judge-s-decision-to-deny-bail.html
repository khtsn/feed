Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr. had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-bail-appeal.html" title="">denied Mr. Combs’s first appeal</a> of a federal judge’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html" title="">order that he be held in the detention facility</a> until trial.</p><p>Attorneys for Mr. Combs did not immediately respond to a request for further information about his appeal.</p><p>As recently as last week, Mr. Combs’s lawyers had informed Judge Carter that they did not, at that point, intend to ask for Mr. Combs to be moved from the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The M.D.C., as that facility is known, has been harshly criticized by lawyers and advocates for what they say are poor conditions and chronic understaffing. But in a statement last week, Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/music/sean-combs-sam-bankman-fried-jail.html" title="">spoke positively about the facility</a>, saying the “dedicated professionals at the M.D.C. are doing everything possible to help him and his lawyers prepare his defense, and I personally thank them.”</p><p>“I can’t say enough good things about the M.D.C.,” Mr. Agnifilo added, “which has been responsive to our and his needs.”</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-bail-appeal.html" title="">arguing for Mr. Combs’s release on bail</a>, his lawyers have suggested a variety of measures to ensure he would not flee before trial, including offering to post a $50 million bond as security if he were released. They have emphasized that their client has been cooperating with the prosecutors’ investigation for months, and that he had taken steps to fund the bond offer. Under an unusual proposal, which a federal judge rejected, Mr. Combs would have agreed to remain at his mansion in Florida, monitored around the clock by a private security force.</p><p>But prosecutors have fought to keep Mr. Combs behind bars, citing concerns that he will tamper with witnesses if given the opportunity and that he is prone to violence. Judges have so far sided with the government, leaving him <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/music/sean-combs-sam-bankman-fried-jail.html" title="">in the same unit of M.D.C. as Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/technology/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced.html" title="">crypto mogul convicted of fraud</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
