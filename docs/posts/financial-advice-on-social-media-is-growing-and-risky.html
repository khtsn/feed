It was April 2020, and the stock market had plunged, draining a nest egg that she had built up over the years.</p><p>Ms. Ryan, a 43-year-old sales engineer from Wales, had dumped her portfolio in the crash and was afraid of losing even more. Looking for guidance, she found Kevin Paffrath, a prolific finance influencer who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/magazine/finance-gurus-youtube.html" title="">discussed the economy</a> and investing on his Meet Kevin YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o57vrsx7ySU&amp;ab_channel=MeetKevin" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">channel</a>.</p><p>“At the time, I was not really well educated in buying and selling share<em>s,”</em> she said, adding that she felt reassured that Mr. Paffrath had about one million followers. “I trusted this guy.”</p><p><a href="https://rpc.cfainstitute.org/research/reports/2024/finfluencer-appeal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Social media</a> is an appealing way for inexperienced people like Ms. Ryan to learn how to manage their investments. Content creators are branding themselves as money experts, endorsing a range of financial products from credit cards to cryptocurrencies, and earning a sleek moniker: fin-fluencers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But a growing number of them have faced accusations of promoting <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/12/10/hawk-tuah-memecoin-launch-haliey-welch-pump-dump-rug-pull/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high-risk assets</a>, hyping “pump-and-dump” schemes or simply sharing unqualified advice. Regulations can be unclear or hard to enforce, especially across international borders.</p><p>Ms. Ryan had considered herself to be a savvy saver. When the markets began recovering from the Covid crash, she was terrified that she had been rash in selling her portfolio. She paid $532 for Mr. Paffrath’s “Stocks and Psychology” course and mirrored his lead in buying shares in companies that he believed were lucrative. She moved her cryptocurrency into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/business/cryptocurrency-investors-ftx-blockfi.html" title="">BlockFi</a>, a cryptocurrency lender that Mr. Paffrath promoted.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
