Trump takes office.</p><p>The aid will include air defense, artillery and other critical weapons systems, President Biden said in a statement on Monday morning.</p><p>“I’ve directed my administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible,” he said, “including drawing down older U.S. equipment for Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield and then revitalizing the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our stockpiles with new weapons.”</p><p>The package includes $1.25 billion from existing Pentagon stockpiles. An additional $1.22 billion will come from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a program that allows military equipment to be procured from the defense industry or partners and sent to Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Separately, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said in a statement on Monday that the administration had released $3.4 billion in additional budget aid to Ukraine. The support, which is provided through the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department, “marks the final disbursement of funds appropriated under the bipartisan Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024,” the Treasury statement said. “Our direct budget support continues to be conditioned on reforms related to strengthening law enforcement, improving transparency and efficiency of government institutions, and bolstering anticorruption rules and procedures.”</p><p>The additional support comes amid concerns in Ukraine that the Trump administration could cut off military aid to the country. Mr. Trump has vowed to end the war there quickly, though he has not said how. But Vice President-elect JD Vance has outlined a plan that would allow Russia to keep the Ukrainian territory it has seized.</p><p>The new tranche will be the single largest that the United States has sent to Ukraine since April, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/us/politics/house-foreign-aid-bill.html" title="">the House approved new aid</a> after a monthslong hold.</p><p>Pentagon officials said this month that the Biden administration was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/politics/ukraine-aid-biden-trump.html" title="">unlikely to spend</a> all of the remaining $5.6 billion that Congress has allocated to send weapons and other military help to Ukraine. It is difficult to rush the remaining amount to the battlefield before the Trump administration begins next month, officials said.</p><p>The $1.22 billion that the Biden administration is sending from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative does essentially use up the money that remained in that program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Russia has been waging war in Ukraine — which has now spread back into Russia itself — for almost three years. The White House said last week that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/us/politics/north-korea-russia-war-casualties.html" title="">more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers</a> had been killed or wounded fighting Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region of Russia, with a few choosing suicide over surrender.</p><p>The heavy losses of North Koreans, who began arriving in Russia this fall, would amount to almost 10 percent of their deployment figures to the country. The announcement was the latest turn in the U.S. effort to publicly criticize both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, for sending ill-prepared and ill-equipped troops to a foreign front line to aid Russian efforts.</p><p>In August, Ukrainian forces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-invasion-map.html" title="">advanced into Russian territory</a>, shocking the Kremlin and surprising even the United States. It was the first time in 10 years of fighting between the two countries that Ukrainian troops had taken and held Russian territory, including during Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.</p><p>U.S. officials initially expressed skepticism about the wisdom of Ukraine’s incursion and said it might drain resources badly needed on the front lines. But some American officials have changed their assessment, saying that Ukraine has so far managed to kill a large number of counterattacking Russian forces without incurring many casualties.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Helene Cooper is a Pentagon correspondent.
