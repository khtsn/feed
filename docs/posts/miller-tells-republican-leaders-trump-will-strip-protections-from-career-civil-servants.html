Shear</a> and </p><p>Michael D. Shear reported from Washington and Maggie Haberman from inside the Capital One Arena.</p></div></div></div></div><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump delivered a boastful, campaign-style rally at a downtown Washington arena on the eve of his second inaugural, celebrating his election victory and vowing to advance his agenda in spite of what he called a “failed and corrupt political establishment” in the nation’s capital.</p><p>The speech at Capital One Arena down the street from the White House was classic Trump. In remarks laced with exaggerations and outright falsehoods, the president-elect railed about illegal immigration, bragged about the swing states he won last November, and denigrated President Biden.</p><div><p>“Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand-new day of American strength and prosperity, dignity and pride,” the president-elect said, adding that Mr. Biden presided over “a failed administration. We’re not going to take it anymore.”</p><p>The rally was a break with the tradition for presidents, who have sought to reserve their comments for the official inauguration speech, to be delivered moments after taking the oath of office with the world watching.</p><p>In one of his most hotly anticipated actions, Mr. Trump hinted strongly that he would pardon many of the people convicted of attacking the Capitol on Jan. 6 four years ago.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President-elect Donald J.

The rally was part of a full day of events intended to underscore his remarkable return to power.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“Tomorrow, everybody in this very large arena will be very happy with my decision on the J6 hostages,” he said, using the term that he prefers for the people who have been convicted in the attack. “You’ll be very, very happy. I would say about 99.9 percent in this beautiful arena.”</p><p>He was joined on the stage by Village People for a live rendition of their song “Y.M.C.A.,” which has become part of the unofficial soundtrack of Mr. Trump’s campaign because of his repeated use of it at his rallies.</p><p>Mr. Trump will not take office until Monday at noon. But his return to Washington began in earnest on Sunday, with a full day of ceremonial and political events intended to underscore his remarkable ascendance — again — to the seat of American power.</p><p>For Mr. Trump, the rally was an opportunity to speak to his supporters in the language they have grown to love: a casual and sometimes rambling review of his own accomplishments, filled with attacks on his adversaries — journalists, Democrats, immigrants, moderate Republicans and foreign leaders.</p><p>Mr. Trump called Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of Tesla, to talk about the coming effort to cut government spending and regulations. He vowed to end diversity efforts around the country. And he showed a video recounting deadly attacks on Americans by undocumented immigrants.</p><p>“The border security measures I will outline in my inaugural address tomorrow will be the most aggressive, sweeping effort to restore our borders the world has ever seen,” Mr. Trump vowed in front of the boisterous crowd.</p><p>“We will stop illegal immigration once and for all,” he added. “We will not be invaded. we will not be occupied, we will not be overrun, we will not be conquered. We will be a free and proud nation once again and that will take place tomorrow at 12 o’clock.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump’s pre-inaugural rally was a break from the tradition of presidents reserving their comments for the official inauguration speech.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>He also said he would release “in the coming days” the classified records relating to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., “and other topics of great public interest. It’s all going to be released.”</p><p>It was unclear what, exactly, Mr. Trump was talking about. It was a repeat of a promise he made eight years ago and did not fully make good on.</p><p>A day before he takes the oath of office for the second time, Mr. Trump hosted a private breakfast with Republican senators at Blair House, the 19th-century mansion across the street from the White House that serves as the president’s exclusive guesthouse, often used by world leaders.</p><p>He then traveled to Arlington National Cemetery to pay tribute to fallen U.S. service members. At the cemetery, the president-elect placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in a somber ceremony that has become a tradition for presidents just before their inaugurals.</p><p>Wearing a long overcoat and gloves in the rainy, cold weather, Mr. Trump lifted the large wreath, assisted by a service member at the cemetery, and placed it on an easel at the tomb. He stood silently for a moment before Vice President-elect JD Vance did the same.</p><p>After the wreaths were placed, a soldier played “Taps,” the sound echoing through the hallowed burial grounds.</p><p>For more than a half-hour, Mr. Trump, Mr. Vance and their wives talked with the families of service members who had been killed at the Abbey Gate in Kabul during the evacuation of American troops from Afghanistan.</p><p>An icy rain pelted down as they walked from one gravestone to another in Section 60, where many deceased U.S. veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. Mr. Trump placed what appeared to be a gold-tinged challenge coin on each of the headstones. Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Vance carried lilies. Mrs. Trump placed them at each gravesite.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance also attended a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, in Virginia on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The rally took place blocks from the National Mall, his first such address in Washington since the election in November. The president-elect ended his day by attending a candlelight dinner with supporters.</p><p>The busy schedule was a prelude to what Mr. Trump’s aides promise will be an intense day of activity on Monday, including his inaugural address and a flurry of executive orders and presidential actions on immigration and other areas.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/weather/winter-storm-northeast-snow.html" title="">Forecasts of frigid weather</a> have scrambled the choreography and cadence of Monday’s inaugural events. Mr. Trump’s inaugural address was moved indoors, to the Capitol, and the traditional parade was canceled, meaning the viewing stand for dignitaries across from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, which took months to build, will sit empty.</p><p>But Mr. Trump’s aides are racing to rewrite the script. Mr. Trump is planning to return to Capital One Arena on Monday, after he becomes president, and his aides are considering whether to have him sign some of the executive orders from a desk placed onstage.</p><p>Even before his Sunday events, Mr. Trump began his day the way he often did while serving as the 45th president: with a post on social media.</p><p>“Hostages starting to come out today!” he wrote on his Truth Social site, referring to the implementation of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire" title="">cease-fire agreement</a> between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The deal called for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/world/middleeast/hostages-emily-tamari-doron-steinbrecher-romi-gonen.html" title="">release of hostages</a>, which began on Sunday. He hailed the release of “three wonderful young women.”</p><p>Also on Mr. Trump’s mind was the fate of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/technology/tiktok-ban.html" title="">TikTok</a>. He said in a Truth Social post on Sunday morning that he would sign an executive order on Monday to give the Chinese-owned app, which stopped operating in the United States because of a ban that went into effect on Sunday, an extension to keep functioning.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who has made clear he wants the app up and running during his inauguration and related events, wrote that there would not be liability for tech companies that keep the app active until he takes office. Soon after, the app <a href="#trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order" title="">began flickering back to life</a>.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="47" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOGE1MzMxNzItMzEyMi01OTBmLWFhMWYtMWY4MjM5MjViNjU3"><div id="8a533172-3122-590f-aa1f-1f823925b657" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/us/trump-inauguration-news#8a533172-3122-590f-aa1f-1f823925b657"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-haberman"><img alt="Maggie Haberman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-20T01:00:12.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 8:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>A spokesperson for the congressional committee that oversees the official inauguration says the number of spots in the Capitol Rotunda will now be about 750, significantly higher than expected previously.

Nobody has done that ever.”</em></p><p><strong>False. </strong>Most Republican presidents in the past century won Florida by greater margins than 13 percentage points: Herbert Hoover by 16.7 points in <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/elections/1928" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1928</a>, Dwight D.

That would allow his administration to shift large numbers of federal workers into a new status over which it could keep a much tighter rein, including the ability to hire and fire them more easily. The order is significant as Mr. Trump and Mr. Miller have a deep hostility toward large portions of the federal bureaucracy, which the president-elect often derisively calls the “deep state.”</p><p>Mr. Trump is also planning a string of orders related to energy policy, much of which arise from pledges to encourage offshore drilling and end the electric vehicle tax credit, as well as stop spending on Mr. Biden’s climate policies.</p><p>And on immigration, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html" title="">as The New York Times has reported</a>, Mr. Trump is planning to designate drug cartels as “foreign terrorist organizations”; declare a border emergency to allow him to go around Congress and surge money and potentially military resources to the border; and declare a public health emergency to essentially seal the border as the administration did during the coronavirus pandemic. He also is expected to curtail asylum grants and step up detentions and deportations.</p><p>Mr. Miller has been leading the executive order process throughout the transition, aiming for as much secrecy as possible and only opening the aperture internally as time went on so that various agency heads could see some of the work. He has been using a team of lawyers to vet them.</p><p>At his rally at the Capital One Arena on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Trump told the crowd that the executive orders would make them “extremely happy.”</p><p>He said he had beaten back efforts by some advisers to delay his Day 1 executive orders, saying he wants to give the country a massive first day and first week in office filled with activity.</p><p>Mr. Trump also said he plans to quickly release the classified files related to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>And he previewed coming clemency grants for people convicted in connection with the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6, 2021. He referred to them as “hostages,” as he has throughout the campaign.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="41" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYjUwYWZlOWItMGUwZC01NzFlLTlhNTktZDkxN2YxOTUyM2E4"><div id="b50afe9b-0e0d-571e-9a59-d917f19523a8" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/us/trump-inauguration-news#b50afe9b-0e0d-571e-9a59-d917f19523a8"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs"><img alt="Zolan Kanno-Youngs" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T23:33:11.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 6:33 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>After a live performance of YMCA by the Village People, Trump steps off stage.

The ego-stroking message to the man who once famously declared, “I Alone Can Fix It,” was clear. And rarely does a corporate political appeal — especially one as naked as this one — yield such instant results.</p><div><p>By midmorning on Sunday, Mr. Trump declared that he would in fact fix it: “I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.”</p><p>Mr. Trump went on to describe, in the vaguest of terms, his newest idea: Reconstitute TikTok as a 50-50 “joint venture” between the existing Chinese owner, ByteDance, and some kind of American entity. It has a surface appeal, though it is not clear it would satisfy the mandate of the law Congress passed and President Biden signed banning the app unless the company and the algorithm are under American control.</p><p>Nor is it evident that it would address the national security problem inherent in having TikTok’s algorithms — which monitor the selections of users and pick the next thing shown to them — written in China.</p><p>But it was impressive politics on all sides. By shutting down the app for a bit of Saturday night and Sunday morning, TikTok made vivid to its loyal users what the world would be like without the app. (That shouldn’t be hard to imagine: It first came into American’s phones in 2016, just two months before Mr. Trump was elected for the first time.) And it created, for just a few hours, a standoff that Mr. Trump could then leap in and resolve, at least temporarily, on his way to the rally of his supporters in Washington on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>It’s no wonder that TikTok’s chief executive, Shou Chew, is planning to attend the inauguration and, at least before the ceremony was moved into the Capitol because of the cold, had a seat at the dais. He will hardly be alone among tech executives; Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk will be there too.</p><p>For TikTok, Mr. Trump’s reversal in recent months — from the man who was determined to ban the app to the man who is determined to save it — was nothing short of a miracle. On Sunday morning, just as Mr. Trump was issuing his stay of execution for the app, his incoming national security adviser, Michael Waltz, said that for all the national security concerns, “it’s a fantastic app. It’s something that 170 million Americans enjoy, and we’re confident that we can save TikTok, but also protect Americans’ data and protect them from influence, whether that’s an outright sale” or firewalls “to make sure that the data is protected here on U.S. soil.”</p><p>He appeared to be previewing Mr. Trump’s strategy: Come up with a solution that would satisfy the law’s mandate that makes it illegal, as of Sunday, to “distribute, maintain or update” a “foreign adversary controlled application.” There is an exemption if the president determines the app is “no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary,” especially when it comes to designing the algorithms that make TikTok tick.</p><p>Would Mr. Trump’s 50/50 joint venture fill that definition? It depends. If ByteDance remains the owner and developer of the algorithm, and that algorithm is composed in China by Chinese engineers, then it solves very little.</p><p>The national security concern that motivated the passage of the law grew from concern that the algorithm can be controlled by the Chinese government, or that Chinese officials could gain access to users’ data or their geolocation. And of course there is the underlying worry that the algorithm could be stealthily designed to influence what Americans see on their phones.</p><p>No one knows yet what a joint venture would look like; Mr. Trump was imprecise in his language, so it was not clear whether the American partner would be a private company or the government itself. But clearly, the president-elect is delighted that his first encounter with China involves a deal, and by the time he made it to the Capital One center late Sunday afternoon, for a pre-inauguration rally, he boasted that he holds all the leverage.</p><p>After noting that the app helped propel him to a remarkably good performance in the election among young voters — at least for a Republican — he declared: “So I like TikTok! I had a slightly good experience, wouldn’t you say?”</p><p>When the cheers subsided he suggested that the United States had no intention of paying for its 50 percent share of the company; ByteDance would turn over half the company in return for the presidential approval that will allow it to operate. “Whether you like TikTok or not, we’re going to make a lot of money,” he said, making no mention of the national security concerns.</p><p>If it played out that way it would amount to, at a minimum, an unusual business deal, more akin to the way the government sells leases to drill oil and gas or sells space on the electromagnetic spectrum to telecommunications companies.</p><p>But those are all details, bound to shift. For now Mr. Trump could just bask in the message that appeared on the TikTok app as service was restored in the afternoon, just before he got to the rally. On a day in which nothing had really changed — no executive order had yet been signed, no solution to the national security problem found, just an idea floated — TikTok gave the incoming president all the credit.</p><p>“Thanks for your patience and support,” the notice read. “As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMzhmOWZjNGMtNjY4Ny01YzBkLThjOGYtNjc2ODdhMWVhMDVk"><div id="38f9fc4c-6687-5c0d-8c8f-67687a1ea05d" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/us/trump-inauguration-news#38f9fc4c-6687-5c0d-8c8f-67687a1ea05d"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs"><img alt="Zolan Kanno-Youngs" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T21:47:22.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 4:47 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy who cooperated with President Biden’s team to try and negotiate a cease-fire deal that would free hostages held by Hamas, just took the stage.

By that measure, Ballard Partners, a Trump-aligned lobbying firm that opened an office here in 2017, has had a very good transition.</p><p>“We’ve been getting a lot of calls,’’ said Justin Sayfie, a partner with the firm, who was at a Politico brunch on Sunday at the top of the Hay-Adams Hotel. Mr. Sayfie was talking to Brian Hughes, an Air Force veteran who starting at noon on Monday will be the spokesman for the National Security Council in the Trump White House.</p><div><p>Since the election, Ballard has signed up ​Paramount Global, Bayer, Chevron, the U.S. arm of the crypto firm Blockchain, the President and Fellows of Harvard College, Booz Allen Hamilton and the California Avocado Commission, among others.</p><p>Mr. Sayfie, who was a spokesman and policy adviser for former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, was reluctant to crow in a conversation after the brunch. Finally he managed to say that “there are big changes coming in policy and if you’re a stakeholder in policymaking, you’re not doing your job if you don’t seek help with a professional to effectively communicate your message.”</p><p>Translation: You need a lobbyist.</p><p>Ballard Partners has close ties to the incoming administration. It employs Mr. Trump’s pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, and previously employed the president-elect’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles. The firm’s founder, Brian Ballard, has been a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump for years and is a member of Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>The firm’s party Friday night at Mastro’s Steakhouse in downtown Washington drew Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Mr. Trump’s pick to be secretary of state, and Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="15" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZTZmMTk0MDgtMTA4Ni01NTU4LTk2NmEtZTE3NTYzMTRmZDE0"><div id="e6f19408-1086-5558-966a-e1756314fd14" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/us/trump-inauguration-news#e6f19408-1086-5558-966a-e1756314fd14"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs"><img alt="Zolan Kanno-Youngs" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T21:33:26.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 4:33 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Stephen Miller, who has helped oversee a team crafting executive orders that would restrict immigration, just finished speaking.

The two individuals, Robin Peoples and Michelle West, had overwhelming support from civil rights activists and will be released next month, Mr. Biden said.</p><div><p>It was the latest act of clemency in Mr. Biden’s final weeks in office, many of which have highlighted Mr. Biden’s longstanding relationship among Black communities and his evolution on civil rights and criminal justice.</p><p>The president has announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/biden-commute-sentences-drug-offenders.html" title="">thousands of individual pardons and commutations</a>, more than any other president, in seeking to reverse longstanding disparities in convictions and sentencing laws that have disproportionately affected minority communities. Mr. Biden said that Sunday’s clemency recipients had “demonstrated remorse, rehabilitation and redemption,” and “each made significant contributions to improving their communities.”</p><p>“The list is not only important because of each and every individual that is represented on it, but it’s also important because of the broader story that it tells about the failures of our criminal legal system,” said Janai Nelson,<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.</p><p>During a <a href="#biden-president-trump-charleston-south-carolina" title="">visit to Royal Missionary Baptist Church</a>, a storied Black church near Charleston, S.C., Mr. Biden said that his decisions reflected how he had come to view the power of “redemption.”</p><p>“We know how healing and restoration from harm is a pathway to the kind of communities we want to live in, where there’s fairness, justice, accountability,” he said, “where the people we love go through hard times, fall down, make mistakes, but we’re right there and helping get back up. We don’t turn on each other. We lean into each other.”</p><p>Civil rights leaders and lawmakers have long called Mr. Garvey’s criminal conviction unjust and argued that his conviction was racially motivated, and that he was targeted for his civil rights activism with fabricated charges and flawed evidence. He was sentenced to five years in prison, two of which he served before his sentence was commuted by President Calvin Coolidge in 1927.</p><p>Mr. Garvey inspired generations of Black leaders, including Malcolm X and Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa, and he was seen as the embodiment of Black liberation and self-determination. Martin Luther King Jr. called him the “first man on a mass scale and level to give millions to Negroes and make the Negro feel he was somebody.”</p><p>A White House statement on Sunday highlighted his creation of the Black Star Line, the first Black-owned shipping line and method of international travel, and founding of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which celebrated African history and culture. The association, which was founded in 1914, inspired thousands with its emphasis on racial pride and liberation, which he encouraged through urging Black Americans to return to their ancestral homelands in Africa.</p><p>After his conviction, Mr. Garvey was deported back to his native Jamaica. He died in London in 1940.</p><p>For decades, many — including Mr. Garvey’s descendants, lawmakers and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/us/politics/roger-stone-statement.html" title="">Roger J. Stone Jr., an ally of President-elect Donald J. Trump</a> — had lobbied for a pardon of Mr. Garvey’s conviction, to no avail.</p><p>Anthony Pierce, the lawyer for the Garvey family who filed petitions to pardon Mr. Garvey during President Barack Obama’s administration and again during Mr. Biden’s, said in an interview that Mr. Biden’s decision reflected that “the country has finally done the right thing by Marcus Garvey.”</p><p>“There were a lot of legal infirmities in what the country did to convict him,” Mr. Pierce said. “And so it also shows that the country knows how to fix a wrong, and I think that’s good, both from a legal and moral standpoint.”</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Garvey’s granddaughter, Nzinga Garvey, said that his conviction was not only a “miscarriage of justice” but a “reminder of how the overreach of power can be weaponized to silence the voices that seek fairness, equity and accountability.”</p><p>A group of congressional lawmakers, led by Representative Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vLj3OI15EAyZuBsUFe73Qu1RDfXqJM8I/view" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent a letter</a> to Mr. Biden last month urging him to exonerate Mr. Garvey. In a statement Sunday, she said that although Mr. Biden’s clemency “will help remove the shadow of an unjust conviction” she and Mr. Garvey’s family would continue to “push toward his full and unambiguous exoneration.”</p><p>Among those also receiving pardons, which wipe their criminal records clean of convictions, is Darryl Chambers, a gun violence prevention advocate who was previously convicted of a nonviolent drug offense and sentenced to 17 years in prison in 1998; Ravi Ragbir, a well-known advocate for immigrants who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/nyregion/immigration-activist-deportation.html" title="">convicted of wire fraud in 2000</a>; and Don Scott, a lawyer who served his sentence for a nonviolent drug offense and went on to be elected to the Virginia legislature in 2019, and became the first Black speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates last year.</p><p>Mr. Biden also pardoned Kemba Smith, a criminal justice advocate whose case drew attention to the mass incarceration of Black women, often victims themselves, who were harshly punished by tough-on-crime laws.</p><p>Ms. Smith was the victim of domestic abuse, and was sentenced to 24 and a half years in prison without the possibility of parole despite being a first-time, nonviolent offender who was seven months pregnant. She had observed illegal activity of her boyfriend, and federal prosecutors charged her with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, though she never sold or used drugs. Her case was taken up by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund nearly 30 years ago, which led to her sentence being commuted by President Bill Clinton.</p><p>Though she was released 25 years ago and went on to build a successful career as a criminal justice activist, Ms. Smith said in an interview that the pardon has provided a new level of freedom from the confines of a felony conviction.</p><p>“I’ve always accepted responsibility for the choices that led me down this path, and even though I have done so many things, it’s a continuous healing process,” Ms. Smith said in an interview. “There’s several collateral consequences that come with this. So I’m grateful that I can have my complete freedom today.”</p><p>Ms. Smith said she looked forward to reuniting with Ms. West, whom she befriended in prison, and who was one of the two people whose sentences Mr. Biden commuted on Sunday.</p><p>Ms. West was serving a life sentence for drug-related convictions during the height of the war on drugs. On Sunday, as Ms. Smith grew emotional talking about newfound freedoms, she touched a necklace that Ms. West gave her. She was set to return it when her friend’s sentence expires next month.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzJmZGM5NmQyLWFmNzUtNWM2OC1hZjg1LWQ2ZmY5NDc5OTM0OQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/us/trump-inauguration-news#trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order" data-source-id="100000009936074"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-mccabe"><img alt="David McCabe" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/08/lens/author-david-mccabe/author-david-mccabe-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/08/lens/author-david-mccabe/author-david-mccabe-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/08/lens/author-david-mccabe/author-david-mccabe-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T15:39:24.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 10:39 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President-elect Donald J.

Lawmakers passed the law over concerns that the Chinese government could use the app, which claims roughly 170 million United States users, to gather information about Americans or spread propaganda.</p><p>App stores and cloud computing providers that do not comply with the law face potentially significant financial penalties. Mr. Trump said in his post on Sunday that his order would “confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.”</p><p>The possibility of an executive order, followed by TikTok’s stunning about-face, mark a new phase in the fight over the future of the app, which has reshaped the social media landscape, defined popular culture and created a living for millions of influencers and small businesses that rely on the platform.</p><p>In issuing an order, Mr. Trump would raise questions about the rule of law in the United States. His action would constitute an attempt to temporarily neuter a law that passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress and that the Supreme Court unanimously upheld last week.</p><p>“We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,” TikTok said in a statement announcing that the app was coming back online.</p><p>Creators celebrated as TikTok sputtered back to life.</p><p>“ITS BACKKKKK,” James Charles, a beauty influencer, posted on Instagram, where he had been communicating with fans since the ban took effect. </p><p>Policy experts and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle issued early warnings that the law is still valid and enforceable. TikTok remained unavailable for downloads on the Google and Apple app stores, suggesting that some companies continued to enforce the ban.</p><p>Legal experts said that the impact of Mr. Trump’s action would hinge on the details of any order he released, which is likely to provoke significant questions about the reach and limits of the president’s authority.</p><p>“There’s no good path here from a rule of law perspective,” said Alan Rozenshtein, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>Google declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment, although it said in an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121596" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explanation on its website</a> that it is “obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates,” and that TikTok would no longer be available for downloads or updates in the United States.</p><p>Oracle, which hosts TikTok on its servers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>It is unclear whether Mr. Trump’s efforts — and the negotiations to keep the app online that happened before he even takes office on Monday — will be successful in the long term. His executive order could face a legal challenge, including over whether he has the power to stop enforcement of a federal law. Companies subject to the law may determine that the text of an order does not provide enough assurance that they will not be punished for violations.</p><p>The law does allow a president to grant a 90-day extension if a buyer is found, but only if there is “significant progress” toward a deal that puts TikTok in the hands of a non-Chinese company. That deal also has to be able to be completed within the 90 days for the president to trigger the extension. And it’s unclear if that extension option still exists, given that the law is already in effect.</p><p>In his post on Sunday, Mr. Trump floated the idea that he “would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture,” without providing further details.</p><p>TikTok has said that a sale is impossible, citing the nature of its global operations, and China has already signaled that it could block the export of its all-important video-recommendation technology.</p><p>Some policy experts said there is too little information to draw a conclusion about the next steps. “What Trump has proposed on social media seems lawless,” said Peter Harrell, a former Biden administration official. “We’ll have to see what he actually does to implement it.”</p><p>Late Saturday, TikTok posted a message for users saying that the site was unavailable but, it was “fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution.”</p><p>Then, after restoring service, TikTok welcomed back users with a message saying, “As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!”</p><p>TikTok and several Democratic members of Congress in recent days mounted a last-ditch effort to keep the app online. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/technology/tiktok-ban-lobbying-washington.html" title="">privately told President Biden</a> that the app going dark on his watch would hurt his legacy.</p><p>Critics of TikTok started their own push to keep the possible ban on track. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas and chairman of the Senate’s intelligence committee, called some of the major tech companies in recent days to say they needed to comply with the law, according to three people familiar with the calls. He also said in a joint statement earlier Sunday that there was no room for any type of extension, since the law had already taken effect.</p><p>After TikTok announced it would restore service to the app, Mr. Cotton posted a warning.</p><p>Any “company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law,” not just from the federal government but also state attorneys general, shareholder lawsuits and under securities law, he said in a post on X.</p><p>“Think about it,” he said.</p><p>Maggie Haberman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Karen Weise<!-- -->, <!-- -->Sapna Maheshwari<!-- -->, <!-- -->Madison Malone Kircher<!-- --> and <!-- -->Aaron Krolik<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
