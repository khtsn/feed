    <h1>More Than Twice as Many U.S. Troops Are in Syria Than Previously Disclosed</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since the Assad government’s collapse, Israel and Turkey have launched military operations in Syria. The United States, for its part, has conducted dozens of strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria to stop the militant group’s fighters from taking advantage of the shifting situation.</p><p>The Pentagon was asked repeatedly in recent days and weeks how many American troops were in Syria, and maintained that the number was 900.</p><p>The issue of American boots on the ground in Syria has something of a history. In 2019, President Donald J. Trump ordered all U.S. troops in Syria to return home, in an effort to end the American mission there. Pentagon officials balked, and Gen. Mark A. Milley, who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, talked Mr. Trump into allowing a limited number of troops to remain to safeguard oil fields, Mr. Trump said.</p><p>“We’re keeping the oil,” the president said at the time. “We left troops behind, only for the oil.”</p><p>After that, Pentagon leaders said little about the U.S. presence in Syria, but when asked, replied that 800 American troops were in the country.</p><p>More recently, they have put the number at 900.</p><p>The Pentagon has said that the troops in Syria are scattered among several bases, including al-Tanf, on the Syria-Iraq border, and in northeast Syria. U.S. and partner forces in a coalition that includes the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces have been working to keep pressure on Islamic State militants and to ensure that fighters who are detained do not end up back on the battlefield.</p></div></div>
