Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p><p>Wars are hard to end, Mr. Acton said, in part because the side that thinks it is winning often sees little incentive to negotiate seriously or offer any concessions.</p><p>“If the side that is doing better believes that the war is going to get more costly in the future, it has much more of an incentive,” he said.</p><p>The Ukrainian operation somewhat erodes Russia’s ability to attack Ukraine by taking out some of the aircraft Russian forces have been using to launch longer-range missiles at Ukrainian targets. Russia of late has been intensifying such attacks on Ukrainian cities, with record barrages of drones and missiles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>More broadly, the Ukrainian assault appeared aimed at stoking fear in the Kremlin about the other vulnerable targets in the Russian heartland where Kyiv could inflict pain in the future. There are many, including military supply factories and military training facilities, Mr. Acton said. Even Russia’s exposed fleet of nuclear submarines present a potential target, though Moscow hasn’t used the vessels in the war and going after them would amount to a particularly risky escalation.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In this photo released by Russian state media in March, Russian sailors line up during a ceremony in front of a nuclear-powered submarine in Murmansk, Russia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gavriil Grigorov/Sputnik, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“There is a ton of stuff that Ukraine can hit that would be very hard for the Russians,” Mr. Acton said. “You can’t protect everything.”</p><p>Ukraine said Sunday&#39;s operation damaged 41 aircraft and caused some $7 billion in damage. That assessment couldn’t be independently verified.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attacks.html" title="">Open-source analysis by The New York Times</a> confirmed that at least a dozen aircraft were damaged, including Tu-95 bombers, known as Bears. U.S. and European security officials, citing preliminary assessments, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/politics/ukraine-russia-drone-attack.html" title="">estimated</a> that as many as 20 Russian strategic aircraft may have been destroyed or severely damaged, among them six Tu-95 and four Tu-22M bombers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But the attack doesn’t significantly alter Russia’s nuclear capabilities.</p><p>Before last weekend’s strike, Russia had 67 active nuclear-capable heavy bombers, <a href="https://thebulletin.org/premium/2025-05/russian-nuclear-weapons-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</a>, an organization founded by physicists during the Cold War that tracks nuclear forces. That count includes the Tu-95s but not the Tu-22s.
