They had been nearly eradicated by the late 1800s. In the early 1970s, the state Department of Natural Resources moved 29 <a href="https://www.themeateater.com/hunt/wild-turkey/americas-5-wild-turkey-subspecies" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eastern turkeys</a> in Missouri to southeastern Minnesota. Now, the wild turkey population is more than 70,000.</p><p>The odds of bagging one aren’t great. On average, only about a quarter of the 60,000 people who hold licenses for the fall and spring hunts head home with a bird.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Still, wild turkeys are part of the fabric of life here. In urban areas, they are an object of both fasciation and annoyance, chasing children and clawing up gardens.

Deer hunting is a quieter, more solitary pursuit and perhaps more revered in rural communities. But turkey hunting has its devotees, especially in the spring when the woods are loud with the heart-pounding yelps and gobbles of male turkeys looking to mate.</p><p>The trick is to use well-placed hen decoys and <a href="https://www.nwtf.org/content-hub/the-sounds-of-the-wild-turkey" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calls</a> from a practiced hunter to attract the toms.</p><p>“It’s so entertaining, like watching guys in a bar trying to impress the ladies,” said Brita Edgerton, 43, a bowhunting friend of Ms. Swenstad’s who owns an <a href="https://www.avrduluth.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">audiovisual production company</a> in Duluth. “They start waltzing in with their big tails and plumage, showing off.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The fall turkey hunt is different. It’s smaller and less social. Fewer hunters are looking for turkey, and since the birds aren’t mating, they tend to gather in quiet groups.</p><p>“Fall is to get the meat and just be out here,” said Ms. Swenstad, who <a href="https://www.echopress.com/sports/living-her-dream-osakis-swenstad-pursues-a-passion-in-the-outdoors-with-no-hesitation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has hunted elk</a> during a snowstorm in the Wyoming backcountry and long-horned antelopes called gemsboks with a bow and arrow in South Africa. One gemsbok’s taxidermied head is stored in her former bedroom at her parents’ house.</p><p>It would be hard to be a member of her family if you didn’t want to pick up a gun and head to the woods. Text strings are filled with hunting jokes and wildlife photos. Getting a <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/safety/firearms/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">firearm safety certificate</a> is as much a rite of passage as getting a driver’s license.</p><p>Ms. Swenstad’s uncle, John, belongs to the National Wild Turkey Federation, a conservation and hunting organization. And, like all the men in the family, he’s worked as a firefighter. He gives each child in the family a .22-caliber rifle to use in their gun-safety classes. He has already set aside one for his 3-year-old grandniece, whose mother, Moli Swenstad, 29, hunted deer until a month before her daughter was born.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Post-hunt breakfasts are often held at A.J.’s Restaurant in Osakis, Minn., where Ms. Swenstad sat between her uncle and her mother, while her father listened to details about the morning hunt.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dan Koeck for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An old family hunting photo from 1981 is one of dozens pinned up in Ms. Swenstad’s father’s woodworking shop in the tiny Minnesota town of Osakis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dan Koeck for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A favorite family party trick is to ask the toddler where you shoot a turkey. “In the face!” she squeals. (The idea is to minimize the amount of birdshot in the meat.)</p><p>Ms. Swenstad’s mother, Lynnette, 58, usually stayed home and cooked while the others hunted. That changed on Mother’s Day 2010, when she decided to join in a turkey hunt. Now she is as devoted as everyone else. “I like sitting in the tranquillity of the forest,” she said.</p><p>She is also practical. When a turkey wandered to the edge of the yard a few years ago, she took aim from the patio and then walked across the lawn in slippers to retrieve it.</p><p>When someone bags a deer, everyone gets together to butcher it on plastic cutting boards set on work tables in Ms. Swenstad’s father’s cabinet shop in nearby Osakis. Backstraps and roasts are cut out whole. Some meat is reserved for jerky. Trimmed, lean chunks go into a grinder, sometimes mixed with lard from a whole pig the family buys to share.</p><p>“We just have venison in our freezer,” Moli Swenstad said. “That’s our red meat of choice.”</p><p>Few things irritate the Swenstads more than people who criticize hunting but buy meat in the supermarket. If you choose to eat meat, taking animals from the wild is the most ethical, environmentally sound option, Ms. Swenstad said. There are no torturous feedlots, she said, and most hunters are dedicated to preserving wildlife habitats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“I like the fact that I know where my food is coming from, and I worked hard to get it on my table rather than just going to the store, where you don’t know where it came from or what’s in it,” she said. “These turkeys are the closest thing you can get to pure.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Swenstad stores her hunting trophies in her old bedroom at her parents’ home.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dan Koeck for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Some hunters will roast them whole, but that’s not ideal. The birds have long, thin breasts and tough, tendon-filled leg muscles. Some cooks might throw the legs into a slow-cooker and shred the meat. But in the Swenstad household, the lean, dense breasts are the prize.</p><p>The night before she took me and a photographer out turkey hunting, Ms. Swenstad cooked two breasts for a family get-together. One was about two pounds, harvested from a tom that her best friend’s husband had shot. The other was from a juvenile male called a jack. Her fiancé, Taylor Hayes, had shot it in the spring.</p><p>Mr. Hayes (also a firefighter) didn’t grow up in a hunting family, but when he fell in love with Ms. Swenstad, it became a “when in Rome” situation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“He’s slowly getting into it because it’s all we talk about,” said Ms. Swenstad’s brother, Kyle.</p><p>The turkey breasts had been soaking in buttermilk for days. Ms. Swenstad cut them into two-inch chunks and seasoned them well with a commercial spice blend heavy on garlic, onion, paprika and chili powder. She wrapped them in bacon. Some were secured with a toothpick. Others were threaded on skewers with onion and bell pepper.</p><p>Her father, Howard, cooked the kebabs on a Charbroil Big Easy in the garage. Mr. Hayes sizzled the turkey-bacon bites on a Blackstone grill in the driveway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Swenstad likes her turkey wrapped with bacon and turned into a kebab, while many in her family prefer them without onions and peppers. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dan Koeck for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>All of it was nearly gone before Ms. Swenstad set out the main event: venison stew made from her mother’s recipe, which is punched up with Worcestershire and soy sauce.</p><p>After a round of baked apples with ice cream and a few more hunting stories — including one involving her father, a crossbow and a 700-pound elk whose head ended up hanging in their foyer — we headed off to sleep.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Rising before dawn, we made our way across a field on her uncle’s 114-acre farm. The trick was to be in place before the turkeys woke up and fluttered down from the trees to have breakfast.</p><p>“I just like being out here in God’s country,” Ms. Swenstad said as we worked our way to the blind in the dark. “It brings you this inner peace you can’t find anywhere else.”</p><p>Then we had to be quiet. Turkeys can see and hear really well.</p><p>The sun came up. The turkeys started to gobble softly. Nine hens pecked their way toward us from the tree line.</p><p>One wandered close enough to the blind to get a clean shot. Ms. Swenstad pushed the barrel of her gun through a canvas flap and pulled the trigger.</p><p>She tagged her turkey, slung it over her shoulder and started the walk back to the car. She’d dress it at home.
