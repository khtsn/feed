Trump is moving quickly to assemble his cabinet, naming people he expects to shift America away from the Biden administration agenda once he reclaims the Oval Office early next year.</p><p>He confirmed on Tuesday that he’d <a href="#who-is-michael-waltz-trump" title="">chosen Representative Michael Waltz of Florida</a> to be his national security adviser, turning to <a href="#who-is-michael-waltz-trump" title="">a former Green Beret</a> who has taken a tough line on China to oversee foreign and national security policy in the White House.</p><div><p>The choice of Mr. Waltz — as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-stefanik-un-ambassador.html" title="">Representative Elise Stefanik</a>, Mr. Trump’s pick to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations — <a href="#trump-house-majority" title="">puts some pressure on what is expected to be Republicans’ precarious House majority</a> once the remaining races are called. Speaker Mike Johnson said on Tuesday that he did not expect any additional Republican House members to be picked by Mr. Trump, but said he would leave it up to the president-elect.</p><p>Mr. Trump has not announced his nominees for the highest-profile jobs, like secretary of state or attorney general. He is expected to name Senator <a href="#who-is-marco-rubio" title="">Marco Rubio</a> of Florida as his secretary of state, three people familiar with his thinking said on Monday, cautioning that he <a href="#trump-rubio-secretary-of-state" title="">could still change his mind</a> at the last minute.</p><p>His choices for the cabinet, which includes the leaders of 15 departments and the vice president, will require confirmation by the Senate.</p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Senate leadership:</strong> Three men are pitching themselves as the best equipped to carry out Mr. Trump’s agenda ahead of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/us/trump-news-house-election#senate-republicans-return-to-washington-and-prepare-to-pick-mcconnells-successor" title="">secret ballot on Wednesday</a> when senators will choose their leader. Senators John Thune of South Dakota and John Cornyn of Texas are seen as having an edge over Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who is seen as the favorite of the party’s right flank.</p></li><li><p><strong>House update:</strong> Control of the House of Representatives remains unclear, though analysts say Republicans are favored to win a narrow majority when all of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/california-ballot-count-house-election.html" title="">the votes are counted</a> in close races around the country. Nine of the 16 uncalled races that will determine the balance of power are in California, where the counting of ballots typically takes longer than in any other state.</p></li><li><p><strong>White House visit:</strong> President Biden will host Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday, a presidential tradition that Mr. Trump did not offer four years ago after Mr. Biden defeated him.</p></li><li><p><strong>More Trump picks:</strong> Mr. Trump announced on Tuesday that he intended to nominate Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and the father of the office’s current occupant, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, to be the U.S. ambassador to Israel. On Monday, he selected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/climate/trump-chooses-lee-zeldin-to-run-epa.html" title="">former Representative Lee Zeldin</a> to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Larger role for Miller:</strong> Stephen Miller, the architect of Mr. Trump’s assault on immigration during his first term, is likely to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html" title="">take a much bigger role</a> in the president-elect’s upcoming administration.</p></li><li><p><strong>A win for Democrats:</strong> Representative Ruben Gallego, a Phoenix-area Democrat and military veteran, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/ruben-gallego-kari-lake-arizona-senate.html" title="">has won the Senate race in Arizona</a>, The Associated Press said — a bright spot for Democrats after Republicans regained control of the chamber.</p></li></ul><p>Maggie Haberman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2E5NDhiMWI3LTMyYTAtNTAzNS1iNGZlLWQ2OGZiNDFjN2IzOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/us/trump-news-house-election#mike-huckabee-ambassador-to-israel" data-source-id="100000009821656"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-gold"><img alt="Michael Gold" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-michael-gold/author-michael-gold-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-michael-gold/author-michael-gold-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-michael-gold/author-michael-gold-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-12T20:10:08.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 12, 2024, 3:10 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, on the steps of the State Capitol after the inauguration of his daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, as governor in January 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Al Drago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump has selected Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, to be his ambassador to Israel, choosing a loyal ally for a crucial foreign post at a time of crisis in the Middle East.</p><p>If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Huckabee, a former pastor who has never served as an overseas diplomat, would play a crucial role in helping Mr. Trump’s quest to fulfill his promise to bring the war in Gaza to a swift close.</p><div><p>“Mike has been a great public servant, governor, and leader in faith for many years,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about peace in the Middle East!”</p><p>Mr. Huckabee has voiced staunch support for Israel as it conducts its war in Gaza, which began after Hamas led an attack on the country on Oct. 7, 2023. In August, he said <a href="https://x.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/1829757918234685855" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> that Hamas must “release ALL hostages &amp; unconditionally surrender.”</p><p>Mr. Trump said earlier this week that he would ask another vocal supporter of Israel, Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, to serve as U.N. ambassador.</p><p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump frequently presented himself as Israel’s strongest ally, and has voiced support for that country’s right to defend itself. He has been less clear about how he would bring the conflict in Gaza to an end, but analysts believe he is likely to steer U.S. foreign policy toward terms more favorable to Israel.</p><p>Mr. Huckabee was the governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007, then ran for president in both 2008 and 2016. His daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is the governor of Arkansas and has served as Mr. Trump’s White House press secretary.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="19" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFlZTYyMjlkLTc3NDEtNWY0Zi05ZWZkLTRmMTEyZTgxZjFlNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/us/trump-news-house-election#black-voters-democrats-results" data-source-id="100000009814945"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-12T19:55:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 12, 2024, 2:55 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the final weeks of the campaign, many Democrats hoped that signs of crumbling support among Black voters would not materialize at the polls.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Elconin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Jamaal Stokes’s quality of life in Milwaukee has declined over the past decade, just as it has for many other Black residents.</p><p>He lost his well-paying factory job in the mid-2010s, when his company left town. He spent the next several years toiling in temporary jobs as he searched for stable employment. Mr. Stokes, 44, now works as a security guard at a local supermarket, even as he struggles to afford groceries himself.</p><div><p>This presidential election, he paid little attention to Donald J. Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, because national politics are “not the answer.”</p><p>“So what’s the point?” he asked. “I’m just kind of over it all.”</p><p>In the final weeks of the campaign, many Democrats hoped that signs of crumbling support among Black voters would not materialize at the polls.</p><p>The historic nature of the campaign, with the possibility of the country electing a Black and Indian American woman as its leader, inspired some confidence.</p><p>There was also an expectation that Mr. Trump’s baggage would be poisonous, as he was heavily criticized for trying to discredit Ms. Harris’s racial identity, spreading vicious disinformation about Haitians eating pets and accusing immigrants of taking “Black jobs.”</p><p>And for an overwhelming majority of Black Americans, those reasons were more than enough to justify supporting Ms. Harris. But her loss has illuminated a percolating sense of dissatisfaction and an increasingly conspicuous divide within the Black community, as a segment of Black voters rejected her campaign and the message of the Democratic Party more broadly.</p><p>Some of those voters, namely working-class Black men, said they doubted their circumstances would fundamentally change, regardless of who won. The dissatisfaction — evident in urban centers in swing states, like Milwaukee and Philadelphia, as well as remote reaches in the Mississippi Delta — was potent enough to depress turnout in some Democratic strongholds and even flip some majority-Black counties to Mr. Trump.</p><p>The outcome<span>  </span>was less of a reflection of enthusiasm for Mr. Trump and more of an indication that some Black voters were questioning what dividends, if any, have come from their loyalty to the Democratic Party. </p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yazoo County, Miss., which is 60 percent Black, flipped to red from blue for Donald J. Trump.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rory Doyle for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“I think the Democrats have abused us for years,” said Vincent Genous, 50, who lives in Yazoo City, Miss., and followed the guidance he grew up hearing — that the party was his only realistic choice — before he was swayed by Mr. Trump in recent elections.</p><p>Even some Harris voters were not enthused. In Philadelphia, David Childs, a 40-year-old vendor in the city’s downtown shopping district, said he would reluctantly vote for her, but that neither candidate really spoke to his concerns, and that he mostly heard about abortion and the southern border.</p><p>“Neither one of them is going to affect us down here directly,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Childs said he has not seen any money or direct assistance for small businesses like his and that the Biden administration did not do enough to help people like him.</p><p>For many Black Americans, the election was “not really a question of a choice between Harris and Trump,” said Christopher Towler, an associate professor of political science at Sacramento State and the director of the Black Voter Project, which studies political attitudes and engagement.</p><p>“It was a choice between participating at all or staying home,” Mr. Towler said.</p><p>For example, in Milwaukee, the heart of the Black population in Wisconsin, the city’s crucial base of Democratic voters seems to have steadily lost enthusiasm for the party.</p><p>The city’s majority Black wards saw a minor partisan shift away from Democrats in recent election cycles, said John D. Johnson, a researcher at Marquette University Law School. But those wards have seen a <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/assets/community/lubar/posts/MilwaukeeVoterTurnout_3-9-2023.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">precipitous drop in turnout</a>, which fell to 58 percent when President Biden ran in 2020 from 77 percent during Mr. Obama’s 2012 re-election.</p><p>Turnout for Ms. Harris did not appear to plunge even further, according to an initial analysis of election data from Mr. Johnson. But she also did not appear to make up much lost ground.</p><p>Mr. Stokes, the security guard, chose to stay home. “I said ‘Let the chips fall where they may,’” he said. “Nothing changes for Black folks, really.”</p><p>Some Black voters also voted — or considered voting — for Mr. Trump. In Nash County, N.C., a largely rural county east of Raleigh where roughly 40 percent of residents are Black, voters have sided with the winner of the last four presidential elections — including with Mr. Trump this month.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Linwood Yarborough, 43, said he thought Vice President Kamala Harris was “more for the people” than Mr. Trump, but ultimately declined to vote.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cornell Watson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Linwood Yarborough, 43, who works part time fixing cars, said he thought Ms. Harris was “more for the people.” And he had a boss and others who lobbied for her.</p><p>But an uncle, a truck driver in the same county, revealed that he planned to vote Republican. Mr. Yarborough said that his uncle told him that life for Black people had been far better under Mr. Trump’s leadership than it was under President Biden’s.</p><p>“Gas prices were down when he was in office; groceries were cheaper,” Mr. Yarborough recalled his uncle saying.</p><p>“And I agree with that,” Mr. Yarborough acknowledged.</p><p>Mr. Yarborough ended up not voting.</p><p>In red states, voters also yearned for change.</p><p>Yazoo County, Miss., where Mr. Genous lives, is 60 percent Black. It’s in the poorest stretch of one of the country’s poorest states. Health outcomes have been dire. Yazoo City’s public school system was in such awful condition that it was taken over by the state. Only 12 percent of residents hold a college degree.</p><p>And Yazoo County flipped to Mr. Trump in 2024 from Mr. Biden in 2020. In this part of the world, where an inescapable history of slavery, segregation and disenfranchisement has taught many that the promise of America was more an ideal to chase than a reality to safeguard, the arguments that Mr. Trump posed grave peril to democratic institutions could only gain so much traction.</p><p>And to Mr. Genous, those arguments were overblown. Mr. Trump said he was not a politician, and he did not sound like one. He said things that were offensive or simply unbelievable — Mr. Genous never thought for a second that Mexico would pay for a border wall. But he was blunt, raw. And more and more, Mr. Genous agreed with his message.</p><p>“I just feel like some things need to be said and Trump is going to say it,” said Mr. Genous, who works as a supervisor for a discount retail chain.</p><p>Younger generations of Black voters lack the same loyalty to the Democratic Party as baby boomers and Gen Xers, said Alvin B. Tillery Jr., a political science professor at Northwestern who founded a political action committee to focus on Black swing state voters. The allegiance of older voters was often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/us/politics/black-democrats-age-gap.html" title="">forged through the Civil Rights Movement</a> and from witnessing race relations in the 20th century.</p><p>Younger voters, however, need to be sold on their vote for Democrats, Mr. Tillery said, “but the campaign and the party did not do a good job of that. And that’s a big part of why they lost.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bobby Jackson voted for Ms. Harris, but said his enthusiasm for the Democratic Party has waned.

But he was just as unsure about Ms. Harris. He did not know much about her when she entered the race in late July, and still felt as if he didn’t know her by Election Day.</p><p>He was put off by the celebrities — Beyoncé, Megan Thee Stallion, Bruce Springsteen and Oprah Winfrey — who endorsed her campaign.</p><p>He voted for Ms. Harris, but his enthusiasm for the Democratic Party has waned. He said the party was offering “a lot of promises, but not following through.”</p><p>Some younger Black men said that they were also frustrated by Ms. Harris’s emphasis on her law enforcement experience as a prosecutor — part of her appeal to moderate Democrats and disenchanted Republicans.</p><p>Ronnell Shaw, 36, lives in a section of Milwaukee’s north side, where incarceration rates are among the highest in the nation.</p><p>He said that he has cousins and friends who have faced harassment by the police. Mr. Shaw said that the focus of elected leaders should be on “making up for that history,” rather than “bragging about all the people they locked up.”</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Shaw was turned off by Mr. Trump’s brash demeanor and record. So Mr. Shaw, who said that he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, opted to sit out of this election.</p><p>“Why should I vote for someone who doesn’t care about people who look like me?” Mr. Shaw asked about both candidates.</p><p>In a crowded shopping center in Rocky Mount, N.C., the main city in Nash County, Carson Criswell, 35, said that while he voted for Ms. Harris, he was not entirely surprised that she did not receive more support among some Black men.</p><p>Voting for a woman of color was exciting, he said. “But the world ain’t always ready for that.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Carson Criswell and his wife, Chrystal.

And she was anxious about the stability of Social Security under a Trump administration.</p><p>Ms. Arrington worried, though, that some younger Black men were too laser focused on the economy. “They don’t understand what will happen with everything else: Education, health care, taxes,” she said. “They’re in for a rude awakening.”</p><p>Donna Madden, 52, who identifies as a Black Latina, said she was “terrified” of the fallout.</p><p>“It’s like a betrayal,” she said. “It just makes me so mad.

Trump to be secretary of state</a>, an appointment that would make him the first Latino to hold the position. He would serve a president who has made demonizing immigrants a defining feature of his political message.</p><div><p>Mr. Rubio was a finalist to serve as Mr. Trump’s running mate. If he is selected to serve as secretary of state, the top foreign policy role will be a test of whether the senator, who has reinvented himself repeatedly during his political ascent, can help bring stability to a world stage where leaders are bracing for four years of unpredictable foreign policy and “America First” protectionism.</p><h3 id="link-36ead9f1"><span>Rubio ran against Trump in 2016 and viciously criticized him.</span></h3><p>During his failed 2016 presidential bid, Mr. Rubio was Exhibit A in how the schoolyard taunts that worked for Mr. Trump only served to mortify other politicians who tried to mimic his style.</p><p>“He doesn’t sweat because his pores are clogged from the spray tan he uses,” Mr. Rubio said of Mr. Trump at a campaign rally in Salem, Va, in February 2016. “He’s like 6’2”, which is why I don’t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5’2”, Mr. Rubio continued. “Have you seen his hands? And you know what they say about men with small hands.”</p><p>He added, after a pause: “You can’t trust ‘em!”</p><p>“I will never give up the fight to ensure that the party of Reagan remains a conservative party,” Mr. Rubio said on Fox News around the same time, adding, “not one headed up by a con man.”</p><p>Mr. Trump belittled him with the nickname “Little Marco” and attacked him for having “no money.”</p><p>Like many Republicans who criticized Mr. Trump back then, Mr. Rubio has worked overtime to smooth over past disagreements. During the first Trump administration, he strengthened his relationship with the president by advising him on Latin American issues.</p><p>During the 2024 campaign, Mr. Rubio served as a behind-the-scenes foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump and helped him prepare for his first debate against President Biden. Even after he was passed over for vice president, Mr. Rubio remained a staunch surrogate on the campaign trail for the Trump-Vance ticket.</p><h3 id="link-1b7d425b"><span>He is not known as a policy heavyweight in the Senate.</span></h3><p>Mr. Rubio’s one major foray into bipartisan deal making came in 2013, when he served as the lead Republican in the so-called Gang of Eight, a group hammering out a complicated bipartisan immigration bill that would have granted a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already living in the United States. Mr. Rubio ultimately abandoned his own legislation, which failed to pass the House, in the face of backlash from the party’s grass roots.</p><p>In the Senate, he serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and as the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, where he has demanded that the Biden administration block sales to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/business/huawei-annual-earnings-2022.html" title="">Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant</a>, after it released an AI processor chip-powered laptop.</p><p>Mr. Rubio has been better known as a political climber than a legislator. A three-term senator, he is not known for leading any other major legislation in Congress after the failed push for immigration reform. In 2016, he opposed same-sex marriage and in 2022 he dismissed legislation the Senate passed to codify the right to same-sex marriage as a “stupid waste of time.”</p><h3 id="link-69c453f3"><span>He is a hawk but has turned against more funding for Ukraine.</span></h3><p>Mr. Rubio has long staked out a hawkish foreign policy approach, sometimes contrasting with Mr. Trump’s “America First” stances.</p><p>He cosponsored legislation last year that would bar any president from removing the United States from NATO without congressional approval, a measure that was seen as a precaution should Mr. Trump win the presidency and follow through with his frequent threats to abandon the alliance.</p><p>Mr. Rubio has pressed for a more confrontational approach to Beijing, warning that China’s Communist rulers are adversaries who aim to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/us/politics/marco-rubio-china-republicans.html" title="">“rise at the expense of the United States.”</a></p><p>He introduced legislation to block <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/10/tech/rubio-ford-china-battery-technology/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tax credits for electric vehicle batteries</a> produced using Chinese technology and was sanctioned by the Chinese government in 2020, along with five other U.S. lawmakers, for “behaving badly on Hong Kong-related issues.”</p><p>When Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, Mr. Rubio quickly supported the Biden administration’s push to send billions of dollars and heavy arms to Kyiv. But he has since shifted his stance, voting in April against a $95 billion aid package for Ukraine and arguing that Kyiv needed to negotiate a settlement with Russia to end the war.</p><p>“I’m not on Russia’s side — but unfortunately the reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement,” he said on NBC earlier this year.</p><h3 id="link-2a4b765f"><span>He has shifted with his party on immigration issues.</span></h3><p>Mr. Rubio began climbing the political ladder in 1998, the same year he was married to Jeanette Dousdebes, a Miami Dolphins cheerleader and the child of Colombian immigrants. He was 26 and was elected to the five-seat city commission in West Miami. The smooth-talking, boyish-looking, Spanish-speaking Mr. Rubio was then elected to the state legislature in 2000, where he supported a bill that would allow undocumented students to qualify for in-state tuition.</p><p>When he rose to become the speaker of the Florida statehouse in 2006, he opposed Republican efforts to crack down on undocumented immigrants.</p><p>But in 2010, when he mounted his first campaign for Senate, he positioned himself as a hard-line immigration hawk.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE5NDI5ZGEzLTA4MTgtNWQ2My05ODg5LTM4ODEyZjJmYTZjNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/us/trump-news-house-election#trump-higher-education-policy-universities" data-source-id="100000009819762"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/vimal-patel"><img alt="Vimal Patel" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sharon-otterman"><img alt="Sharon Otterman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/14/multimedia/author-sharon-otterman/author-sharon-otterman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/14/multimedia/author-sharon-otterman/author-sharon-otterman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/14/multimedia/author-sharon-otterman/author-sharon-otterman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-12T19:39:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 12, 2024, 2:39 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President-elect Donald J.

Trump’s victory to a second presidential term and a Congress potentially under unified G.O.P. control, Republicans are now poised to escalate their efforts to root out what they see as progressive ideology in higher education.</p><div><p>The return to power of Mr. Trump comes at a vulnerable moment for higher education. Universities have been under increasing pressure from lawmakers, while public confidence in colleges <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646880/confidence-higher-education-closely-divided.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has fallen</a>. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/09/us/university-of-pennsylvania-president-resigns.html" title="">two Ivy League presidents resigned</a> following their widely panned performances before Congressional panels that grilled them about how they handled pro-Palestinian activists on their campuses. Other top university leaders have resigned amid criticism over protest responses.</p><p>Mr. Trump has said he thought that colleges needed to be reclaimed from <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-protecting-students-from-the-radical-left-and-marxist-maniacs-infecting-educational-institutions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Marxist maniacs,”</a> and his running mate, JD Vance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FR65Cifnhw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has described universities</a> as “the enemy.” (Both men attended Ivy League institutions.)</p><p>Republicans have often trained their focus mainly on highly selective campuses, but their proposed policies could have a wider impact. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 — an outline for Mr. Trump’s second term that he has tried to distance himself from — calls for sweeping changes, like privatizing all student loans, rolling back protections for transgender students, and paring back diversity efforts on campus.</p><p>“This is a moment of enormity for American higher education,” said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities. “Many of President Trump’s top advisers are the architects of Project 2025, which seeks to dismantle higher education, not reform it, and to replace what they perceive as woke Marxist ideology with their own conservative ideology.”</p><p>Some items on Republicans’ wish lists, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/shut-down-department-of-education-trump.html" title="">eliminating the Department of Education</a>, will be challenging to achieve. But their plans include a slew of other ideas that worry universities.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Presidents of elite colleges have been grilled by Congress over complaints of antisemitism on campuses.

The president-elect has spoken of expanding the taxation of university endowments. And the new administration could scrap President Biden’s expansive student-debt forgiveness efforts and loosen regulation of for-profit colleges.</p><p>Mr. Trump did not make higher education a major focus of his first term. His focus on the sector in his second term may depend partly on who he chooses to lead the Education Department.</p><p>Still, advocates for colleges worry that Republicans will push their plans aggressively, with an emboldened Mr. Trump and an army of conservative activists who have honed their strategy and amassed a striking run of recent victories.</p><p>“There’s a gathering force here,” said Steven Brint, a public policy professor at the University of California at Riverside. “They feel — and rightly, actually — that Americans have lost confidence in higher education.”</p><p>Much about how Republicans may attack higher education in the new Trump term remains unclear, according to Robert Kelchen, an education professor at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. But Republicans will no doubt use the bully pulpit, as they did during Congressional hearings over the last year, to ramp up efforts to reshape higher education at a moment when colleges and universities are politically and culturally weaker.</p><p>“If I was the president of a selective private college, or even a big blue-state public university, I would be very concerned,” Dr. Kelchen said, “especially if I was a woman or person of color, because that’s who was disproportionately brought in for hearings.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Civil rights complaints filed with the Education Department related to antisemitism have proliferated since Oct. 7, 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Universities have been under pressure to crack down on student protests against Israel’s war in Gaza, which Republican and some Democratic lawmakers have described as supportive of terrorism and veering into antisemitism. Civil rights complaints filed with the Education Department related to antisemitism <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/24/us/politics/kenneth-marcus-college-antisemitism-complaints.html" title="">have proliferated</a> since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s Education Department could play an important role in trying to curb student and faculty protesters. In a 2019 executive order, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/politics/trump-anti-semitism-jews.html" title="">embraced a definition of antisemitism</a> that included claims that Israel’s existence was a “racist endeavor,” a move that advocates of academic freedom said would chill speech.</p><p>The Biden administration did not reverse Mr. Trump’s executive order, and universities have expressed confusion about exactly what the Education Department required of them on the issue. Now, supporters of academic freedom worry that a new Trump administration will have a more aggressive interpretation of what constitutes antisemitism, one that could further stifle speech about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p><p>There is nothing resembling a consensus about how universities should be preparing for a new Trump administration, partly because it remains an open question how much of the president-elect’s rhetoric will be turned into reality.</p><p>Dr. Brint said colleges should start by making a better case to the public that they are not partisan. They should <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/us/harvard-university-statements-empathy.html" title="">commit to institutional neutrality</a> — the practice of avoiding making statements about the political issues of the day — and should reconsider some aspects of their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, which he said have become divisive.</p><p>“Colleges have become a little too closely tied to the policy objectives of one of the two political parties,” Dr. Brint said.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump’s administration is expected to be friendly to for-profit colleges.

One who has spoken out is Michael Roth, the president of Wesleyan University, who <a href="https://roth.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2024/11/06/work-to-do-after-the-election/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> the day after the election that he would double down on the university’s equity and inclusion office.</p><p>“President-elect Trump has threatened the largest deportation in American history, and we have students and faculty and staff who will be threatened by that,” Dr. Roth said in an interview. “I want them to know that the university will do what it can to support them.”</p><p>He was <a href="https://slate.com/life/2024/10/trump-college-presidents-politics-liberal-conservative.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more forceful in an opinion essay</a> published shortly before the election.</p><p>“The folks who brought us the fraudulent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/us/politics/trump-university.html" title="">Trump University,</a>” he wrote, referring to Mr. Trump’s failed for-profit venture, which resulted in a payment of $25 million to former students to settle fraud claims, “now threaten to dismantle a higher education ecosystem that is still (for now) the envy of the rest of the world. We must not be neutral about this.”</p><p>Among the ideas Mr. Trump floated during his campaign was <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-the-american-academy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new university</a>: the American Academy, a tuition-free online university that the president-elect said would compete with existing colleges and dole out bachelor’s degrees that would be recognized by all government agencies and federal contractors.</p><p>This new institution — which he said would be “strictly nonpolitical” with “no wokeness or jihadism” — would be paid for by another proposal by Mr. Trump: Expanding taxation of university endowments, a notable departure from his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts.html" title="">broader focus on cutting taxes</a>.</p><p>Dr. Kelchen said such a new university would be “exceedingly unlikely,” though he added a caveat: “I’m just expecting the unexpected at this point.”</p><p>The endowment tax increase could stand a better chance of becoming reality because of universities’ weakened political position. Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/college-endowments-tax.html" title="">signed a bill in 2017</a> that levied a 1.4 percent tax on the income from the wealthiest university endowments. Some Republicans want to sharply increase that tax rate, or expand it to apply to more institutions.</p><p>Some colleges depend heavily on their endowments to pay for student financial aid. At Colby College, a small liberal arts college in Maine, the endowment’s annual income of roughly $60 million covers about 20 percent of the school’s annual budget, according to David Greene, the university’s president.</p><p>The gain for the Treasury from expanding the endowment tax would be “less than a rounding error,” Dr. Greene said.</p><p>“So it’s simply a punishment,” he added. “A political tool. If you do that, you have to realize who you’re actually punishing. And it’s going to be students.”</p><p>Another way of applying financial leverage would be to go after the way colleges and universities are accredited, and therefore become eligible to participate in federal student aid programs.</p><p>The current system is overseen by nongovernmental organizations that are approved by the federal government. Mr. Trump has talked about opening up the process and allowing states to accredit universities directly. He might also decide to approve new accrediting agencies that would be friendlier to for-profit colleges, similar to actions taken during <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/02/15/college-accreditation-department-education-betsy-devos-south-dakota-sioux-falls/4746906002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his first term</a>.</p><p>Other major policy priorities, including imposing tariffs on imports, may occupy the president-elect’s bandwidth before he turns to higher education. And some industry leaders have not abandoned hope of finding an accommodation with the new administration.</p><p>Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, a higher education trade group, said he worried that the administration would use federal funding to force ideological conformity and promote conservative program preferences. But he also hoped for common ground.</p><p>“Income inequality, job preparation, a belief in strong civic values — these are all things that we depend on higher education to deliver,” he said. “And together, we can — but we need to start from a point of partnership.”</p><p>Anemona Hartocollis<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="15" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzAzNGExN2U2LWM5YTEtNWE1NC1hZDU5LTM2MTAzNmQyMGJjNg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/us/trump-news-house-election#trump-house-majority" data-source-id="100000009821287"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/annie-karni"><img alt="Annie Karni" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/multimedia/author-annie-karni/author-annie-karni-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/multimedia/author-annie-karni/author-annie-karni-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/multimedia/author-annie-karni/author-annie-karni-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maya-c-miller"><img alt="Maya C.

Trump’s push to stack his administration with loyal members of Congress is colliding with a tough political reality for Republicans: They are running out of the bodies they need to preserve the narrow House majority they expect to hold.</p><p>With the party on track to win the House by a precariously small margin and Mr. Trump tapping two House members to serve in top national security posts, Republican leaders warned on Tuesday that they can’t spare any more.</p><div><p>“I don’t expect that we will have more members leaving, but I’ll leave that up to him,” Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference on Tuesday morning, as Congress returned to Washington for the first time since the election. </p><p>Control of the House of Representatives is still officially up for grabs, with several competitive races not yet called, but Republicans appear to be positioned to keep the majority by a similarly tiny edge that has made it so difficult for them to govern over the past two years. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-house.html" title="">As of Tuesday afternoon, they had won control of 214 seats, and Democrats had 205</a>. A party needs 218 seats for a majority, and most strategists expect that the G.O.P. will end up with only a few to a handful more than that.</p><p>That means that if Mr. Trump were to continue to raid their ranks to fill out his White House and cabinet, Republicans could lose their edge altogether.</p><p>“Every single vote will count, because if someone gets ill or has a car accident or a late flight on their plane, then it affects the votes on the floor,” said Mr. Johnson, who has cultivated a close relationship with Mr. Trump. He added that the president-elect “fully understands and appreciates the math here, and it’s just a numbers game.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has already tapped Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 4 House Republican, to serve as the ambassador to the United Nations, and Representative Mike Waltz, Republican of Florida, as his national security adviser.</p><p>Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority leader, echoed Mr. Johnson’s concern and tried to hint that the music had stopped on Washington’s current game of musical chairs — at least when it came to his ranks. </p><p>“Hopefully no more for a little while,” Mr. Scalise said.</p><p>Many House Republicans have spent years currying favor with Mr. Trump. Had he won the White House and Democrats taken back control of the House, those members would have been in prime positions to join his administration. The tight Republican majority in the House may benefit Mr. Trump’s agenda, but for at least some G.O.P. lawmakers, it will also mean putting their own personal ambitions on hold.</p><p>In the event of a House vacancy, there is typically a special election called to fill the seat for the remainder of the term. That process, the timing of which is sometimes dictated by the state’s governor, can take months. </p><p>In Ms. Stefanik’s case, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, a Democrat, would have an incentive to hold up the special election for as long as possible.</p><p>Elon Musk, Mr. Trump’s most well-known backer who has been a constant presence at Mar-a-Lago while the president-elect fills out his cabinet, made it clear on X that he had reservations about Ms. Stefanik’s appointment, based on the tight margin of control expected in the House.</p><p>“Elise is awesome, but it might be too dicey to lose her from the House, at least for now,” Mr. Musk wrote.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvY2VhNGQwNDItYWRlZi01NGNlLWJkYTktYWQ4MzRiNjA4YjMx"><div id="cea4d042-adef-54ce-bda9-ad834b608b31" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/us/trump-news-house-election#cea4d042-adef-54ce-bda9-ad834b608b31"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-haberman"><img alt="Maggie Haberman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-12T18:51:10.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 12, 2024, 1:51 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Trump has also announced that he will nominate Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, to be the United States ambassador to Israel.

Trump has chosen to be his national security adviser, is a former Green Beret and three-term congressman who established himself early on Capitol Hill as a key hawkish voice on matters of national security.</p><p>Mr. Waltz, who received four Bronze Stars after multiple combat tours in Afghanistan and Africa, has the pedigree of the type of conservative who once espoused the G.O.P. orthodoxy on foreign policy. At the Pentagon, he worked as a defense adviser to defense secretaries Donald H. Rumsfeld and Robert M. Gates. He advised then-Vice President Dick Cheney on counterterrorism.</p><div><p>But during his time in Congress, Mr. Waltz has espoused a national security doctrine that has increasingly jelled with Mr. Trump’s worldview. A member of the Armed Services, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees, he <a href="https://waltz.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=875" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has chastised NATO allies</a> for not meeting their military spending commitments and taken a hard line on China and Iran.</p><h2 id="link-5b4328d6">He has deep connections to the Trump administration.</h2><p>Even during his first term in Congress, Mr. Waltz caught the eye of the Trump White House with his national security credentials. In 2020, in the days after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/world/middleeast/qassem-soleimani-iraq-iran-attack.html" title="">Mr. Trump authorized the drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani</a> of Iran, Mr. Waltz was included in a small group of Republicans invited to the White House who received a briefing on the strike. He frequently appears on Fox News as an expert on matters of national security.</p><p>His wife, Julia Nesheiwat, was homeland security adviser in the first Trump administration.</p><h2 id="link-69057db0">His hawkish worldview extends from Mexico to Iran to Afghanistan.</h2><p>Since he was elected to Congress in 2019 to represent a district in eastern Florida, Mr. Waltz has displayed a hawkish outlook on Iran and China, but also on Mexico and Afghanistan.</p><p>He was a vociferous critic of President Biden’s precipitous withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.</p><p>“What no one can ever do for me, including this administration right now, is articulate a counterterrorism plan that’s realistic without us there,” Mr. Waltz said in an interview in the days after the withdrawal.</p><p>Mr. Waltz had also opposed withdrawing large numbers of troops from Afghanistan during the Trump administration without stringent conditions, and he <a href="https://waltz.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=191" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced legislation</a> to prevent a significant troop drawdown from Afghanistan unless the director of national intelligence could certify that the Taliban would not associate with Al Qaeda.</p><p>In 2023, Mr. Waltz led legislation that would authorize the president to use military force against Mexican drug cartels based on their fentanyl trafficking, production and distribution. The bill mirrored the war powers Congress gave former President George W. Bush before the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOWNmZmE5ZWUtZDczNC01NzNlLTg2MzUtNGFmMzFmYzRjMjc2"><div id="9cffa9ee-d734-573e-8635-4af31fc4c276" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/us/trump-news-house-election#9cffa9ee-d734-573e-8635-4af31fc4c276"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-rappeport"><img alt="Alan Rappeport" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-alan-rappeport/author-alan-rappeport-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-alan-rappeport/author-alan-rappeport-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-alan-rappeport/author-alan-rappeport-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-12T17:03:03.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 12, 2024, 12:03 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The shortlist of aspiring Treasury secretaries just got a little shorter.

Trump.</p><p>Mr. Paxton’s emergency request — filed on Monday in Federal District Court in Amarillo — came as some of Mr. Trump’s allies have said they want to hold the special counsel accountable for prosecuting Mr. Trump.</p><div><p>Without specifying precisely what actions could be taken, Mr. Paxton wrote that many people close to Mr. Trump are “promising accountability,” giving Mr. Smith “a strong incentive to minimize transparency and accountability in every way possible.”</p><p>He added, “This suit is a modest attempt to avoid that obstruction of accountability.”</p><p>Mr. Smith brought two federal criminal cases against Mr. Trump: One for plotting to overturn the 2020 election and one for holding on to classified documents after he left office and obstructing their return.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Smith gave the clearest signal yet that the federal cases against Mr. Trump may be drawing to an end. A judge in Washington <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/jack-smith-trump-jan-6-case.html" title="">granted Mr. Smith’s request to put on hold all activity</a> in the election case, a pause that Mr. Smith said was needed so that prosecutors could assess the effects of Mr. Trump’s election victory on the future of the case.</p><p>A longstanding Justice Department policy bars the prosecution of sitting presidents. Mr. Smith has already opened discussions with Justice Department leaders about how best to wind down both cases. (The classified documents case, brought in Florida, had been dismissed by a judge there, but Mr. Smith has appealed that decision.)</p><p>Mr. Paxton filed his emergency request to Judge Matthew J.

But in recent days, some of President-elect Donald J. Trump’s allies have pressed him to weigh in on the race against the man considered by many Republicans to be the front-runner: Senator John Thune of South Dakota.</p><div><p>The contenders are Mr. Thune, who is currently the No. 2 leader; Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who has held several leadership positions in the Senate; and Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who is seen as the favorite of the party’s right flank.</p><p>Each man is pitching himself as best equipped to carry out Mr. Trump&#39;s agenda.</p><p>The race to replace Mr. McConnell, who helped conservatives gain control of the Supreme Court, has gone into a form of heated, if genteel, overdrive.</p><p>Mr. Thune made his case <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-john-thune-modern-republican-party-our-mandate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an opinion essay on Fox News</a>, arguing that Senate Republicans need to fulfill Mr. Trump’s promises to voters in order to keep the support of a multiethnic, multiracial coalition that swept him into a second term.</p><p>“If we fail to deliver on President Trump’s priorities, we will lose their support,” he wrote. “They have trusted us with their votes. Now we have to roll up our sleeves and get to work.”</p><p>He also pitched colleagues on his plans to open up the Senate floor to more debate and amendments and said he would meet weekly with Speaker Mike Johnson.</p><p>Mr. Cornyn circulated a letter casting himself as the candidate best equipped to overhaul the chamber to get the job done for the MAGA movement.</p><p>“In order to make America great again, we must make the Senate work again,” Mr. Cornyn wrote to his colleagues. “To that end, we will reinvest in a Senate committee process to drive an aggressive legislative agenda that secures our border, reduces federal spending, boosts our economy, unleashes the nation’s energy potential, and reverses bad Biden-Harris policies.”</p><p>And Mr. Scott promoted endorsements from conservative activists on social media, including arguments that he would work to keep transgender athletes out of women’s sports.</p><p>The secret-ballot election will be held Wednesday morning. There is a private forum planned for Tuesday evening moderated by Senator Mike Lee of Utah.</p><p>Retiring senators, such as Mitt Romney of Utah, are not eligible vote, but senators-elect, such as Tim Sheehy of Montana, are. With Republicans expecting to control 53 seats, the winning candidate must have the backing of a majority of those senators, or 27 votes, to become leader.</p><p>For months, Mr. Thune and Mr. Cornyn have been seen as having an edge in the race to succeed Mr. McConnell. Each has crisscrossed the country raising millions of dollars for other senators and shoring up votes privately.</p><p>But Mr. Scott is hoping Mr. Trump will shake up the race with an endorsement. Already, Mr. Trump’s ally, the billionaire Elon Musk, has backed the Floridian. Hard-right advisers are <a href="#trump-senate-thune-scott" title="">pushing him to weigh in against Mr. Thune</a>, an establishment Republican who is reviled by the MAGA right.</p><p>The former president <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1341547750710800385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1341547750710800385%7Ctwgr%5Ebadc6b94d5731243eda2cbd154af36473df675a5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftalkingpointsmemo.com%2Fnews%2Ftrump-attacks-mitchs-boy-sen-thune-for-pooh-poohing-electoral-college-challenge" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has railed against Mr. Thune in the past</a> over his refusal to go along with Mr. Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election. He has also criticized Mr. Cornyn and Mr. Thune as “<a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1346580318745206785" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weak and ineffective</a>.”</p><p>Both Mr. Thune and Mr. Cornyn have worked to improve their relationships with Mr. Trump. Mr. Thune visited Mar-a-Lago in March, and spoke with Mr. Trump just days ago. Mr. Cornyn met with Mr. Trump twice in recent months, in Texas and Nevada, and also speaks with him regularly.</p><p>Both men have run quiet, traditional races, working in one-on-one meetings with senators to secure votes, pitching themselves as experienced leaders who can navigate the intricacies of Congress to deliver on Mr. Trump’s legislative agenda.</p><p>Mr. Scott, by contrast, is running to appeal to the right flank of the party — and doing so publicly and online. Many in the establishment wing of the party view Mr. Scott’s time leading Senate Republicans’ campaign arm as a failure. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/us/politics/rick-scott-mitch-mcconnell-senate.html" title="">He was blamed</a> for failing to recruit quality candidates, questionable spending practices, and the release of a disastrous policy agenda including tax increases and the phasing out of popular entitlement programs that was quickly repudiated by his colleagues. When Mr. Trump urged him to challenge Mr. McConnell for Republican leader two years ago, Mr. Scott <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-rick-scott-senate.html" title="">fell well short, receiving only 10 votes</a>.</p><p>Most Republican senators have not publicly declared which of the three candidates they support for majority leader. Privately some are grumbling about online influencers attempting to pressure them to change their votes.</p><p>Senators often resent outside intervention, even by a president, in their internal affairs, and view it as remarkable that a president would try to handpick a chosen leader in the chamber.</p><p>The last time the White House meddled in the selection of a Senate Republican leader was in 2002, when President George W. Bush and his inner circle helped push out Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi after he made comments at the 100th birthday party of Senator Strom Thurmond that praised the South Carolinian’s presidential bid in 1948, when he ran as a segregationist.</p><p>The Bush team wanted Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, a less experienced and more agreeable figure, to lead Senate Republicans, and saw the opportunity to install someone they could more easily influence. Mr. Frist, a heart transplant surgeon who had run the Republican Senate campaign operation, led the G.O.P. for four years and considered a presidential run but he was never quite able to shake the impression that he was too tightly aligned with the White House.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvY2RjM2U4MDgtN2I4OC01NDZkLWFmMzQtMmFlY2I4ZTgyN2Yz"><div id="cdc3e808-7b88-546d-af34-2aecb8e827f3" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/us/trump-news-house-election#cdc3e808-7b88-546d-af34-2aecb8e827f3"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-crowley"><img alt="Michael Crowley" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-12T14:37:14.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 12, 2024, 9:37 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/blinken-nato-ukraine-russia.html" title="">headed to Brussels today</a> for meetings with NATO and European officials to discuss the Ukraine-Russia war.

Trump’s closest allies are privately counseling him to try to block a onetime Republican nemesis from becoming the Senate majority leader, pushing him to impose his will more forcefully on an already compliant G.O.P. Congress.</p><p>Those advisers believe Mr. Trump should stop Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican, from winning the top post, according to people familiar with the talks. One person close to the president-elect noted that he had not weighed in on the race.</p><div><p>Doing so would be an extraordinary move even for Mr. Trump, who during his first term and since he has left office has had an iron grip on congressional Republicans. He has demanded and almost always received loyalty from them on matters of policy and personnel.</p><p>Mr. Thune, an establishment Republican who is reviled by some on the MAGA right, is competing for the position against Senators John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida. Republican senators and senators-elect are set to vote by secret ballot on Wednesday.</p><p>Intervening in an internal leadership struggle among G.O.P. senators, who have at times been more resistant to the former president’s dictates and where members are fiercely protective of their independence, would signal Mr. Trump’s determination to dominate the legislative branch in his second term. The majority leader controls the Senate floor, including what proposals and nominees receive votes, and when.</p><p>Mr. Trump has already indicated his desire to hold a tighter rein on the Senate in the days since he was elected. He posted an ultimatum on social media on Sunday in which he demanded that any new Senate leader cooperate in his efforts to circumvent the confirmation process by calling recesses during which he could appoint personnel without winning Senate approval. All three candidates vying to lead the Senate next year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/us/politics/republican-senators-trump-scott-thune-cornyn.html" title="">quickly promised to speed through his choices</a>.</p><p>So far, Mr. Trump has not lent his voice to the bid to block Mr. Thune, but influential figures in his orbit are pushing a campaign to do so. They include the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and the right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk. Most of them are instead supporting Mr. Scott, whom Mr. Trump backed two years ago when he challenged Mr. McConnell.</p><p>But Mr. Trump is said to have privately conceded that Mr. Scott, who is unpopular with his colleagues, has little chance of succeeding in his bid. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-rick-scott-senate.html" title="">The Floridian received only 10 votes the last time he sought to lead his G.O.P. colleagues</a>.) One person close to Mr. Trump said the president-elect was reluctant to get involved in the leadership fight unless he is certain he has the votes to push the winner over the line.</p><p>Senators tend to resent outside intervention in their internal business or efforts to bully them publicly, even by a president or president-elect. Laura Loomer, a far-right activist and conspiracy theorist who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/trump-laura-loomer.html" title="">traveled with Mr. Trump on his private plane during the campaign</a>, has publicly threatened on social media to release negative information about Mr. Thune, a tactic that has the potential to backfire.</p><p>Mr. Trump has tried to insert himself in internal congressional elections in the past with mixed success. Last year during a prolonged fight among House Republicans over who should be their speaker, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/us/politics/scalise-jordan-trump-speaker.html" title="">he backed Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio for the post</a>, but the pressure campaign to install him, amplified by the hard right, alienated establishment Republicans, who banded together to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/us/politics/jordan-speaker-house.html" title="">defeat Mr. Jordan</a>. Mr. Trump has had more success at tearing down candidacies than he has at boosting them. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/us/politics/house-republicans-speaker.html" title="">torpedoed the speakership bid of Representative Tom Emmer</a>, whom he slammed as a “RINO.” (Mr. Emmer ended the 2024 race by speaking enthusiastically on Mr. Trump’s behalf at his events.)</p><p>This time, the prospect of Mr. Trump’s involvement has scrambled an already intense fight among Senate Republicans about who should lead them.</p><p>For months, Mr. Thune and Mr. Cornyn have been seen as the front-runners in the race to succeed Mr. McConnell. Each has crisscrossed the country raising millions of dollars for other senators and shoring up votes privately.</p><p>Mr. Thune and Mr. Cornyn, both institutionalists, have worked to improve their relationships with Mr. Trump, who has been harshly critical of each at different times but has stayed out of the fray so far during this leadership contest. Mr. Thune visited Mar-a-Lago in March and spoke with Mr. Trump just days ago. Mr. Cornyn has met with Mr. Trump twice in recent months, in Texas and Nevada, and also speaks with him regularly.</p><p>Both have run quiet, traditional races, working in one-on-one meetings with senators to secure votes, pitching themselves as experienced leaders who can navigate the intricacies of Congress to deliver on Mr. Trump’s legislative agenda. Mr. Thune is believed to have an edge over Mr. Cornyn.</p><p>Mr. Scott, by contrast, is running to appeal to the right flank of the party, and doing so publicly and online. Many in the establishment wing of the party view Mr. Scott’s time leading Senate Republicans’ campaign arm as a failure. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/us/politics/rick-scott-mitch-mcconnell-senate.html" title="">He was blamed</a> for a failure to recruit quality candidates, questionable spending practices, and the release of a disastrous policy agenda including the phasing out of popular entitlement programs that was quickly repudiated by his colleagues.</p><p>Most Republican senators have not publicly declared which of the three candidates they support for majority leader. The three are set to meet on Tuesday night at a closed-door forum moderated by Senator Mike Lee of Utah. Privately, some are already grumbling about online influencers attempting to pressure them to change their votes.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE1N2RjMzdiLTIwNWQtNWUwYi1hNmU4LWNmNDBmODhjZTllYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/us/trump-news-house-election#trump-rubio-secretary-of-state" data-source-id="100000009820311"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-12T01:17:38.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 11, 2024, 8:17 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Marco Rubio was a loyal surrogate for President-elect Donald J.

Trump is expected to name Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as his secretary of state, three people familiar with his thinking said on Monday, as Mr. Trump moves rapidly to fill out his foreign policy and national security team.</p><p>Mr. Trump could still change his mind at the last minute, the people said, but appeared to have settled on Mr. Rubio, whom he also considered when choosing his running mate this year.</p><div><p>Mr. Rubio was elected to the Senate in 2010, and has staked out a position as a foreign policy hawk, taking hard lines on China, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba in particular.</p><p>He initially <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/rubio-and-paul-embody-conservative-debate-over-foreign-policy/" title="">found himself</a> at odds with those Republicans who were more skeptical about interventions abroad, but he has also echoed Mr. Trump more recently on issues like Russia’s war against Ukraine, <a href="https://x.com/SenMarcoRubio/status/1854252665418772536" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying that the conflict has reached a stalemate</a> and “needs to be brought to a conclusion.”</p><p>Despite speaking in hard-line terms about Russia in the past, Mr. Rubio would likely go along with Mr. Trump’s expected plans to press Ukraine to find a way to come to a settlement with Russia and remain outside of NATO. It is unclear whether the leaders of Ukraine or Russia would be prepared to enter into talks at Mr. Trump’s urging.</p><p>Mr. Rubio has been among the most outspoken senators on the need for the United States to be more aggressive on China. He has adopted positions that later became more mainstream in both parties. For example, while serving in Congress during the first Trump administration, he began advocating industrial policy meant to help the United States better compete with China’s state-directed economy.</p><p>Mr. Rubio also served as a co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which has aimed to craft aggressive policy on China, especially in trying to address human rights abuses there. In 2020, Mr. Rubio sponsored a bill that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/us/politics/china-uyghurs-forced-labor.html" title="">tried to prevent the import of Chinese goods</a> made with the use of forced labor by China’s ethnic Uyghur minority. President Biden signed it into law the next year.</p><p>In 2019, Mr. Rubio helped persuade Mr. Trump to adopt a harsh sanctions policy against Venezuela to try to unseat its authoritarian leftist president, Nicolás Maduro. “He’s picked a battle he can’t win,” Mr. Rubio said of Mr. Maduro in an interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/world/americas/marco-rubio-venezuela.html" title="">The New York Times</a>. “It’s just a matter of time. The only thing we don’t know is how long it will take — and whether it will be peaceful or bloody.”</p><p>Though Venezuelans have suffered from the U.S.-imposed sanctions, Mr. Maduro remains in power.</p><p>More recently, Mr. Rubio has expressed unalloyed American support for Israel’s war in Gaza. When asked by a peace activist late last year what he thought about the many Palestinian civilian deaths, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIO2y1IJgwY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>, “I think Hamas is 100 percent to blame.”</p><p>Mr. Rubio has worked across party lines on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee, and would likely sail through a confirmation process.</p><p>If he becomes secretary of state, a main question is whether he would forgo U.S. interventions in parts of the world to prioritize China. That approach would align with Mr. Trump’s “America First” ideas but would run counter to some of Mr. Rubio’s earlier positions.</p><p>Mr. Rubio was a loyal surrogate for Mr. Trump during the campaign even after being passed over as the vice-presidential pick.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Rubio declined to comment, and a spokesman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Trump has made his choice for a number of other national security roles. He has selected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-michael-waltz-national-security-adviser.html" title="">Representative Michael Waltz</a>, Republican of Florida, to be his national security adviser, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/nyregion/elise-stefanik-trump-un.html" title="">Representative Elise Stefanik</a>, Republican of New York, to be ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p>Mr. Rubio was first elected to the Senate in 2010 as part of a new generation of conservative Tea Party leaders. But some conservatives considered him wobbly on immigration, an issue that caused him political problems when he ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 against Mr. Trump and others.</p><p>During that campaign, Mr. Trump belittled him as “Little Marco,” and Mr. Rubio responded with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/us/politics/republican-debate.html" title="">acerbic attacks</a>.</p><p>But after Mr. Trump’s 2016 victory, Mr. Rubio went on to patch things up with him, serving as an informal foreign policy adviser and helping to prepare him for his first debate against Mr. Biden in 2020.</p><p><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11907" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Under Florida law</a>, Gov. Ron DeSantis can temporarily appoint a replacement to Mr. Rubio’s seat who will serve in the Senate until the next regularly scheduled general election is held. After last week’s elections, Republicans are set to hold at least 52 seats in the chamber.</p><p>Catie Edmondson<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
