Trump was standing outside the clubhouse at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J. Behind him was a bunch of butter substitute, milk, eggs and various other groceries that had been laid out across two gold-topped tables with little white signs bearing all sorts of statistics and upward-shooting arrows that detailed the “Price Increase Since Kamala Harris Took Office.”</p><p>The day before, the Consumer Price Index report had been released, and Vice President Harris made plans to unveil her own economic agenda on Friday. So the Trump campaign threw together this news conference to get out ahead of her, to remind voters about inflation and Mr. Trump’s economic record. It came at a time when many of his allies were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/us/politics/trump-harris-campaign.html" title="">begging him to focus</a> on a winning message.</p><p>But he appeared to get bored with the grocery talk after a few minutes. And so, there he stood, beside the Fruit Loops and the Wheaties and the Lunchables and the Folgers and the Oreos and the Wonder Bread, talking about MS-13 gang members and Elon Musk and communism and artificial intelligence and John Kerry and windmills and “bird cemeteries” and diesel fuel and Bagram airport and Viktor Orban and the homicide rate in Chicago.</p><p>After 45 minutes, Mr. Trump, who has described himself as a bacon-and-eggs guy, glanced down at the food and seemed to remember why he was standing out there in the first place. “I haven’t seen Cheerios in a long time,” he said. “I’m going to take them back with me.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>This was a news conference about the economy in set design only.</p><p>“This is a rally,” said Edward X. Young, a Trump supporter who said he’s been to 82 rallies and turned up to Bedminster because he knew Thursday would be no different. “He’ll call it a press conference, but it’s always a rally.”</p><p>Indeed, Mr. Trump used the occasion to do pretty much what he always does: to ramble, to mix it up with his foes in the press, to put on a spectacle for his people, and to lap up their applause in return.</p><p>At one point, he became sidetracked talking about the 2020 election and someone yelled out, “You won!” When Mr. Trump called Ms. Harris a radical socialist, someone else shouted, “Marxist!” When Mr. Trump mentioned his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/us/politics/trump-musk-interview-x.html" title="">livestreamed conversation</a> with Mr. Musk this week, the crowd cheered and he responded, “I agree.”</p><p>Though it was a specialized audience for this bit. There were the golfers who abandoned their game and wandered right off the green to take in the show. There were the groups of elderly women who belonged to the Phyllis Schlafly Eagle Council, which was hosting its annual summit at Bedminster that day. And there were the Orthodox rabbis, who’d turned up for a reception there with Miriam Adelson, the Republican megadonor.</p><p>Inside the pro shop, a man who claimed to have been charged in connection with the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, said he was there for a panel earlier that day on the legal plight of the rioters. “My lawyer said I’m not supposed to do any interviews,” he added as he perused the store’s Trump-themed merchandise.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Siggy Flicker, a former cast member on “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” who is friends with the former president’s lawyer, Alina Habba, wandered by. Ms. Flicker explained that her time on reality television taught her “all about false narratives and selective editing and fake story lines, that’s why I can relate to the greatest president in the history of America, Donald John Trump.”</p><p>This was the audience for Mr. Trump’s performance, and they didn’t care whether he talked about groceries. After his remarks and a few questions from journalists, he told the crowd he’d heard there was a woman among them who’d recently turned 100. He spotted her, approached the fence and told her she looked pretty good.</p><p>Mr. Trump then turned to two Ukrainian men named Alex and Igor who said they believed only he could stop the war with Russia. The former president whipped out a black Sharpie and graffitied his name on their oxford shirts, right across their chests.</p><p>As the butter sat there unloved, melting in the August heat, Mr. Trump’s political strengths and weaknesses were on vivid display: He always knows how to keep his people entertained, but that often comes at the expense of a disciplined approach to campaigning. It was another day, in a tightened race, that he failed to focus on the message he was meant to deliver.</p><p>Would it matter?</p><p>“He’s Trump,” said Marjorie Dahmer, 72, who’d traveled from St. Louis to catch a glimpse of the former president on his golf course. “You don’t control him. That’s what we like about him.”</p></div></div></section><div id="NYT_BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" data-testid="region"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2024-election-footer-carousel" data-id="100000009577677" data-source-id="100000009577677"><div>
