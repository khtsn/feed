Demis Hassabis, the chief executive of Google’s primary artificial intelligence lab, and John Jumper, one of the lab’s scientists, were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/science/nobel-prize-chemistry.html" title="">among a trio of researchers who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> for their efforts to better understand the human body and fight disease through A.I.</p><p>The two Google scientists won their Nobels a day after Geoffrey Hinton, a former Google vice president and researcher, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/science/nobel-prize-physics.html" title="">one of two winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for his pioneering work on artificial intelligence.</p><p>The Nobel wins were a demonstration of the growing role artificial intelligence is playing in areas far beyond the traditional world of the high-tech industry, and were a reminder of Silicon Valley’s influence in nearly every corner of science and the economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This is the year the Nobel committee got A.I.,” said Oren Etzioni, a professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Washington. “These prizes are a conscious recognition of how influential A.I. has become in the scientific world.”</p><p>But the triumphant moment for Google was tempered by concerns that the commercial success that has allowed the company to pursue these long-term projects is under threat by antitrust regulators. The Nobel awards were also a reminder of worries that the tech industry isn’t paying enough attention to the implications of its open-throttled pursuit of building more powerful A.I. systems.</p><p>“We might find ourselves in a situation in which not only the solutions but even the questions being asked are actually being provided by the A.I.,” said Mohammed AlQuraishi, a Columbia University biologist. “It’s going to be very interesting navigating that as scientists and as humans.”</p><p>On Tuesday evening, the Justice Department said it could ask a federal court to force <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/technology/google-search-antitrust.html" title="">Google into breaking off parts of the company or change how it operates</a> in order to eliminate its monopoly in online search.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Google is also facing off with the Justice Department in a Virginia federal court over claims that it broke antitrust laws to dominate the technology that places ads on websites. Closing arguments in that case are expected next month. And on Monday, a federal judge in California <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/technology/google-app-store-epic-games-anticompetitive.html" title="">ordered Google</a> to let other companies place app stores on its Android operating system for three years as part of a third antitrust case.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Google is facing off with the Justice Department in a Virginia federal court over claims that it broke antitrust laws to dominate the technology that places ads on websites.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Brenner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Google is not the only big tech company getting squeezed by regulators. The Justice Department has also sued Apple, arguing that the company makes it tough for customers to ditch its suite of devices and software. The Federal Trade Commission has filed antitrust lawsuits against Meta, saying it snuffed out competition when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp; and Amazon, arguing the company’s practices artificially inflate prices for products online.</p><p>As the largest tech companies fight off concerns over monopolist behavior, they are going all-in on A.I. — so much so that regulators are arguing that the companies must be reined in now before they use their power to take control of the young market for A.I. systems.</p><p>“A.I. is coming to chemistry and going to Washington,” said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. “You may not be interested in A.I. but A.I. is interested in you.”</p><p>In its Tuesday court filing, the Justice Department said it believed that any efforts to tame Google’s search monopoly should take into account its ability to “leverage its monopoly power to feed artificial intelligence features.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Justice Department said it was considering asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which in August agreed with the government that Google abused a search monopoly, to take steps to limit Google’s power in the new technology, including allowing websites to opt out of having their content used in the development of Google’s artificial intelligence systems.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department this year reached a separate deal clearing the way for them to investigate other companies focused on A.I. development. The Justice Department has opened an inquiry into Nvidia, which makes computer chips essential to the technology, while the F.T.C. will be responsible for investigating Microsoft and its partner, the San Francisco company OpenAI.</p><p>(The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and Microsoft in December over copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)</p><p>In the early 1960s, when computer science was emerging as a field, the standard put down was that any academic discipline that put “science” in its name wasn’t one. A computer, skeptics said, was a mere tool like a test tube or a microscope.</p><p>But as the technology has progressed, accelerated by recent advances in artificial intelligence, computer science has become a driving force behind discoveries across the sciences — in astronomy, biology, chemistry, medicine and physics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Chatbots are how most people know A.I., but the technology’s ability to speed scientific discovery is much more important,” Mr. Brynjolfsson said.</p><p>After OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, igniting an industrywide A.I. boom, some researchers turned up the volume on their concerns about how the technology could be used.</p><p>Dr. Hinton left Google, using his retirement as an opportunity to speak freely about his worry that the race toward A.I. could one day be catastrophic. He said on Tuesday that he hoped “having the Nobel Prize could mean that people will take me more seriously.”</p><p>Leading researchers such as Dr. Hassabis often describe artificial intelligence as a way to cure disease, battle climate change and solve other scientific mysteries that have long bedeviled the world’s researchers. The work that won a Nobel was a significant step in that direction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demis Hassabis, left, and John Jumper at the Google DeepMind offices in London on Wednesday after being awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Toby Melville/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>DeepMind, Google’s main A.I. lab, created technology called AlphaFold that can rapidly and reliably predict the physical shape of proteins — the microscopic mechanisms that drive the behavior of the human body and all living things. By pinpointing protein structures, scientists can more quickly develop medicines and vaccines and tackle other scientific problems.</p><p>In 2012, Dr. Hinton, then a professor at the University of Toronto, published a research paper with two of his graduate students that demonstrated the power of an A.I. technology called a neural network. Google paid $44 million to bring them to the company.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, last year.

Dr. Hinton and Dr. Hassabis were part of a small academic community that had nurtured neural networks for years while the rest of the world had largely ignored it.</p><p>Dr. Hinton, 76, liked to call Dr. Hassabis, 48, his “grand-post-doc” because he had overseen the post doctoral work of the academic who later oversaw Dr. Hassabis’s research.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Dr. Hassabis also worries that A.I. could cause a range of problems or even threaten humanity if it is not carefully controlled. But he thinks that staying with a company is the best way to make sure its A.I. doesn’t cause problems.</p><p>When Google acquired DeepMind, Dr. Hassabis and his co-founders asked for assurances that Google would not use DeepMind’s technologies for military purposes and that it would establish an independent board that would work to ensure that its technologies were not misused.</p><p>“Of course it’s a dual-purpose technology,” Dr. Hassabis said during a news conference after winning the Nobel Prize. “It has extraordinary potential for good, but also it can be used for harm.”</p><p>Teddy Rosenbluth<!-- --> contributed reporting in New York.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cade Metz writes about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas of technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cade-metz">More about Cade Metz</a></span></p></div><div><p>Steve Lohr writes about technology and its impact on the economy, jobs and the workplace.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/steve-lohr">More about Steve Lohr</a></span></p></div><div><p>David McCabe is a Times reporter who covers the complex legal and policy issues created by the digital economy and new technologies.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-mccabe">More about David McCabe</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
