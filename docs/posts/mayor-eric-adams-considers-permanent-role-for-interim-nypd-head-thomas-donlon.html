It didn’t last long.</p><p>On Sept. 21, a week after his appointment, Mr. Donlon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/nyregion/nypd-thomas-donlon-search.html" title="">acknowledged that he was also the subject of a federal probe</a>. F.B.I. agents had come to his home with a warrant and demanded he return files he had taken more than 20 years ago when he left the agency. Almost immediately, reports began circulating that Mr. Donlon would go the way of other City Hall executives who had resigned amid the crisis.</p><p>His acting chief of staff, Terri Tobin, and other supervisors assigned to his office stepped aside about a month after they started their roles for reasons that remain unclear, according to two people with knowledge of the change.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/nyregion/nypd-nyc-marathon.html" title="">On Nov. 3, the commissioner had a public spat during the New York City Marathon</a> with his acting chief of staff, Tarik Sheppard. The men, according to two people briefed on the incident, argued so vociferously during a photo opportunity that they had to be separated. The incident <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/811-24/transcript-mayor-adams-holds-in-person-media-availability" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forced Mr. Adams to answer questions</a> about infighting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Yet two months in, Mr. Donlon remains and has told friends and people at the department that he wants to stay.</p><p>“He has no intention of leaving,” said Mark Carroll, a friend and retired federal prosecutor who has known him for 44 years. “He likes the job, and he likes the work. He enjoys helping people and doing public service. That’s been his whole career.”</p><p>Fabien Levy, a spokesman for Mr. Adams, said on Friday that Mr. Donlon remains under consideration for the permanent job.</p><p>He became Mayor Adams’s third police commissioner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">on Sept. 13</a>, replacing Edward Caban, who had resigned following the seizure of his phone by federal officials investigating members of Mr. Adams’s administration. Mr. Adams’s first commissioner, Keechant Sewell, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/13/nyregion/keechant-sewell-nypd-resignation.html" title="">resigned last year</a>.</p><p>As he waits to learn his future, Mr. Donlon is meeting with union leaders in his conference room on the 14th floor of headquarters at 1 Police Plaza. He has stood in at several news conferences, though he often lets other executives handle questions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He is going to roll calls and visiting crime hot spots, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBgp3eqpyuF/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like Roosevelt Avenue in Queens</a>, where officers have been targeting prostitution rings. He talks daily to chiefs and deputy commissioners who said he is curious and eager to learn the intricacies of a vast agency with more 50,000 employees, just over 34,000 of them uniformed police officers.</p><p>Mr. Donlon is leading America’s biggest police department at a difficult time for the city and its officers. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/nyregion/eric-adams-corruption-trial-date-court.html" title="">The mayor faces corruption charges</a>. Residents remain skeptical that the department has controlled violence despite falling crime rates, and many officers are feeling overwhelmed by long hours, tensions with the public and sagging morale.</p><p>Twenty-three percent of officers surveyed last year said they were ready to leave the department or the profession, <a href="https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1569&amp;context=jj_pubs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a study by researchers from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and DeSales University</a>. Officers cited their reasons for wanting to leave: poor working conditions, such as unsanitary workplaces and inferior equipment, and forced overtime, which has affected their ability to balance work and their personal lives.</p><p>This is a critical time for steady leadership, said Louis A. Turco, president of the Lieutenants Benevolent Association. He said the commissioner invited him about two weeks ago to discuss his union’s concerns. The men spoke for about an hour, primarily about the disciplinary process, which Lt. Turco said is arbitrary and drags on, leaving officers accused of wrongdoing in limbo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“I found the commissioner to be very friendly and open to our concerns,” Lt. Turco said. “He’s new to the organization. He wanted to understand it.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Commissioner Donlon attended the New York marathon last week, where he got into an argument with his chief of staff.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Uli Seit for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Immediately after Mr. Donlon took the job, he sought to instill a sense of order. He told top chiefs and commissioners that he wanted leaders to act professionally — especially to stop fighting with reporters and critics on social media.</p><p>Mr. Donlon has yet to sit down with reporters for a full interview. The department declined to make him available or respond to questions about any policy changes he wants to make.</p><p>With the city still reeling from investigations and the choice of department leader still up in the air, no commissioner could speak with full confidence, said Brandon del Pozo, a former Police Department deputy inspector who is now an assistant professor at Brown University.</p><p>“You want spirited leadership, not just consistency, but a voice, a brand, a vision,” he said. “It would be very hard to find a leader with a vision who would commit to the long haul because no one knows how long that haul will be.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At the moment, the department does not have “somebody with the sure-footedness to be a solid leader,” Mr. del Pozo said.</p><p>But for now, Mr. Donlon is acting the part. His use of social media accounts on Instagram and X has grown quickly with photos of him <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBh-_58sWCi/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posing with fraternal organizations,</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBxEiVhPHRq/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting new recruits</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nypdpc/p/DBpJuWdPPg7/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attending memorial events for officers killed in the line of duty.</a></p><p>Scott Munro, the president of the detectives’ union, recalled a recent promotion ceremony where the commissioner stood on the stage and asked individual officers how they were and where they worked.</p><p>“The promotions went a little long,” Detective Munro said. He described the commissioner as “down to earth” and a “gentleman.”</p><p>“He’s out there,” Detective Munro said. “He’s meeting people.”</p><p>The federal probe still hangs over Mr. Donlon’s head, and it remains unclear whether he even has the security clearance that would allow him to get full briefings from the F.B.I. The department did not respond to questions about his clearance. The F.B.I. did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Donlon’s lawyer, Jim McGovern, a partner at Vinson &amp; Elkins, said he “continues to cooperate” with the investigation.</p><p>He described Mr. Donlon as thrilled to have his “dream job.”</p><p>“As each day passes, he’s more committed to doing the job that he has been asked to do,” Mr. McGovern said. “He wants to get the Police Department to where he believes it can be.”</p><p>The news of the search warrant shocked Mr. Donlon’s friends and former colleagues at the F.B.I.</p><p>“I’ve known Tom to be nothing but a straight shooter,” said Joe Pistone, a former F.B.I. agent who met Mr. Donlon in 1974 when they were both working in New York. “If I were doing a background check on Tom, everything would be positive. He’s a rules follower.”</p><p>When the agents came to his apartment to ask for the files, Mr. Donlon told them they had the wrong address: The files were at another one of his homes in New York, according to a friend of Mr. Donlon, who spoke with the commissioner about the investigation and asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the investigation.</p><p>Mr. Donlon gave them the keys to the apartment, told them the address and said they were welcome to let themselves in and grab whatever files they needed, the friend said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Cramer is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and crime in the city and surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-cramer">More about Maria Cramer</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Adams Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Adams Indictment</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Federal prosecutors unveiled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html">five-count indictment</a> against Mayor Eric Adams, charging him with bribery conspiracy, fraud and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations.</p></li><li><p><strong>What Happens Next?</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The indictment of Adams prompted calls for his resignation, but there is no legal requirement that he leave office.
