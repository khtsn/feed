For years, she enticed a following of tens of thousands of voyeurs by sharing copious photos of their vintage-cars-private-planes-deep-sea-yachts lifestyle.</p><p>But social media notoriety no longer bears much difference from fame. And so when Mr. Miller, 43, died over the Fourth of July holiday after poisoning himself in the garage of the family’s Hamptons home — amid rumors of indiscriminate spending and staggering debt — a media frenzy followed.</p><p>On Reddit, TikTok and Instagram, the question of what had gone wrong became summertime sport. Online sleuths screen-shotted the photo crumbs that were not swept away after Ms. Miller scrapped her account, zooming in to search for fissures in the glamour. News and tabloid publications picked over mortgage filings and public loan records, seeking to understand how the Millers’ extravagant house-of-cards existence had finally toppled.</p><p>The public was transfixed, and then it moved on.</p><p>But behind the scenes, a different sort of frenzy quickly unfurled as creditors scrambled for repayment, lawsuits were filed and a lavish property — once the site of gilded parties — was hurried to market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Nearly six months later, Mr. Miller’s widow, lawyers, lenders and courts are still untangling an extraordinary financial mess. As they do, the saga raises fundamental questions about the ease with which someone was able to convert a patina of ornate wealth into millions of dollars in loans.</p><p>When Mr. Miller died — without a will — he had $33.6 million in debt and just $8,000 in the bank, according to a court filing made by Ms. Miller.</p><p>He did not leave his family destitute, though. In the suicide note that Mr. Miller left for his wife, he told her that his death would entitle her to about $15 million from life insurance policies he had purchased. Ms. Miller has since received those funds, according to three people familiar with her finances.</p><p>(Life insurance policies often have an exclusion for suicide, but it generally lasts only two years after the policy is purchased, according to industry experts, assuming that the policyholder did not lie or commit fraud in securing the policy.)</p><p>Ms. Miller, who declined requests for comment, is making a new life with her daughters in Miami Beach. She is living in a $10 million, 2,800-square-foot condominium that overlooks the ocean. It is owned by an L.L.C. connected to Alexander von Furstenberg, son of the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, and is on loan to Ms. Miller, according to three people aware of the arrangement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But the past is close behind. Though Ms. Miller told friends after her husband’s death that she had not asked him about his business affairs and had kept a distance from details of their personal finances, she has since been enmeshed in such matters. Legal filings show that she is working with lawyers to wrangle the debts of her husband’s estate — those which she personally may be on the hook for, and those which so far creditors have not made legal claims to tie her to.</p><p>In late August, court documents show, she agreed to pay about $4 million to settle a lawsuit over an unpaid loan.</p><p>Ms. Miller has also been sued for $194,881.89 in unpaid rent by the company that owns the Park Avenue apartment that she and Mr. Miller had lived in since 2021, which rented for about $47,000 per month. In a response to the lawsuit, Ms. Miller denied that she owed the rent because, she said, she had not personally signed the lease agreement. </p><p>Mr. Miller’s estate is carrying numerous other unresolved debts, according to court records.</p><p>Mr. Miller had more than $20 million in unsecured loans, according to his widow’s legal filings — from institutional lenders, including UBS Bank ($2.1 million) and BMO Bank ($11.25 million), as well as from family friends and American Express, which he owed more than $300,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>His main asset was the Hamptons house — which was loaded with five mortgages totaling nearly $12 million. It was placed <a href="https://www.bespokerealestate.com/listing/cobb-isle-road-water-mill-ny/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the market</a> in August, with an asking sale price of $15.5 million. Court records show that Ms. Miller considered at least two offers for the house and its furnishings: one for $12.8 million and the other for $13 million. It sold last week, according to two people familiar with the transaction.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Millers’ vacation home in the Hamptons, which was loaded with five mortgages totaling nearly $12 million, was recently sold.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johnny Milano for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As Mr. Miller’s need for cash intensified at the end of his life, he turned to friends and high-risk lenders. One lender, who agreed to be interviewed if his name was not included in this article, said that he lent Mr. Miller $208,000 in early June, after Mr. Miller came to him nearly in tears.</p><p>Mr. Miller said he would repay the loan in a week, according to the lender, offering a piece of the Hamptons house as collateral. The lender had previously provided an unsecured loan of $1 million to Mr. Miller, who had paid back all but $60,000. So the lender said he was happy to help again.</p><p>By mid-June, Mr. Miller had stopped responding to his repeated calls and texts, he said, so he began to reach out to Mr. Miller’s lawyer to urge that Mr. Miller make a good-faith partial payment. Mr. Miller never did so.</p><p>The lender now says that he wishes he had not exerted so much pressure on Mr. Miller.</p><p>When the Hamptons house was sold last week, the estate repaid the $208,000 plus interest, he said. The $60,000 remains outstanding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Earlier this month, many of Mr. Miller’s loved ones had sad occasion to reconnect: His mother, Barbara Miller, died at 81. About 50 friends of Brandon and his sister, Maurley Miller, gathered in the bitter December cold to pay their respects as their mother was laid to rest beside the graves of her husband and her son.</p><p>“Our beautiful Barbara passed away with a broken heart, and we are desperately trying to find comfort and peace in knowing that she has been reunited with her beloved husband, Michael, and precious son, Brandon,” Maurley Miller said in a statement.</p><p>“The tragedy that my family has endured over the past few months has been absolutely devastating,” she said. “The pain is indescribable.”</p><p>Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>12</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>In Shadow of Social Media Fame, Widow Deals With Tangle of Debt<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
