    <h1>Eric Adams Charged With Bribery and Fraud</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indicted-news" title="">indicted on five federal charges</a> of bribery, fraud and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations that prosecutors said began at least a decade ago and continued after he became mayor. He’s the first sitting mayor in the city’s history to be criminally charged.</p><p>Damian Williams, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/nyregion/damian-williams-sdny-prosecutor.html" title="">the U.S. attorney prosecuting the case</a>, said that Adams — a retired police captain who was elected as a Democrat in 2021 on a pledge to reduce crime — was “showered” with over $100,000 in gifts that he knew were illegal. Those include free airline tickets, lavish overseas accommodations and campaign donations from Turkey. </p><p>In return, Williams said, Adams used his influence as Brooklyn borough president, then later as mayor, to aide Turkish officials. Most notably, prosecutors argued, Adams pressured officials at the Fire Department to permit a new Turkish consulate building in Manhattan despite safety problems.</p><p>In a news conference, Adams insisted that he was innocent and vowed to fight the charges. “I ask New Yorkers to wait to hear our defense,” he said. Adams was ordered to be arraigned tomorrow, but he said he would not resign despite a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/eric-adams-resignation-calls-list.html" title="">cascade of elected officials calling on him to do so</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>St. Petersburg, Fla., today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Craine for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destruction from an Israeli airstrike in Baalbek, Lebanon, yesterday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-7490f6d4">Netanyahu said Israel would fight on</h2><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel today instructed his military to keep fighting “with full force” in Lebanon, even as the U.S. and several other countries pushed for a temporary cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel.
