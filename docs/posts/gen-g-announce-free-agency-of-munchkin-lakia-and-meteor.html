<p>After qualifying as the second seed to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai" target="_blank">Shanghai</a>, Gen.G would make history for the region by being the first Asian team to win an international event. The lead-up to their victory involved a three-year drought that saw Western teams win every VCT title up until Masters Shanghai. In the process, the team made it through Masters flawlessly, going 6-0 in matches against top seeds such as FNATIC and 100 Thieves. </p>

<p>With a third championship to their name in one year following a 3-1 grand final against DRX in Stage 2, Gen.G entered <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions</a> as the overarching favorites to win the event as a whole. Pitted into a group of death against fellow Masters finalists Sentinels and Team Heretics, alongside Chinese dark horse FunPlus Phoenix, Gen.G&#39;s expectations were quickly subverted with a collapse against Heretics and Sentinels to knock the home team out 9th-12th.</p>
