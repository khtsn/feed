Kathy Hochul on Thursday announced the resurrection of New York City’s congestion pricing program, drawing a rebuke from the incoming president and setting up renewed legal battles to stop new tolls from taking effect in the heart of Manhattan.</p><p>Ms. Hochul, who had canceled the tolling plan abruptly this summer just weeks before it was scheduled to begin, said that she would salvage it by reducing rates as she sought to appease critics who said the fees were too high.</p><p>But the plan, which would be the first of its kind in the nation, could still be derailed. President-elect Donald J. Trump has threatened to kill congestion pricing as one of his first acts in office. And other opponents, among them the State of New Jersey and an influential union, said they were resuming litigation to halt the plan for good.</p><p>The retooled congestion pricing plan would charge most motorists $9 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street during peak hours, down from the previously approved rate of $15. The new program was scheduled to begin by early January, with a possible start date around Jan. 5.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At a news conference on Thursday, the governor reiterated her argument that she had halted the original version of congestion pricing because the tolls would be a financial burden on New Yorkers.</p><p>“I always have and I always will fight to put more money in the pockets of everyday New Yorkers,” Ms. Hochul said. “That’s why, back in June, I stood up on behalf of hardworking families.”</p><p>Congestion pricing aims to get cars off the crowded streets of Manhattan and improve air quality while also raising funds for the city’s mass transit. But commuter groups from across the New York metropolitan area have complained that the tolls would amount to a shadow tax.</p><p>The reduced tolls would save commuters nearly $1,500 annually, Ms. Hochul said, while also meeting the budget needs of the M.T.A. The $9 toll was expected to stay in place for at least three years, officials said, before possibly being raised. The revised plan is expected to go before the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority next week for approval.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

The staff of the M.T.A. detailed cuts that totaled $16.5 billion, about a third of the agency’s capital plan.</p><p>Revenue from the tolls was projected to be about $1 billion annually, which in turn would allow the M.T.A. to secure $15 billion in financing through bonds.</p><p>On Thursday, transit officials said the revised plan would still allow the M.T.A. to hit its financing target even if the annual receipts from tolls would initially be less than $1 billion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We’re required to give the M.T.A., basically, a $15 billion credit card,” said Kathryn Garcia, who oversees the operations of state agencies. “Then they’ll start paying that off. And they will have the cash flow as we move forward to do that. It just may mean that it takes longer to pay it all back.”</p><p>But some watchdog groups were unconvinced by the presentation given by Ms. Hochul, transit leaders and other state officials. Andrew Rein, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, said not enough details had been released for him to be fully confident about the plan.</p><p>“We urge the administration to share more details of the plan,” Mr. Rein said in a statement, “so the public and policymakers can rest assured that the $9 congestion charge fully plugs the $15 billion funding gap without slowing projects or using financing methods that stress the M.T.A.’s budget.”</p><p>On Thursday, Ms. Hochul announced a 40 percent reduction across the board to the <a href="https://congestionreliefzone.mta.info/tolling#:~:text=For%20both%20the%20peak%20and,trip%20charge%20will%20be%20%241.25.&amp;text=Read%20more%20about%20the%20Per%2DTrip%20Charge%20Plan." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously approved tolling structure</a>. That means that along with the lower $9 toll during peak hours, cars would pay an off-peak rate of $2.25 while other types of vehicles would receive similar discounts.</p><p>The lower toll would bring in an estimated $500 million a year, down from the previous $1 billion projection, senior M.T.A. officials said Thursday. The original plan was also expected to reduce the number of vehicles in the congestion zone by roughly 17 percent, and although it was unclear how the scaled-back program would compare, Ms. Garcia said that it would cut traffic by at least 10 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“We think $9 is a good place to start,” said Kate Slevin, executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban planning nonprofit. “It’s going to deliver better transit, cleaner air and a reduction in traffic, and those are the key goals of the congestion pricing program.”</p><p>Ms. Hochul had given few public hints that she was concerned about the cost of the tolls when she suspended the program before its long-awaited debut. Officials at the M.T.A. had already spent more than half a billion dollars and installed much of the equipment needed to put the program in place when it was halted.</p><p>The governor said on Thursday that the timing of the new plan was not motivated by Mr. Trump’s return to Washington next year.</p><p>“I’m not driven by the calendar of when people are elected or not elected,” she said during the news conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump on Thursday said that he disagreed with Ms. Hochul’s decision. He repeated his concern that congestion pricing would harm New York City’s economy and its rebound from the Covid pandemic by driving visitors and businesses away.</p><p>“It will put New York City at a disadvantage over competing cities and states, and businesses will flee,” he said through a spokesman. “It will be virtually impossible for New York City to come back as long as the congestion tax is in effect.”</p><p>New York officials would still need final federal approval for the program to get underway. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation said on Thursday that New York officials had notified the department of the updated plan. The <a href="https://highways.dot.gov/about/about-fhwa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Highway Administration</a>, an agency within that department, “is working expeditiously to finalize the needed steps to complete the agreement,” he added.</p><p>If the program does not receive that approval before Mr. Trump is inaugurated, he could block it permanently. Even if it is already in place, Mr. Trump could find other ways to impede the program, such as by withholding federal funding to New York City.</p><p>Supporters of the plan, some of whom have fought for decades to institute congestion pricing, applauded Ms. Hochul’s decision and urged her to move quickly to get the program up and running before Inauguration Day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Subway and bus riders campaigned for years to win congestion pricing, and the governor’s new plan represents much more than just half a loaf,” said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for Riders Alliance. “It’s a new balance between traffic and transit.”</p><p>Even if the program overcomes its political hurdles, it could still be undone through court action. At least nine lawsuits over congestion pricing have been filed by opponents in recent years.</p><p>As Ms. Hochul moved to bring back the program, New Jersey officials who are suing New York to stop it petitioned a federal judge for a decision in their case. Opponents there worry that traffic and pollution could be shifted across the Hudson River as drivers avoid the new tolls.</p><p>“Merely lowering the toll amount would not cure the defects in the National Environmental Policy Act review process conducted by the defendants,” wrote Randy M. Mastro, the lawyer representing New Jersey.</p><p>A group of residents called New Yorkers Against Congestion Pricing Tax who have filed a separate lawsuit said this week that they were considering seeking an injunction to block the program. Representatives for the United Federation of Teachers and the Trucking Association of New York, which have filed separate lawsuits against the program, said on Thursday that they would continue to fight it.</p><p>In a statement on Thursday, Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey reiterated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/07/nyregion/congestion-pricing-phil-murphy-new-jersey.html" title="">his objections</a>. “All of us need to listen to the message that voters across America sent last Tuesday, which is that the vast majority of Americans are experiencing severe economic strains and still feeling the effects of inflation,” he said. “There could not be a worse time to impose a new $9 toll.”</p><p>Emma Fitzsimmons<!-- -->, <!-- -->Grace Ashford<!-- --> and <!-- -->Maggie Haberman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Ley is a Times reporter covering New York City’s mass transit system and the millions of passengers who use it.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-ley">More about Ana Ley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Winnie Hu is a Times reporter covering the people and neighborhoods of New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/winnie-hu">More about Winnie Hu</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>19</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Hochul Brings Back Congestion Tolling Program at Reduced Rates<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Politics in the New York Region</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Congestion Pricing:</strong> Gov.
