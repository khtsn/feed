    <h1>Trump Fires Nearly the Entire Civil Rights Branch of D.H.S.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just this week, the Trump administration stonewalled a federal judge seeking information about the use of an 18th-century wartime law to deport immigrants with little to no due process to a prison in El Salvador.</p><p>“It’s a demonstration of their total contempt for any checks on their power,” said Deborah Fleischaker, a former civil rights office worker and chief of staff of Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the Biden administration. She said the office “endeavored to make the D.H.S. mission work with respect for civil rights, civil liberties and privacy.”</p><p>“This is a clear message that those things do not matter to this administration,” she added.</p><p>Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said the decision was meant to “streamline oversight to remove roadblocks to enforcement.”</p><p>“These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining D.H.S.’s mission,” Ms. McLaughlin said. “Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.”</p><p>The office investigates allegations from migrants, their families and the public.</p><p>In one example, in 2021, the office investigated the Trump administration’s use of the Remain in Mexico policy, which forced migrants to wait in Mexico until the date of their immigration court appearance.</p></div></div>
