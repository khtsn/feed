Another wave of explosions was reported on Wednesday afternoon killing at least nine people and wounding hundreds more, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. Buildings were reportedly ablaze after explosions in Beirut’s southern suburbs.</p><p>The blasts — which came after Israeli officials said they were ready to step up attacks against the Iranian-backed militia — have heightened concerns that Israel’s long-simmering conflict with the group might escalate into a broader war. Hezbollah and Iran quickly blamed Tuesday’s operation on Israel, an assessment confirmed by U.S. and other officials. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility.</p><p>With hospitals in Lebanon struggling to cope with the number of wounded, Israel and Lebanon were tensely awaiting a promised retaliation from Hezbollah and its allies.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about the attack and its potential ramifications.</p><h2 id="link-3fee16dc">What happened?</h2><p>Pagers carried by hundreds of Hezbollah fighters began beeping for several seconds at 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday with what appeared to be a message from the group’s leadership, according to two officials familiar with the attack. Then they exploded — in grocery shops, on sidewalks, even on a moving motorcycle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Lebanese officials said that 12 people had been killed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/lebanon-funeral-pager-attack.html?smid=url-share" title="">including a young girl</a>. Hezbollah said that at least eight of its fighters were among the dead. More than 2,700 people were injured in Lebanon — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas/irans-ambassador-to-lebanon-is-injured-in-the-apparent-attack-state-media-reports?smid=url-share" title="">including Iran’s ambassador to the country</a>.</p><p>In Syria, at least 14 people were injured, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitor.</p><p>Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, condemned what he characterized as “criminal Israeli aggression” and called it a “serious violation of Lebanese sovereignty.”</p><p>A little more than 24 hours after the pagers started exploding, reports started coming in about new blasts. The Lebanese Red Cross said that 30 ambulance teams were responding to “multiple explosions” in different areas of the country, including the south and east. The circumstances of the latest explosions were not immediately clear.</p><h2 id="link-5e409c97">How did the pagers explode?</h2><p>Officials and analysts ruled out malfunctions and said the pagers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html" title="">appear to have been tampered with</a> before they made it into the hands of Hezbollah members.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Israel hid tiny explosives inside a batch of Taiwanese-branded pagers imported to Lebanon, according to American and other officials briefed on the operation. The explosive material, as little as one to two ounces, was implanted next to the battery in each pager, two of the officials said. A switch was also embedded that could be triggered remotely to detonate the explosives.</p><p>The attack affected pagers that were switched on and receiving messages.</p><p>The Taiwanese company some of the officials named as the supplier, Gold Apollo, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas#taiwan-pagers-lebanon" title="">sought to distance itself from the devices</a>, saying on Wednesday that another manufacturer with a Hungarian address had made the model targeted in the attack as part of a licensing deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pagers at the Gold Apollo factory in Taiwan on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-7adf9ea5">Why was Hezbollah using pagers?</h2><p>Officials said that Hezbollah had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html" title="">ordered more than 3,000 pagers</a> from Gold Apollo, distributing them not just to fighters, but also to rank-and-file members across Lebanon and in Syria and Iran. It was not clear when the pagers were ordered or when they arrived in Lebanon.</p><p>Hezbollah has used pagers for years to make its messages harder to intercept. The group’s reliance on pagers increased after the Oct. 7 attacks, when its leader warned that Israeli intelligence had penetrated the cellphone network, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas/hezbollah-started-using-paging-devices-more-widely-after-oct-7-experts-say?smid=url-share" title="">according to security experts</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Analysts said that in trying to guard against one vulnerability, Hezbollah had opened itself to another fatal attack. Abandoning cellphones meant the group also “took out a central means of communication,” said Keren Elazari, an Israeli cybersecurity analyst and researcher at Tel Aviv University.</p><p>While the attack will likely incapacitate some members, Hezbollah has a long history of adaptability: It lost many fighters in its last major war with Israel, in 2006, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-pager-lebanon.html" title="">emerged stronger</a> in the years that followed.</p><h2 id="link-3359f80">What happens now?</h2><p>Hezbollah was quick to pin responsibility on Israel for the attack and warn that there would be “punishment for this blatant aggression,” prompting fears that a simmering conflict between the two <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-impact.html" title="">could boil over.</a></p><p>The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is expected to give an address on Thursday.</p><p>Israel and Hezbollah have been trading near-daily cross-border fire since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, and Hezbollah, its ally, began firing rockets into northern Israel in support.</p><p>The violence has driven tens of thousands of people from their homes on both sides of the border and prompted repeated rounds of diplomacy in an attempt to fend off a wider war and more direct Iranian involvement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The cross-border clashes have intensified in recent months. As Israel scales down its assault against Hamas in Gaza, it has more of its forces available for a possible offensive in the north against Hezbollah. This week, the country’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pager-attack.html?smid=url-share" title="">warned</a> that “military action” was “the only way” to end the conflict.</p><p>While the pager blasts embarrassed Hezbollah and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/hezbollah-pager-explosions-lebanon.html" title="">appeared to incapacitate many of its members</a>, they have not so far altered the military balance along the Israel-Lebanon border. On Wednesday, Hezbollah and the Israeli military appeared to be locked in the same pattern, exchanging missiles and artillery fire at the typical tempo.</p><p>Observers of Hezbollah said the group’s leaders were likely stuck between feeling the need to respond and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/middleeast/hezbollah-lebanon-israel.html" title="">wanting to avoid an all-out war with Israel</a> that could be catastrophic for both sides.</p><h2 id="link-58dbcd6b">Will the attacks affect the war in Gaza?</h2><p>Both Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, part of a network of proxies that Tehran has supported in the region.</p><p>Since Hezbollah has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-pager-lebanon.html" title="">tied its attacks on Israel</a> to the war in Gaza, officials had hoped that a cessation of hostilities in the Palestinian enclave might lead to a parallel agreement between Israel and Hezbollah.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>American and French mediators, led by Amos Hochstein, a U.S. envoy, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pager-attack.html?smid=url-share" title="">shuttled between Beirut and Jerusalem</a>, preparing the ground for a truce between Israel and Hezbollah in the event of a deal in Gaza.</p><p>The pager blasts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-pager-lebanon.html?smid=url-share" title="">might change those calculation</a>s and complicate those efforts.</p><p>On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that the United States did not know about the pager attack in advance and was not involved. He told a news conference in Cairo that the United States has been “very clear about the importance of all parties avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict that we’re trying to resolve in Gaza.”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Sheera Frenkel<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ronen Bergman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Patrick Kingsley<!-- -->, <!-- -->Chris Buckley<!-- -->, <!-- -->Amy Chang Chien<!-- -->, <!-- -->Euan Ward<!-- -->, <!-- -->Hwaida Saad<!-- -->, and <!-- -->Matthew Mpoke Bigg<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel covers South Africa and the countries that make up southern Africa from Johannesburg.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
