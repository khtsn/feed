    <h1>Biden Slams Trump Over False Story of Pets and Immigrants</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Addressing members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other luminaries, Mr. Biden took credit for naming the first Black vice president, appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, making Juneteenth a federal holiday, financing historically Black colleges and universities, and fostering record-low unemployment among Black Americans.</p><p>“The bottom line is the Black community has always had my back and I’ve always had yours,” Mr. Biden said. “So thank you for all you’ve taught me. Thank you for all the love you’ve extended to me.”</p><p>As he mentioned the new jobs for Black Americans, he leaned into the microphone and alluded to Mr. Trump’s recent reference to “Black jobs,” as the former president put it. “By the way,” Mr. Biden said, “the next Black job to be filled is as president of the United States of America.”</p><p>While technically not a campaign event, it had the feel of one and Mr. Biden did not shy away from going after Mr. Trump more directly. “I get so tired of the other guy talking about we’re a failing nation,” the president said. “We are the greatest nation in the history of the world. That’s a fact.”</p></div></div>
