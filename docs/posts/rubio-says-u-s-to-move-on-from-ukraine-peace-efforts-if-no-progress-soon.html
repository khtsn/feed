Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he was “not a big fan” of the Ukrainian leader. By contrast, speaking of his relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during his first term, Mr. Trump has said that “I was the apple of his eye.”</p><p>Mr. Rubio said Mr. Trump “has spent 87 days at the highest level of this government repeatedly making efforts to bring this war to an end. We are now reaching a point when we need to decide and determine whether this is even possible or not.”</p><p>Responding to Mr. Rubio’s comments, the Kremlin signaled that it was in no hurry for a cease-fire, a consistent message from Moscow throughout Mr. Trump’s attempts to end the war.</p><p>High-level talks on Thursday between American, European and Ukrainian officials were the first of their kind, intended to bring “convergence” between views of the war in Washington and European capitals. Mr. Rubio said the conversations had been constructive, but it appeared clear that Mr. Trump was losing patience.</p><p>During the talks, a “broad framework” for peace, in effect an American plan, was presented to Ukraine. “It’s a framework that gets us into a position to see — look, there are going to be differences; there’s no one saying this can be done in 12 hours,” Mr. Rubio said. He declined to give any further details of the proposal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It is not our war. We didn’t start it,” Mr. Rubio said. “The United States has been helping Ukraine for the past three years and we want it to end, but it’s not our war.”</p><p>He added: “If it’s not possible — if we’re so far apart that this is not going to happen — then I think the president’s probably at a point where he’s going to say, well, we’re done. We’ll do what we can on the margins.&#34; He described Mr. Trump as feeling “very strongly” about this.</p><p>Mr. Rubio and Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s envoy, have led the American diplomacy aimed at ending the war, which has festered for more than three years. Mr. Witkoff has met with Mr. Putin multiple times and said he was trying to develop a “friendship, a relationship” with the Russian leader.</p><p>But Mr. Putin has balked, setting various conditions even for a 30-day cease-fire. The Russian bombardment of Ukraine continues.</p><p>Asked whether Russia planned to respond to a cease-fire offer from Mr. Trump this week, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said ending the war was “not a simple topic” and that Russia was seeking a settlement that would “ensure its own interests.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We are open for dialogue,” Mr. Peskov said. “There are already certain developments, but many difficult discussions lie ahead.”</p><p>Mr. Peskov described the one-month moratorium on strikes on energy infrastructure that expired this week as an example of “certain progress.” He said that while the 30-day time frame had expired, Mr. Putin had “not made any other orders,” leaving ambiguous whether that meant the Kremlin would consider the moratorium still in force or would consider it justified to renew military strikes.</p><p>Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of violating the agreement.</p><p>There was no immediate official reaction from Kyiv to Mr. Rubio’s remarks, which appeared jolting after strained efforts on Thursday to demonstrate harmony between American and European approaches to the war.</p><p>Mykhailo Samus, the director of the New Geopolitics Research Network in Kyiv, said that an American exit from peace talks would mean an open acknowledgment of Mr. Trump’s “powerlessness regarding the Russia-Ukraine war.”</p><p>He added that, “this calls into question the signing of an agreement on strategic resources between the US and Ukraine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ukraine and the United States signed a memorandum of understanding late on Thursday as a “step toward a joint economic partnership agreement,” according to Ukraine’s economy minister, bringing both sides closer to a contentious minerals deal. The deal, if concluded, would make American abandonment of Ukraine appear a remote possibility.</p><p>The officials who took part in the Paris talks have agreed to meet next week in London, and Mr. Rubio indicated he might participate, but not if the meeting was just an exercise in further talking. He said he hoped Europeans would remain engaged in the efforts to secure a peace in Ukraine. Mr. Putin’s demands — among them that Ukraine cede territory that Russia has occupied and abandon its attempts to join NATO — have been rejected outright by Ukraine.</p><p>“I think the U.K. and France and Germany can help us move the ball on this and then get this closer to a resolution,” Mr. Rubio told reporters at Le Bourget airport as he prepared to depart. “I thought they were very helpful and constructive with their ideas.”</p><p>Anton Troianovski<!-- --> and <!-- -->Maria Varenikova<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Roger Cohen is the Paris Bureau chief for The Times, covering France and beyond.
