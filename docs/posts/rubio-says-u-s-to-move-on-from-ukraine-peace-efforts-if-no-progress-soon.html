    <h1>Rubio Says U.S. to ‘Move On’ From Ukraine Peace Efforts if No Progress Soon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>High-level talks on Thursday between American, European and Ukrainian officials were the first of their kind, intended to bring “convergence” between views of the war in Washington and European capitals. Mr. Rubio said the conversations had been constructive, but it appeared clear that Mr. Trump was losing patience.</p><p>“It is not our war. We didn’t start it,” Mr. Rubio said. “The United States has been helping Ukraine for the past three years and we want it to end, but it’s not our war.”</p><p>Mr. Rubio and Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s envoy, have led the American diplomacy aimed at ending the war, which has festered for more than three years. Mr. Witkoff has met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia multiple times and said he was trying to develop a “friendship, a relationship” with the Russian leader.</p><p>But Mr. Putin has balked, setting various conditions even for a 30-day cease-fire. The Russian bombardment of Ukraine continues.</p><p>The officials who took part in the Paris talks have agreed to meet next week in London, and Mr. Rubio indicated he might participate. He said he hoped Europeans would remain engaged in the efforts to secure a peace in Ukraine. Mr. Putin’s demands — among them that Ukraine cede territory that Russia has occupied and abandon its attempts to join NATO — have been rejected outright by Ukraine.</p></div></div>
