Mentions of “condom” and “Gaza” appeared on podcasts, radio shows or television programs with a combined national audience of 53 million, according to data from <a href="http://criticalmention.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Critical Mention</a>, a media monitoring company.</p><p>Numerous news organizations, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/trump-executive-orders-fact-check.html" title="">The New York Times</a>, found the claim to be baseless, but those fact checks did not reach nearly as wide an audience.</p><p>U.S.A.I.D. spent just under $61 million on contraceptives worldwide in the 2023 fiscal year, the vast majority in Africa and none in Gaza, according to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250128201143/https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/C-and-C-FY2023.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual report</a> that has since been removed from the agency’s website. A separate $68 million grant last year provided emergency medical care in Gaza through International Medical Corps, which <a href="https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/press-release/international-medical-corps-operations-in-gaza/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it never provided condoms or any other family planning services.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Trump doubled down anyway. He declared that the United States had spent not $50 million but $100 million on condoms for Hamas fighters, and repeated the claim that they were used “as a method of making bombs.” And he did so as recently as Feb. 19, long after it was proved untrue.</p><p>The White House did not respond to questions about the false claims, but that and other falsehoods about spending by U.S.A.I.D. paved the way for a sweeping cut to the agency’s budget. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on March 10 that he would cancel 5,200 contracts — 83 percent of the agency’s total.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Cubal, Angola, a U.S.A.I.D. program has supported female farmers.

The grant proposal used the word “transgender” once in a summary identifying the populations that might benefit from the research on natural fibers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Other moves by Mr. Trump have reflected animus to efforts to track and identify misinformation and malign foreign influence in the name of free speech. He has moved to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/trump-foreign-influence-election-interference.html" title="">dismantle the government agencies responsible,</a> including one created during his first term at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.</p><p>He has done so when many of the industry guardrails against the spread of disinformation have already unraveled under political and legal pressure from the right. </p><p>Days before Mr. Trump returned to the White House, Meta’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, announced that the company would end its third-party fact-checking program on Facebook, Instagram and Threads, embracing Republican claims that flagging lies was too often politically motivated. The company intends to shift to using Community Notes, a crowdsourced fact-checking effort used by Mr. Musk at X, the platform he bought in 2022.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s supporters sometimes depict his false or exaggerated statements as negotiating strategies. Mr. Trump himself has described prevarication as a means to an end. “If you say it enough and keep saying it,” he said once at a rally in 2021, “they’ll start to believe you.”</p><p>The consequences, though, can be corrosive — to his own policy goals and to trust more broadly. He has blamed Ukraine, for example, for the full-blown war that Russia started when its forces invaded in February 2022 and called Mr. Zelensky a dictator for suspending elections while the country is under martial law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>“It’s awfully hard to have a rational conservation about Ukraine policy if one can’t acknowledge the fact that Russia invaded Ukraine,” said James P.
