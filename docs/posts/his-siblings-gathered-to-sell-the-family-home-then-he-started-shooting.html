He chafed at his three older siblings’ plan to sell the home they had left long ago and split the proceeds four ways.</p><p>“He kept saying, ‘I’m going to be homeless — my siblings are not going to help me. They’re just going to sell the house,’” a neighbor, Randi Marquis, said on Monday while staring at the DeLucias’ faded-blue Cape Cod house, partly obscured by untrimmed bushes.</p></div></div><div><div><p>On Sunday, Mr. DeLucia waited until his siblings and a niece gathered in the rear den of the house to meet with a real estate agent.</p><p>As they were sipping their Starbucks, he suddenly appeared brandishing a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun and shot all four of them repeatedly, leaving “one of the most horrific scenes I have ever seen,” the Nassau County Police commissioner, Patrick Ryder, said at a news conference on Monday.</p><p>Mr. DeLucia then ran onto the front lawn screaming and dragged a rusty patio chair from his favorite spot on the porch onto the center of the lawn, where he shot himself in the chest under a tree, the police said. On Monday, the chair remained on the lawn next to where police found him dead from the same shotgun he used to kill his family.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joseph DeLucia came outside his house, sat in a rusty chair and shot himself in the chest.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Several neighbors on Wyoming Court, a loop of eight houses, had noticed Mr. DeLucia’s recent unraveling, but the warnings were never relayed to the authorities, police officials said on Monday.</p></div><div><div><p>Only after the shooting did neighbors tell police of Mr. DeLucia’s comments, such as, “If you hear gunshots, don’t call police, because it will be too late,” said Commissioner Ryder.</p><p>After a massacre at a Buffalo supermarket in 2022, New York State strengthened its red-flag laws, which allow the authorities to seize guns from people deemed to be at risk of harming themselves or others.</p><p>Had police been notified of Mr. DeLucia’s threats, they could have tried to take the shotgun, Commissioner Ryder said.</p><p>Detective Captain Stephen Fitzpatrick, commanding officer of Nassau’s homicide unit, said the shotgun was legally owned, “but if he was reported to be mentally unstable, this would be illegal for him to possess.”</p><p>In Syosset, a safe, well-to-do suburb with good schools, some 30 minutes by car from the New York City line, the family massacre stood out as a shocking outlier along with other notorious Long Island crimes. They include last summer’s accusations that a family man from Massapequa, Rex Heuermann, committed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/nyregion/gilgo-beach-rex-heuermann.html" title="">Gilgo Beach serial murders</a>, and the so-called Amityville Horror killings in 1974, when a man <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/nyregion/ronald-defeo-amityville-dead.html" title="">killed his parents and four siblings</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>There is little data on so-called family annihilation — mass killings where one person kills several relatives. Part of the reason is that law enforcement agencies do not always keep comprehensive data on the relationships between the killer and the victims, according to a 2022 <a href="https://jmvr.org/2022/02/out-of-sight-out-of-mind-an-analysis-of-family-mass-murder-offenders-in-the-us-2006-2017/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> by the Journal of Mass Violence Research.</p><p>The IndyStar, a news organization in Indianapolis, <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2023/07/13/family-annihilation-investigation-what-is-behind-cases-person-kills/70184802007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last year examined 227 such cases across the country</a> that occurred between January 2020 and April 30, 2023, in the wake of a similar killing in Bloomington, Ind. It found three major scenarios: men who killed their partners and children, young men who killed parents and siblings, and couples who killed their children and themselves.</p><p>Mr. DeLucia did not neatly fit any of those categories. In all, the police said, he fired 12 times inside the home, killing his brother, Frank DeLucia, 63, of Durham, N.C.; his sisters Joanne Kearns, 69, of Tampa, Fla., and Tina Hammond, 64; and Tina’s daughter, Victoria Hammond, 30, both of East Patchogue, N.Y.</p><p>Officers who came to the scene have been offered counseling, the commissioner said.</p><p>Mr. DeLucia’s shotgun had a six-shell capacity, so he presumably stopped to reload once while shooting his relatives and again before shooting himself, the detective captain said.</p><p>Police officials said Mr. DeLucia’s only prior criminal history was a 1983 arrest on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol. They conducted a 2022 wellness check at the home but did not deem Mr. DeLucia to be a threat.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Police officials said outdated psychiatric medication was found in the home during a search.</p><p>“He was kind of a hoarder, spent all his money on his tools and stuff,” Detective-Captain Fitzpatrick said. “The house was pretty much packed with tools and stuff involved in auto mechanics.</p><p>“He was living there his entire life, never lived on his own,” he said. “So you can see the mind-set where his world was now changing, at 59 years old, and he was panicking.”</p><p>Sandy Landsman, a psychologist who lives across the street from Mr. DeLucia, said he seemed to struggle emotionally and was often guarded and distant to neighbors.</p><p>“It never occurred to me he would do this, but I knew he had a very hard time after his mom’s death and was afraid he was going to have to leave the house,” Mr. Landsman said. “I didn’t think he was that great a risk.”</p><p>But on Sunday after hearing Mr. DeLucia’s screams followed by a gunshot, he said, “My first thought was that he killed himself.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Marquis said she tried to reassure Mr. DeLucia that, especially with his share of the inheritance from the sale of the house, he would be able to secure housing. But he remained unconvinced.</p><p>“His intentions were to wipe out the whole family,” Ms. Marquis said. “His mind-set was, “If I can’t stay here, I might as well take everyone with me.”</p><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Corey Kilgannon is a Times reporter who writes about crime and criminal justice in and around New York City, as well as breaking news and other feature stories.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/corey-kilgannon">More about Corey Kilgannon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
