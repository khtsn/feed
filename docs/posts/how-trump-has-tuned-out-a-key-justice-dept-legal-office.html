It has justified those blocks with shifting legal rationales in court. But both President Trump and his White House budget chief, Russell T. Vought, have said that they believe the president has constitutional authority to refuse to spend taxpayer money that Congress appropriated for things the president does not like. That tactic is called impoundment, and Mr. Trump and Mr. Vought have said that they intend to re-establish that power despite a 1974 law that largely banned it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>What the Office of Legal Counsel has said</p><p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/147706/dl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An opinion from 1969</a>, written by William H.
