But to ensure that the U.S. Senate would ratify its membership bid, Finland’s government decided to also seek out the president living in Florida.</p><p>And so Mikko Hautala, the Finnish ambassador to the United States at the time, made a point of speaking privately with former President Donald J. Trump to persuade him of the merits of his country’s joining the alliance. The goal was to head off any opposition by Mr. Trump, who has long been openly hostile toward NATO.</p><p>The strategy worked. Mr. Trump, who potentially could have ignited Republican opposition with a single intemperate social media post, remained publicly silent, and the Senate voted 95 to 1 to approve Finland’s admission to the alliance in August 2022. Had Mr. Trump spoken out against the move, it would have taken only 34 votes to block the two-thirds supermajority needed for ratification.</p><p>In the nearly four years since he left the White House, Mr. Trump has acted as something of a shadow president on international affairs operating out of what he used to call the Winter White House at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Even before he kicked off a comeback bid to reclaim his old office, foreign governments realized that Mr. Trump was still a force in American politics and that they needed to take him into account in their dealings with the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Now that he is the Republican nominee for president in next month’s election, foreign leaders have been playing up to Mr. Trump even more. A parade of world leaders has made the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago or to Trump Tower in New York, including the leaders of Ukraine, Israel, Poland, Hungary, Argentina, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other countries. The crown prince of Saudi Arabia rang up Mr. Trump’s cellphone. The newly elected prime minister of Britain dropped by last month for dinner.</p><p>“Very unusual for a former president,” said Jeremy Shapiro, a former State Department official who is now director of the U.S. program at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “I suppose it comes from his status as both a former and possibly future president, which is of course unique.”</p><p>“As a former president, he has the contacts and the relationships,” Mr. Shapiro added. “As a possible future president, he has the potential power to deliver for foreign leaders in the not-too-distant future.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, right, at Mar-a-Lago in July.

The book, “War,” reports that an unnamed aide to Mr. Trump told Mr. Woodward that the former president since leaving office has spoken on multiple occasions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, perhaps as many as seven times.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump and the Kremlin have disputed the report and 20 current and former Biden and Trump administration officials and intelligence officials have told The New York Times that they could not confirm it. But several veteran U.S. officials said it was possible the two could have spoken without American intelligence agencies detecting the calls.</p><p>Many former presidents maintain contacts with foreign leaders after leaving the White House. Richard Nixon regularly traveled the world as an elder statesman meeting with heads of state while Jimmy Carter established himself as a sort of globe-trotting troubleshooter in conflict zones or election monitor in fragile democracies. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama often see overseas counterparts during their travels, at conferences or through charitable initiatives.</p><p>For the most part, those presidents were not seen as enduring power brokers back in the United States in the same way that Mr. Trump is, and they have generally operated within certain parameters, typically coordinating with the White House or State Department. Mr. Carter at times went beyond what the sitting president of the moment wanted, for instance in negotiating with North Korea or urging United Nations members to oppose the Iraq war. But even then, foreign leaders did not regard him as a quasi president or president-in-waiting.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/politics/john-bolton-memoir-takeaways.html" title="">John R. Bolton</a>, a former national security adviser to Mr. Trump who has become a vocal critic, recalled how former Secretary of State <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/us/henry-kissinger-dead.html" title="">Henry A. Kissinger</a> used to joke that foreign leaders typically wanted to meet with him when they visited the United States because he was a stop on the museum tour.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump with President Andrzej Duda of Poland at Trump Tower in New York, in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“They wanted to hear what Henry Kissinger had to say, they wanted to hear what Richard Nixon had to say,” Mr. Bolton said. “That’s not what they’re calling Donald Trump for. They want to try to get him to weigh in on the side they want to prevail or at least mitigate the downside if he came out the other way.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Trump ran his White House like a Middle East dictatorship, so these actions are par for the course with him,” said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. “But it’s off-the-charts unusual and potentially a major national security threat for a number of reasons.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has been indicted on charges of mishandling classified documents, although <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/us/politics/trump-document-case-dismissed.html" title="">the case was dismissed</a> for now on procedural grounds. Secret conversations in the middle of a war with the leader of a sanctioned American adversary like Mr. Putin would go beyond grip-and-grin photo ops at Mar-a-Lago, particularly because Mr. Trump has played an important role on the issue of aid to Ukraine in its war against Russian invaders.</p><p>Mr. Trump, long an admirer of Mr. Putin, has said that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was “very smart” and refused to say he hoped Ukraine would win. He went so far this year as to say he would “encourage” Russia to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/11/us/politics/trump-nato.html" title="">“do whatever the hell they want”</a> in terms of attacking NATO allies that have not spent enough on their own militaries.</p><p>For months, Mr. Trump was the key figure in the congressional fight over more military assistance to Ukraine as House Speaker Mike Johnson blocked Mr. Biden’s aid package in deference to the former president. This “was a source of great frustration to other countries seeking to strengthen the Ukrainian resistance,” said Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump was lobbied by competing world leaders. In March, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/briefing/hungary-orban-trump.html" title="">hosted Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary</a>, a skeptic of helping Ukraine. Then in April, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/world/europe/david-cameron-trump-ukraine-israel.html" title="">David Cameron, the foreign secretary of Britain at the time</a>, traveled to Mar-a-Lago and a week later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/16/us/politics/trump-foreign-leaders.html" title="">President Andrzej Duda of Poland</a> met with Mr. Trump in New York, both to implore the former president to release his effective hold on the Ukrainian aid.</p><p>Days later, with Mr. Johnson finally putting the measure on the floor, Congress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/us/politics/house-foreign-aid-bill.html" title="">passed $60.8 billion in aid to Ukraine</a> in both chambers on strong bipartisan votes, although a majority of Republicans still voted against it in the House.</p><p>The dispute left President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in an awkward position. A senior official in his government said that Mr. Zelensky had avoided any “back-channeling or gamesmanship” with Mr. Trump and sought to deal with him only through formal channels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump meeting last month with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at Trump Tower in New York.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Zelensky understands that he needs to maintain bipartisan support, and he will work with whoever wins the election, the official said. Nonetheless, he found himself caught in the middle of American political crossfire when he accompanied Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat and supporter of Vice President Kamala Harris, on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/politics/zelensky-ukraine-russia-strikes.html" title="">a visit to an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pa.</a>, last month to thank Americans for military hardware. Mr. Johnson blasted Mr. Zelensky and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/world/europe/mike-johnson-ukraine-us-ambassador.html" title="">demanded he recall his ambassador</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview with The New Yorker</a>, Mr. Zelensky also questioned Mr. Trump’s claim to be able to settle the war in 24 hours if elected. Mr. Trump fired back. “The president of Ukraine is in our country,” he said at a campaign event. “He is making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president — me. We continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal — Zelensky.”</p><p>Mr. Zelensky then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/us/politics/trump-zelensky-putin-war.html" title="">visited Mr. Trump at Trump Tower</a> to smooth things over but as the two faced cameras the former president made a point of talking about what a good relationship he has with Mr. Putin, the man who has sent forces that have killed tens of thousands of Mr. Zelensky’s citizens.</p><p>In this campaign season, Mr. Zelensky is not the only foreign leader to make the trek to Mr. Trump’s doorstep. In fact, it has become a ritual now for some foreign leaders to have three meetings while in the United States, one with Mr. Biden, another with Ms. Harris and a third with Mr. Trump.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel made that three-stop journey in July. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/us/politics/trump-netanyahu.html" title="">His trip to Mar-a-Lago</a> was his first face-to-face encounter with Mr. Trump since the former president left office, and it represented an effort to mend fences.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who once gave Mr. Netanyahu almost anything he wanted, grew bitter toward the Israeli leader late in his term and then exploded with anger after the election when Mr. Netanyahu congratulated Mr. Biden on his victory. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>With reporters in the room in July, Mr. Trump made no reference to that, insisting that he “always had a very good relationship” with Mr. Netanyahu. The kiss-and-make-up session seemed to have some success. Just last week, Mr. Trump called Mr. Netanyahu “of his own accord” to “praise him on Israel’s determined and mighty actions against Hezbollah,” the Israeli leader’s office said in a statement.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Netanyahu meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The Netanyahu statement noted that Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, joined the call, which was something of a tell. Mr. Graham, a vocal ally and golf partner of Mr. Trump’s, has played intermediary with a number of foreign leaders in the last four years. As The Times reported, Mr. Graham was with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia in March when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/16/us/politics/trump-foreign-leaders.html" title="">they decided to call Mr. Trump</a> together.</p><p>The former president’s dealings with foreign leaders are not only complicated by politics and diplomacy but also by business. Through his sons, Mr. Trump has been actively involved in deals in several Middle East states since losing the presidency, including towers in Dubai and Saudi Arabia and a luxury resort in Oman. His son-in-law and former White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, secured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/us/politics/kushner-private-equity-saudi-arabia.html" title="">a $2 billion investment from a Saudi government fund</a> for his private equity firm.</p><p>Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates, which includes Dubai, was among those who have also made the three-stop visit to Mr. Trump following meetings with Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris.</p><p>Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons, dismissed questions about the confluence of his father’s business and foreign policy in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6005d855-4c4e-4846-ad33-ed76d61ecc77" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent interview with The Financial Times</a>. “I don’t really deal with foreign governments,” he said.
