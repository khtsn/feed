He was a Michigan doctor who argued that sick people should be allowed to die on their own terms rather than suffer through a grueling illness. Was he a traitor to his oath to “do no harm”? Or was he an angel of mercy, letting victims of disease exercise one last bit of agency over their failing bodies? Kevorkian, who went to prison for helping dozens of people with “physician-assisted suicides,” seemed so radical at the time.</p><p>Now his ideas are commonplace. Ten states and lots of Western nations have assisted-dying laws. But they’re mostly built for people with a life-ending diagnosis.</p><p>Canada is trying something more. There, a patient can have a state-sanctioned death if she is suffering — but not necessarily dying — from an illness. For the cover story of yesterday’s New York Times Magazine, <strong>Katie Engelhart </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/magazine/maid-medical-assistance-dying-canada.html" title="">followed one woman’s journey to die</a>. It’s a nuanced portrait of a person racked with pain and a tour of some controversial bioethics. I spoke with Katie about the difficulty in knowing what’s right and what’s wrong when people suffer.</p><p><strong>Your story has so much intimate detail about the struggles of the main character, Paula Ritchie. How did you get her to confide in you?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Paula was, in her own words, “an open book.” The first time I called her, we talked for nearly three hours. She had applied for medical assistance in dying, or MAID, after suffering a concussion, which led to dizziness and insomnia and pain that never went away. I knew that Paula would be an interesting case study, in large part because of the complexity — the messiness, really — of her life. She was the kind of patient whom opponents of MAID worry about. Paula had a mix of physical and psychiatric conditions: chronic pain, chronic fatigue, bipolar disorder, depression. She had a history of childhood trauma. She lived below the poverty line. She was very lonely.</p><p><strong>You watched Paula die. I was moved, reading about her last moments. What was it like to see that?</strong></p><p>I was trying to be as small a presence as possible in the room. I sat in a folding chair at the foot of her bed. As a reporter, the experience was doubly intense: I was there to do a job — to gather information — but I was also experiencing the moment as a human being, sitting in a room full of suffering. I said very little to Paula and she said very little to me, although she did briefly reach for my hand as she was getting ready for her injections.</p><p><strong>Wow, that’s intense. Aside from witnessing a person’s death, you also talked to a lot of doctors and lawyers about Canada’s law, which says a patient can qualify for MAID if she’s suffering. What constitutes suffering?</strong></p><p>Patients must have a serious disease or disability; be in an advanced state of decline; and have intolerable “physical or psychological suffering.” The law doesn’t define exactly what it means to suffer or how a clinician should judge it. MAID assessors are instructed to “respect the subjectivity of suffering.”</p><p><strong>So Canada’s law is not just for people who are imminently dying.</strong></p><p>In the United States, patients need a “terminal” diagnosis — and a prognosis of six months or less. In Canada, they don’t have to be dying at all. People can qualify with, say, multiple sclerosis or chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>This is tricky terrain! One cancer psychiatrist told you, “If you want to allow people to end their lives when they want to, then put suicide kits in hardware stores.”</strong></p><p>Yeah, it’s not really “aid in dying” if the patient isn’t dying. It’s something different.</p><p><strong>Someone in pain today might feel better tomorrow. You talk about how patients with spinal cord injuries adjust and often become glad to be alive.</strong></p><p>Right. Opponents of MAID say it should be a last resort, something that is allowed only after a patient has tried everything to get better. But the Canadian law doesn’t require this. As one MAID assessor told Paula: “It’s not my role to force you to do anything, even if I genuinely think it would really help you.”</p><p><strong>Some worry that poor and disabled people might pick MAID because it’s easier than living. Is there any truth to that?</strong></p><p>I spent <em>a lot</em> of time looking into this. It’s not as straightforward as saying marginalized people are being forced into it. But of course money and social factors influence people’s health — and the choices they make about it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>How many Canadians end their lives each year through the state’s program?</strong></p><p>The latest data is from 2023. That year, nearly 15,000 patients whose deaths were “reasonably foreseeable,” and 622 patients whose deaths were not, chose MAID. Overall, about one in 20 Canadians died this way.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/magazine/maid-medical-assistance-dying-canada.html" title=""><em>Read Katie’s story here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id="link-77d6e4bc"><span><strong>AN ATTACK IN COLORADO</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the scene of the attack.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Ciaglo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Eight people have been hospitalized with burns and other injuries after a man used what officials described as a “makeshift flamethrower” in Boulder, Colo., yesterday to attack demonstrators honoring Israeli hostages.
