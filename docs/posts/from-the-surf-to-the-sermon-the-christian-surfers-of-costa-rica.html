Those identities combine to make him a senior member of the Christian Surfers organization, an international group of missionaries who love to surf.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>As dusk fell, he watched the tide calm and surfers retreat to the shore. Walking away from the beach, he came across three sunburned Canadians hanging out in their beat-up R.V., sharing a joint.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man on a white surfboard riding an ocean wave." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj/22costa-rica-surfers-dispatch-vphj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/29a1798f-1c77-5188-8262-b6405f0a3e18" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chandler Brownlee, 52, a former Baptist minister and a hardcore tatted-up surfer.

We’ve been driving for over a year. Sometimes it’s been dicey. But man, the waves down here.”</p><p>A big grin broke out on Mr. Brownlee’s chiseled face, framed by salt-and-pepper stubble.</p><p>“That’s why surfers make such good missionaries,” he said, shaking his head jovially. “They’ll sleep where they can, eat whatever they get their hands on. They don’t mind roughing it, being patient for the perfect swell, the perfect wave, an opportunity to talk to someone about God.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Christian Surfers organization tries to bridge the connection that surfers feel with nature — a spiritual pursuit even skeptics recognize — and show them how that feeling is just a hair away from forming a relationship with God.</p><p>The interdenominational group has more than 175 chapters in over 35 countries, including Japan, Norway and the United States. In Costa Rica, one of the world’s best surf spots, they founded their newest chapter this year in Pavones, on the southernmost tip of the country on the border with Panama.</p><p>Pavones, with a population of about 4,000, is home to the second-largest left-hand wave in the world. Its main street is called Perfect Waves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Christian Surfers operates under the belief that surfers are a unique subculture that can be effectively ministered to by other surfers who share their passion and lifestyle.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Surfers preparing to enter the water off Esterillos Oeste, Costa Rica. The country is one of the world’s best surf spots.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The town’s isolation, lack of infrastructure and dirt roads attract only the most committed surfers — a dedication that Mr. Brownlee hopes to tap into. In his mind, even if you trek out here and catch the perfect wave, you may still feel empty inside.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>And that’s an opening for God, he says.</p><p>“Gringos are always trying to find themselves through ayahuasca,” he said. “But what about knowing the Lord instead?”</p><p>The surfing missionaries know that they have to tread carefully or they may scare people off. So they swap button-up shirts for swimsuits, tattoos and barefoot living.</p><p>For possible converts, there is no pressure to go to church. Rather, the missionaries aim to be a “bridge from the beach to the church,” as their motto states. The cover of the “Surfers’ Bible” they distribute does not bear a cross, but an enticing barrel wave. </p><p>“When you tell surfers to come to church, they think pews, stained glass, organs,” Mr. Brownlee acknowledged. “We aren’t trying to mass proselytize people, but to bro-out with ’em, love on ’em, catch a wave with ’em.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“We aren’t trying to mass proselytize people, but to bro-out with ’em, love on ’em, catch a wave with ’em,” Mr. Brownlee said.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maikol Zeledon, Elias Leon, Brandon Segura and Selah Leon in Esterillos Oeste.

Knowing that God loves her “unconditionally” helped her take losses more easily in competitions and move on, but learn from the mistakes, according to her testimony.</p><p>Christian Surfers was established in Australia in the late 1970s to counter the discrimination its founders faced on the waves and in the pews. They were shunned by the church for their tattoos and flip-flops and the sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll stereotype of surfer culture. But surfers also shunned them for their Christian beliefs, perceiving them as uptight, judgmental and decidedly uncool.</p><p>The group’s members come together to surf when the swell is good, and when it isn’t, they hang out over hamburgers or beers to connect over the sport and discuss scripture. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The Christian Surfers organization is relying on one family, the Leons, to broaden its presence in Costa Rica. On a recent evening in the town of Esterillos Oeste, Kyle Leon was cooking a vat of pasta and getting ready to host a group of children and young adults for surf videos and a Bible study led by her husband, Dennis.</p><p>Ms. Leon, 43, joined the Christian Surfers in Santa Barbara, Calif., in the 1990s. She was one of the only female surfers on the water at the time, and probably the only religious one. But she “didn’t love youth group” and felt the games were “silly and infantile.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dennis and Kyle Leon at the beach in Esterillos Oeste.

That is where she met Dennis Leon.</p><p>Mr. Leon had recently joined the Pentecostal church when she arrived with her family. “But I had to quit surfing,” he said. “The thinking was you couldn’t be a surfer and a Christian because surfers were potheads.”</p><p>Eventually, he was able to reconcile his love for Jesus with surfing after meeting Ms. Leon and her family. He says he now uses the sport as a way to evangelize in a more real, less uptight way.</p><p>“Jesus didn’t use a church,” he said. “His followers followed him through nature. Remember, his disciples were the fishers of men.”</p><p>As night set in, a group of teenagers and young adults walked up to the Leons’ house atop a hill overlooking the water.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Amid the full-sleeve arm tattoos, exclamations of “dude!” and bathing suits, it was easy to forget that everyone was gathered for Bible study. A small cross hung on a wall, next to a towering surfboard. Stickers on the doors to the Leon children’s bedrooms featured their favorite bands, and the flaming logo for the skate magazine Thrasher.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“This is not an intimidating place, like a church building can be,” Ms. Leon said, as young people were gathered at her house for Bible study.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Leon holding a baby before a sermon given by her husband, Dennis, at their home in Esterillos Oeste.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“This is not an intimidating place, like a church building can be,” said Ms. Leon, gesturing to the living room where kids were splayed out on the couch and dogs ran in and out of the house. “This isn’t scary. And that’s our main goal here as missionaries. You don’t need to believe to belong. But you can belong before you believe.”</p><p>The group watched surfing videos as they chowed down on spaghetti, gasping as the world’s most famous surfer, Kelly Slater, rode Tahitian waves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Then, it was time for Bible study.</p><p>Mr. Leon sat on a wooden bench in the living room and opened up his Bible as the room went quiet, the young devotees looking up at him from the floor. He went on to compare the Apostle Paul with Mr. Slater, before tying the sermon into what they could do to draw on their love of Jesus, surfing and nature in order to serve their communities.</p><p>The Leons run a church called Pura Vida — a Costa Rican saying that means the “pure life” — that holds worship services on the beach during the dry season and under a roof with no walls just next to the town’s basketball court when it rains.</p><p>Of the crowd that gathered in the family’s living room, Mr. Leon estimated that 40 percent had not accepted Jesus “yet,” he said, lifting a finger to the air.</p><p>But that could change.</p><p>“They feel less pressure coming here than a church,” he said. “This is just Dennis’s house.”</p><p>Soon, it was time for everyone to go home.</p><p>“Lord,” Mr. Leon wrapped up, “thank you for the opportunity to be together, to eat food together and to talk about surfing together. Amen.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Christian Surfers organization tries to bridge the connection that surfers feel with nature and show them how that feeling is just a hair away from forming a relationship with God.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Abi-Habib is an investigative correspondent reporting on Latin America and is based in Mexico City.<span> </span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Turning Allies Into Enemies: </strong>The United States killed its own allies in Afghanistan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/afghanistan-allies-enemies-nuristan-taliban.html">sabotaging itself in a part of the country</a> where it never needed to be.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gold Drives Both Sides in Sudan’s War: </strong>Famine and ethnic cleansing stalk Sudan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/africa/sudan-gold-rush-heart-civil-war.html">Yet the gold trade is booming</a>, enriching generals and propelling the fight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reining In Argentina’s Inflation: </strong>President Javier Milei has been praised inside and outside Argentina for taming the world’s highest inflation rate. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/americas/argentina-president-milei-inflation-economy.html">But his policies have inflicted widespread hardship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nudging Japan Forward: </strong>In a society used to quiet consensus-building, Tokyo has made bold changes to its defense policy.
