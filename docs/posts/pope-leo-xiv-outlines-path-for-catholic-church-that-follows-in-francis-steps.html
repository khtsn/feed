From that document, Leo highlighted multiple objectives, including “growth in collegiality,” “popular piety,” a “loving care for the least and the rejected,” and “courageous and trusting dialogue with the contemporary world.”</p><p>“Francis masterfully and concretely set it forth,” Leo said, referring to the document, called <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/it/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Evangelii Gaudium</a>.</p><p>The new pope also explained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/name-leo-xiv-history.html" title="">the choice of his name</a>. The previous pope with his name, Leo XIII, issued a document called the “Rerum Novarum,” known in English as “Rights and Duties of Capital and Labor,” in the late 19th century in which he emphasized the church’s right to make assertions about social issues as they related to moral questions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The document “addressed the social question in the context of the first great industrial revolution,” Leo explained.</p><p>Now, the pope added, another industrial revolution was taking place in the field of artificial intelligence. That, he said, would “pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice and labor.”</p><p>The church, he said, “offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response.”</p><p>The reference to Francis’ document was not the only endorsement that the new pope gave of his predecessor. Francis, Leo noted, was a “humble servant of God and of his brothers and sisters,” who gave an “example of complete dedication to service and to sober simplicity of life.”</p><p>The cardinals appeared to have noted the message about maintaining the direction set by Francis’ papacy.</p><p>As he exited the meeting where Leo spoke, Cardinal Baltazar Enrique Porras Cardozo of Venezuela said the pope “spoke about the continuity of the pontificate of Francis and then he asked some questions to us.” Those questions were “mostly about the formation of priests and bishops,” the cardinal added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On his way out of the meeting, Cardinal Sean Brady of Ireland said that Leo was in the process of “greeting everybody now, which is very nice.”</p><p>Jason Horowitz<!-- --> and <!-- -->Elizabeth Dias<!-- --> contributed reporting from Vatican City.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
