Two of the lawsuits were filed on Friday night to meet a midnight deadline.</p><p>The Alexanders are collectively now facing at least 24 lawsuits, deepening the legal troubles for the brothers once known for their jet-setting lifestyles fueled by the work of Tal Alexander and Oren Alexander in the luxury residential real estate. </p><p>In the latest batch of lawsuits, the net of allegations has widened to include their parents; Douglas Elliman, the real estate brokerage where Tal Alexander and Oren Alexander once worked; the Alexander family business; and the owner of an estate in the Hamptons who frequently hosted parties that the brothers attended.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The claims add new twists to the maze of sexual assault allegations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/realestate/alexander-brothers-arrested-charged-sexual-assault.html" title="">against the brothers who were arrested</a> in December in Miami Beach on federal sex-trafficking charges. Currently jailed in New York, they are scheduled to go to trial early next year. </p><p>All three have pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Just a few years ago, the brothers were fixtures of a social circuit in Miami and Manhattan, making their nightlife adventures part of their brand. Tal Alexander and Oren Alexander were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/realestate/tal-oren-alexander-sexual-assault.html" title="">among the country’s most prominent real estate agents</a>, while Alon Alexander, who ran the family business Kent Security Services and did not work in real estate, accompanied them on the circuit.</p><p>Their current plight has shaken the luxury real estate industry, as more women have come forward with allegations. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Oren Alexander, in red, and Alon Alexander, in a green protective vest, appeared in court in Miami in December.

Ocner</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>One of the lawsuits, filed jointly by five women on Friday morning, describes sexual assaults in both New York and Florida dating as far back as 2009. In one alleged assault, a woman filing as Jane Doe says that in Miami in 2017, Alon Alexander drugged her and tried to force her to have sex, and when she said no and told him she was on her period, he “forcefully ripped out her tampon” and forced her to instead perform oral sex on him. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That lawsuit also accuses Douglas Elliman, where Tal Alexander and Oren Alexander were top brokers for a decade, of enabling and facilitating what the women describe as the brothers’ “sex-trafficking ring.” The brokerage’s longtime chief executive, Howard Lorber, “was well aware” the brothers were sexually abusing women, the women claim in the lawsuit, and they “could not and would not have sex-trafficked all of these women without the financial and other resources provided by their parents, defendant Shlomi Alexander and defendant Orly Alexander, and their company, defendant Kent Security Services.”</p><p>In another lawsuit, a woman filing as Jane Doe said she was taken to a party in the Hamptons hosted by Ivan Wilzig, who regularly threw over-the-top bashes at his castle-like estate, called “Sir Ivan’s Castle.” She said she was handed a glass of champagne by one of the Alexander twins — she wasn’t aware of which one — and said she lost consciousness, only to wake up in a bed with one of the twins on top of her, penetrating her, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Several weeks later she realized she was pregnant, and one of the men who had brought her to the party paid for an abortion, she said in the lawsuit. </p><p>In a third lawsuit, a woman named Laura Buck said she was sexually assaulted by Tal Alexander after a dinner date in New York in 2010, and during the alleged attack, Oren Alexander watched and laughed while a third man filmed her. She said she went to the hospital the next day and asked to speak to the police, who arrived but failed to file a police report. In the weeks that followed, she said, she contacted several friends of Tal and Oren, and even their mother, to describe what had happened to her.</p><p>“She screamed it from the hilltops,” said Evan Torgan, a lawyer representing Ms. Buck. “No one cared. So she brought the case.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>All seven of this week’s claims were filed in New York City under a two-year window that closes on Friday at midnight. The window was created as an extension of the New York City Gender-Motivated Violence Act, which allows survivors of gender-based violence like sexual assault to file older claims that would otherwise have been tossed under the statute of limitations.</p><p>Shlomi and Orly Alexander, who observe the Jewish sabbath, could not be immediately reached for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Orly Alexander, the mother of Tal, Oren and Alon Alexander, leaves court in Miami in January.

Every one of them.”</p><p>Mr. Wilzig, Howard Lorber, and a representative for Douglas Elliman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>A representative for Kent Security said in an email that the company never received allegations about Alon Alexander while he worked for the company, and that it has a policy to decline to comment on pending litigation. </p><p>Kristen Gibbons Feden, one of the lawyers who filed two of the lawsuits this week, said that it was important that women continue to file civil lawsuits even as the brothers’ criminal case makes it way through federal court. Their trial is set to begin in New York in January 2026.</p><p>“These lawsuits make it clear: survivors will not be silenced, and the truth will not be buried,” she said in an email. “Civil lawsuits are critical because they give survivors what the criminal system cannot — direct restitution for the harm they’ve endured.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Debra Kamin reports on real estate, covering what it means to buy, sell and own a home in America today.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/debra-kamin">More about Debra Kamin</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
