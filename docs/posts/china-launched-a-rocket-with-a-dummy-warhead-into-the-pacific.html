It was fired by the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force and struck in the “high seas,” China’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240925030135/https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TvAiZzb5OGp56MWog8GKZQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ministry of National Defense said</a>, without giving details of where the dummy warhead fell, what model of missile carried it or where it was launched. It said the dummy warhead “fell precisely into the assigned seas.”</p><p>“This missile launch was a routine part of the Rocket Force’s annual exercises,” the ministry said, adding that it “was not aimed at any specific country or target.” <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/20240925/4e4661b391d244a9aba055914fbb2cfd/c.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">China’s official news agency, Xinhua</a>, stated that Beijing had notified “the relevant countries” about the missile test, without elaborating. China usually tests its missiles within its own borders.</p><p>China’s assurances appeared unlikely to dispel questions about the test from experts and officials in the region. Such missiles fly in an arc high above the earth and can deliver warheads thousands of miles, making them a pillar of each superpower’s nuclear capabilities. China has about 134 intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, that can deliver around 240 warheads, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2023.2295206#infos-holder" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to an annual survey</a> from the Federation of American Scientists, a bit under half of the numbers fielded by the United States or Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It is difficult to hide a ballistic missile launch into the Pacific, so it is sensible for Beijing to announce that it took place and control the narrative,” said <a href="https://www.rsis.edu.sg/profile/drew-thompson/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Drew Thomson</a>, a former Pentagon official who is now a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.</p><p>“China is sending a signal,” Mr. Thomson said. “This ballistic missile test puts China’s adversaries on notice that there are limits to its forbearance, and it also underscores the Communist Party’s acute sense of risk and vulnerability.”</p><p>Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other Asian governments are anxious about China’s expanding military strength. “The Japanese government is trying to confirm details,” Yoshimasa Hayashi, the chief cabinet secretary in the Japanese government, said at a regular news conference on Wednesday. He said that Tokyo did not receive advance notice about the launch of the missile, which did not appear to fly over Japanese territory. Japan was already upset about recent incursions into its airspace by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/world/asia/china-surveillance-japan-airspace.html" title="">Chinese</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/world/asia/japan-russia-plane.html#:~:text=A%20Russian%20military%20patrol%20plane,to%20deter%20the%20Russian%20aircraft." title="">Russian militar</a>y aircraft.</p><p>“China’s military activities lack transparency, and that has become a serious concern for Japan and the international community,” Mr. Hayashi said.</p><p>The Pentagon <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3566970/us-focuses-on-deterrence-as-china-raises-stakes-in-indo-pacific/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calls China the “pacing challenge”</a> to the United States’ global military dominance, especially in Asia. The Rocket Force is the custodian of most of China’s nuclear weapons as well as many hundreds of conventionally armed missiles. It has been at the forefront of the ambitions of China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, to project power across the region and blunt American influence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But over the past two years, China’s weapons bureaucracy appeared unsettled by scandal. In 2023, Mr. Xi abruptly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/world/asia/china-nuclear-shakeup.html" title="">replaced the two top commanders</a> of the Rocket Force with outsiders with no experience in the missile force. Other senior officers also disappeared, as did two former Chinese ministers of defense.</p><p>China may have at least partly intended the launch to reinforce the credibility of its missile forces, and its nuclear deterrent, said <a href="https://titx.in.tku.edu.tw/get_page?t=rtdoc&amp;rtdoc_id=ying-yu-lin&amp;lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ying-Yu Lin</a>, an assistant professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan who specializes in the People’s Liberation Army. “They would like to dispel doubts abroad about the strength of the Rocket Force,” he said.</p><p>In June, the Chinese Communist Party leadership <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/world/asia/china-military-corruption.html" title="">expelled the two ministers</a> — Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe — from the party, accusing them of corruption and disloyalty. The following month, party leaders <a href="http://en.cppcc.gov.cn/2024-07/19/c_1006186.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confirmed the expulsions</a> of Li Yuchao, a former Rocket Force commander, and Sun Jinming, a former chief of staff.</p><p>Even so, the Chinese rollout of new missiles does not seem to have slowed much. The <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3561549/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pentagon’s latest report</a> on the People’s Liberation Army said last year it was developing new intercontinental missiles “that will significantly improve its nuclear-capable missile forces.” The report also said that China “may be exploring” development of conventionally-armed intercontinental ballistic systems.</p><p>China last announced an intercontinental ballistic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240925081328/http://www.81.cn/js_208592/jdt_208593/16225173.html#expand" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">missile test into the Pacific Ocean in May 1980</a>, according to Chinese news reports about the latest launch. In 2021, China launched two tests of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/us/politics/china-hypersonic-missile.html" title="">hypersonic gliders</a> than can be carried into orbit by missiles, potentially with nuclear warheads. The People’s Liberation Army has also built over 300 silos that could house intercontinental ballistic missiles across three sites in northern China.</p><p>Additional reporting by <!-- -->Amy Chang Chien<!-- --> in Taipei and <!-- -->Hisako Ueno<!-- --> in Tokyo.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Buckley, the chief China correspondent for The Times, reports on China and Taiwan from Taipei, focused on politics, social change and security and military issues.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-buckley">More about Chris Buckley</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
