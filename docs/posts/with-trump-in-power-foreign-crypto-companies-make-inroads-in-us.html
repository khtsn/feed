But at the Willard, Mr. Ardoino and other crypto leaders were warmly greeted by Senator Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, who attended the lunch and participated in a group discussion about digital currency regulations and national security, according to four people with knowledge of the event.</p><p>The episode was a sign of the changing landscape for crypto firms as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/technology/trump-private-dinner-crypto-memecoin.html" title="">President Trump has embraced the industry</a>. Once an elusive overseas operator with little public footprint in the United States, Tether is capitalizing on the shift to establish a presence in Washington.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Tether has pushed to reshape crypto regulations as it considers starting an operation in the United States. The company’s main product is a cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin, which is designed to maintain a price of $1. Tether is <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/a54bed7c-65ff-4518-9b4e-82c8ea389b98/print/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pushing</a> Congress to influence a Senate bill, <a href="https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2025/02/04/hagerty-leads-legislation-to-establish-a-stablecoin-regulatory-framework/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced</a> this year by Mr. Hagerty, that outlines rules for stablecoins.

Its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/business/economy/federal-reserve-virtual-currency-stablecoin.html" title="">stablecoin</a> has proved to be a <a href="https://www.int-comp.org/insight/stablecoins-the-new-epicentre-of-crypto-fraud/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">popular tool</a> for criminals. In 2021, it paid $18.5 million to <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">settle</a> a fraud investigation by the New York attorney general.</p><p>But within days of taking office, Mr. Trump, who started a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/technology/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html" title="">crypto business</a> with his sons last year, ended a Biden administration crackdown on digital assets. Crypto companies that once avoided the country, fearful of regulatory sanctions, now enjoy astonishing access to Congress and the White House.</p><p>No crypto executive has illustrated the shift more than Mr. Ardoino, an Italian who had never visited the United States until this year. On his trip to Washington in March, he met with lawmakers, joined a forum <a href="https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/1897759080388726914" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hosted</a> by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and mingled with fellow executives at a party sponsored by Coinbase, a crypto exchange.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Paolo Ardoino, the Italian chief executive of Tether, in Washington last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via X</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the White House.

The firm’s most prominent business partner is the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, which until this year was run by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/howard-lutnick-confirmed-commerce.html" title="">Howard Lutnick</a>, now Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary. One of Tether’s main lobbyists is Jeff Miller, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/us/politics/jeff-miller-lobbyist-kevin-mccarthy.html" title="">influential figure in Republican politics</a> who <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/beb65e94-94fa-404f-81f9-6a7ad03b960f/print/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also represents Cantor Fitzgerald</a> in discussions about the stablecoin bill.</p><p>On his recent trip, Mr. Ardoino said, he also met with Zach Witkoff, a leader of Mr. Trump’s crypto company, World Liberty Financial, and a son of the White House envoy to the Middle East. And Tether has turned for advice to Watchtower Strategy, a corporate public affairs firm whose founders include Mr. Miller and Kevin McCarthy, the former Republican speaker of the House.</p><p>“We met Kevin a few times,” Mr. Ardoino said. “We are in good relationship.” He did not meet with Mr. Lutnick because “we are respecting the line of not engaging with Howard while he is in the administration,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/multimedia/00BIZ-TETHER-file-hpcv/00BIZ-TETHER-file-hpcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/multimedia/00BIZ-TETHER-file-hpcv/00BIZ-TETHER-file-hpcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/multimedia/00BIZ-TETHER-file-hpcv/00BIZ-TETHER-file-hpcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Mr. Ardoino leans on a railing on an outdoor cement balcony.

The company was founded 11 years ago by a former child actor, Brock Pierce. Mr. Pierce and a business partner later handed control of the firm to Giancarlo Devasini, an Italian who used to work as a plastic surgeon.</p><p>Now a crypto <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/giancarlo-devasini/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">billionaire</a>, Mr. Devasini <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/who-is-giancarlo-devasini-tether-jeremy-allaire-circle-90a408b9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lives</a> in Switzerland and rarely speaks publicly. For much of the past decade, Mr. Ardoino, a former software developer who joined a Tether affiliate in <a href="https://tether.io/news/tether-appoints-paolo-ardoino-as-ceo/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2014</a>, has served as the company’s public face.</p><p>Tether’s product is designed to address a key shortcoming of traditional cryptocurrencies, which constantly swing in value, making them inconvenient to use for payments and other standard transactions. Because stablecoins maintain a price of $1, many crypto investors prefer using them for trades.</p><p>In many ways, Tether and other issuers operate like banks. A trader deposits $500 and receives 500 stablecoins; the issuer generates revenue by investing a portion of those deposits and keeping any returns for itself. But the system works only if the issuer has $1 in reserve for each coin it sends into circulation, allowing customers to redeem their holdings at any time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>For years, Tether’s critics <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether?sref=zVYYYI5e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pointed to evidence</a> that the money it held in reserve would be <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insufficient</a> to cover a surge of redemptions.

At a recent Banking Committee hearing, Democratic senators criticized that clause, calling it a “giant loophole” to help Tether.</p><p>“It seems that my Republican colleagues are worried about facing backlash from one of Donald Trump’s close friends and our nation’s commerce secretary,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdB9ccYMS3g&amp;t=2391s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> at the hearing.</p><p>Ultimately, the Banking Committee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/technology/crypto-congress-financing-lobbying.html" title="">voted</a> to advance the bill to the full Senate.</p><p>In the interview, Mr. Ardoino said he was “very excited” to see the language in the GENIUS Act requiring cooperation with law enforcement, because his company already works closely with the U.S. authorities.
