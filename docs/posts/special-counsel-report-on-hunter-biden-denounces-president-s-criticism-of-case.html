He also pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in Los Angeles in September for falsifying records and failing to file returns. The time span of his tax crimes included both a period when he was addicted to crack cocaine and after he became sober.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In his report, Mr. Weiss pushed back against criticism, largely from Democrats, that the case against Mr. Biden was unwarranted or tainted by political motives.</p><p>The report acted as a pointed rejoinder to the president.
