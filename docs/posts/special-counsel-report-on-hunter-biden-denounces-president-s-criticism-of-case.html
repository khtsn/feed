Weiss, the special counsel who spent years investigating Hunter Biden, criticized President Biden for making “baseless accusations” about his inquiry that threatened “the integrity of the justice system as a whole” in a final report made public on Monday.</p><p>“The president’s characterizations are incorrect based on the facts in this case, and on a more fundamental level, they are wrong,” Mr. Weiss wrote.</p><p>His inquiry had been a subject of fierce debate until the president issued a broad pardon that ended the case against his son, saying that the prosecution was the result of “raw politics.”</p><p>The report, at some 27 pages, acted as a pointed rejoinder to the president. Citing judicial rulings that found that the case had been fairly brought, Mr. Weiss used his final words on the long-running investigation to decry President Biden’s characterizations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Politicians who attack the decisions of career prosecutors as politically motivated when they disagree with the outcome of a case undermine the public’s confidence in our criminal justice system,” Mr. Weiss’s report said. “The president’s statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith.”</p><p>Despite its relative brevity, Mr. Weiss’s report contains many more pages of appendices, including Hunter Biden’s indictments and other significant court filings.</p><p>The release comes amid a much more contentious 11th-hour legal fight over the publication of a report by Jack Smith, the special counsel who filed two indictments against Donald J. Trump only for both to collapse in part because of Mr. Trump’s 2024 election victory.</p><p>Mr. Weiss’s time as special counsel began after he had already investigated Hunter Biden for several years on tax, finance and foreign lobbying issues. The two sides briefly struck a plea deal, but the unusual nature of the agreement — in addition to the government’s unwillingness to promise that the investigation would end with the deal — resulted in its collapse in July 2023.</p><p>The failed plea led Mr. Weiss to seek and receive an appointment as special counsel, allowing him to file indictments against the president’s son in two jurisdictions — related to lying on a gun purchase form in Delaware, and tax charges in Los Angeles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Last year, the younger Mr. Biden was convicted of the gun charge by a jury in Wilmington, Del. He pleaded guilty in the tax case, but his father pardoned him while he was awaiting sentencing in both cases. The president not only absolved his son of the convictions, but also gave him a sweeping pardon for any potential crimes covering a period of more than 10 years.</p><p>In doing so, the president said his son’s case had been infected with politics, a claim that angered Mr. Weiss and the Justice Department, particularly because the president had for years asserted that the case had been handled independently.</p><p>Because the presidential pardon had effectively ruled out any such analysis, the report said, Mr. Weiss reached no conclusions about the possibility that Hunter Biden had committed other crimes.</p><p>Mr. Weiss also indicted and won a guilty plea from another man, Alexander Smirnov, for lying to the F.B.I. during the 2020 election period by falsely claiming knowledge of corrupt payments to the father and son. Mr. Smirnov, a longtime F.B.I. informant, had claimed that executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Hunter Biden $5 million each around 2015 — an accusation that was trumpeted by congressional Republicans.<br/></p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
