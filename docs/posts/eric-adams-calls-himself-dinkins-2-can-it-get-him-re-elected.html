At an event celebrating Haitian heritage, he again portrayed himself as a sequel to Mr. Dinkins, the city’s first Black mayor. He repeated the line the next day, at a gathering of older New Yorkers in East Harlem.</p><p>Invoking Mr. Dinkins, and his history as a one-term mayor, has become a central theme in Mr. Adams’s re-election strategy. At every event where the mayor has an audience with his base — town halls with older adults, ethnic heritage celebrations, guest appearances on Black radio — Mr. Adams has argued that his accomplishments are being dismissed because of his race.</p><p>The mayor has urged his supporters to respond by re-electing him to the second term that Mr. Dinkins was denied — a call that has resonated among some voters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Jackie L. Wilson, 78, a retired Army sergeant major who lives in southeast Queens and attended one of the mayor’s town halls, said he recalled how Rudolph W. Giuliani turned voters against Mr. Dinkins, diminishing his accomplishments and portraying him as ineffectual.</p><p>“The more he does,” Mr. Wilson said, referring to a Black mayor like Mr. Dinkins or Mr. Adams, “the more they say he didn’t do<em>.</em>”</p><p>Of course, it’s easy to understand the strategic way that Mr. Adams is invoking the name of Mr. Dinkins. The current mayor has significant problems of his own making, most notably a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/nyregion/eric-adams-fbi-investigation.html" title="">federal investigation</a> into his campaign’s fund-raising. (He has not been charged with a crime and denies any wrongdoing.) Mr. Adams has also received strong pushback against his handling of the city’s budget and recent migrant influx.</p><p>Those factors have led to record low poll numbers and a perception of vulnerability that has created what is shaping up to be the most competitive Democratic primary faced by a sitting mayor in three decades. His rivals say Mr. Adams is a poor manager who has demonstrated an inability to effectively run the nation’s largest city.</p><p>And some notable Democrats have taken offense at his self-drawn comparison to Mr. Dinkins, a deliberative and dignified presence who suffered after his mishandling of four days of racial violence in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. But even as Mr. Dinkins’s stature began to diminish, his credibility was seldom questioned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Patrick Gaspard, the president of the Center for American Progress who worked as an aide to Mr. Dinkins, said he thought it was “really difficult to see how this comparison holds for those of us who actually lived through it all,” referring to how New York was torn by racial strife during Mr. Dinkins’s tenure.</p><p>Mr. Adams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/nyregion/eric-adams-dnc-convention.html" title="">has also lost</a> much of his national luster. As mayors from smaller cities like Durham, N.C., and Cincinnati graced the Democratic National Convention stage in Chicago last week, Mr. Adams was not given an official role.</p><p>In the wake of those political realities, the mayor has embraced an us-versus-them framing meant to persuade his supporters not to abandon him.</p><p>Mr. Adams has buttressed his argument by citing improvements in areas that resonate with his target audience. Unemployment rates among Black New Yorkers have dropped; murders and shootings have declined; affordable housing has increased. And his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/style/rat-pack-nyc-eric-adams.html" title="">war on trash and rats</a> continues with full force. Yet he claims that unnamed forces have been able to change the narrative and distort his legacy.</p><p>“It’s mind-blowing what we’ve delivered for Black and brown people in the city,” Mr. Adams said on a hip-hop program on SiriusXM last month. “Just as they did with David Dinkins, turning their base against him as he was delivering for us, this is the same script.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Adams’s strategy may prove crucial to his re-election efforts. In its most recent poll of New York City voters, Quinnipiac University found that his approval rating had fallen to 28 percent, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/nyregion/eric-adams-record.html" title="">lowest for a mayor</a> since the university began polling the city in 1996.</p><p>The mayor’s approval ratings were below 50 percent among every political and racial demographic: White voters disapproved of the mayor, 61 percent to 28 percent; Hispanic voters, 65 percent to 20 percent; Asian voters, 60 percent to 22 percent. Even among Democrats, Mr. Adams was underwater, with only 35 percent approving of his job performance.</p><p>The one silver lining for the mayor was the response of Black voters, who, by a 48 percent to 38 percent margin, still approved of Mr. Adams. Getting those New Yorkers to turn out seems pivotal to his chances of prevailing in the Democratic primary next June.</p><p>As a mayoral candidate, Mr. Adams expressed great admiration for Mr. Dinkins, calling him a mentor and saying that his policing approach would be similar to his. At the same time, Mr. Adams made clear that he was his own brand of urban leader, broadening his message to moderates and conservatives with his policing proposals, and to real estate executives with his business-friendly approach.</p><p>But as some of Mr. Adams’s law-and-order policies — including the return of policing tactics like stop-and-frisk — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/nyregion/eric-adams-nypd.html" title="">drew criticism for infringing on the rights</a> of New Yorkers, especially people of color, he started making the Dinkins comparisons to insinuate that racial politics had undermined both men.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Dinkins was elected in 1989 after a competitive primary in which he beat the three-term incumbent, Edward I. Koch, and then defeated Mr. Giuliani, then a U.S. attorney in Manhattan, in a close general election. He ran on a message of racial reconciliation after the murder of Yusef Hawkins, a Black teenager, by a white mob in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. He referred to New York City as a “gorgeous mosaic.”</p><p>Mr. Dinkins inherited a city that was spiraling out of control with crime. He tapped federal money to hire more police officers, which was later credited with helping to reverse the city’s crime numbers.</p><p>But Mr. Dinkins’s poor response to the Crown Heights riots helped end his political career. Aiding in his downfall was Mr. Giuliani, who worked vociferously to portray Mr. Dinkins as incompetent, including at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/17/nyregion/officers-rally-and-dinkins-is-their-target.html" title="">an unruly rally</a> of police officers on the steps of City Hall in 1992, where racial epithets were hurled at the mayor. Mr. Dinkins lost to Mr. Giuliani the following year.</p><p>It wasn’t until years after Mr. Dinkins left office that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/nyregion/david-dinkins-legacy-nyc.html" title="">his vision for the city and his accomplishments</a> were more appreciated.</p><p>“David Dinkins was one of the authors of New York City’s public-safety turnaround, but they never gave him credit,” said Bill de Blasio, Mr. Adams’s predecessor, who worked as an aide to Mr. Dinkins. “He was politically crucified because he was Black, much more than for any policy mistakes of his own.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>But Mr. Gaspard, who served as a trusted adviser to Mr. de Blasio, contended that Mr. Adams’s problems had less to do with the racial animosity endured by Mr. Dinkins and more to do with his own mayoralty, “which still needs to better define its core meaning, reason and vision.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David Dinkins’s tenure as mayor of New York City was largely criticized until years later, when his efforts to battle crime were given their due.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Don Hogan Charles/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Former Representative Charles B. Rangel, who, with Mr. Dinkins, was part of the so-called Gang of Four, a Black political coalition from Harlem, acknowledged that the federal investigation into Mr. Adams’s campaign “makes it very difficult for his accomplishments” around education or the migrant crisis “to break through.”</p><p>But he said in an interview that there was “no question in my mind that Eric Adams is a target,” much in the same way “that David Dinkins was the target.”</p><p>Some of the mayor’s traditional political adversaries such as the city’s public advocate, Jumaane Williams, and its comptroller, Brad Lander, who recently announced his mayoral campaign, tread lightly when it came to criticizing Mr. Adams during the first half of his term, aware of the perception of racism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But with the Democratic primary 10 months away, Mr. Lander and other candidates, including Scott Stringer, a former city comptroller, and Zellnor Myrie, an Afro-Latino state senator who holds the mayor’s former seat in Brooklyn, have begun to frame the race as a referendum on Mr. Adams’s management of the city.</p><p>Mr. Myrie has spent part of his nascent mayoral campaign trying to claw away some of the mayor’s support in the Black and Latino community by speaking about how his parents immigrated from Costa Rica and focusing on his efforts at the state level to address early childhood education, gun violence and deed theft.</p><p>As for Mr. Adams, he has made it clear that he intends to continue to compare himself to Mr. Dinkins.</p><p>“I’m going to remind people what they did to David, my mentor,” Mr. Adams said recently. “I’m not going to be quiet because people are uncomfortable with me reminding them of that.”</p><p>Dana Rubinstein<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeffery C.
