In 2022, SpaceX, which makes rockets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/business/spacex-workers-elon-musk.html" title="">fired nine employees</a> who had called on the company to distance itself from social media comments by Mr. Musk, including one in which he mocked sexual harassment accusations against him. Some of those employees later filed unfair-labor-practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board.</p><p>Mr. Ottmann’s critical remarks, and Tesla’s reaction, are the latest indication of the disruption caused by Mr. Musk’s right-wing politics. He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/europe/musk-afd-weidel-call.html" title="">supported a far-right party</a> in Germany whose members have been fined by the government for using Nazi slogans. Mr. Musk’s role in the Trump administration as leader of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/musk-federal-government.html" title="">the Department of Government Efficiency</a> has also made him a polarizing figure.</p><p>Signs of dissent at Tesla have not been isolated to Mr. Ottmann. Last month during a meeting at Tesla’s offices in Palo Alto, Calif., employees vented their frustrations about Mr. Musk’s political activities, leading a manager to say he was also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/elon-musk-tesla-trump.html" title="">discouraged</a> by the chief executive’s behavior.</p><p>Mr. Ottmann confirmed Thursday that he had been fired. He declined to comment further, referring questions to Jana Moser, a lawyer in Santa Monica, Calif. Ms. Moser did not reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This fall, a SpaceX employee was fired after writing on an internal message board that he hoped Mr. Musk would stop wearing company apparel during his campaign appearances for Mr. Trump, three people familiar with incident said. During an October rally in Butler, Pa., for example, Mr. Musk wore an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/style/elon-musk-donald-trump-campaign-rally.html" title="">“Occupy Mars” T-shirt</a> — which SpaceX sells in its company store — as he jumped up and down onstage.</p><p>The employee wrote that it wouldn’t be appropriate for workers to wear political clothing to the office and, therefore, that company apparel should not be worn at campaign events. A few days after his post, the company revoked the employee’s access to internal systems, though it later reinstated the employee after determining there was no violation of company policies, the people said.</p><p>The employee resigned weeks later. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Musk has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/technology/elon-musk-twitter-fired-criticism.html" title="">fired workers at X who criticized him</a>. In the wake of his $44 billion takeover of the company, then called Twitter, in 2022, several employees posted critiques of the billionaire on the platform. Mr. Musk argued with some of them online, and they were later fired.</p><p>The firings are at odds with Mr. Musk’s often-stated goal to defend free speech. He has offered to fund lawsuits against employers who fire workers because of things they posted on X. In 2024, he funded a suit for a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-x-lawsuit-chloe-happe-jack-dorsey-block" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former worker</a> at the payments company Block after she was fired for inflammatory posts she made on a pseudonymous X account.</p><p>Investors in Tesla, the only publicly traded company that Mr. Musk runs, are also worried that his political activities are alienating some buyers and that he is spending too much time in Washington and not enough time addressing slumping car sales. Shares of the company have declined about 40 percent from a high set on Dec. 17.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ryan Mac covers corporate accountability across the global technology industry.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ryan-mac">More about Ryan Mac</a></span></p></div><div><p>Kate Conger is a technology reporter based in San Francisco.
