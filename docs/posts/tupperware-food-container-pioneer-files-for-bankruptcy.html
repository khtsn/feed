They came to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/world/asia/tupperwares-sweet-spot-shifts-to-indonesia.html" title="">sold globally</a>, propelled by a direct sales campaign called “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/07/business/07interview.html" title="">Tupperware parties</a>.”</p><p>But the strengths of that model became “weaknesses,” the company said in <a href="https://document.epiq11.com/document/getdocumentbycode?docId=4380251&amp;projectCode=TLP&amp;source=DM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its Chapter 11 filing</a>, saying it failed to develop a diverse sales strategy, including for online shoppers. It also blamed a “challenging macroeconomic environment” over the last several years.</p><p>“In stark contrast to the early days of the company, nearly everyone now knows what Tupperware is, but fewer people know where to find it,” Brian J. Fox, Tupperware’s chief restructuring officer, wrote in the filing. Only in 2022 did the company set up a storefront on Amazon and start selling at Target, he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Tupperware said it would seek court approval to facilitate a sale and to keep operating during the bankruptcy case, which was filed in Delaware. In filings, Tupperware, along with certain subsidiaries, said that it had assets of about $680 million and debts of $1.2 billion.</p><p>The company, which is headquartered in Orlando, Fla., had raised concerns about its financial health for several years. It said in a recent <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1008654/000100865423000079/tup-20221231.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regulatory</a> document that it had begun facing financial headwinds and declining sales in 2019.
