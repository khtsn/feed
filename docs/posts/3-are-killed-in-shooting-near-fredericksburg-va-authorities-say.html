A motive was not immediately clear, but a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office said that the shooting had not arisen from a domestic dispute.</p><p>The shooting was reported around 5:30 p.m. on Olde Greenwich Circle, a street of modest townhouses in Spotsylvania County about 60 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., the sheriff’s office said. People in the immediate area were urged to stay indoors, and others were told to avoid the area.</p><p>The ages of the victims were not known. The injured victims were taken to area hospitals, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. A bystander’s video showed what appeared to be two bodies covered in white sheets several yards apart on the pavement outside a row of houses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We still have an active, ongoing investigation with no suspects in custody,” Major Scott said.
