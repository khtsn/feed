A lower court had dismissed the case. But last year a federal appeals panel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/appeals-court-mexico-lawsuit-gunmakers.html" title="">ruled</a> that the $10 billion lawsuit could proceed. In October, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/supreme-court-mexico-lawsuit-gun-makers.html" title="">agreed</a> to take the case; it will hear arguments in March.</p><p>Unlike the United States, Mexico has strict gun control laws, with only one single gun store issuing fewer than 50 permits a year. Gun violence, however, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/world/americas/violence-mexico-killings.html" title="">continues to wreak havoc</a> across the country.</p></div></div>
