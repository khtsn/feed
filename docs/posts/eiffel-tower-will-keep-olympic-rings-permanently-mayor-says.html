The five interlaced rings of blue, red, yellow, black and green, which represent the different continents, were installed this summer between the tower’s first and second floors, more than 200 feet above the ground.</p><p>“I want the two to remain married,” Ms. Hidalgo said in an <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/jeux-olympiques/entretien-anne-hidalgo-a-ouest-france-les-anneaux-olympiques-vont-rester-sur-la-tour-eiffel-8ee1f7d6-679a-11ef-9827-8f066c8ca511" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with Ouest-France, a newspaper.</p><p>The Eiffel Tower, already one of the most widely recognized monuments in the world, with about seven million visitors per year, has been a prominent symbol of this year’s Olympic Games, which ended earlier this month, and of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/paralympic-games?searchResultPosition=0" title="">Paralympic Games</a>, which will end on Sept. 8.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Olympic competitors pass the Eiffel Tower at the start of the women’s road race in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

The city of Paris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/world/europe/paris-eiffel-tower-closed-strike.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">owns the Eiffel Tower</a> and is a majority shareholder in the company that operates it.</p><p>Ms. Hidalgo said that the rings now installed on the monument — 95 feet wide and 43 feet tall — were too heavy to resist winter winds and remain permanently, and would be replaced “as soon as possible” by lighter rings made by ArcelorMittal, the global steel giant that made the current set.</p><p>“As long as we can keep these, let’s keep them; then we’ll put up others,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Hidalgo also said that the city needed to come up with a system to “mask” the rings when the Eiffel Tower is lit up on special occasions — like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/world/empire-state-building-eiffel-tower-ukraine-russia.html?searchResultPosition=5" title="">to support Ukraine</a> in the war against Russia — because it could run afoul of the I.O.C.’s strict neutrality rules.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The I.O.C. could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Ms. Hidalgo, who has been mayor of Paris since 2014, hopes to make Olympic-related achievements — like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/olympics/triathlon-seine-paris.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">making the Seine clean enough to swim in</a> — a key part of her legacy, and she said that she wanted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/world/olympics/paris-vibe-tourists.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">fervor</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/world/europe/olympics-paris-france-unity.html?searchResultPosition=25" title="">unity</a> that were fostered by the Games to continue.</p><p>“Paris will never again be the same,” she told Ouest-France. Later, she added: “I want to keep this festive spirit alive!”</p><p>The fate of the Olympic cauldron, another widely popular landmark in Paris these past few weeks, is more uncertain. Ms. Hidalgo says she hopes to also keep the cauldron, which is lifted into the sky from the Tuileries Gardens every night by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/world/olympics/flame-cauldron-balloon.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">a gigantic golden balloon</a>, as hundreds of onlookers ooh and aah.</p><p>But the site, next to the Louvre Museum, belongs to the French state, not the city of Paris, and some experts have <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2024/08/27/keeping-the-olympic-cauldron-in-the-tuileries-gardens-requires-a-reasoned-and-reasonable-approach_6722393_23.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed reservations</a> about keeping the cauldron in an area that is governed by strict heritage rules.</p><p>“It’s up to the president to decide,” Ms. Hidalgo told Ouest-France. “But my opinion is that it should stay in the same place, because it’s an inseparable part of the Paris Games.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
