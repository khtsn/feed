Blinken traveled to Haiti on Wednesday in a display of American support for international efforts to wrest the nation from the grip of tyrannical violent gangs.</p><p>Mr. Blinken planned to visit the capital, Port-au-Prince, and survey the work of a Kenyan-led security force, backed by the United Nations, that arrived in Haiti this summer. Its mandate is to support Haitian police as they combat the gangs, which have subjected large areas of the Caribbean nation to brutal rule, enforced by torture, rape and murder.</p><p>Overshadowed by crises in the Middle East and Europe, Haiti’s collapse into criminal anarchy is among the most intractable problems faced by the Biden administration and the international community.</p><p>Efforts to improve the lives of Haiti’s largely impoverished population of roughly 11 million people have been complicated by past interventions by the United States and the United Nations that only seemed to exacerbate the country’s problems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Those failures, as well as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/world/americas/haiti-history-colonized-france.html" title="">legacy of colonialism</a>, help explain why the United States has played a supporting role behind Kenya’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/world/americas/haiti-gangs-kenya-police.html" title="">deployment of police officers</a>, now numbering about 400 in the country. That is well behind a stated goal of 2,500 personnel, to which at least six other nations have said they would contribute.</p><p>U.S. officials said that Mr. Blinken — paying the first visit to Haiti by a U.S. secretary of state in nearly a decade — would assess the state of the security mission, which has so far done little to dislodge the power of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/world/americas/haiti-gangs-explainer.html" title="">well-armed gangs</a> that have marauded through the country, blocking roads, emptying prisons and attacking police stations.</p><p>While the United States is not providing personnel to the security mission, it is giving equipment and financial support, with a commitment so far of $309 million, the State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said on Wednesday.</p><p>Some $200 million of that has already been delivered to Haiti by the Defense Department in the form of equipment such as armored personnel carriers. The State Department is supplying the rest, including radios, night-vision capabilities and police gear, Mr. Miller said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kenyan police officers, part of a U.N.-backed force, worked to tow away a broken-down armored vehicle during an operation in Port-au-Prince.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Odelyn Joseph/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Despite the small number of Kenyan police in the country, Haiti is far more stable than it was several months ago, Brian A. Nichols, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, told reporters on Wednesday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Nichols noted that, in March, Haiti’s former prime minister, Ariel Henry, was stranded when gangs fired on the country’s international airport, shutting it down. The airport is again operational. Around that same time, a former rebel leader <a href="https://apnews.com/article/haiti-protests-guy-philippe-ariel-henry-b8e7902b5f1d9d3e1e92343766b33126" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threatened to march on Port-au-Prince</a> and take over the government.</p><p>“We’ve come a long way since those very dark moments,” Mr. Nichols said. “We’re seeing that forward movement on the security side that we’ve long waited for.” He said that Kenyan forces have been conducting joint operations with the Haitian national police and Haitian army, “going after gangs and their leaders in a way that hasn’t happened in years.”</p><p>But Mr. Nichols struck an ominous note, warning that progress could be reversed without more outside support. “We need the rest of the international community to step forward with much more significant financial contributions so that the force can continue to operate,” he said.</p><p>Also at issue is what will become of the mission after its current U.N. mandate expires on Oct. 2. Some analysts have said the Kenyan-led deployment, which is authorized but not funded by the United Nations, should be replaced by a traditional U.N. peacekeeping force — despite lingering anger over previous U.N. peacekeepers, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/world/americas/haiti-un-peacekeepers.html" title="">raped women and girls</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/world/americas/united-nations-haiti-cholera.html" title="">introduced cholera</a> into the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Asked about the possibility of a peacekeeping mission, Mr. Miller said the U.S. government “will always look at all the available options.”</p><p>While security is essential to restoring the country’s stability, officials and analysts say that any long-term success will depend on a successful transition back to democratic rule following years of turmoil after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/world/americas/haiti-president-assassinated-killed.html" title="">its president, Jovenel Moïse</a>, was assassinated in his bedroom in July 2021. The country is nominally ruled by its prime minister, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/us/haiti-prime-minister-garry-conille.html" title="">Garry Conille</a>, a former U.N. official who was appointed in May, and with whom Mr. Blinken planned to meet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Garry Conille, center, visits a hospital in the capital after the national police took control of it away from armed gangs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Clarens Siffroy/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A transitional council established earlier this year is paving the way for national elections to choose a new president. But that process has been plagued by delays and infighting, and three members of the council are under investigation by the country’s anti-corruption agency over the handing out of government jobs to members of its coalition of political and economic groups.</p><p>Mr. Nichols expressed concern about the allegations, saying that Haitian authorities should investigate the charges and “hold anyone who’s responsible for corrupt acts accountable.” He added that the Haitian people deserve good governance and that international donors require “confidence that funds that flow through the Haitian government are used appropriately and transparently.”</p><p>Mr. Blinken planned to meet with the transitional council’s leader, Edgard Leblanc Fils.</p><p>After stopping in Haiti, Mr. Blinken will visit the neighboring Dominican Republic, State Department officials said. The Dominican Republic has been a political and economic success story in contrast to its neighbor and, unlike Haiti, is secure enough for the secretary of state to spend the night.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Crowley covers the State Department and U.S. foreign policy for The Times.
