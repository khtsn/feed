    <h1>A Polarized Nation Votes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Tens of millions of Americans went to the polls today to elect the next president. Some voters, particularly in the West, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/poll-closing-times.html" title="">a few more hours to cast their ballots</a>. But soon, the dizzying and contentious race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will become an exercise in patience as votes are being counted.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/05/us/trump-harris-election" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>No matter who wins, this election will make history. Harris, who began her campaign just over 100 days ago, would be the first woman ever elected to the country’s highest office. Trump would be the second-ever president to serve nonconsecutive terms and the first to be elected after being convicted of a felony.</p><p>“Both parties took risks in this election,” my colleague Jess Bidgood, who writes the On Politics newsletter, told me. “My big question going into tonight is: Whose risk is going to pay off?” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">The latest polls</a> suggested that either candidate could win.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Harris, like more than 80 million others, voted early. Trump cast his ballot today in Florida and said this would likely be his last campaign. He will watch the returns at Mar-a-Lago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-election-night.html?smid=url-share" title="">where Elon Musk plans to join him</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3b9f688">A guide to election night</h2><p>It will take multiple days to count all of the votes across the country. If the polls are right, it could be days before we know the next president. If they’re wrong, a victor could be declared before you wake up tomorrow. Either way, we should <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/upshot/election-night-guide.html" title="">by tonight have a good idea of how close the race is</a>.</p><p>The election will very likely be decided by the seven battleground states. Among those, polls close first in Georgia, at 7 p.m. Eastern, and then North Carolina, at 7:30 p.m. Both states are expected to report the vast majority of their ballots before midnight. If Harris is leading in either one, she will have multiple paths to victory. If Trump is leading in both, Harris will most likely need to take Pennsylvania to win.</p><p>The Midwestern swing states, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, could be counting through the night and into tomorrow. My colleagues highlighted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/counties-presidential-election-michigan-georgia-pennsylvania.html" title="">several counties that could provide some hints</a>.</p><p>If the race is so close that Arizona or Nevada prove decisive, it’s unlikely that we will know the final result for at least a few days. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/results-timing-presidential-race-calls.html" title="">Check out our detailed breakdown of when each state is expected to be called</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Things could get clearer as the night goes, but it’s also possible that things could get more complicated,” Jess said. “We may have to be really patient before we get clarity.”</p><p>If you’re looking for live updates on the results, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-president.html" title="">follow our results tracker</a>.
