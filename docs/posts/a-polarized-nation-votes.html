Some voters, particularly in the West, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/poll-closing-times.html" title="">a few more hours to cast their ballots</a>. But soon, the dizzying and contentious race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will become an exercise in patience as votes are being counted.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/05/us/trump-harris-election" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>No matter who wins, this election will make history. Harris, who began her campaign just over 100 days ago, would be the first woman ever elected to the country’s highest office. Trump would be the second-ever president to serve nonconsecutive terms and the first to be elected after being convicted of a felony.</p><p>“Both parties took risks in this election,” my colleague Jess Bidgood, who writes the On Politics newsletter, told me. “My big question going into tonight is: Whose risk is going to pay off?” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">The latest polls</a> suggested that either candidate could win.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Harris, like more than 80 million others, voted early. Trump cast his ballot today in Florida and said this would likely be his last campaign. He will watch the returns at Mar-a-Lago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-election-night.html?smid=url-share" title="">where Elon Musk plans to join him</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3b9f688">A guide to election night</h2><p>It will take multiple days to count all of the votes across the country. If the polls are right, it could be days before we know the next president. If they’re wrong, a victor could be declared before you wake up tomorrow. Either way, we should <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/upshot/election-night-guide.html" title="">by tonight have a good idea of how close the race is</a>.</p><p>The election will very likely be decided by the seven battleground states. Among those, polls close first in Georgia, at 7 p.m. Eastern, and then North Carolina, at 7:30 p.m. Both states are expected to report the vast majority of their ballots before midnight. If Harris is leading in either one, she will have multiple paths to victory. If Trump is leading in both, Harris will most likely need to take Pennsylvania to win.</p><p>The Midwestern swing states, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, could be counting through the night and into tomorrow. My colleagues highlighted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/counties-presidential-election-michigan-georgia-pennsylvania.html" title="">several counties that could provide some hints</a>.</p><p>If the race is so close that Arizona or Nevada prove decisive, it’s unlikely that we will know the final result for at least a few days. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/results-timing-presidential-race-calls.html" title="">Check out our detailed breakdown of when each state is expected to be called</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Things could get clearer as the night goes, but it’s also possible that things could get more complicated,” Jess said. “We may have to be really patient before we get clarity.”</p><p>If you’re looking for live updates on the results, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-president.html" title="">follow our results tracker</a>.

The House has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-house.html" title="">dozens of close races</a>, which will determine the party in power.

The tightest race may be in New Hampshire, where the Republican candidate is better known, but the Democrat is hoping to be buoyed by support for abortion rights.</p><p>In 10 other states, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-abortion.html" title="">abortion is directly on the ballot</a>. All 10 are considering whether to protect abortion access; Nebraska is also considering a stricter ban. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/ballot-measures-abortion-marijuana.html" title="">Other ballot measures</a> consider legalizing marijuana and public funding for private schools.</p><h2 id="link-1a370c34">Federal and state officials are monitoring threats</h2><p>Federal officials are bracing for an increase in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/election-threats-russia.html" title="">efforts by foreign adversaries</a> to undermine the election. So far, voting has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/election-voter-fraud.html" title="">gone relatively smoothly</a>.</p><p>The F.B.I. said in a statement today that it was aware of bomb threats to polling locations in several states, “many of which appear to originate from Russian email domains.” Officials said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/pollls-voting-bomb-threats.html" title="">none of the threats appeared to be credible</a>.</p><p>Other difficulties could arise if the losing candidate rejects the results of the election, as Trump did in 2020. It’s possible, though unlikely, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/election-supreme-court.html" title="">the Supreme Court could get involved</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>Luckily, </strong>local officials have being preparing for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/02/upshot/election-day-card-scenarios.html" title="">emergencies you probably have never thought about</a>.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-55bd377a">More top news</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Israel:</strong> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/netanyahu-fires-gallant.html" title="">fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant</a>, after disagreements over the prosecution of the war in Gaza.</p></li><li><p><strong>Russia:</strong> Western officials said that Moscow had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/europe/russia-plot-dhl-planes.html" title="">plotting to place incendiary devices on cargo planes in Europe</a> and performed a test run this summer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business:</strong> A nearly two-month strike at Boeing ended. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/business/boeing-planes-production.html" title="">Its new chief executive has a lot more problems to fix.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Tech:</strong> In a policy shift, Meta will allow U.S. government agencies and contractors working on national security to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/technology/meta-ai-military.html" title="">use its A.I. for military purposes</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saudi Arabia:</strong> Wall Street titans and the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, courted each other last week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/business/wall-street-saudi-arabia-oil-money.html" title="">at a confab sometimes called “Davos in the Desert.”</a></p></li></ul><hr/><h3 id="link-63db171d"><span><strong>TIME TO UNWIND</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A screening in Manhattan last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-3fd1ca7c">‘Dinner in America’ has a rare second chance</h2><p>The angsty rom-com “Dinner in America” debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2020, but the low-budget film struggled to find distribution and was self-released in 2022 to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/26/movies/dinner-in-america-review.html" title="">mixed reviews</a> and little buzz.</p><p>The movie’s fortunes have suddenly changed, thanks to an inexplicable bump in TikTok’s algorithm that has turbo-blasted the movie and its catchy song, “Watermelon,” to millions of users.
