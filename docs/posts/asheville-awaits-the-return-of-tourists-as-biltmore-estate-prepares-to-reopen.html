The storm in North Carolina killed 101 people, according to the most recent count from the state’s health department, and also heavily damaged roads, knocked out Asheville’s water system and forced the closure of most businesses and attractions.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.visitnc.com/advisory/cAdA/hurricane-helene-travel-advisory" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">official guidance about visiting changed</a> to proceed with caution in the middle of October, typically one of the region’s most lucrative months for travel-related businesses with visitors flooding in to see fall colors. Those businesses and workers typically rely on October profits and wages to bank a financial cushion ahead of the lean first quarter of the following year.</p><p>Now, travel-reliant businesses from restaurants to Airbnbs are gradually reopening.

Floodwater swamped two areas of the city that are major tourist draws, Biltmore Village and the River Arts District. Interstate 40, the region’s main route to the west, is closed at the Tennessee state line for an indefinite period. The portion of <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Great Smoky Mountains National Park</a> closest to Asheville also remains closed, as does much of the scenic <a href="https://www.nps.gov/blri/index.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>.</p><p>Helene was a focus of national news coverage for days, and people in some towns west of Asheville with relatively little damage said that coverage unnecessarily scared off tourists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The effects of Helene also heavily damaged roads, destroyed Asheville’s water system and forced the closure of most businesses and attractions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sean Rayford/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Chris Cloer, owner of <a href="http://www.crystalmarketminingcompany.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Crystal Mountain Gem Mine</a> in the town of Brevard, about a 45-minute drive southwest of Asheville, said Brevard is in good condition. But October’s business at his rock shop, which includes an indoor flume where people can pan for gems, was a quarter of what he normally sees. Potential visitors who saw images of Helene’s destruction elsewhere, he said, “assumed that that’s what the whole area looks like.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Asheville’s immediate problem is the havoc Helene wreaked on its water system. Water resumed flowing through system pipes in mid-October, but because Helene stirred up so much sediment in the system’s main reservoir, that water is unsafe to drink without boiling. City officials decline to say when that will change.</p><p>“Potable water is the holy grail,” said Vic Isley, president and chief executive of the <a href="https://www.exploreasheville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Explore Asheville</a> tourism bureau. Some hotels and restaurants are trucking in clean water, she said. Others have stayed closed instead.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some 1.3 million visitors come to the Biltmore each year, which was built for an heir of the shipping tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt in 1895.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Biltmore Company</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>At the Biltmore, potable water is not a problem because the estate draws its water from its own wells.</p><p>Chase Pickering, vice president for guest experience at the Biltmore, said officials there do not know what level of activity to expect during November and December, when elaborate Christmas decorations in the past have drawn the estate’s largest number of visitors annually. “We are in uncharted territory,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Workers at the Biltmore lined up to help with Christmas trees on Wednesday.

The lowest standard nightly rate for an available double room in one of the two Biltmore hotels in November is $360, according to the Biltmore website, and many rooms run the $600 to $700 range nightly.</p><p>The Biltmore House, two hotels, a winery and other major buildings that are part of the estate saw little damage from Helene, Mr. Pickering said, and on Wednesday, most of the 8,000-acre property visible from roads looked much as it does in any year, though dozens of fallen trees lay in some spots.</p><p>The company had 2,400 employees before Helene threw many out of work, Mr. Pickering said.
