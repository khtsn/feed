Young, were sentenced to more than seven years for their parts in the assault on the officer, Michael Fanone.</p><p>On Monday, President Trump pardoned all three of them, lumping them together with nearly 1,600 other people who had been charged in connection with the Jan. 6 riot and who he suggested had been victimized by a politicized prosecution. His grant of clemency comes despite a wealth of evidence about their crimes, including videos used against them by the Justice Department.</p><p>Some of the videos document the gruesome moment when Officer Fanone, who rushed to defend the Capitol on his day off, was dragged into the crowd by Mr. Head, beaten by Mr. Young and then attacked with a stun gun by Mr. Rodriguez.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Video from Officer Fanone’s body camera shows Mr. Rodriguez driving the stun gun into Officer Fanone’s neck, causing him to scream.

Of those defendants, nearly 175 used a dangerous or deadly weapon, prosecutors say.</p><p>Four years later, the violence they committed is still shocking — and the facts of what happened are right there in the images, many of them now iconic.</p><p>Here are some of the most egregious acts of violence that took place during the Capitol attack, as seen in videos.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>An hourslong battle pitting rioters against outnumbered police officers took place by an entrance to the Capitol where Mr. Fanone was beaten unconscious.

Howell wrote in a court order on Wednesday that dismissed a case against two Jan. 6 defendants at the government’s request. “No ‘process of national reconciliation’ can begin when poor losers, whose preferred candidate loses an election, are glorified for disrupting a constitutionally mandated proceeding in Congress and doing so with impunity.”</p><p>“This court,” Judge Howell concluded, “cannot let stand the revisionist myth relayed in this presidential pronouncement.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
