Nearly six inches of rain fell on Saturday and Sunday in places like Redding, Calif., which caused some roads to flood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The second of these storms is expected from Monday into Wednesday. Flood watches were issued for roughly 13 million people across Northern California from Monday afternoon through Wednesday morning, including heavily populated areas like the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento Valley. (A flood watch means residents should be prepared for possible flooding; it does not mean that flooding will occur.)</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/us/03wea-westcoast-rain/03wea-westcoast-rain-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/us/03wea-westcoast-rain/03wea-westcoast-rain-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/us/03wea-westcoast-rain/03wea-westcoast-rain-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People cross a rainy street in San Francisco.

It is expected to drench Northern California before drifting south, bringing some rainfall to Southern California.</p><p>Forecasters warned that last weekend’s rain had left the ground saturated, essentially priming some northern regions for flooding to occur as new rain pours down this week. By the end of it, the Sacramento Valley and areas south of San Francisco may have seen another one to three inches of rain. North of the city, forecasters predicted an additional two to four inches.</p><p>A third atmospheric river is expected at the end of the week. While it is still uncertain exactly how that system will evolve, forecasters expect it to be weaker, with reduced totals of only one to two inches of rain. This third system is also likely to be aimed farther south.</p><h2 id="link-2f78ff86">Southern California will likely see some rain.</h2><p>The recent and continuing rains have been focused on the northern part of the West Coast, but Southern California is not out of danger. The region would welcome the steady rainfall after dry conditions that helped fuel disastrous wildfires in and around Los Angeles last month, but too much rain, too fast, could lead to mudslides in areas that burned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But forecasters believe the rainfall this time isn’t expected to be intense. One of the storms is likely to peak in Southern California from Tuesday night into Wednesday, with maybe an inch of rainfall. Los Angeles County may even see far less. But up to two inches of rain may fall on south-facing slopes, including in the Santa Barbara South Coast, Malibu and the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.</p><p>After a brief lull on Thursday morning, another system will arrive later, delivering widespread rainfall across the region. Rainfall from that storm is expected to taper off on Friday afternoon, and the rain threat should end by the evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-02-03-westcoast" data-id="100000009967122" data-source-id="100000009967122"><div slug="2025-02-03-westcoast" data-sourceid="100000009967122" id="embed-id-100000009967122">
