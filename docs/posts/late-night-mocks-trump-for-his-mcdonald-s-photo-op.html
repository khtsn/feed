Citing news reports, he said the Trump appearance “was a half-hour photo op at a closed McDonald’s, and the people he served were preselected supporters.”</p><blockquote><p>“He’s not the common man. This is all just blue-collar drag. But with more makeup.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmi0W96qYWw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><blockquote><p>“Well, McDonald’s screwed up my order again!” — <em>SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“That’s his whole campaign right now: ‘Ave Maria’ dance party, ‘I’m going to deport everybody,’ football tailgate, blame the Jews if I lose, McDonald’s drive-through.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“Yeah, he had a great time at McDonald’s, ’cause for 20 minutes, Trump actually ran a successful business.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Trump told reporters, ‘I love McDonald’s. I love jobs. I like to see good jobs.’ Wow, I just realized, if you replace ‘I’ with ‘me,’ he has the same vocabulary as Cookie Monster: ‘Me love McDonald’s. Me love jobs.’” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“I love when he said ‘I’ve always wanted to work at McDonald’s’ with a straight face and expects us to believe it. Oh, do you? Well, no one’s stopping you, bro. I noticed you didn’t pick up an application on your way out. Maybe you can get a job jumping out of the ball pit and scaring away kids who have been there for too long.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“Give him the job. I implore you. I don’t care if his references don’t shake out. Save democracy, give him the job.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-747d26e3">The Punchiest Punchlines (Eggplant Emoji Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“While speaking over the weekend at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, former President Trump discussed golf legend Arnold Palmer and said he was ‘all man.’ Well, technically, he was half man, half iced tea.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“But for Trump, this was actually one of his milder genital rants. This was kind of his Kidz Bop genitals rant: classy, body-positive, he was complimenting somebody else. I don’t know why we have to parse everything that this guy says so sternly.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“I think one of his staffers must have said, ‘We need to focus on the polls,’ and Trump was, like, ‘Oh, I’ll focus on the pole.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“Afterwards, you could donate $10 to Trump’s campaign by texting the eggplant emoji.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Right after, McDonald’s was, like, ‘We’re sorry, but you’re fired. It’s a family restaurant.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Harris’s running mate, Gov.
