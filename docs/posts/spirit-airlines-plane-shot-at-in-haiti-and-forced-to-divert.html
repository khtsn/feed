Spirit suspended flights to Port-au-Prince and to the northern Haitian city Cap-Haïtien. The plane was taken out of service.</p><p>The crew on the JetBlue plane, Flight 935, did not initially report any issues, the airline said, but an inspection later found that a bullet had hit the plane’s exterior. JetBlue said it was suspending all flights to and from Haiti through Dec. 2 and investigating the episode.</p><p>Flight monitoring websites showed a JetBlue plane turning around and heading away from Haiti, as the Port-au-Prince airport was quickly shut down.</p><p>The gunfire that struck the Spirit Airlines plane appeared to come from the ground, though it was unclear who fired the shots. Gangs that have inflicted a campaign of violence in Haiti are also known to be active in the area around the airport in Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Videos circulating on social media showed the interior of a plane with what appeared to be several bullet holes, including in an overhead compartment and a panel.

One gang attacked a community in the rural Artibonite Valley last month, killing more than 100 people.</p><p>Godfrey Otunge, the Kenyan police official who is commander of the multinational force, said in a statement that the force was still in the deployment phase and was transitioning to the “decisive operations phase.”</p><p>Last week, statements by the multinational force stressed that officers had brought peace back to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/americas/haiti-gang-massacre-pont-sonde.html" title="">Pont-Sondé,</a> where the massacre in the valley occurred, and had made important strides, such as opening up roads that had been under gang control.</p><p>The deployment “shall strive to ensure that for once local Haitians will enjoy their Christmas festivities in peace,” one recent statement said, adding that it was putting gang members on notice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We are coming for them,” the statement said. “We will smoke them from their enclaves and hide-outs and ensure that they face the rule of law. Their time is simply running out.”</p><p>As a result of Monday’s plane episode, the president of the Dominican Republic, Luis Abinader, urged U.S. and Haitian authorities to officially designate Haitian gangs as terrorist organizations.</p><p>“The Dominican Republic treats and will treat them like terrorists,” Mr. Abinader said during his weekly news conference, noting that the flight was hit seven or eight times.</p><p>“It’s a terrorist act.”</p><p>David C.
