Its sharp drop wasn’t mainly because of economic jitters. Traders seemed to be reacting to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-03/nvidia-gets-doj-subpoena-in-escalating-antitrust-investigation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report by Bloomberg</a> that the Justice Department sent the company a subpoena as part of an investigation into whether it violated antitrust laws.</p><p>Looking slightly more broadly at Tuesday’s bad day, more than half of the S&amp;P 500’s decline was accounted for by eight tech stocks. Aside from Nvidia, they were Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms (the parent of Facebook), Broadcom, and two classes of shares in Alphabet (the parent of Google).</p><p>The “stocks fell” story about Tuesday is complicated by the performance of Berkshire Hathaway, among the 10 most valuable companies in the S&amp;P 500. Its shares bucked the trend and rose fractionally (0.2 percent). Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s company, does own a lot of Apple stock, but otherwise, it’s light on tech. Its holdings include Geico and Burlington Northern.</p><p>There are legitimate reasons to worry that economic weakness will hurt corporate profits and cause stock prices to fall from their elevated valuations. But that doesn’t seem to be primarily what happened on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RlY2Y3Yzc3LWViMGYtNWI1Ny05MDY3LTRlNjdmYzQ3YzZiYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/03/opinion/thepoint#far-right-elections-germany" data-source-id="100000009672306"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/serge-schmemann"><img alt="Serge Schmemann" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-04T09:03:40.988Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 4, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protest against far-right extremism in August in Leipzig, Germany.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jens Schlueter/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Historical memory is bound to shape the first reaction to the powerful showing of a far-right party in two German state elections on Sunday. Nonetheless, there is nothing specifically German in the appeal of populism and extremism, especially among populations confused and threatened by a complex, unstable and vaguely threatening world. It’s endemic in the former Soviet satellites, but familiar, too, in the most venerable democracies.</p><p>It was populism and extremism that won in Sunday’s elections in the neighboring states of Thuringia and Saxony, both in what was formerly East Germany. The Alternative for Germany (AfD), an anti-immigrant, anti-Islam, anti-European Union party that has been formally branded extremist in both states, came in first in Thuringia and second in Saxony, while a strange left-conservative populist hybrid, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, known by its German initials, B.S.W., and named after the former Communist who formed it a few months ago, came in third in both.</p><p>That raises some problems, and many questions.</p><p>The immediate problem will be how to form governments in the two states. B.S.W., like every other party, has declared that it will not join in any coalition with AfD, so the center-right Christian Democratic Union, the only mainstream party to make a respectable showing in either state, will probably have to try to form coalition governments with B.S.W. and other left-wing parties. It won’t be easy.</p><p>One immediate question is what the results might mean for Germany’s critical support for Ukraine. Though at opposite ends of the political spectrum, AfD and B.S.W. have almost indistinguishable positions on the resentments they feed on, including immigration and Ukraine. Both are friendly to Russia and against supporting Ukraine. German foreign policy is shaped by the federal government, which is not likely to reduce Germany’s military or political support for Ukraine anytime soon. But a signal has been sent.</p><p>The rapid rise of the AfD in eastern Germany also raises inevitable anxieties born of history: Is Nazism coming back? The leader of the AfD, Björn Höcke, has not helped with his repeated use of Nazi rhetoric in his speeches, and many Germans have demanded that AfD be banned.</p><p>Another question, though, is whether extremism and populism are unique to Germany. Many former East European populations — those of Poland and Hungary come to mind — still nurture a resentment over the perception that they are somehow second-class members of Western society, that their way of life is threatened by alien social norms imposed by a distant European Union and by alien immigrants. And populism is hardly unfamiliar in Western democracies like France, Britain, and thanks to the MAGA movement, the United States.</p><p>In eastern Germany, that sense is intensified by the fact that the West is the same country. Thuringia was one of the states most devastated by the collapse of industries that followed the reunification of Germany, and though its economy has rebounded somewhat, it still suffers from a westward exodus, especially of young women. The AfD party successfully targeted young men with messages like: “Real men stand on the far right. Real men are patriots. That’s the way to find a girlfriend!”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2U3NjlkNTEzLWE5ZGItNTJiZi05OWJjLWVmOWI2MzY0OTFkNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/03/opinion/thepoint#trump-harris-bidenomics-misleading" data-source-id="100000009671828"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-03T20:33:40.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 3, 2024, 4:33 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>A new TV ad from Donald Trump’s campaign shows how desperate he is to tie Kamala Harris to President Biden’s economic policies, and how far he is willing to stretch the truth to make that point to voters who just aren’t buying it.</p><p>The ad, titled “The Debate We’ve All Been Waiting For: Harris vs. Harris,” shows Harris talking on a TV screen about high prices.</p><p>“Everyday prices are too high,” she says. “Food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes.”</p><p>Then, on another TV screen beside the first one, she says, “That’s called Bidenomics.”</p><p>This goes on a few times, with Harris talking about the price of ground beef and housing, skillfully edited with a clip of her saying, “Bidenomics is working,” as if part of the same sentence.</p><div><div><blockquote data-cards=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FLASH: Multiple presidential campaign ads have run nationally on ABC during Clemson-Georgia so far including this Trump campaign spot -- <a href="https://t.co/ppChtCkjwq">pic.twitter.com/ppChtCkjwq</a></p>— Medium Buying (@MediumBuying) <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/1829928909594640891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote>

</div></div><p>But of course these remarks were not made at the same event, or even in the same year. She was talking about the high prices caused by the pandemic <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/08/16/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-a-campaign-event-in-raleigh-nc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at an event last month in Raleigh, N.C.</a>, where she acknowledged the financial pressure of inflation on middle-class families and unveiled an economic plan to address it.</p><p>The clips about Bidenomics were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWeZQYV7NI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from a speech in Washington</a> in August of 2023, where she was promoting the good news from the monthly jobs report that had come out that day. The full context of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/08/04/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-highlighting-the-impacts-of-bidenomics-and-announcing-increasing-support-for-small-businesses/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">her remarks</a>:</p><blockquote><p>And as today’s jobs numbers make clear: Bidenomics is working. Last month, we created 187,000 new jobs. That means today — yeah, go ahead and clap. I don’t want to step on the applause. That means, today, 187,000 more Americans are able to go to work, to provide for their family and invest in their future. Today’s numbers reflect the point that President Biden has made many times: America’s economy is strong and experiencing stable and steady growth. In fact, since we took office, we have created more than 13 million new jobs. In two and a half years, we have created more jobs — more new jobs than any other administration has created in four.</p></blockquote><p>Harris, now running her own campaign, won’t be using the word Bidenomics anymore; it will be uttered only by Republicans, trying to blame her for the post-pandemic rise in prices. That hasn’t been very successful so far. As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/18/harris-trump-post-abc-ipsos-poll/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent Washington Post poll shows</a>, only about a third of Americans believe she had significant influence on Biden’s economic policies.</p><p>But Republicans won’t be mentioning the 15 million jobs created during the Biden administration, the robust stock market or the dwindling remains of inflation. Instead, following the standard Trump method, they will just issue a series of misleading, distorted ads.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FjMTIzMGQ4LWUzNjMtNTcyMC04ZWE0LTQ1NDljZjU3NTA5NQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/03/opinion/thepoint#tipsheet-trump-harris-project2025" data-source-id="100000009669992"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-miller"><img alt="Katherine Miller" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-03T09:03:27.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 3, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p>Opinion Writer and Editor</p></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>During the convention, the Project 2025 handbook was treated almost as a joke by the comedian Kenan Thompson and others.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caroline Brehman/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Every week on The Point, we kick things off with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign.

Tim Walz will be in Pennsylvania on Wednesday and Thursday. After a fairly busy Labor Day weekend, Kamala Harris’s plans are so far light for the week — but presumably both she and Trump will be prepping for next week’s debate.</p></li><li><p>On Thursday, Judge Tanya Chutkan will hold a status hearing in the federal Jan. 6 case, in which Trump is still charged with four felony counts, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/us/politics/trump-election-case-immunity.html" title="">a variety of filings</a> from both Trump’s team and prosecutors last week. We might find out more about what, if anything, will happen with the case before the election.</p></li><li><p>Just to give you a sense of how soon the election is in a world of absentee and early voting: In North Carolina, officials will <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/news/events/absentee-ballots-begin-mailing-out-2024-general-election" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">begin</a> mailing absentee ballots on Friday. That’s basically the earliest that happens, but over the next few weeks, more and more states will mail out absentee ballots or open early-voting locations.</p></li><li><p>One thing, tonally, that came up during the Democratic convention was the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/08/21/obamas-dnc-attack-trump-column-00175334" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shift</a> toward more jokes about Trump versus the very solemn and dark approach often taken by President Biden. That sometimes created jarring swings in tones, particularly during the nightly segments on Project 2025, which often were delivered pretty ironically. A specific policy agenda like Project 2025 can be either a serious problem or an object of joking derision for critics, but it’s harder for it to be both at the same time from the same person. On television, however, the Harris campaign is running <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/1829135607542775837" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a dark, non-joking ad</a> about Project 2025 with a vintage voice-over that feels like something from the 1990s or 2000s.</p></li></ul><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rkuOOfpDyWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><ul><li><p>As we get closer to the election, it can be hard to keep up with what to read.

Remember Franklin Roosevelt’s dog Fala? No? Well, it was a while ago. President Biden is a big dog lover, but his pets were exiled to Delaware after multiple biting episodes. Jill Biden brought in a cat to fill the void.</p><p>Kamala Harris has been photographed cuddling puppies, but if there’s going to be any Republican animal stories during the campaign this fall, chances are they’re going to be sort of unpleasant. Donald Trump doesn’t like animals — naturally, since they draw attention from him. And now he’s got a new supporter who’s famous for his run-ins with their corpses.</p><p>Yeah, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once allegedly chain-sawed the head off a dead whale on a beach, bungee-corded it to the roof of his car and drove it five hours to the family home. Some years ago, Kennedy’s daughter Kick Kennedy called the episode “the rankest thing on the planet.”</p><p>People, does that remind you of anything? Back when Mitt Romney was running against Barack Obama, his son once told the story about a family vacation in which Romney put Seamus, their pet Irish setter, in a roof crate for a 12-hour drive to Canada. Apparently, Seamus weathered the trip fine, but the presidential campaign in 2012 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/21/opinion/gail-collins-mitt-romney.html" title="">was very boring</a>. As a diversion, I decided to try to see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/opinion/collins-dogging-mitt-romney.html" title="">how many times</a> I could mention the story before Election Day. Diligent readers counted around 80 mentions.</p><p>How would you compare the whale incident with that? Does it make you miss Romney? Yes, he was boring, but we’ve certainly learned how much worse a candidate can be. Don’t forget: Kennedy also dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park. His explanation was that he’d found it on the side of a road and decided to take it home to refrigerate its meat. Then, upon realizing that he was late to a steakhouse dinner, he changed his mind and left the carcass in the park, creating a stir he called “amusing.”</p><p>Kennedy, you may remember, says he once suffered from memory issues <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/rfk-jr-brain-health-memory-loss.html" title="">because of a dead worm</a> in his brain. He’s now supporting Trump for president, and Trump might even consider giving an administration job to his new pal.</p><p>No further comments seem necessary.

He’s fixated on this place.</p><p>For good reason. North Carolina has 16 Electoral College votes — the same as Georgia, one more than Michigan and only one fewer than Ohio. And they appear to be in play. On Tuesday, the Cook Political Report moved North Carolina <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/north-carolina-moves-toss-minnesota-and-new-hampshire-shift" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">into the tossup category</a>.</p><p>The state hasn’t voted Democratic in a presidential election since 2008, when Barack Obama won, but Joe Biden lost here in 2020 by only about 75,000 votes, or under 1.4 percentage points.</p><p>And 2024 is different. Political analysts here tell me that they’re struck by the burst of energy for the Harris campaign and its significant investment in the state, where, according to the Pew Research Center, about 23 percent of eligible voters are Black, in contrast to 14 percent nationally. They haven’t seen anything like it since 2008.</p><p>Additionally, Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C., noted that in the Republican presidential primary here, Nikki Haley received hefty percentages of the votes in urban counties even though her campaign by then was a lost cause. That suggests a potent anti-Trump sentiment among moderate Republicans and independents.</p><p>There’s yet another distinctive dynamic this time around. The slate of Republican candidates for statewide office is MAGA fury through and through. Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, is a firebrand with a history of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/opinion/north-carolina-governor-robinson.html" title="">misogynistic, homophobic, antisemitic and altogether deranged remarks</a>. Michele Morrow, the Republican nominee for superintendent of public instruction, has suggested that Cooper, Biden, Obama, Hillary Clinton and Anthony Fauci should <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/14/politics/kfile-gop-nominee-north-carolina-public-schools-michele-morrow-executing-democrats/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">be executed for treason</a> — and that Obama’s killing should be televised.</p><p>Asher Hildebrand, a fellow professor at Duke University’s School of Public Policy, said that while that extremism probably won’t “push too many voters to the polls for Harris, it very well might keep some Trump voters home.”</p><p>And in an election potentially decided by one measly percentage point, such disaffection absolutely could turn North Carolina blue.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
