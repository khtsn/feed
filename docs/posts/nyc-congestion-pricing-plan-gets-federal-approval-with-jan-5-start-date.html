</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But even as long-suffering supporters of congestion pricing celebrate, the tolling plan could still be upended. The program is in jeopardy of being blocked by a volley of lawsuits and an incoming president who has called it “the most regressive tax known to womankind.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A central goal of the program is to raise $15 billion in financing for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to pay for the modernizing of the city’s mass transit system. The busiest transit network in North America still depends on some equipment that dates back to before World War II and it needs billions of dollars to install elevators and escalators, repair crumbling tracks and boost service, among other improvements.</p><p>To make the unpopular plan more palatable, Gov. Kathy Hochul has reduced the costs of the tolls, after first placing congestion pricing in limbo with a pause just weeks before its original start date in June.</p><p>Ms. Hochul said at the time that she was concerned the plan would be too much of an economic burden on New Yorkers. Some critics of the governor questioned whether the suspension was also meant to shield Democrats at the ballot box from any possible fallout from the start of the plan.</p><p><a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SNY-April-2024-Poll-Release-FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A Siena College survey conducted in April</a> revealed that about two-thirds of New York State residents said they opposed the program.</p><p>Earlier this month Ms. Hochul announced a 40 percent reduction in the tolls, lowering the peak period fee for most drivers from $15 to $9. Drivers will be charged when they enter Manhattan south of 60th Street.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Now there are questions about whether the toll reductions have won congestion pricing any more support among New Yorkers and if the more modest fees will allow the M.T.A. to reach its funding goals. The revised plan, set to start Jan. 5, is expected to generate hundreds of millions less than the initial proposal.</p><p>A spokesman for Ms. Hochul said her plan to make congestion pricing more affordable would still allow the M.T.A. to complete all the improvements listed in its capital plan.</p><p>On Friday, the Federal Highway Administration gave the final approval to Ms. Hochul’s version of the plan and pushed it past its last bureaucratic hurdle.</p><p>“This is an exciting moment,” said Janno Lieber, the chief executive of the M.T.A., which will implement the plan. “Everybody knows this has been a long journey getting to this point.”</p><p>Under the latest plan, transit officials will gradually raise the fee to the original price, bringing it up to $12 after three years, and then to $15 by 2031. The first plan was projected to yield roughly $1 billion annually. The new plan will generate only about $500 million per year during its first three years, according to transit officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Officials in the governor’s office and the M.T.A. have said that the revised plan will still allow the transit agency to leverage the toll revenue as backing for $15 billion in bonds. Some finance experts have cautioned that the transit authority, which has a history of grappling with surging debt, may see its borrowing costs rise as it tinkers with the financing terms. They also believe the authority will slow down projects because of the toll reductions.</p><p>In the 1950s, the idea of congestion pricing was first introduced in New York City by <a href="https://econ.columbia.edu/faculty/in-memoriam/william-vickrey-1914-1996/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William Vickrey</a>, an economist at Columbia University, as a way to discourage vehicles from packing onto crowded roads. Even then, elected officials considered it a hard sell, in part because some commuters either had no choice or preferred to drive into Manhattan.</p><p>“I’m still biting my nails. I’m still nervous,” said Samuel I. Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner and longtime congestion-pricing supporter. “I’ve seen acts of Congress, I have seen lawsuits, I’ve seen politicians kill it in the past. All three of those are still active.”</p><p>New York State legislators voted congestion pricing into law in 2019 after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo helped push it through. A series of breakdowns in the city’s subway system during the so-called Summer of Hell in 2017 helped make the case. </p><p>In other international cities, similar tolling programs have also been deeply disliked by residents as motorists grew accustomed to the new costs. Yet, following those growing pains, the programs have been widely considered effective in reducing vehicle congestion and cutting pollution while raising funds for public coffers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Experts have said that the outcome of New York’s tolling plan will serve as either a blueprint or a cautionary tale for other American cities with similar transit goals.</p><p>“While an adjustment period is inevitable, the long-term benefits for urban mobility, air quality and climate resilience are substantial and will be felt by current and future generations,” Jimena González-Ramírez, a professor specializing in environmental economics at Manhattan University, wrote in an email. “This policy positions N.Y.C. as a potential leader.”</p><p>Public officials have been racing to complete the comeback of congestion pricing in the weeks before its most powerful detractor, Donald J. Trump, takes office.</p><p>The president-elect is opposed to the tolling plan, saying that the added costs could keep tourists away from Manhattan and hurt businesses. He has vowed to undo the plan as one of his first acts in office, though his options are limited now that the federal government has signed off.</p><p>Additionally, at least nine lawsuits threaten the plan, including some filed by the State of New Jersey, an influential teachers’ union and a coalition of New York City residents. One group of opponents escalated its efforts last week by requesting an injunction to block the program from advancing.</p><p>“This new congestion pricing plan is still bad for the economy, will still cause supply chain disruptions and will still raise the price of goods upon which households across the five boroughs and its surrounding suburbs rely,” Kendra Hems, the president of the Trucking Association of New York, said in a prepared statement. “The Trucking Association of New York will continue using every tool at our disposal to fight this plan.”</p><p>Wesley Parnell<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Ley is a Times reporter covering New York City’s mass transit system and the millions of passengers who use it.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-ley">More about Ana Ley</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>22</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>New York City Plans to Charge Drivers $9 Congestion Toll Beginning on Jan. 5<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
