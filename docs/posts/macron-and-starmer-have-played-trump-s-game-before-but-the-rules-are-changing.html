    <h1>Macron and Starmer Have Played Trump’s Game Before, but the Rules Are Changing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When the leaders of France and Britain meet President Trump at the White House this week, they can draw on a well-worn playbook for dealing with their mercurial host. But it is not clear that the old tricks will be enough to meet the new challenge.</p><p>After a week in which Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-trump-russia-war.html" title="">branded President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine as a dictator</a>, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain are no longer merely navigating a norm-busting president with a distaste for multilateral institutions and decorous diplomacy.</p><p>They are also trying to salvage a trans-Atlantic alliance that has fallen into existential crisis.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s hostile statements, coupled with his overture to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to go over Europe’s head to strike a peace settlement in Ukraine, have left some Europeans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/trump-russia-putin.html" title="">wondering whether the alliance that protected the continent for more than seven decades is already defunct</a>.</p><p>So inviting Mr. Trump to a French military parade, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/world/europe/trump-macron-frendship-france-bastille-day-parade.html" title="">Mr. Macron did on Bastille Day 2017</a>, or to a lavish banquet at Buckingham Palace, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/world/europe/royal-family-donald-trump.html" title="">Queen Elizabeth II of Britain did in June 2019</a>, might not be sufficient to get things back on track.</p></div></div>
