and Keith Budke, married 43 years, are migratory beekeepers. They produce honey with the taste of canola nectar, sweet clover and other flowers that their bees pollinate first in North Dakota, then in Texas, after being hauled there by truck, and eventually in California — if the bees make it that far and if nobody snatches them.</p><p>This season, the chances of the bees making it to California were much lower. Honeybee colonies are under siege across much of North America. And the Budkes, owners and operators of Budke Bees, a small commercial beekeeping business, know it all too well. Parasites, loss of habitat, climate change and pesticides threaten to wipe out as much as 70 percent or more of the nation’s honeybee colonies this year, potentially the most devastating loss that the nation has ever seen.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“There is a shortage of bees across the entire world,” Ms. Budke said. “It’s a crazy life that we lead because we’re trying to fight so many different battles.”</p><p>At the start of their annual migratory journey last August, the Budkes had 2,900 hives. Larger operations manage 10 times as many. But the challenges faced by the Budkes in getting their bees to the plains of Texas, and then to the almond groves of California, mirror those of virtually all beekeepers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Keith Budke, now 70, has been a beekeeper since he was a teenager.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>He and his wife, Nancy, start their annual bee-hauling journey in North Dakota.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Budke, who is also a registered nurse, nurtures the millions of tiny insects with the care of a loving pet owner, inoculating them against viruses and pests and making sure they have enough to eat. </p><p>Healthy bees mean healthy people and a healthy climate.

They socked away their extra cash.</p><p>“About a year later, I wrote him out a check for his Christmas present of $30,000,” Ms. Budke said. “We saved up that much money, and I handed it to him and said, ‘There you go. Now you can be your own beekeeper.’” The initial 40 hives the couple bought in the late 1970s have grown to about 3,000. Since the major national colony collapse almost 20 years ago, Ms. Budke said, it seemed every three or four years they suffered massive losses of bees.</p><p>Last year, in August, looking over their hives in the weeks before heading from North Dakota to Texas, the Budkes appeared optimistic about the potential of a big payday in California.

The Environmental Protection Agency believes the pests played a role in a major colony collapse in late 2006, when large numbers of bees unexpectedly disappeared.</p><p>“If you go as a colony into winter time with high varroa mite loads, those colonies usually don’t survive,” said Ms. Niño, the University of California, Davis professor. “It is difficult to keep the colonies healthy and strong.”</p><p>Things looked good before the Budkes left their bees to hang out in Texas, returning to Minnesota for Christmas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>But weeks later, beekeepers across the country began reporting massive beehive collapses.

U.S.D.A. Agricultural Research Service scientists are working closely with federal partners, stakeholders, and impacted parties to identify the source of this agricultural challenge.”</p><p>But for now, the agency will have to do its work with fewer researchers.</p><p>John Ternest, a scientist who studied pollinator health at the U.S.D.A.’s Agricultural Research Service until he was fired in February, said about 15 people involved in bee research lost their jobs at the Agricultural Research Service.</p><p>Stakeholders in the beekeeping industry are concerned that the cuts could affect investigations into the bee losses. Scientists from the U.S.D.A. collected samples of live bees in California in January to examine them for pathogens, parasites and viruses.</p><p>The timing of the colony collapses couldn’t have been worse. “We have so many crops that are going into bloom and rely on pollination right when all of this was happening — the firings, the crisis of honeybees,” Dr. Ternest said. “What kind of trickle-down effect does that have on, of course, the farmers, but potentially even things like food prices?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-47"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andrew Beld, a commercial bee broker in California, collects hives from various almond groves around California’s Central Valley.
