</span> in the first round of the upper bracket. Starting on Pearl, both teams had slight variations of a similar composition, with Trace opting for a double duelist using Neon and Yoru while DRG ran the double initiator with Fade and KAY/O. DRG&#39;s defense side struggled against the explosiveness of <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4770/fengf">
		FengF	</a>
</span> on Yoru and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/37494/kai">
		Kai	</a>
</span> on Neon, and some smart thinking from Trace snuck a pistol win out of a tough situation.</p>


<p><em>Trace sneaks a post-plant defuse with some good teamwork.</em></p>

<p>Despite losing that pistol round, DRG fought back thanks to big plays from both <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7841/tvirusluke">
		TvirusLuke	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11524/nicc">
		Nicc	</a>
</span> before Trace secured the map 13-8 thanks to an early collateral from FengF with the Operator.</p>

<p>The teams then went into Abyss with a similar situation to the previous map, as both teams ran similar teams with one key difference. Trace opted for the more defensive composition using Cypher this time, while DRG ran the more traditional double smokes composition. <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3021/biank">
		Biank	</a>
</span> started hot on the attack half, as his Guardian skills helped convert a bonus round. The half was all Trace, as <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3045/luok1ng">
		LuoK1ng	</a>
</span> and Kai took sites with confidence to lead 9-3.</p>

<p>DRG won the pistol round to start a potential comeback, and Nicc cleaned up on DRG&#39;s anti-eco. Yet, LuoK1ng was in his element on the retake, hitting some clean shots to not only stop his opponent&#39;s momentum but to secure the map 13-7 and a series sweep.</p>

<p>With this win, Trace secured a spot in the upper semis, facing off against the winner of the next game of the day for a chance at qualifying for Masters Bangkok. As for DRG, their path continues in the lower bracket against <span data-ref-id="11">

<p>Starting the game with flair, EDG began their debut for the 2025 season with <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13768/s1mon">
		S1Mon	</a>
</span> playing new agent Tejo on Split, while Nova decided to throw unique picks in Vyse and Deadlock. EDG won the pistol round but lost their anti-eco soon after. The rounds started a bit back and forth, with EDG shaking off some rust while Nova won some impressive rounds. S1mon showed off the fragging potential of Tejo, as EDG entered the half up 7-5.</p>

<p>Just like the previous half, EDG won pistol and struggled on their anti-eco, but managed to secure the round on the second attempt. <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> was getting a lot of value off his teammate&#39;s utility, especially the near impeccable Tejo play from S1mon, as the lead widened. After converting a round down 2v4 just after, EDG held off Nova and took the map 13-8, also getting Tejo his first map win in the region.</p>


<p><em>ZmjjKK completes a four-piece thanks to S1mon on Tejo.</em></p>

<p>Fracture was next, with both teams running Neon and Breach, but Nova decided to add Raze and Cypher while EDG selected Fade and Killjoy. Switching from Tejo to Breach, S1mon continued his strong form to help EDG win pistol and not only get EDG&#39;s first clean anti-eco win of the day but their first bonus round win. Up 6-0, EDG started to wane as Nova fought back, notably off the Operator play of <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/39697/cb">
		CB	</a>
</span>. Just as quickly as it looked like Nova could end the half even, EDG caught fire and was up 9-3.</p>

<p><span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span> had a hero round to win EDG&#39;s fourth straight pistol round, and that extended the lead to 11-3. It looked to be in the bag for EDG, but Nova won seven rounds in a row thanks to a great run from <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1209/swerl">
		SWERL	</a>
</span> on Raze. Just about to lose their lead, S1mon got three from a desperate position on site to get EDG up to 12, then <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span> had a highlight reel ace in a similar situation. EDG wiped the sweat off their brow as they won the map 13-10 and swept the series to reach the upper semis of Kickoff. </p>
