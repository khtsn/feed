In fact, it has skyrocketed through China’s tech world in recent years with a path that was anything but conventional.</p><p>Its mission to pursue research mirrors that of companies like OpenAI, the Silicon Valley firm that marked an American signature over A.I. in the fall of 2022. But the similarities mostly end there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>DeepSeek’s origins are in finance, not technology for technology’s sake. Its parent company, a Chinese hedge fund called High-Flyer, began not as a laboratory devoted to safeguarding humanity from A.I. like Open AI, but as a business using A.I. to make bets in the Chinese stock market.</p><p>High-Flyer had thrived by capitalizing on a market dominated by China’s retail investors, who are known for jumping in and out of stocks impulsively. In 2021, High-Flyer found itself pressured by regulatory crackdowns in China on speculative trading, which the authorities in Beijing felt was at odds with their attempts to keep markets calm.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
