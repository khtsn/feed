In all, European officials have said they expect to put tariffs on up to 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of exports.</p><p>But Europe’s plan has met with a firm response from Washington, and European officials have been told that negotiations to avert tariffs will not begin in earnest until April, according to the bloc’s trade commissioner.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump has threatened to impose a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-tariff-european-union-whiskey.html" title="">crushing 200 percent tariff</a> on European champagne, wine and other alcohol in response to Europe’s measures, and some European leaders from wine-producing nations have since criticized the planned E.U. response. Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister, has warned against a “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/34ca185a-1060-4502-9812-909d4d02df1b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vicious circle</a>” of trade measures, and François Bayrou, the prime minister of France, has said Europe was at risk of “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-prime-minister-eu-tariffs-us-trade-war-american-products/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hitting the wrong targets</a>.”</p><p>The goal in delaying the first wave of European countertariffs is to “strike the right balance of products, taking into account the interests of E.U. producers, exporters and consumers,” while also remaining open to a dialogue with the U.S., Mr. Gill said on Thursday.</p><p>Maros Sefcovic, the E.U.’s trade commissioner, said <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_25_840" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a speech</a> in Brussels on Thursday that Europeans believed the U.S. planned to impose additional tariffs on April 2, and that Trump administration officials did not want to negotiate until after those were announced.</p><p>“Only then may partners be able to engage on possible negotiations,” he said, adding that the E.U. would be flexible in trying to respond to the new measures.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>New Tariff ‘Number’</strong><strong>:</strong> The Trump administration plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-tariffs.html">confront countries around the world with a reciprocal tariff “number” on April 2</a>, a figure that will reflect what the White House considers the cost of foreign trade barriers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Boeing and the Aerospace Industry:</strong> Companies in the industry are big exporters but also very reliant on a global supply chain, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/business/boeing-trump-tariffs.html">making them vulnerable</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unsettled Farmers:</strong> When the U.S. trade representative asked for examples of unfair trade, agriculture interests had plenty, but also politely warned about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/business/trump-tariffs-farmers-agriculture.html">what a trade war could do to them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>What Oil Executives Want:</strong> Some executives in the industry, which spent more than $75 million to help elect President Trump, are increasingly frustrated with his agenda. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/business/energy-environment/oil-executives-trump-tariffs.html">Here are some of the industry’s priorities</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>France’s Champagne Region:</strong> Merchants in the region worried that a trade war <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/business/france-champagne-wine-tariffs-trump.html">could wreak financial havoc</a> in an area where producers do nearly a billion dollars’ worth of business with the United States every year.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
