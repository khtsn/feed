    <h1>An Entertainment Tax</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Hollywood recently got the Trump tariff treatment. On Sunday, the president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/movies/tariffs-trump-voight.html" title="">announced</a> a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside America. Filmmakers said the move would hurt U.S. filmmaking. Shares for Netflix and other entertainment companies fell. The next day, the White House said no tariff would take effect.</p><p>We’ve seen this before for other sectors of the economy. But why would President Trump think Hollywood could benefit from more protectionism? Today’s newsletter looks at the headwinds the industry faces.</p><h2 id="link-5d27d730">Hollywood’s problems</h2><p>When Trump talks tariffs, he typically speaks about manufacturing. He invokes American industries that have fallen from grace — steel, coal, cars — and the physical goods that they once made for the world. He complains that the United States imports more goods than it exports, leading to a trade deficit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On set in Montana. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Janie Osborne for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Hollywood doesn’t fit that description. It remains the world’s dominant moviemaking industry. American film exports are three times as high as imports, according to the Motion Picture Association. Movies are also a service; the product is entertainment, not a physical good. And unlike with goods, the United States has a nearly $300 billion trade <em>surplus</em> with services.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Still, Hollywood has problems. For one, fewer movies are made in Los Angeles nowadays. Filming has moved to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/movies/hollywood-filming-overseas.html" title="">other states and, increasingly, overseas</a>. Other countries offer cheaper labor and tax credits for filmmakers. This has erased jobs once held by Americans. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Trump posted online.</p><h2 id="link-9a94602">Other fixes</h2><p>Tariffs, however, are a messy solution to Hollywood’s problems.</p><p>A levy on a Chinese-made phone is simply applied to the value of that product. But what would a tariff on movies look like? Would it apply to the production costs? Box office earnings? Would it depend on how much of a movie is filmed and edited abroad? What about movies — think of “James Bond” or “Harry Potter” — that require overseas filming? Would the toll apply to TV shows? Filmmakers say that a 100 percent tariff will force them to halt production altogether.</p><p>Tariffs could also backfire. Other countries could put their own levies on U.S. movies. That could hurt global ticket sales. Most studio revenue is now international, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/06/movie-tariffs-trump-studios" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Axios noted</a>.</p><p>The industry says it prefers a carrot instead of a stick: America could lure back moviemakers with its own tax credits. This is the approach that California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, backed on Monday when he called on Trump to support a $7.5 billion federal tax break for films made in America.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But that would cost money at a time when Congress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/republicans-trump-tax-cuts.html" title="">is already struggling</a> to find ways to pay for tax cuts the president wants. So Trump once again invoked tariffs as his favored fix.</p><h3 id="link-18ef2d4d"><span><strong>KASHMIR CLASH</strong></span></h3><p>Early yesterday morning, Indian planes struck Pakistan. The attack was retaliation against a neighbor and nemesis that, India claimed, aided in a terrorist attack last month that killed 26, mostly Hindu tourists. Pakistan, which denies involvement in the attack, said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/asia/india-pakistan-downed-aircraft.html" title="">downed five Indian planes</a> in response.</p><p><strong>What’s at stake?</strong></p><p>The terrorist operation targeted Kashmir, a region both countries have claimed since India and Pakistan became independent nations in 1947. Today, each controls only parts of Kashmir. A border of roughly 460 miles, known as the Line of Control, divides Indian and Pakistani territory. In 2019, India stripped Kashmir of the autonomy it had enjoyed under the country’s Constitution and opened the region for more tourism. Visitors surged in, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/world/asia/india-terrorist-attack-kashmir.html" title="">upsetting many Kashmiris</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: Pakistani military (strike locations) | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Could this conflict spiral?</strong></p><p>The two nations face off periodically over Kashmir. Over the decades, they’ve fought three wars and had innumerable skirmishes along their disputed border. Since both countries possess nuclear weapons, an escalation could get dangerously out of hand.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>How might it end?</strong></p><p>India may not want a war. Government officials described the airstrikes as “measured, nonescalatory, proportionate and responsible.” It’s less clear what Pakistan might do; officials there called the airstrikes an “unprovoked and blatant act of war” that violated the country’s sovereignty. Perhaps the latest tit-for-tat will satisfy both sides, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/asia/india-pakistan-conflict.html" title="">as some analysts expect</a>. But if each keeps responding, a wider conflict looms. The United States could end up playing mediator.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Pakistan’s defense minister said he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/pakistan-defense-minister-india.html" title="">welcomed U.S. efforts</a> to help defuse the conflict.

The gym TV was broadcasting live from the Vatican during the conclave that picked Pope Benedict. After she finished her run, Patrick, who works in sales in Atlanta, sat on the floor, transfixed, until white smoke emerged from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel. When it did, she “inexplicably burst into tears.” Patrick, 44, says she is now a devout Catholic. She has been praying for the church in the past week. “I’m already talking to Pope Francis and thanking him for everything,” she said.</p><p><strong>A reversion: </strong>Nick Woomer-Deters, a 45-year-old public defender in North Carolina, was a zealous atheist who swore he’d never go back to his Catholicism — until a few years ago, when he secretly started watching Father Mike Schmitz’s videos on YouTube while his wife slept. He began attending Mass, drawn by the “smells and bells,” he said — the robes, incense, hymns, liturgy. “It’s persisted for two millennia,” he said of the church. “I’m happy to be part of it.”</p><p><strong>A curiosity: </strong>Griffin Devine, 24, is a budget manager in Los Angeles who spends his day in spreadsheets. He identifies as agnostic but recently started attending Mass — inspired by friends from college and his girlfriend. He said the pope’s death made him feel connected to a global church. “Some see it as antiquated,” he said. “But I think it is very compelling and alluring.”</p><h2 id="link-7e950b24">In one map</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: The Vatican</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Pope Francis appointed about 80 percent of the cardinals who are sequestered to elect his successor.
