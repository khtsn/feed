Trump as a grave danger to the country.</p><p>“In our nation’s 248 year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Mr. Cheney, 83, said in a statement. After Mr. Trump’s actions trying to steal the 2020 presidential election and then using “lies and violence” to keep himself in power, Mr. Cheney said, “he can never be trusted with power again.”</p><p>The former vice president added: “We have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.”</p><p>Mr. Cheney released his statement after one of his daughters, former Representative Liz Cheney, the once high-ranking Republican from Wyoming who sacrificed her political career by breaking forcefully with Mr. Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, said this week that she would be voting for Ms. Harris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Friday during a panel discussion at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Ms. Cheney revealed that her father, an unapologetic partisan, would be, too.</p><p>“Dick Cheney will be voting for Kamala Harris,” Ms. Cheney said, a remarkable statement that the Cheneys themselves could not have foreseen making even four years ago. </p><p>Mr. Cheney served as White House chief of staff under President Gerald Ford; secretary of defense under President George H.W. Bush and vice president under President George W. Bush, when Mr. Cheney was the architect of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. He was viewed by Democrats as such a force of darkness that he earned the nickname Darth Vader.</p><p>His announcement on Friday was only the latest reflection of how profoundly the Republican Party has shifted since Mr. Cheney was in power. Back then, his brand of conservatism — which prioritized hawkishness on foreign policy, and an unapologetic allegiance to big business and the political establishment — defined the G.O.P. Mr. Trump’s rise has changed all that, pushing the party in a more isolationist and populist direction, making the establishment into a villain and unleashing a new coarseness that now dominates Republican politics. </p><p>But it was Mr. Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election results and his role in instigating the Jan. 6 riot that prompted the Cheneys to turn against him. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Cheney has previously called Mr. Trump a “threat to our republic” and a “coward” in an advertisement he starred in for his daughter’s final Republican primary, in 2022, which she lost by 37 points to a Trump-backed challenger.</p><p>Ms. Cheney on Friday tried to frame the joint family decision to vote for the Democratic presidential nominee as something beyond party, one that had to do with country and “duty.” And she lambasted Mr. Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, as a pair of “misogynistic pigs.” Ms. Cheney explicitly rejected the idea of not voting at all, as some conservative Republicans have signaled they plan to do.</p><p>Earlier this week, Pat Toomey, the former Republican senator from Pennsylvania, said he would not be supporting Mr. Trump in the fall. But, he said, he could not vote for Ms. Harris, either.</p><p>The show of support from both Cheneys is significant for the Harris campaign, which has been pouring tens of millions of dollars into a paid media campaign targeting anti-Trump Republicans. It potentially helps create a model for deeply conservative voters reluctant to back Mr. Trump to vote for a Democrat for the first time in their lives.</p><p>In her panel discussion with The Atlantic’s Mark Leibovich, Ms. Cheney said she would not be acting as an official surrogate of the Harris campaign and said she had not spoken with Ms. Harris since her announcement of support earlier this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Cheney also refused to entertain the speculation that she could be the Republican Ms. Harris has promised to appoint to her cabinet if she is elected.</p><p>“I am not focused on that,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.
