    <h1>Trump Loses Appeal of Carroll’s $5 Million Award in Sex-Abuse Case</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steven Cheung, Mr. Trump’s chief campaign spokesman, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/us/politics/steven-cheung-trump-white-house-communications.html" title="">who is set to be his White House communications director</a>, said Mr. Trump was re-elected with an “overwhelming mandate,” and he said the American people “demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the witch hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll hoax, which will continue to be appealed.”</p><p>Mr. Trump was represented in the appeal by D. John Sauer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/politics/trump-administration-cabinet-appointees.html" title="">his pick for U.S. solicitor general.</a></p><p>The ruling came as Mr. Trump prepares to take the presidency next month amid unceasing legal entanglements. This month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/nyregion/trump-juror-misconduct.html" title="">he accused a juror of misconduct</a> that he said should void a 34-count felony conviction in Manhattan. He also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/politics/trump-sues-des-moines-register.html" title="">sued The Des Moines Register</a> for running a poll that showed him trailing Vice President Kamala Harris. ABC News this month settled a defamation lawsuit brought by Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/business/media/trump-abc-settlement.html" title="">agreeing to pay $15 million</a>. </p><p>During the trial last year, Ms. Carroll testified that she had run into Mr. Trump at Bergdorf’s on Fifth Avenue and he asked her to help him buy a present for a female friend. Ms. Carroll testified that they wound up in the lingerie department, where he pulled her into a dressing room, shut the door and began assaulting her.</p><p>Ms. Carroll said he shoved her against a wall, pulled down her tights and inserted his fingers and then his penis into her vagina. She said she pushed him away and fled. Other than telling two friends, she kept the encounter secret until disclosing <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/president-donald-trump-faces-new-rape-accusation.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it in a 2019 book excerpt in New York magazine</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump did not testify at the trial but denied wrongdoing and claimed he had never met Ms. Carroll. He earned a rebuke from the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, when he posted on Truth Social that Ms. Carroll’s lawsuit was a scam and wrote that Ms. Carroll’s lawyer was a “political operative.” He also said that the dress Ms. Carroll wore at Bergdorf’s that day should be “allowed to be part of the case.”</p></div></div>
