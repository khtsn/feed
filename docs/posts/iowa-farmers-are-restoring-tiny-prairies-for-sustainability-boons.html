    <h1>Iowa Farmers Are Restoring Tiny Prairies for Sustainability Boons</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The little tracts of wilderness grow on Maple Edge Farm in southwest Iowa, where the Bakehouse family cultivates 700 acres of corn, soybeans and alfalfa. Set against uniform rows of cropland, the scraps of land look like tiny Edens, colorful and frowzy. Purple bergamot and yellow coneflowers sway alongside big bluestem and other grasses, alive with birdsong and bees.</p><p>The Bakehouses planted the strips of wild land after floodwaters reduced many fields to moonscapes three years ago, prompting the family to embark on a once-unthinkable path.</p><p>They took nearly 11 acres of their fields out of crop production, fragments of farmland that ran alongside fields and in gullies. Instead of crops, they sowed native flowering plants and grasses, all species that once filled the prairie.</p><p>The restored swaths of land are called prairie strips, and they are part of a growing movement to reduce the environmental harms of farming and help draw down greenhouse gas emissions, while giving fauna a much-needed boost and helping to restore the land.</p><p>As the little wildernesses grew, more and more meadowlarks, dickcissels, pheasants and quail showed up, along with beneficial insects. Underground, root networks formed to quietly perform heroic feats, filtering dangerous nutrient runoff from crops, keeping soil in place and bringing new health to the land.</p><p>“We’re thinking about our farm as a small piece of the overall good puzzle,” said Jon Bakehouse, on a visit to the family’s fields one sunny morning earlier this summer. “On a larger scale, we’re all in this together.”</p><p>The fertile soils of America’s vast prairies made the heartland ideal for growing crops. But today in Iowa, less than <a href="https://naturalresources.extension.iastate.edu/encyclopedia/prairie-restoration-habitat-headquarters#:~:text=Since%20European%20settlement%2C%20prairie%20land,on%20this%20habitat%20for%20survival." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">0.1 percent of original prairie</a> remains, scattered in fragments around the state.</p><p>Prairie strips are helping to reverse that loss, and are being adopted at an increasing clip. Researchers counted 586 acres of prairie strips on farmland across seven states in 2019. As of last year, they had spread to 14 states, filling 22,972 acres.</p><p>While the acreage accounts for a tiny fraction of the Midwest’s farm fields — Iowa alone has roughly 30 million acres of cropland — researchers said the strips had disproportionately positive impacts.</p><p>“There are a whole suite of dramatic environmental benefits that come with this small intervention,” said Lisa Schulte Moore, a professor of natural resource ecology and management at Iowa State University, and a founder of its prairie strips project. “If you put a bit of prairie back, it makes a big difference.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-1"><div><figcaption><span>Jon Bakehouse and his wife, Tina; a silver-spotted skipper; Lisa Schulte Moore, a founder of Iowa State University&#39;s prairie strips project.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>To be classified as a prairie strip, restored land must adjoin active cropland, reach a width of at least 30 feet and be sown with dozens of native plant species.</p><p>Researchers at Iowa State found that when prairie strips were planted in and around soy and corn fields, they acted as both “speed bumps and diapers,” Professor Schulte Moore said.</p><p>Soil erosion and surface runoff plummeted, as the prairie plants held soil in place and transpired water. Levels of nitrogen and phosphorus carried in surface runoff from adjacent cropland decreased by as much as 70 percent, absorbed instead by the prairie strips, resulting in less water contamination. The prairie strips created better conditions for helpful bacteria, resulting in dramatically lower levels of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas generated by chemical fertilizer, compared to cropland without prairie strips. The strips also drew twice as many native grassland birds and three times as many beneficial insects, compared to fields that had not been rewilded.</p><p>While the research did not show that prairie strips affected yields in adjacent cropland, tests found that the strips boosted the health and fertility of the soil where they were sown. “When people buy farms, they’re buying the soil,” Professor Schulte Moore said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The restored land also brought unexpected benefits for humans. Farmers who sowed prairie strips found themselves visiting them to decompress when they were having a bad day, the professor said. Children clamored to play or hunt in them and people stopped by to snip bouquets.</p><p>“The serenity that you get standing right in the middle of something like this that has so many diverse plants, animals and insects, that moment of calm and away from the busy world, for even just a few minutes, is so important,” said Jeanne-Marie Bakehouse, who farms along with her brother Jon.</p><p>Iowa has the most industrialized livestock farms in the country, and tens of millions of pounds of untreated manure that they produce end up fertilizing crops, along with synthetic fertilizer made from fossil fuels. The nitrogen-heavy runoff from agricultural fields threatens drinking water, and is a leading cause of an oxygen-starved dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico that kills marine plant and animal life.</p><p>In 2007, Professor Schulte Moore was part of a team at Iowa State University that began researching the ways in which restoring parts of the prairie could enrich soil, help insects and wildlife, and stanch emissions and fertilizer runoff. They went on to plant prairie strips on commercial farms and at some of the university’s test sites, and found that benefits were consistently achieved when 10 percent of a farm’s cropland is converted into prairie strips, with lower amounts still providing some boons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="An Iowa State University sign in a field that includes this text: “Strips: Science-Based Trials of Rowcrops Integrated With Prairie Strips.”" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf/OOCLI-PRAIRIE-STRIPS-05-cbmf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>To be classified as a prairie strip, restored land should adjoin active cropland, reach a width of at least 30 feet and be sown with dozens of native plant species.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Annick Sjobakken for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hills behind Resilient Farms near Red Oak, Iowa.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Annick Sjobakken for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The findings might have sat on a shelf, Professor Schulte Moore said, were it not for her department chair, who rewrote the professor’s job description so she could promote the idea to farmers.</p><p>In late 2018, the prairie strips initiative got perhaps its biggest boost when it was included in the federal Conservation Reserve Program. That meant that farmland owners who converted some of their acreage to prairie strips could collect money from the federal government. According to the Agriculture Department, the average payout for prairie strips is $209 per acre each year.</p><p>“That was monumental,” Professor Schulte Moore said. “It helped align hearts, heads and pocketbooks.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Still, federal payments for prairie strips can end up being less than revenue from livestock or crops. An analysis from Iowa State University found that even with government help, prairie strips generally cost farmers around $64 an acre a year, because of factors such as cost of conversion and taxes.</p><p>Professor Schulte Moore said prairie strips often offered better options than farming poor-quality land. At the Bakehouse farm in southwest Iowa, much of the acreage they converted into prairie strips had flooded earlier, making it difficult to farm. While prairie strips require maintenance such as mowing and weeding in the early years, and, later on, controlled burns, they need far less work and attention than soy or corn.</p><p>“I was a little worried; I thought, do we need the income from our row crops?” said Nancy Bakehouse, Jon and Jeanne-Marie’s mother. “The more I looked into it, I thought this is absolutely the thing to do for encouraging the insects and the wildlife, and for saving the water.”</p><p>Still, prairie strips alone cannot solve all the environmental and economic challenges facing Midwestern farmers. Professor Schulte Moore and her team are looking into ways the strips might generate income through honey production, harvesting prairie grasses for bioenergy or livestock bedding and carbon credits. Other possibilities include paying farmers for keeping nitrogen and phosphorus out of the water through the strips, reducing the need for expensive wastewater treatment facilities to filter nutrients downstream.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-12"><div><figcaption><span>Maggie McQuown; a barn of her farm, which has been in her family for more than a century; her husband, Steve Turman, in one their prairie strips.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Another option is underway at Resilient Farms near Red Oak, Iowa, in the southwest corner of the state. The farm has been in Maggie McQuown’s family for more than a century. She and her husband, Steve Turman, returned there from Dallas in 2012. To offset the impacts of soy and corn grown by the farmer who rented their land, they planted a dozen prairie strips that are teeming with life today.</p><p>While the farmer employed environmentally friendlier no-till and cover crop techniques, Ms. McQuown still worried about the toll of soy and corn, how rising carbon dioxide levels would decrease their nutritional value, and how climate change would lead to dry, lifeless soil.</p><p>“The traditional agricultural system is extracting from the soil, killing it, turning it into dirt,” she said during a recent visit to the farm, as a crop duster roared over a neighbor’s fields, dousing them with fungicide. “We want a living soil, filled with microbes, a whole ecosystem under the ground.”</p><p>Over the last year, Ms. McQuown arranged for another farmer to lease her land, and, in mid-August, he moved his herd of Scottish highland cows to graze. Grass-fed beef is better for the land than annual row crops, mimicking the beneficial impacts that bison once had across the prairies, while also producing food and generating income, she said. She wants her farm to be 40 percent prairie and 60 percent pasture.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Resilient Farms represents what Professor Schulte Moore sees as the logical next step for land conservation and a viable path forward for some Midwestern farmers. While past studies have shown that <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/08/13/746576239/is-grass-fed-beef-really-better-for-the-planet-heres-the-science" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">industrialized cattle farms emit fewer greenhouse gasses than grass-fed beef</a>, which require larger amounts of pasture, the professor said much of that research fails to fully account for negative impacts of concentrated animal feeding operations.</p><p>Such operations, also known as factory farms, have numerous effects on waterways, biodiversity, local communities and the land. Cows spew methane, a greenhouse gas that is 28 times as warming as carbon dioxide, but fertilizers used on crops emit nitrous oxide, which is 10 times more potent than methane. The easiest way to restore grassland while creating local jobs, Professor Schulte Moore said, was by raising grass-fed livestock.</p><p>“We want people in rural communities, and the easiest way to get young farmers back is through cattle livestock production,” she said.</p><p>Professor Schulte Moore has a prairie strip of her own that fills four and a half acres of her family’s farm in Wisconsin. It catches runoff from their neighbors’ soy and corn fields, and is filled with dozens of species of blooming native plants and grasses, including stretches of lupine, planted specially for the endangered Karner Blue butterfly, that form riotous splashes of purple across the fields every June.</p><p>“We love it,” she said. “This is my attempt to rewild the Midwest.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cara Buckley is a reporter on the climate team at The Times who focuses on people working toward climate solutions.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cara-buckley">More about Cara Buckley</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
