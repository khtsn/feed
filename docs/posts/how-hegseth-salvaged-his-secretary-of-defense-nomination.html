		<p>Riot has revealed the matchups for the upcoming VCT 2025 <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2276/champions-tour-2025-emea-kickoff" target="_blank">EMEA Kickoff</a> as well as important changes to formats for Challengers, Ascension, Game Changers, and Premier.</p>



<p>Similar to the format used in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2274/champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff" target="_blank">Americas 2025 Kickoff</a>, EMEA&#39;s Kickoff will utilize a 12-team double-elimination bracket to determine which two teams will represent the region at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>. Each team&#39;s position on the bracket was drawn at random in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxzO97UAihs" target="_blank">Kickoff Draw Show</a>, and the four teams who represented the EMEA region at last year&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions</a> received a BYE for their efforts.</p>

<p>Game days will typically take place weekly on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays while Playoff games will occur on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Changes in the schedule can be expected for some of the “bigger moments in the season.”</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425094/riot-unveils-vct-2025-season-overview" target="_blank">revamped</a> Championship Point distribution system ensures each stage of competition holds high stakes and diminishes the chances of a team&#39;s season ending early into the year. The top four finishers of Kickoff will receive Championship Points for their troubles. Additionally, the playoffs of Stage 1 and Stage 2 will expand to eight teams rather than six.</p>



<p>Riot has also released information regarding the state of EMEA Challengers this year, with many changes promoting a healthier Tier 2 ecosystem and path to Ascension.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Riot unveiled a revamped format for the EMEA Challengers across all leagues, which began with a 3-Stage competition that allowed for teams to garner Ascension Points.</p>

<p>Tournament organizers now have greater flexibility designing split formats, ensuring diversity across all Challengers EMEA competition. The main focus, however, is the new format regarding the top two teams from the DACH, French, Spanish, and Turkish leagues. These eight teams will be joined by four teams from the NORTH//EAST region in a week-long competition.</p>

<p>Featuring four matches a day in a round robin stage, the top four teams across four groups will advance to playoffs for their hearty share of Ascension Points. This process will be repeated for Stages 1 and 2, while Stage 3 will introduce another two teams from the MENA region. Regional playoffs outside of the main Challengers EMEA events will distribute less points that will increase with each stage. </p>

<p>The dates for all three cross-Challengers League Tournaments can be found below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Challengers EMEA 1: March 3-9</li>
<li>Challengers EMEA 2: May 19-25</li>
<li>Challengers EMEA 3: Sep 1-9</li>
</ul>

<p>While the main details of Ascension&#39;s format have yet to be released, Riot has clarified that the entire tournament will take place on LAN using a double-elimination format. Additionally, the winner of Stage 3 EMEA Challengers will receive a direct invite to Ascension, while all other teams attending will be based on Ascension Points.</p>

<p>More details regarding Ascension will be released in 2025.</p>



<p>While the format for Game Changers will stay the same, Riot is introducing one change to spice up the competition and allow teams to play more games. The top ten teams will compete in one group rather than split across two, increasing the amount of games per Group Stage by over 20.</p>



<p>Finally, Premier will continue to serve as a “developmental proving ground” for players on their path to pro in 2025. However, the best amateur teams will be provided their own tournaments, with more details being shared closer to the event dates.</p>

<p>The new EMEA format across all levels of competition has been readjusted to garner growth and development for players and teams. More games, attention, and higher stakes seem to be on the agenda for not just EMEA this year.</p>

<p>EMEA Kickoff will begin on Jan 15 as teams fight for two tickets to the first Masters event of the year.</p>
