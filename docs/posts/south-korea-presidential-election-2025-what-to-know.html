Kim Moon-soo is his main rival and is attempting to keep the presidency in the hands of the People Power Party.</p><p>The new leader will take office on Wednesday. He will be tasked with addressing the fallout from former President Yoon Suk Yeol’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law.html" title="">failed martial law decree on Dec. 3</a>, reviving a sputtering economy and navigating increasingly strained geopolitical tensions.</p><p>After months of turmoil for its democracy and a revolving door of temporary leaders since Mr. Yoon was impeached, the stakes are high.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-77e1de9d">The election was called to replace Mr. Yoon</h2><p>The president’s seat has been vacant since Dec. 14, when the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/asia/south-korea-president-impeached-martial-law.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">National Assembly voted to impeach Mr. Yoon</a> for his attempt to impose martial law. The attempted coup failed after lawmakers rushed to the parliament to strike down the decree within hours of the announcement by the former president on Dec. 3.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/asia/yoon-south-korea-impeachment-ruling.html" title="">Mr. Yoon’s ouster was cemented on April 4</a>, when all eight of the nation’s Constitutional Court justices voted to uphold the impeachment. A few days later, Han Duck-soo, the then prime minister and acting president, announced the snap election to be held on June 3.</p><p>South Korea has had three acting presidents in the past six months. Mr. Han also was impeached, but reinstated by the court, and later resigned to make a now aborted run for president. His replacement, finance minister Choi Sang-mok, also resigned, leaving the country’s education minister, Lee Ju-ho, to assume the role of leader since early May.</p><p>If Mr. Yoon had finished his five-year term, the nation’s 21st presidential election would have been slated for spring 2027.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-27f53117">The candidate with the most votes will win</h2><p>South Korea has a pluralistic, direct voting system in which the candidate with the most votes wins a single five-year term. A president cannot be re-elected.</p><p>The nation’s political sphere largely operates as a bi-party system like in the United States, with the Democratic Party on the center left and the People Power Party on the right. But some of its smaller parties are still represented on the ballot. On Election Day, five candidates were vying for the top job.</p><p>In opinion polls, Mr. Lee has been leading by a large margin. His story is one of the underdog: his parents cleaned public toilets for a living and he almost lost a hand working in sweatshops. Mr. Lee was a spearhead figure in driving public sentiment against Mr. Yoon after his martial law decree.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Election posters featuring presidential candidates hanging on a railing in Seoul.

He attended the nation’s most prestigious university — although he was expelled for his anti-government activism. Mr. Kim has faced criticism for his far-right comments and his being slow to apologize for the martial law episode.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The president is the head of leadership in South Korea but rules with oversight from the National Assembly. Mr. Lee’s Democratic Party has a majority in the current parliament, which will give him more power than many predecessors should he win.</p><p>Campaigns run for around three weeks, far shorter than in the United States. They are colorful and boisterous, with street rallies, dancing lawmakers and pompous music. Many candidates have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/08/world/korean-election/drop-that-mix-tape-i-mean-that-presidential-theme-song?smid=url-share" title="">their own theme songs</a> that blast from loudspeakers mounted on trucks that drive throughout the nation. But campaigning is prohibited on Election Day.</p><h2 id="link-2a37066a">Voter turnout is typically high</h2><p>South Korea has historically reported high voter turnout. At its peak, voter participation in democratic elections was 89 percent in 1987, when the first fully democratic election was held after decades of military rule. Even at its lowest — 63 percent in 2007 — voter turnout was higher than typically seen in the United States.</p><p>Citizens must be 18 years or older to be eligible to vote. There are over 44 million eligible voters in South Korea. Polls will be open from 6 a.m. through 8 p.m. on Tuesday, which is a national holiday. Early and absentee voting took place over the past two weeks.</p><p>Ballot counting will be aired live on the major television networks, and the winner is expected to be declared Wednesday morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-1d9506c5">The new leader will be inaugurated on Wednesday</h2><p>Unusually, South Korea’s new leader will begin his duties as soon as the day after the election. While it is custom to observe a two-month transition period between presidents during regular elections, snap elections follow an expedited timeline.</p><p>Under the nation’s Public Official Election Act, the winner of an election to fill a vacancy must take office immediately. The inauguration ceremony for the newly elected president is expected to take place on Wednesday.</p><h2 id="link-4daf4c6d">Issues range from martial law to Trump’s tariffs</h2><p>Many see the election as a referendum on Mr. Yoon’s shock decision to impose martial law. South Koreans have endured half a year of political turmoil, along with a struggling economy and increasingly strained tensions with China and North Korea. Voters will also choose a leader who they hope can navigate external forces in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/asia/south-korea-election-president.html" title="">global competition for power.</a></p><p>The nation’s economy has suffered after its currency, the won, fell in December to its lowest in years and President Trump imposed tariffs on autos and steel, both of which South Korea exports, causing the domestic stock market to plunge. Government data showed that the economy contracted in the first quarter of this year.</p><p>Voters will also look to the new leader to resolve the onslaught of social issues at home. Most urgent on the docket is to mitigate the fallout from martial law and unify a divided country.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
