</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>South Korea has had three acting presidents in the past six months. Mr. Han also was impeached, but reinstated by the court, and later resigned to make a now aborted run for president. His replacement, finance minister Choi Sang-mok, also resigned, leaving the country’s education minister, Lee Ju-ho, to assume the role of leader since early May.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>If Mr. Yoon had finished his five-year term, the nation’s 21st presidential election would have been slated for spring 2027.</p><h2 id="link-27f53117">The candidate with the most votes will win</h2><p>South Korea has a pluralistic, direct voting system in which the candidate with the most votes wins a single five-year term. A president cannot be re-elected.</p><p>The nation’s political sphere largely operates as a bi-party system like in the United States, with the Democratic Party on the center left and the People Power Party on the right. But some of its smaller parties are still represented on the ballot. On Election Day, five candidates were vying for the top job.</p><p>In opinion polls, Mr. Lee has been leading by a large margin. His story is one of the underdog: his parents cleaned public toilets for a living and he almost lost a hand working in sweatshops. Mr. Lee was a spearhead figure in driving public sentiment against Mr. Yoon after his martial law decree.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Election posters featuring presidential candidates hanging on a railing in Seoul.

He attended the nation’s most prestigious university — although he was expelled for his anti-government activism. Mr. Kim has faced criticism for his far-right comments and his being slow to apologize for the martial law episode.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The president is the head of leadership in South Korea but rules with oversight from the National Assembly. Mr. Lee’s Democratic Party has a majority in the current parliament, which will give him more power than many predecessors should he win.</p><p>Campaigns run for around three weeks, far shorter than in the United States. They are colorful and boisterous, with street rallies, dancing lawmakers and pompous music. Many candidates have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/08/world/korean-election/drop-that-mix-tape-i-mean-that-presidential-theme-song?smid=url-share" title="">their own theme songs</a> that blast from loudspeakers mounted on trucks that drive throughout the nation. But campaigning is prohibited on Election Day.</p><h2 id="link-2a37066a">Voter turnout is typically high</h2><p>South Korea has historically reported high voter turnout. At its peak, voter participation in democratic elections was 89 percent in 1987, when the first fully democratic election was held after decades of military rule. Even at its lowest — 63 percent in 2007 — voter turnout was higher than typically seen in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-12"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="skorea-turnout-comparison" data-id="100000010204353" data-source-id="100000010204353"><div slug="skorea-turnout-comparison" data-sourceid="100000010204353" id="embed-id-100000010204353">

South Koreans have endured half a year of political turmoil, along with a struggling economy and increasingly strained tensions with China and North Korea. Voters will also choose a leader who they hope can navigate external forces in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/asia/south-korea-election-president.html" title="">global competition for power.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The nation’s economy has suffered after its currency, the won, fell in December to its lowest in years and President Trump imposed tariffs on autos and steel, both of which South Korea exports, causing the domestic stock market to wobble. Government data showed that the economy contracted in the first quarter of this year.</p><p>Voters will also look to the new leader to resolve the onslaught of social issues at home.
