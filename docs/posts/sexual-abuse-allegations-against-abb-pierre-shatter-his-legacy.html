Streets, schools and public parks are named for him.

The accusations have been made by the women themselves, by members of their families, or by witnesses.</p><p>One woman said Abbé Pierre groped and kissed her when she was 8 and 9 years old in the mid-1970s. Another said he forced her to watch him masturbate and to perform oral sex on him in 1989. Yet another said Abbé Pierre abused her after she asked for help finding housing in the early 1990s.</p><p>The reports do not publicly identify anyone who came forward, but say the accusers were nonprofit employees or volunteers, members of families close to him, staff members at establishments he visited or people he met through his charitable endeavors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abbé Pierre at his office in Paris in 1954.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The reports were compiled by Groupe Egaé, a private consulting firm that specializes in preventing sexual and sexist violence. It conducted an investigation at the request of the nonprofits — the Abbé Pierre Foundation, Emmaüs France and Emmaüs International — after a woman came forward privately in 2023, accusing the priest of sexual assault. The organizations say they believe the accusers and expect more to come forward.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Our movement knows what it owes to Abbé Pierre,” the organizations said in a joint <a href="https://www.emmaus-international.org/en/press/emmaus-international-emmaus-france-et-la-fondation-abbe-pierre-rendent-publics-de-nouveaux-faits-graves-commis-par-labbe-pierre-et-annoncent-plusieurs-mesures-relatives-a-la-place-de-l/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>. “Now, we must also confront the unacceptable suffering that he forced upon others.”</p><p>Abbé Pierre, born Henri Antoine Grouès in 1912 into a wealthy silk-merchant family from Lyon, entered a Capuchin monastery at age 18. He fought with the French Resistance during World War II, served as a chaplain in the French Navy and became a lawmaker.</p><p>He campaigned for the homeless, issuing a famous radio call for shelter and supplies during the harsh winter of 1954. That effort inspired a 1956 law that is still in effect in France, making it illegal to evict tenants during the coldest winter months.</p><p>After that, not even the occasional brush with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/01/world/french-icon-falls-from-grace-in-debate-on-holocaust.html" title="">controversy</a> dented his national image. He topped <a href="https://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/qui-etait-labbe-pierre-4089373#:~:text=Il%20%C3%A9tait%20la%20personnalit%C3%A9%20pr%C3%A9f%C3%A9r%C3%A9e,50%20du%20Journal%20du%20Dimanche" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a newspaper</a> ranking of France’s most popular personalities 17 times.</p><p>Now the nonprofits he left behind are scrambling to distance themselves from a man who was inextricably linked to their work. While he was rarely involved in the day-to-day running of their operations, his scruffy beard, black beret and cape made him an instantly recognizable advocate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Abbé Pierre Foundation said that it was going to change its name. Emmaüs France said it would move to remove his name from its <a href="https://emmaus-france.org/qui-sommes-nous/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">logo</a>. An independent commission of experts will investigate how he was able to act unimpeded for more than half a century.</p><p>“What we are trying to do through these measures isn’t to forget Abbé Pierre or obfuscate his role,” said Adrien Chaboche, the chief executive of Emmaüs International. “What we are changing is the way that we, as a movement and as associations, present ourselves to the world — and we can’t do that with a figurehead who now embodies such a disgraceful and reprehensible reality.”</p><p>They are not the only ones reassessing his legacy.
