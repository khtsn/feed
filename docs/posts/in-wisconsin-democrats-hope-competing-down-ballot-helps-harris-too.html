Just south of Green Bay, for example, three State Senate districts converged in a jigsaw puzzle configuration, allowing three Republican state senators to live within a half-dozen miles of one another.</p><p>Then last year, voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/04/us/elections/results-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">handily elected a liberal justice</a> to the State Supreme Court, handing the left a majority. The campaign that elected the justice, Janet Protasiewicz, was driven in large part by a push to prevent a 19th-century abortion ban from snapping back into place with the repeal of Roe v. Wade. But voters also chafed at the draconian gerrymander that ensured that an almost evenly divided state had a Legislature with an overwhelming Republican majority.</p><p>Just after Justice Protasiewicz was sworn in, a coalition of voting-rights groups and left-leaning law firms filed a legal challenge to the districts, arguing that new maps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/us/politics/wisconsin-maps-protasiewicz.html" title="">should be drawn before the 2024 election</a>.

In Wisconsin’s Senate, 14 districts out of 33 are Democratic-leaning, while 15 lean Republican.</p><p>“Very close, very tight — but it’s fair,” said Duane Shukoski, who worked at the paper giant Kimberly-Clark for 37 years and is now running as a Democrat for a tossup Assembly seat in Neenah, Wis.</p><p>The questions remain: Can Democrats pull themselves off the mat after 13 years of futility? Can Republicans reanimate after 13 years of complacency and guaranteed victories? And what impact will the new action at the bottom of the ticket really have?</p><p>Doug Reich, the chairman of the Republican Party of Brown County, which includes Green Bay, evinced little worry. The energy, he said, was at the top of the ticket, with Mr. Trump. It will flow down from there.</p><p>“Certainly, we’re trying to wake up a lot of people who aren’t aware. I’m sure a lot of people in the old red districts felt these were almost uncontested races,” he said. “But everybody is motivated by the presidential race. The average person sees that as the barometer of the entire culture and where the country is going.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>To an extent, Democrats agree. The voters of northeast Wisconsin do not have the State Legislature top of mind, they concede. But the Wisconsin Democratic Party is contesting 97 of the 99 seats in the Assembly and all 16 State Senate seats up for election, numbers not seen since 2011, the last election before Republicans gerrymandered the Legislature out of contention. Two years ago, Democrats ran in 84 Assembly seats and 12 of the 14 Senate seats up that year.</p><p>In contrast, Republicans have given up on contesting five Democratically-held State Senate districts this year. Repeated efforts to reach legislative candidates in the party — and the state Republican Party chairman — went unanswered.</p><p>“The Republicans have to work for the first time in a lot of these seats, and they just aren’t,” said Ryan Spaude, a 30-year-old district attorney in Green Bay who only recently became a Democrat and is now contesting a newly competitive Assembly seat that he said was “as purple as a Vikings jersey.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“The Republicans have to work for the first time in a lot of these seats, and they just aren’t,” said Ryan Spaude, a Democrat running for the State Assembly in Wisconsin’s Brown County.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Vondruska for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Wisconsin Democratic Party is contesting 97 of the 99 seats in the Assembly and all 16 State Senate seats up for election, numbers not seen in more than a decade.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Vondruska for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>No question, the Democrats are trying.

He estimated on Monday night that he had knocked on close to 15,000 doors. His advertisements compete with those of Mr. Trump, Ms. Harris, Ms. Baldwin and her Republican opponent, Eric Hovde, but they have helped his ground presence.</p><p>“I see your face on the TV!” enthused one woman who answered his knock at her door.</p><p>Dennis Stockwell, 81, a retiree from Pulaski, Wis., suggested the strategy was working when he stopped at the Brown County Democratic headquarters in Green Bay to pick up yard signs.</p><p>“Before, I felt like it didn’t make a difference,” he said. “Now, there’s a sense my vote will count.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In Appleton, about 30 miles southwest of Green Bay, Kristin Alfheim, the Democrat running in the newly formed 18th State Senate district, marveled at the constant flow of volunteers at the Outagamie County Democratic headquarters.

Ms. Alfheim ran in the old 19th Senate district two years ago — and lost by eight percentage points.</p><p>Now, as the region grows more moderate, Ms. Alfheim, a center-left Democrat, has a real shot at a brand-new district that runs up the west side of Lake Winnebago, linking the sister cities of Oshkosh, Neenah, Menasha and Appleton that the old maps intentionally broke apart.
