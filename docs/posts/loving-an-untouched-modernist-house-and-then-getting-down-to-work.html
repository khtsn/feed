But, “I had a bit of a Trulia addiction,” he added, noting that he kept an eye on the real estate market anyway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Fischer and Ms. Christman in the living room with their children.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“We were just looking at houses recreationally, on Saturdays or Sundays,” explained Ms. Christman, 41, an interiors photographer. “We’d take our kids, and they’d run through the houses and hide in closets. It was all just for curiosity’s sake.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The roof crumples low over the earth.

When Mr. Fischer and Ms. Christman stepped inside, they discovered that the 1,590-square-foot house was essentially a time capsule, with most of its original finishes and fixtures, including custom furniture Mr. Green designed for the house, still in place.</p><p>The untouched nature of the house was both good and bad: it hadn’t been compromised by a clumsy renovation but it was in desperate need of upgrades. The home had inefficient single-pane windows, dated heating and electrical systems, failing appliances, and an ant problem.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>They kept custom furniture Mr. Green designed for the house, but reupholstered the cushions in patterned fabric.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A wall of wood slats and built-in banquette define a dining nook off the kitchen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Curved furniture and rugs fit the irregular shape of the living room.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Fischer and Ms. Christman weren’t sure the compact house would be large enough for their family, which now includes three children: Nico, 11, Zeke, 8 and Frieda, 3. But faced with such a striking home for an affordable-for-Palo-Alto price, they couldn’t resist. They bought it for about $2.7 million that October.</p><p>“It was within our budget,” Ms. Christman said. “And most other things just weren’t.”</p><p>They moved in to get a feel for the house as they began working with the architect Neal Schwartz, founder of the firm <a href="https://saasf.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Schwartz and Architecture</a>, on renovation plans. Hoping to retain Mr. Green’s design intent as much as possible, they started by considering piecemeal changes. Before long, however, the project grew into a complete overhaul of the main house, an addition and two new outbuildings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span> Schwartz and Architecture raised the ceiling at the back of the house to make the kitchen lighter and brighter.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A bar is next to the kitchen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“It’s one of those houses you look at and say ‘Oh, I wouldn’t change a thing,’” Mr. Schwartz said. “But then as you get to know it, you think, ‘Oh, well, we probably should change some things.’”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>For instance, the ceiling at the front of the house was high enough to allow for a bright, airy living room, but it descended to only six feet at the back, creating a dark, claustrophobic kitchen. To make it more appealing, the architect cut the existing beams and added extensions to raise the ceiling at the back of the house.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Schwartz and Architecture added a sunken conversation pit where there was previously a carport.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Where there was a carport beneath another section of low roof, Mr. Schwartz excavated into the earth and enclosed the space to create a sunken conversation pit.</p><p>For a new primary suite, he placed an addition to one side, but gave it a boxy shape and finished it in stucco to make it distinct from the original structure. The changes brought the size of the house up to 3,100 square feet. To accommodate a guest suite, and a gym and home office, Mr. Schwartz added two outbuildings measuring 288 and 215 square feet in the yard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An addition contains the new primary suite. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A secret bookcase door connects one of the children’s bedrooms to the primary bathroom.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>For interior design advice, Ms. Christman booked a one-hour video call with <a href="https://sarahshermansamuel.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sarah Sherman Samuel</a>, an interior designer based in Grand Rapids, Mich., through the online service <a href="https://www.theexpert.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Expert</a>. It went so well that the conversation blossomed into an agreement to have Ms. Sherman completely design the interiors.</p><p>“I fell in love with the project,” Ms. Sherman said, explaining that she was already a fan of Mr. Green’s architecture.</p><p>The designer chose materials, finishes and furniture that she hoped would personalize the home without looking out of place. “The family is so vibrant and fun, and they wanted a lot of prints, patterns and colors,” Ms. Sherman said. In response, she reupholstered cushions for the furniture Mr. Green designed in patterned fabric and lined some of the bedrooms in playful wallpaper while otherwise running with a palette of warm neutrals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-23"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Samuel added color and pattern to the walls of smaller spaces, like the powder room.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>She kept the primary bathroom calm and neutral.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>To tie the various parts of the property together, including the expanded house and new outbuildings, the team hired <a href="https://www.boxleafdesign.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boxleaf Design</a> to complete the landscape architecture. The result is a parklike yard of tall grasses, trees and flowers sliced by stone pathways.</p><p>After beginning construction in July 2021, the builder Marrone &amp; Marrone completed work in September 2023. The total cost was about $1,000 per square foot.</p><p>The project was far more work, and a much larger investment, than simply renting another home, but Mr. Fischer and Ms. Christman are delighted with how it worked out.</p><p>“We feel very fortunate to be here,” Ms. Christman said. “We’re already making some amazing memories.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span> Landscape architecture by Boxleaf Design makes the yard feel like a private park.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayla Christman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/realestate/" title="">sign up here</a>.</p></div></section></article></div>
