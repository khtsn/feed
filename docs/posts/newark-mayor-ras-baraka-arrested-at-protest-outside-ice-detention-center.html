The agent added: “That is the last warning. You will be placed under arrest.”</p><p>After leaving the facility, the members of Congress joined Mr. Baraka outside, according to aides for Ms. Watson Coleman and Ms. McIver.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. McIver said that Mr. Baraka then went to a public area where other protesters were gathered. “He walked himself out,” she said.</p><p>Outside the gate, Mr. Menendez can be heard on video telling Mr. Baraka: “They’re talking about coming back to arrest you.”</p><p>“I’m not on their property,” the mayor replied. “They can’t come out on the street and arrest me.”</p><p>Mr. Baraka was taken into custody by a team of masked federal agents wearing military fatigues while outside the gates in a driveway swarming with protesters and reporters.</p><p>Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, called the episode a “bizarre political stunt” in a social media post. She said Ms. Watson Coleman and Mr. Menendez, along with “multiple protesters,” had “holed up in a guard shack.”</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1920938232314810627" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared a video</a> of the mayor’s arrest that she said showed a “mob” assaulting ICE agents outside the gates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“This illegal breaking and entering of a detention facility puts the safety of our law enforcement agents and the detainees at risk,” Ms. McLaughlin said, despite there being no evidence that the lawmakers had entered the building illegally.</p><p>Mr. Menendez said ICE agents had “put their hands on” Ms. Watson Coleman and Ms. McIver.</p><p>“They feel no restraint on what they should be doing, and that was shown in broad daylight today,” Mr. Menendez said at a news conference shortly after Mr. Baraka’s arrest.</p><p>Newark officials had argued for weeks in federal court that the center’s owner, GEO Group, was violating city laws because it had failed to obtain required permits or a valid certificate of occupancy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A man protests outside Delaney Hall after Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested and taken to a different facility.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Fraser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Baraka showed up at the facility with city inspectors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/nyregion/newark-migrants-ras-baraka-ice.html" title="">at dawn</a> seeking entry.

But the building, which received its first detainees last week, quickly drew opposition from Democrats and local activists. They argued that its location near immigrant hubs in New Jersey and New York City would help accelerate the administration’s deportation pipeline.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/RepBonnie/status/1920909461318774937/video/3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a>, Ms. Watson Coleman, wrote that the facility had opened without permission from the city.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“We’ve heard stories of what it’s like in other ICE prisons,” she wrote. “We’re exercising our oversight authority to see for ourselves.”</p><p>In an emailed statement, Ms. McLaughlin argued that the facility had proper permits and she provided a list of five immigrants she said were being detained at Delaney Hall and had been accused of serious crimes, including murder and drug trafficking.</p><p>Ms. McIver said Mr. Baraka had done nothing wrong before his arrest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters demand the release of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka after his arrest.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“What we see here is despicable, and we should all be angry,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Menendez described Mr. Baraka’s arrest as “an act of intimidation.”</p><p>Ms. Watson Coleman said she had been “manhandled” and she described the events as “an abuse of power.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Other New Jersey Democrats used social media on Friday to criticize the ICE response. Gov. Philip D.

Senator Cory Booker <a href="https://x.com/SenBooker/status/1920951054448955693" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> that ICE officers should have de-escalated what he called a “disturbing, unnecessary” confrontation.</p><p>Late Friday, about 200 people gathered in a steady rain outside the ICE office in Newark where Mr. Baraka had been taken.</p><p>“Let him out,” the crowd chanted, referring to the mayor, and “let them in,” referring to the three members of Congress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>More demonstrators gathered as the afternoon wore on.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Mark Bonamo<!-- --> and <!-- -->Taylor Robinson<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Luis Ferré-Sadurní is a Times reporter covering immigration, focused on the influx of migrants arriving in the New York region.</p></div><div><p>Alyce McFadden is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>17</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Newark Mayor Is Arrested During Protest Over ICE Detention Center<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
