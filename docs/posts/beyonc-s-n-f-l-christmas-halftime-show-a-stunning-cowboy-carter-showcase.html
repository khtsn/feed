In September, “Cowboy Carter” received <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/arts/music/beyonce-cmas-nominations-cowboy-carter.html" title="">zero C.M.A. Award nominations</a>; two months later, it earned <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/arts/music/grammy-awards-nominations.html" title="">11 Grammy nods</a>, leading all artists.</p><p>But Beyoncé’s jubilant and expertly staged performance, during halftime of an N.F.L. game in Houston on Christmas, sent the opposite message: In her big-tent reimagining of country music and Southern culture, <em>everyone</em> is welcome. The event was not only part of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/arts/television/nfl-games-beyonce-netflix-christmas.html" title="">first foray</a> into the crowded field of N.F.L. broadcasting, but the live debut of material from “Cowboy Carter,” an album that examines the history of country music, spotlights Black performers vital to its past and present, and ponders larger questions about the confining nature of genre.</p><p>The impressive production, announced at the top as <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/beyonce-delivers-epic-gift-of-a-halftime-performance-beyonce-bowl-is-coming" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beyoncé Bowl</a>, seemed to employ a supporting cast that rivaled a cinematic blockbuster. For most of its 13 minutes, the field teemed with musicians, dancers and a procession of extras, every one clad in dazzling white. That abundance sent a message. Though known for her monolithic singularity as a solo artist — and for striking power poses in the spotlight — Beyoncé put a version of herself on display during this show that felt especially generous, eager to share the moment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>During an excerpt from her cover of the Beatles’ “Blackbird,” she was flanked by the quartet of young Black country artists from the album recording, Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy and Reyna Roberts. She ceded the frame to the rising star Shaboozey to rap his verse on “Sweet Honey Buckiin’,” an appearance that helped facilitate the success of his long-reigning No. 1 hit “A Bar Song (Tipsy).” She joined a long two-step line that featured her strikingly mature 12-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy. And she let Post Malone break the dress code, in denim — perhaps for the sake of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDegkbKwf3Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">product placement</a> — as they performed a chaste but charming version of their sultry duet “Levii’s Jeans.” Malone’s delighted-to-be-there grin telegraphed an awe that echoed what plenty of viewers were probably thinking: “Who <em>but</em> Beyoncé could pull off this sort of spectacle?”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Beyoncé shared the halftime stage with dancers, musicians and a procession of extras.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Christian Smith/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="Optimistic-4"><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
