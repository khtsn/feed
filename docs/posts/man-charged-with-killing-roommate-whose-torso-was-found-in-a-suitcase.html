He does not have any prior arrests in New York City, according to the police.</p><p>Mr. Millet told the police that he had knocked Mr. Echevarria to the ground, then stamped on his head, killing him, according to a law enforcement official. He then used a tool to cut Mr. Echevarria’s body into pieces and put his remains in a suitcase, the official said. It was not immediately clear what happened to the rest of Mr. Echevarria’s body.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The police did not say how they learned the identity of Mr. Echevarria or provide a motive for the killing.</p><p>A New York City ferry captain discovered the suitcase drifting in the East River on Feb. 5, according to an internal police report.</p><p>Unable to fish it out of the river, the captain called the Police Department’s Harbor Unit for help, the report said.</p><p>Officers from the unit pulled the suitcase from the water around 5:30 p.m. and, after seeing what was inside, brought it to Pier 16 on the East Side of Manhattan, about a quarter-mile south of the Brooklyn Bridge, the police said.</p><p>On Thursday, family members and neighbors of Mr. Echevarria expressed shock and horror at the news of his death and disappearance.

I just spoke to him,” she said.</p><p>Juan Roman, 63, an acquaintance of Mr. Echevarria, said he had been a warm presence in the neighborhood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We always said hello to each other. He was a nice, friendly guy. He never looked at anyone the wrong way,” Mr. Roman said.</p><p>Mr. Echevarria’s sister Evelyn said in a brief phone call on Thursday that she was “still coming to terms with this gruesome, horrific murder.” In a post on Facebook, she shared a photo of him, standing in the rain and smiling broadly.</p><p>“We are grieving deeply, but we find comfort in the love and memories we shared with him,” she wrote in the caption. “He will be truly missed and will forever remain in our hearts.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Cramer is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and crime in the city and surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-cramer">More about Maria Cramer</a></span></p></div><div><p>Maia Coleman writes about breaking news and the criminal justice system in New York City and its surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maia-coleman">More about Maia Coleman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
