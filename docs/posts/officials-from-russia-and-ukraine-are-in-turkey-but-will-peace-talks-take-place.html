President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, visiting the Turkish capital of Ankara, slammed the Kremlin for its “disrespect” in sending a midlevel delegation to Istanbul, where Russia wanted the talks to take place.</p><p>“There is no time of the meeting, there is no agenda of the meeting, there is no high-level delegation,” Mr. Zelensky said at a news conference after sitting down with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “I think Russia’s attitude is unserious.”</p><p>After a day of uncertainty over whether Ukraine would participate in the talks in Istanbul, Mr. Zelensky said he would send a pared-down delegation there, led by the minister of defense, Rustem Umerov. He said he made the decision to show that Ukraine would engage in any effort for peace, even one with the slimmest chance of success, after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rebuffed his appeal to meet in person in Turkey.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Overshadowing it all was President Trump, who told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One that “nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together.” Mr. Trump, who was in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, had earlier said that he might travel to Turkey on Friday “if something happened” in the peace talks. However, there was no other indication that a last-minute summit would materialize.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/15/multimedia/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/15/multimedia/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/15/multimedia/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="President Trump and members of his administration sit at a table covered in a white cloth, in front a row of U.S. and Qatari flags." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/15/multimedia/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/15/multimedia/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/15/multimedia/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/15/multimedia/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb/15int-russia-ukraine-talks-01-tlpb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/4b0a0372-10c8-53aa-b6b5-1c19ff9b5e22" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump with business leaders in Doha, Qatar, on Thursday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Putin last weekend proposed direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, in what would be the first known face-to-face negotiation between the two sides since the first weeks of the war, in March 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion. Mr. Zelensky upped the ante by calling on Mr. Putin himself to come, and arrived in Ankara on Thursday with his foreign minister and other senior officials.</p><p>But Mr. Putin refused, and instead sent a delegation that was a mirror image of the one he dispatched for the 2022 talks, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/15/world/europe/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-deal.html" title="">fell apart after about two months and included a high-profile meeting in Istanbul</a>. In that negotiation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/15/world/europe/ukraine-russia-peace-negotiations.html" title="">Russia made numerous demands that would undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty</a>, seeking a pledge that the country would never join NATO and would limit the size of its military.</p><p>Vladimir Medinsky, a former culture minister who led Russia’s delegation in 2022 and resumed that role on Thursday, told reporters that Russia saw the new round of talks as “a continuation of the peace process” of that year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The delegation is committed to a constructive approach, focused on finding possible solutions and points of contact,” Mr. Medinsky said.</p><p>Neither side specified when, exactly, a meeting would take place. Mr. Zelensky made it clear that Ukraine’s expectations were low.</p><p>“Russia does not want to end this war,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said the United States and Turkey would be involved in any talks. A Turkish official said that Keith Kellogg, Mr. Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, was in Istanbul on Thursday, and that Steve Witkoff, the special envoy for the Middle East and Russia, was expected to arrive on Friday.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in Antalya, Turkey, for other meetings, said the Trump administration was “impatient” for progress in the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. The United States was “open to virtually any mechanism” that could engender a lasting peace, Mr. Rubio said, adding, “We remain committed to that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Thursday’s chaotic diplomacy highlighted the wide divergence between Moscow and Kyiv over how to end the war.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian soldiers firing toward Russian troops in the Donetsk region, one of the areas Mr. Putin hopes to control, in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky wants an immediate and unconditional cease-fire, followed by negotiations over a potential peace deal. But Mr. Putin, who appears confident of Russia’s upper hand on the battlefield, is refusing to stop fighting before he secures major concessions from Kyiv and the West.</p><p>Mr. Medinsky, the head of the Russian delegation, indicated on Thursday that Russia would continue to seek wide-ranging concessions rather than an immediate cease-fire. Speaking at Russia’s consulate in Istanbul, Mr. Medinsky repeated Mr. Putin’s frequent phrasing that any peace deal needed to tackle the “root causes” of the conflict — Kremlin shorthand for a range of issues including the existence of Ukraine as an independent country aligned with the West.</p><p>“The goal of direct negotiations with the Ukrainian side is — sooner or later — to achieve the establishment of a lasting peace by addressing the fundamental root causes of the conflict,” Mr. Medinsky said.</p><p>Russian state media had reported that the talks were to take place at an Istanbul palace on the Bosporus where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/15/world/europe/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-deal.html" title="">Ukraine-Russia negotiations were held in March 2022</a>. And so dozens of reporters on Thursday morning thronged outside a side entrance to that palace, Dolmabahce, forcing confused ferry commuters to scramble for a detour around the press scrum. But throughout the day, there were no negotiators in sight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The prospect of a high-profile cease-fire negotiation in Turkey was the latest turn in a rapidly shifting diplomatic landscape.</p><p>Mr. Trump came into office earlier this year promising to bring the war to a swift conclusion. He began his efforts on Feb. 12, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/trump-putin-call-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">with phone calls to Mr. Putin</a> and to Mr. Zelensky, but did not coordinate with European allies, who have urged the United States to put more pressure on Russia to get the Kremlin to compromise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left: Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, in Kyiv, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Stefan Rousseau</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But Mr. Trump instead pressured Kyiv, blaming Ukraine for causing a war that Russia had started.</p><p>In late February, Mr. Zelensky met with the American president in Washington — a disastrous visit in which Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance castigated the Ukrainian leader in the Oval Office for not being grateful enough for U.S. support, as journalists recorded the scene. The Trump administration then briefly suspended military assistance and intelligence sharing.</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Trump was trying to induce Moscow to agree to a cease-fire by holding out the prospect of economic relief from sanctions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Later in the spring, at a meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Mr. Zelensky agreed to a key demand of the Trump administration: an immediate and unconditional 30-day cease-fire, abandoning demands that Western countries guarantee Ukraine’s future security before it agrees to a truce.</p><p>Mr. Putin rebuffed that idea and proposed a three-day cease-fire to coincide with an annual Victory Day parade in Moscow commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Kyiv did not agree to that.</p><p>Overall, during the first months of this year, while Mr. Trump was trying to broker peace talks, the hostilities were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">far deadlier</a> than the same period last year, according to the United Nations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mariupol, Ukraine, devastated in fighting in 2022, has been under Russian control since then.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Nataliia Novosolova<!-- --> contributed research. <!-- -->Nataliya Vasilyeva<!-- --> <!-- -->Qasim Nauman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Safak Timur<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anton Troianovski is the Moscow bureau chief for The Times.
