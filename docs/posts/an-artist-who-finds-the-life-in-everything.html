Ms. Franceschi has curated her collection over a lifetime and added in some of her own portraits and sculptures along the way. There are dozens of paintings and drawings, some photographs and sculptures and stained glass. There’s a samovar converted into a lamp, and a framed apron — woven by her grandmother in Belarus more than a century ago — hangs on the wall. In one hallway, Ms. Franceschi displays three portraits: her mother, her daughter and herself. There’s a lamp shade from Venice, Italy, and a vase from Hangzhou, China.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A few large prints are bundled in a corner, remnants from a book of photographs featuring pre-eminent dancers from the New York City Ballet, her most recent project, which took nine years to complete and was published this year. </p><p>An armoire is the only piece of furniture that she didn’t build herself or buy used. When she moved into the apartment she gut-renovated it, picking up a sledgehammer to do the work with a small crew. She converted a second bedroom into a study and lined it with bookshelves, each deep and tall enough for art books. She built extra drawers into beds and extra shelves into closets. “Storage is how you make it in this town,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-6"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Franceschi built furniture for the apartment with several pullout drawers below for extra storage.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>She remembers when she found her vintage bathroom sink on the street: “I called a neighbor and said, ‘Get in a cab!’” And she remembers scoring her vanity at the Salvation Army after a week of hard negotiating. “Finally the guy said to me, ‘I’ll give it for the price you want if you promise never to come back here,’” she recalled, laughing.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Each object has a story, a past of its own, and each is important to how Ms. Franceschi envisions her future. “If I become immobilized and can’t leave the apartment,” she said, “I want my house to reflect everything I’ve enjoyed and loved.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A centerpiece of Ms. Franceschi’s kitchen is her collection of 19th-century English china. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Each square foot is lit with uncommon precision, tailored to the colors on the canvas or the bay window seats or the shelves displaying Ms. Franceschi’s collection of 19th-century English china.</p><p>Her work studio is the most carefully lit room. It is a 25-by-9-foot rectangle at the corner of the building, and her understanding of the space is shaped by decades of working there to produce drawings, paintings and sculptures. “My studio has south and west light, which walks and changes color as it walks,” she said. In order to control the light she keeps shades over the windows and relies on the full-spectrum lighting system that hangs from the ceiling.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>$2,500 | Upper West Side</p><h2 id="link-5adbbb67">Betti Franceschi, 90</h2><p><strong>Occupation: </strong>Artist</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Franceschi’s apartment includes a 225-square-foot work studio where she has been producing sculptures, paintings, drawings and photographs for decades. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Ms. Franceschi studied art at Carnegie Tech (before it became Carnegie Mellon). “The guys I went to school with didn’t like girls who were pretty and talented,” she recalled. “You could be one but not both.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The words of a drawing teacher still hang in her memory: “He said, ‘Why would I teach you? You’re just going to get married and have kids.’”</p><p>Ms. Franceschi did get married and have children — a son and a daughter — and she moved to New York to continue making art. Once the marriage was over and the kids were older, she was still making art. When her daughter, Antonia Franceschi, began her career as a ballerina, it inspired Ms. Franceschi to produce a collection of drawings, which were published in a book called “The Still Point.” The drawings explore the movement of the body at the dancer’s core.</p><p>A decade ago, Ms. Franceschi had an idea for another book. “My first book is about what it feels like to dance,” she said. “Well, I thought the second should be what it looks like to dance.”</p><p>She wanted to accomplish this with photographs. There was just one problem. “I am not a photographer,” she said.</p><p>It was a friend and fellow artist who convinced her she could do it. “He told me, ‘You may not understand the camera but you know what a picture looks like.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>She wanted each image to be of an older dancer — artists from her generation. “My fundamental motivation,” Ms. Franceschi writes on her website, “is to refute the youth-enthralled ageism of the American culture we live in.”</p><p>She leaned heavily on the advice of friends. The filmmaker Michel Negroponte showed up at many of the shoots to document the process. “He’s a perfect filmmaker,” Ms. Franceschi said. “He enables connections, but he never intrudes. You don’t even feel him there.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-20"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In March, Ms. Franceschi’s published “Ageless Dancers,” a book of photographs that took nine years to complete.

It’s 70 images of dancers between the ages of 62 and 101, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/arts/dance/jacques-damboise-charismatic-star-of-city-ballet-is-dead-at-86.html" title="">Jacques d’Amboise</a> and Carmen de Lavallade, Martine van Hamel and Edward Villella.</p><p>“People think I art-directed this book,” Ms. Franceschi said. “You don’t direct these people — they know what they’re doing. You just pray you see it and your finger moves at just the right time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>In each image she pursued a precise frame. “And each figure is in dialogue, or a romance with the frame,” she said.</p><p>Some of the subjects took convincing, and Ms. Franceschi’s skills as an indefatigable negotiator came in handy, particularly with Mr. d’Amboise. “Originally Jacques said, ‘I’m not going to do it.’” But after nearly four years she convinced him to change his mind. “I told him my approach is just to flatter and flatter and flatter and eventually it’ll work — it worked on you!”</p><p>Mr. d’Amboise and every dancer who walked into Ms. Franceschi studio are now incorporated into the story of her apartment. The black backdrop against which all their photographs were taken still hangs in a corner of the studio, a new addition to the accumulation of life throughout the home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/realestate/" title="">sign up here</a>.
