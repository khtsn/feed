But U.N. officials say that distribution to warehouses and bakeries inside Gaza has been hampered by the lack of secure routes, and that negligible quantities of food are reaching the people who need it.</p><p>Against the backdrop of the humanitarian crisis and mounting international pressure to end the devastating 19-month war in Gaza, Israel and Hamas were considering on Thursday a new version of a cease-fire proposal formulated by President Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff.</p><p>The full details of the new proposal remain unclear.</p><p>But both Israel and Hamas have said they are willing to accept at least some of its terms, including the release of 10 living hostages held by Hamas and the remains of others who died in captivity in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.</p><p>An Israeli official familiar with the details said the initial phase of the deal would provide for a 60-day cease-fire and a flow of aid through U.N.-run operations. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the sensitive negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke from a strike billowing in the background of a camp housing displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It was unclear, however, whether the new proposal could address the main sticking point between the sides. Israel is insisting on having an option to resume fighting if Hamas does not surrender and disarm. Hamas is demanding firm guarantees that a temporary cease-fire would lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p><p>The war began in October 2023 with a deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw about 250 others taken hostage, according to the Israeli government. More than 54,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.</p><p>At least 20 living hostages are still being held in Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities.</p><p>Israel ended a previous cease-fire in March and has since embarked on a new phase of fighting, advancing slowly and expanding its control over larger swathes of the territory.</p><p>On Thursday, Gaza’s health ministry said that hospitals in the enclave had received more than 60 bodies over the past 24 hours.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Palestinian carries a box of supplies from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in Khan Younis on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hatem Khaled/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Khalil Degran, a spokesman for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, said his facility had received 20 bodies on Thursday morning following a reported Israeli airstrike in Al-Bureij, a few miles to the north.</p><p>The majority of the victims were civilians, including nine children, Mr. Degran said.
