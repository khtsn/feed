The three were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/us/tyre-nichols-verdict.html" title="">found guilty of witness tampering charges in that case</a>, but acquitted of a more serious charge, violating Mr. Nichols’s civil rights by causing his death. Federal jurors also found Mr. Haley guilty of violating Mr. Nichols’s civil rights by causing bodily injury.</p><p>The jury in the state case, seated from the Chattanooga area in eastern Tennessee to ensure a fair trial, deliberated more than eight hours after a seven-day trial in state court.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Sentencing in the federal trial is expected later this year.</p><p>The three former officers were emotional after the verdict was read on Wednesday, with Mr. Haley appearing to cry. Mr. Nichols’s mother, RowVaughn Wells, who gave wrenching testimony about the injuries that her son sustained, did not show any emotion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photo of Tyre Nichols displayed at a memorial service for him in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adrian Sainz/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Today’s verdicts are a devastating miscarriage of justice,” Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, two civil rights lawyers who have represented Mr. Nichols’s family, said <a href="https://x.com/BenCrumpLaw/status/1920198159243850107/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a>. They added that “we are outraged, and we know we are not alone.”</p><p>Surveillance and body camera footage from Jan. 7, 2023, showed five officers restraining, kicking or pummeling Mr. Nichols after a traffic stop, despite his efforts to comply with their aggressive commands. None of the officers reported the violence. At one point they left Mr. Nichols bruised and slumped against a police car.</p><p>He died three days later, leaving behind a young child. </p><p>The assault was widely criticized as another example of a Black man facing excessive force at the hands of law enforcement. All of the officers were also Black.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Memphis officials quickly fired them, and disciplined or fired a number of other deputies, paramedics and police officials. They also dissolved the elite policing unit that the five officers belonged to.</p><p>A Justice Department investigation, started after Mr. Nichols’s death, found that the Police Department had engaged in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/politics/memphis-police-justice-department-report.html" title="">pattern of excessive violence and discriminatory treatment</a> of Black people, including children. More than a third of Tennessee’s Black population lives in Memphis.</p><p>But state jurors analyzed the actions of each individual officer: who was there when Mr. Nichols was first stopped, who chased him when he broke away and fled, who caught him near his mother’s house, who landed a blow or restrained his arms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Bean, left, and Mr. Smith last month. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Day/Pool, Commercial Appeal/USA Today Network, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Prosecutors described a tragedy fueled by anger, adrenaline and frustration, in which a group of men helped each other beat another man to death. The core of their case was rooted in the body camera and surveillance videos, and the severity of Mr. Nichols’s injuries.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Are good people capable of doing bad things?” Melanie Headley, the assistant district attorney for Shelby County, asking during closing statements. “That night, Jan. 7, 2023, those three officers did bad things. And when Tyre cried for help, they didn’t do anything. Nobody helped him.”</p><p>Prosecutors in both trials said that Mr. Nichols was speeding on his way home. When officers stopped him, they yanked him from the car, pepper-sprayed him and fired at him with a stun gun before Mr. Nichols broke free and ran toward his mother’s home.</p><p>More officers caught up with him, restraining, kicking and hitting him with a baton.</p><p>Over and over again, lawyers played the videos, stopping and starting to identify the defendants and scrutinize each action: the punches that the officers referred to as “haymakers,” the kicks, the strikes and the commentary after.</p><p>Two of the former officers — Desmond Mills Jr. and Emmitt Martin III — pleaded guilty in federal court. Only Mr. Mills testified in the state case; it remains unclear how Mr. Martin’s case will be handled.</p><p>“It was a bad situation and I was trying to get out of trouble,” Mr. Mills said, when pressed on why he did not immediately disclose the scope of what had happened to Mr. Nichols. “I knew it was real bad.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The defense lawyers sought to use Mr. Mills’s testimony to shift the blame for the severity of the beating away from their own clients.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Federal jurors also found Mr. Haley guilty of violating Mr. Nichols’s civil rights by causing bodily injury.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Chris Day</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Repeatedly, lawyers for Mr. Bean, Mr. Haley and Mr. Smith downplayed their roles and framed their actions as an appropriate response to an unknown suspect who had run from the police.</p><p>“It’s not a case where they’re abusing the badge and trying to go out there and prove a point or to try to kill somebody,” said John Keith Perry, a lawyer for Mr. Bean.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Bean and Mr. Smith also summoned character witnesses, arguing that the defendants had been otherwise upstanding members of the police force. And they sought to cast Mr. Nichols, whose car contained small amounts of marijuana and psilocybin mushroom, as well as stolen ID cards, as a formidable opponent who was able to resist larger police officers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“That’s sort of the really tragic part of this whole entire case,” said Stephen R. Leffler, a lawyer for Mr. Haley. “Had Mr. Nichols pulled over when he got the blue lights and submitted to the officers’ questioning or whatever, in all likelihood, they wouldn’t have arrested him.”</p><p>It was among the arguments that appeared to resonate with jurors, most of whom were white. After the verdict was read, all three former officers embraced their lawyers and each other. At least one family member could be heard yelling, “Thank you, Jesus” outside the courtroom.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/tyre-nichols">Tyre Nichols</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
