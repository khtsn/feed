He will remain in jail until the trial, pending another appeal that his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/arts/music/sean-combs-bail-appeal.html" title="">lawyers filed this week</a>.</p><p>Mr. Combs was present at the hearing on Thursday. Wearing tan jail clothes, he walked into the courtroom waving and smiling at his family assembled in the gallery, including his mother and six of his children, and he embraced some of his lawyers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The hearing had been set as a routine scheduling matter. But it came one day after Mr. Combs’s lawyers filed a motion in which they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-assault-video-leak.html" title="">accused government agents of leaking footage</a> of Mr. Combs assaulting his former girlfriend Cassie to CNN. Without citing direct evidence, the lawyers theorized in court papers that the Department of Homeland Security, the agency that raided Mr. Combs’s homes in March, had been behind the leak. They said they might ask for the video to be barred as evidence at the trial.</p><p>Emily A. Johnson, one of the prosecutors, commented briefly at the hearing about the defense’s accusation of leaks, saying, “The government believes the motion is baseless and it is simply a means to exclude a damning piece of evidence.” She said the government would be filing a response to the defense’s motion.</p><p>In an email to Mr. Combs’s lawyers that prosecutors submitted in a court filing on Wednesday, Ms. Johnson denied that the government was behind the leak, writing that it “possessed no surveillance video at all from the InterContinental prior to CNN’s public broadcast,” referring to the hotel where the encounter was filmed.</p><p>Judge Subramanian indicated that he would soon issue an order reminding both the government and the defense not to communicate with the news media about grand jury material and other nonpublic material related to the investigation or prosecution.</p><p>Ms. Johnson added that the government had its own concerns about the defense’s communication with reporters, highlighting an interview that Marc Agnifilo, Mr. Combs’s primary lawyer, gave to TMZ in which he framed the prosecution as a “takedown of a successful Black man.” Ms. Johnson told the judge that Mr. Agnifilo had baselessly accused the government of a “racist prosecution.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The government has indicated that the hotel surveillance video, which CNN published in May, is a central piece of evidence in its argument that Mr. Combs used violence to compel Cassie, whose full name is Casandra Ventura, to engage in what he called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html" title="">“freak-offs”</a> — elaborate, coerced sexual encounters that involved prostitutes and copious drug use. Prosecutors allege that Mr. Combs directed and sometimes filmed the encounters, using the footage as blackmail.</p><p>The release of the video was a bombshell development in the case: Over about a minute of footage, Mr. Combs can be seen in a towel, striking, kicking and dragging Ms. Ventura as she tries to leave, and angrily throwing what appears to be a vase.</p><p>The prosecutors have not used Ms. Ventura’s name in court, but the allegations of physical and sexual abuse contained in her November lawsuit against Mr. Combs, which was quickly settled, closely align with the allegations of a person identified in the criminal case as “Victim-1.”</p><p>At the hearing, prosecutors said the government was in the process of extracting information from a large amount of electronic devices, including 96 seized in the raids in March.</p><p>The prosecution and defense estimated that the trial would take about a month, though the prosecution noted that its investigation was continuing, and that any further charges added in a superseding indictment could lengthen the trial.</p><p>Mr. Combs is being held at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/arts/music/sean-combs-jail-brooklyn-mdc.html" title="">Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn</a>, a federal facility that has been criticized for poor conditions. In the appeal his lawyers filed this week with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, they argued that concerns he would intimidate witnesses if released from jail were unfounded.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julia-jacobs">More about Julia Jacobs</a></span></p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-sisario">More about Ben Sisario</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/sean-combs">Sean Combs</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
