The attacks on Saturday came amid a <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1857665549108715833" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new flurry of Israeli</a> <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1857717115576263085" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evacuation warnings</a> to local residents and after a round of strikes overnight on the same area.</p><p>Israel has said the strikes this week have targeted facilities used by Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia that holds sway in the Dahiya. It has accused the group of hiding “terrorist infrastructure” in residential areas.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-hezbollah.html" title="">dayslong bombing campaign</a> of Beirut’s southern suburbs has complicated U.S. diplomatic efforts for a truce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hezbollah began near daily rocket attacks on Israel last October in solidarity with its ally, Hamas, in Gaza. The conflict intensified in mid-September when Israel stepped up attacks on Hezbollah, culminating in a ground invasion of Lebanon on Oct. 1.</p><p>The war has driven roughly one million Lebanese from their homes, and Hezbollah’s rocket attacks on the north of Israel have displaced tens of thousands of Israelis.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-hezbollah.html" title="">The Biden administration has recently renewed its efforts</a> to broker a cease-fire. But there has so far been no public indication that Hezbollah or its patron, Iran, are willing to accept Israel’s demands, which include the withdrawal of Hezbollah from the Israel-Lebanon border.</p><p>Israel also wants any cease-fire deal to stipulate that it has the right to attack Hezbollah if the group violates the agreement, a demand rejected by both the armed group and the Lebanese government, which is not a party to the conflict.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Dahiya area south of Beirut has been hit by a string of bombings this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>A prominent Iranian official, Ali Larijani, met on Friday with Lebanese officials in Beirut to discuss the cease-fire efforts, the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon said. Mr. Larijani, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, passed messages to Hezbollah from Mr. Khamenei that said he supported ending the war with Israel, according to two Iranians affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The messages also assured Hezbollah that Iran would continue its support and help the group rebuild its forces and recover from the war, they said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Iranians, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the supreme leader had also told Hezbollah to accept the terms of a cease-fire deal demanding it move its forces north, in accordance with U.N.
