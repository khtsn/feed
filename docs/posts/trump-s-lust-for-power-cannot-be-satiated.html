There are any number of theories that seek to explain Trump’s preoccupation with tariffs and trade wars. Perhaps he wants to revitalize American manufacturing and bring factory jobs back to postindustrial communities wracked by poverty and despair. Perhaps he wants the revenue he generates from large tariffs to reduce deficits and help address the nation’s long-term debt. Or perhaps he hopes to rebalance the global economic system, weakening the dollar in order to make the United States a more export-driven economy.</p><p>But each line of thinking shares an obvious problem: How does one accomplish any of these goals with blanket tariffs that threaten to radically reduce trade with the United States? How do you revitalize American manufacturing if manufacturers can’t reasonably import the materials they need to build factories and produce goods? Where is capital supposed to come from? How do you reset the nation’s relationship with its trading partners if those partners are forced to treat you as a bad actor who can’t be trusted? And how are you supposed to revitalize working-class communities if your trade policies will probably destroy as many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/business/trump-tariffs-cars-auto-industry.html" title="">blue-collar jobs</a> as they might, theoretically, create?</p><p>There is a hypothetical president with a hypothetically similar agenda who could answer these questions. This actual president cannot. He did not reason himself into his preoccupation with tariffs and can neither reason nor speak coherently about them. There is no grand plan or strategic vision, no matter what his advisers claim — only the impulsive actions of a mad king, untethered from any responsibility to the nation or its people. For as much as the president’s apologists would like us to believe otherwise, Trump’s tariffs are not a policy as we traditionally understand it. What they are is an instantiation of his psyche: a concrete expression of his zero-sum worldview.</p><p>The fundamental truth of Donald Trump is that he apparently cannot conceive of any relationship between individuals, peoples or states as anything other than a status game, a competition for dominance. His long history of scams, hostile litigation — not to mention his <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frequent refusal to pay</a> contractors, lawyers, brokers and other people who were working for him — is evidence enough of the reality that a deal with Trump is less an agreement between equals than an opportunity for Trump to abuse and exploit the other party for his own benefit. For Trump, there is no such thing as a mutually beneficial relationship or a positive-sum outcome. In every interaction, no matter how trivial or insignificant, someone has to win and someone has to lose. And Trump, as we all know, is a winner.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This simple fact of the president’s psychology does more to explain his antipathy to international trade and enthusiasm for tariffs and other trade barriers than any theorizing about his intentions or overall vision. It certainly is not as if he has a considered view of the global economy. It is not even clear that Trump knows what a tariff is.</p><p>This isn’t a dig. The president genuinely seems to think of tariffs as fees that foreign countries pay to the United States. “We have massive Financial Deficits with China, the European Union, and many others,” he wrote on his Truth Social website on Sunday. “The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing Tens of Billions of Dollars into the U.S.A.” Here, you also see his related belief that a trade deficit represents an actual absence of funds, akin to a negative balance in a bank account.</p><p>“I spoke to a lot of leaders — European, Asian — from all over the world. They’re dying to make a deal, but I said, ‘We’re not gonna have deficits with your country,’ ” the president told reporters on board Air Force One over the weekend. “We’re not gonna do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We’re gonna have surpluses or at worst we’re gonna be breaking even.”</p><p>Of course, a trade deficit is not a loss any more than it is a loss when you, as a consumer, spend your hard-earned cash at a restaurant or a movie theater or a grocery store. When American businesses buy raw materials from foreign countries to make their own products — when they buy finished products and sell them on their shelves — they aren’t incurring a loss. They are exchanging currency for something of value, which they will go on to use or sell for a profit. As a statement of economic policy, Trump’s pronouncement makes no sense. But as an expression of his zero-sum instinct — of his desire to dominate — it is perfectly coherent.</p><p>Trump’s desire to dominate others is the driving psychological force of his administration. His obsession with territorial conquest — seen in his effort to coerce the Canadian government into relinquishing its sovereignty as well as his calls for both the acquisition of Greenland and the Panama Canal — is an obvious product of his predatory approach to human interaction. His authoritarian attempts to cow and coerce key institutions of civil society into compliance with his agenda and obedience to his will are, likewise, a kind of dominance game. They are meant to demonstrate his mastery over his perceived enemies more than they are to achieve any policy aim. He even <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lmdcovngwg2f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said as much during an event on Tuesday</a>, where he bragged about the law firms “signing up with Trump” and said that “they give me a lot of money considering they’ve done nothing wrong.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>You could even say that this need to dominate — this overwhelming drive to show mastery — is constitutive of Trump’s self. There must be a loser or else there is no Trump. Or, as Hegel <a href="https://www.csus.edu/indiv/b/bellonc/fall14/117/hegel_phenspirit_masterslave.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put it</a>, “self-consciousness exists in itself and for itself, in that and by the fact that it exists for another self-consciousness; that is to say, it is only by being acknowledged or recognized.”</p><p>The upshot of this understanding of Trump’s personality is that there is no point at which he can be satisfied. He will always want more: more supplicants to obey his next command; more displays of his power and authority; and more opportunities to trample over those who don’t belong in <em>his</em> America.</p><p>On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the president <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-simply-floated-idea-of-deporting-u-s-citizens-white-houses-leavitt-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had floated the illegal and unconstitutional idea</a> to send incarcerated American citizens to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. This comes as the Department of Homeland Security seeks to spend $45 billion on a plan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-administration-immigrant-detention-facilities-services.html" title="">to expand immigrant detention</a> in the United States, with new facilities to hold the many thousands of people the president intends to arrest and deport, along with the necessary services and new personnel.</p><p>Viewed in light of the president’s psychological need to dominate, it is almost certainly true that his flagrant abuse of the rights of migrants, asylum seekers and foreign-born students in the United States — snatching them off the streets to be imprisoned or, worse, sending them to an unaccountable foreign prison with no practical legal recourse — is just the beginning. In the same way that there was nothing that could stop Trump from imposing a tariff regime that, in his mind, humiliates America’s rivals, there is nothing that can dissuade him from using the coercive power of the state to dominate those he disfavors at home.</p><p>Trump is a winner, and he’ll show it by making all of us the loser.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jamelle Bouie became a New York Times Opinion columnist in 2019.
