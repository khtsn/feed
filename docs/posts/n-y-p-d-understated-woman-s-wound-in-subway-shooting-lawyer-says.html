He said she was unable to walk and was at a rehabilitation facility on Saturday as she worked to regain her health.</p><p>“They say she left the hospital, but she’s still in rehab,” he said. “She has a long road ahead of her both physically and mentally. She will have a bullet in her leg the rest of her life.”</p><p>The Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his assertion.</p><p>Mr. Levine, like those close to Mr. Delpeche, said the footage released by the police on Friday had undercut the argument that the shooting was justified. Based on the edited, 17-minute video, Mr. Levine said, Mr. Mickles was not an imminent threat to the officers when they shot him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The events that led up to the shooting began around 3 p.m. with an initial, unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Mickles to avoid the subway fare, followed 10 minutes later by his entering the system through an emergency gate without paying, the video shows.</p><p>Two officers, Edmund Mays and Alex Wong, follow him up the stairs to the nearly empty subway platform while noting the knife in his hand, the video shows. They ask him repeatedly to drop the knife. Mr. Mickles refuses, tells them to leave him alone and challenges them to shoot him.</p><p>An L train arrives, and Mr. Mickles backs into one of the cars, followed by the officers. They demand again that he drop the knife as several passengers look on, the footage shows. He continues to refuse.</p><p>The officers fire their Tasers, which fail to subdue Mr. Mickles. He rushes down the platform toward Officer Mays before stopping and turning to face Officer Wong. Mr. Mickles appears to be standing still in front of an open subway car door when the officers begin firing, the video shows. Ms. Gahalal and her husband were in that car, Mr. Levine said.</p><p>“It was handled very poorly by the police, and two innocent bystanders are going to have lifelong effects as a result of their decision,” he said.</p><p>Officer Mays, who was shot below the armpit, has been released from the hospital, officials said. Mr. Mickles, who was shot in the stomach, remains hospitalized. On Friday, he was arraigned on charges that include attempted aggravated assault on a police officer and criminal possession of a weapon. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held on $200,000 cash bail.</p><p>Sheelagh McNeill<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ed Shanahan is a rewrite reporter and editor covering breaking news and general assignments on the Metro desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ed-shanahan">More about Ed Shanahan</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Mayor in Turmoil:</strong> As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html">federal investigations</a> swirl around Mayor Eric Adams, his political influence, his agenda and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/nyregion/eric-adams-scandal-crisis.html">his re-election effort are at risk</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Insurance Crisis Looms:</strong> The largest insurer of taxis and Ubers in New York City is insolvent.
