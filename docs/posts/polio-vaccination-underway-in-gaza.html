Since then, the Israeli military has launched an intense offensive in northern Gaza against what it has said is a resurgence of Hamas in the area.</p><p>A humanitarian pause for the second phase of the vaccination campaign was only assured for Gaza City, according to the U.N. agencies. They said that around 15,000 children under 10 in northern towns where the Israeli military has been carrying out the offensive over the last few weeks “remain inaccessible and will be missed during the campaign, compromising its effectiveness.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>COGAT, the Israeli government agency that oversees policy in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, said on Sunday that 58,604 children under 10 had been vaccinated in northern Gaza since the second phase of the campaign began a day earlier.

Col. Nadav Shoshani, <a href="https://x.com/LTC_Shoshani/status/1852819910893646299" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">replied</a> to that post on X, saying that an initial review by the military showed it had not struck in that area at that time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>UNICEF, the U.N. children’s agency, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/statement-unicef-executive-director-catherine-russell-deadly-weekend-attacks-north" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> separately that the vehicle of one of its staff members who was working on the polio campaign “came under fire by what we believe to be a quadcopter” while driving in northern Gaza on Saturday. The agency said that although the staff member was not injured, the attack illustrated the “grave consequences of the indiscriminate strikes on civilians in the Gaza Strip.” The Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about the incident.</p><p>Aid agencies sought to start a vaccination campaign in Gaza after traces of poliovirus were found in local wastewater in July, and a 10-month-old boy was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-vaccine.html" title="">confirmed in August</a> to be the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-crisis.html" title="">first resident of Gaza</a> to be paralyzed by poliovirus in 25 years.</p><p>In September, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-crisis.html" title="">temporary pauses in the war</a> agreed to by Israel and Hamas allowed aid workers to immunize about 640,000 children under 10 who were at risk of the disease. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-vaccine.html" title="">The campaign began</a> in central Gaza, then moved to the south and ended in the northern area.</p><p>Here’s what else is happening in the Middle East:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hezbollah rockets:</strong> At least 26 rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel on Sunday, the Israeli military said, adding that some had been intercepted while others had fallen in open areas. Hezbollah has launched near-daily aerial attacks on Israel since last October. Israeli ground troops invaded southern Lebanon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-ground-invasion.html" title="">around a month ago</a>, part of a campaign to cripple Hezbollah’s forces and infrastructure in the area.</p></li><li><p><strong>Eastern Lebanon:</strong> Israel’s military warned people to move away from several buildings in the Baalbek area of eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley on Sunday, saying it would target the buildings in the coming hours because they were used by Hezbollah. Last week, Lebanese officials said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-lebanon-baalbek-bekaa-valley.html" title="">Israeli airstrikes</a> had killed at least 60 people in the Bekaa Valley, the deadliest attacks in the region in recent weeks.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. bombers:</strong> The Pentagon has repositioned B-52 Stratofortress bombers from the Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota closer to the Middle East, according to the United States Central Command. It did not say <a href="https://x.com/CENTCOM/status/1852847593153294451" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how many bombers</a> had been moved, or where they are stationed, but the deployment is consistent with U.S. efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/world/middleeast/iran-threatens-retaliation-israel-strikes.html" title="">deter Iran</a> from launching a retaliatory attack on Israel.<span>  </span></p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hiba Yazbek covers the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a focus on Palestinian affairs and society in the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and Israel.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
