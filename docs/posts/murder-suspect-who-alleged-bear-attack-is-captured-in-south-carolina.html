Jones II of Monroe County, Tenn., <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/18JJX8zvwj/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced on Sunday</a> that Nicholas Wayne Hamlett, 45, had been taken into custody in Columbia, S.C., more than three weeks after police found a dead body near a bridge on the Cherohala Skyway, which runs through the town of Tellico Plains.</p><p>Mr. Hamlett faces first-degree murder charges related to the death of Steven Douglas Lloyd, 34, of Knoxville, Tenn., Sheriff Jones said in a statement on social media.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photo of Steven Douglas Lloyd released by the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Monroe County Sheriff&#39;s Office</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Lloyd’s body was discovered by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1044339927707394&amp;set=a.284744377000290&amp;type=3&amp;rdid=KUQhiln7KdT81k73&amp;share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2F1Dt3GgURms%2F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">police as they responded to a 911 call</a> made on Oct. 18.</p><p>The caller, who had identified himself as Brandon Kristopher Andrade, told the dispatcher that he had been chased off a cliff by a bear, leaving him injured and partially submerged in the water. When the police arrived at the scene, they found a deceased man with the ID of Mr. Andrade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But their investigation soon took a strange turn.</p><p>The injuries on the body, <a href="https://www.wate.com/news/monroe-county-news/update-in-search-for-monroe-county-murder-suspect/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the sheriff’s office said</a>, weren’t consistent with a bear attack or a fall. And neither the deceased man nor the 911 caller, they determined, were Mr. Andrade. It was a case of stolen identity, and Mr. Andrade’s name had been used on multiple occasions in other fraudulent schemes.</p><p>The police said Mr. Hamlett, a parolee with a long criminal history, had used Mr. Andrade’s identity. They also named Mr. Hamlett as a suspect in the killing of the man they had found, who had not yet been identified at that time. After the 911 call, the police said, Mr. Hamlett fled from his home and used a fake name when speaking with law enforcement in Knoxville, Tenn.</p><p>Earlier this month, the sheriff’s office <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/1B31VnJaWv/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">identified the murder victim</a> as Mr. Lloyd, a former foster child who had been known to live on the streets but who had kept in contact with his adoptive family. Mr. Hamlett, they added, befriended Mr. Lloyd before luring him into the woods and taking his life.</p><p>Mr. Lloyd’s family “was shocked to learn that their beloved son’s life had been taken by someone that Steven trusted,” the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Hamlett was captured on Sunday after a person <a href="https://x.com/ColumbiaPDSC/status/1855746671646527530" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recognized him at a hospital</a> in Columbia, S.C., and alerted the authorities. In addition to the murder charge, he also faces a parole violation in the state of Alabama.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kate Christobek is a reporter covering the civil and criminal cases against former president Donald J.
