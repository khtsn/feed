Explosions shook buildings and sent more than 16,000 people into the subway system to take shelter; clouds of smoke rose over the city as the sun came up.</p><p>One missile hit a two-story building with 12 apartments where emergency workers hunted for survivors. A five-story building next door lost all its windows. People stood outside, staring at the damage and talking on their phones, telling loved ones that they were alive. No military target was visible nearby.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said nearly 70 missiles, including ballistic ones, and about 150 attack drones had targeted cities across the country — although Kyiv was hit the hardest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Before cutting short a trip to South Africa, Mr. Zelensky said at a news conference there that he saw no indication Russia was being pressured to agree to a cease-fire. He said that with more pressure brought on Moscow, “we will be able to get closer to a complete, unconditional cease-fire.” To him, Mr. Zelensky added, the attack on Kyiv instead appeared intended to pressure the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/24vid-ukraine-cleanup-90346-cover/24vid-ukraine-cleanup-90346-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The assault was the deadliest on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, since last summer.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>About the same time, Mr. Trump lashed out at President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia about the attack, showing how his administration’s positions can seem to flip-flop without warning.</p><p>“Vladimir, STOP!” Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social, saying that he was “not happy” with the Russian strikes. “Not necessary, and very bad timing,” the post added.</p><p>The attack came hours after Mr. Trump and his top aides demanded that Kyiv accept an American-designed plan that would seemingly grant Russia all the territory it has gained in the war, which started with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">Moscow’s full-scale invasion</a> in February 2022. The plan also offered Kyiv only vague assurances about future security. So far, Mr. Zelensky has said Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/europe/ukraine-cease-fire-talks-london.html" title="">cannot accept</a> such a deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Since Mr. Trump took office in January, his administration has echoed Kremlin talking points in the war, a reversal of previous U.S. policy under the Biden administration. Over the past week, the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to walk away from the peace process, claiming that the two sides were both intransigent.</p><p>On Wednesday, planned peace talks in London <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/downgraded-peace-talks-between-us-ukraine-and-european-allies-begin-in-london/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were downgraded</a>, largely because the United States decided not to attend.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A group of people standing outside." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw/24int-ukraine-attacks-pvqw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/823ef9ce-c634-5769-9556-5f683a91cd3f" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the site of a Russian missile strike in Kyiv on Thursday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump later called Mr. Zelensky “inflammatory” in a post on social media and said the Ukrainian president would only “prolong the ‘killing field.’”</p><p>“The president’s frustrated; his patience is running very thin,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters later on Wednesday. She echoed Mr. Trump in appearing to blame Mr. Zelensky, saying that Ukraine’s leader seemed to be “moving in the wrong direction.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On Thursday, in his Truth Social post, Mr. Trump said he wanted to “get the Peace Deal DONE!”</p><p>Mr. Zelensky earlier pointed out that in March Ukraine accepted a U.S. proposal for a 30-day cease-fire but that Mr. Putin has refused to agree to that plan. While Mr. Putin did announce a temporary truce for Easter Sunday, it seemed more of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/world/europe/ukraine-russia-easter-truce.html" title="">public relations stunt</a> than a cease-fire along the front line. Ukrainian cities, at least, were largely spared for the truce’s 30 hours.</p><p>But that was not the case early on Thursday. Shortly after midnight, the first air alarms sounded.</p><p>Yevhenii Plakhotnikov, 40, lives just across the street from the two-story apartment building struck by a missile. He said that he had awaken to the alarm, heard the buzzing sound of drones and then started getting dressed. A message on Telegram — the messaging platform that many Ukrainians rely on for missile alerts — said a ballistic missile had been launched.</p><p>Mr. Plakhotnikov said he went to the hallway to put on his shoes.</p><p>“While I was putting on the second sneaker, I heard the first explosion,” he recalled in an interview. “Then I heard something heavy fall. All my interior doors were torn in half. I opened the door and saw shrapnel flying.”</p><p>He said he helped get other people out of his building. There, one man was standing, covered in blood. Another, a bit farther away, said merely, “That apartment building in the courtyard is gone.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Liuba Haldetskaya, 76, sitting outside her damaged apartment building on Thursday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Tetyana Hrynenko, 58, stood on the street, covering her mouth with her hands and looking up at her ruined apartment next to the flattened building.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The most important thing is that we are alive,” said Ms. Hrynenko, adding that she had heard two explosions, seen clouds of dust and smelled burning. She added: “People were shouting and asking for help. I looked out into the stairwell, and there were no stairs. And I live on the fifth floor.”</p><p>Residents managed to clear the stairwell of debris, allowing Ms. Hrynenko and others to make it outside.</p><p>Friends and relatives continued to show up outside the demolished apartment building hours after the attack, hoping for good news. But there was little to be had. A brother, 21, and a sister, 19, both died.</p><p>On Thursday afternoon, dozens of classmates and friends of Danylo Khudya, 17, came to hold a vigil. The teenager, known as Danya, was still missing under the rubble, along with his parents. Watching the emergency workers dig, the boys were stone-faced, while many of the girls, including Danya’s girlfriend, sobbed inconsolably.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I am waiting for Danya,” said one friend, Denys, 19, who did not want to give his last name.</p><p>Ukrainian officials have said that Russia has only intensified attacks against civilians since the start of U.S.-led peace negotiations.</p><p>Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, posted a video on social media showing emergency workers on Thursday. “Once again, Russia strikes civilians,” he said. Other Ukrainian officials urged Western partners to replenish Kyiv’s air defenses. </p><p>In March, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/03/19/7503662/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had pledged</a> to work with Mr. Zelensky to find U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems. But when Mr. Zelensky said this month that he wanted to buy Patriots from the United States, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5q0mev07lo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested that Ukraine</a> had “started the war” and said the Ukrainian president was “always looking to purchase missiles.”</p><p>The attack on Kyiv on Thursday was one of the deadliest of the war and the worst in the capital since July, when Russian missiles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/world/europe/russia-ukraine-missile-strikes-childrens-hospital.html" title="">destroyed a children’s hospital</a> and killed more than 20 people throughout the city. Recent deadly missile strikes have also targeted the cities of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/europe/ukraine-sumy-palm-sunday-russia-war.html" title="">Sumy</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/europe/ukraine-kryvyi-ri-attack.html" title="">Kryvyi Rih</a>, inflicting heavy civilian casualties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Emergency workers searching for victims under the rubble in Kyiv on Thursday.

Just after 5 p.m. local time, an emergency worker walked up to the huddle of teenagers and asked for any identifying marks of Danya. The workers had spotted a teenage boy’s body in the rubble. The teenagers volunteered some through their tears.</p><p>“Your friend is not with us anymore,” the worker told the teenagers, who burst into tears and hugged each other. And then, defeated, they left to go home.</p><p>Those affected by the strike said that they wanted the war to end but could not see accepting a one-sided deal that would benefit Russia. </p><p>“Yesterday, we were very disappointed that the negotiations hadn’t moved forward, and then overnight, it hit me directly,” said Ms. Hrynenko while surveying her damaged apartment. “I am disappointed. Exhausted.”</p><p>Mr. Plakhotnikov said he did not know of a way out for Ukraine.</p><p>“There’s no point in continuing the war,” he said, “but it’s also impossible to stop.”</p><p>Andrew E.
