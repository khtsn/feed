And I’d love to hear from you about the crazy, romantic, shocking or unconventional dating experiences that you or someone you know may have had.</p><p>Have you ever been ghosted by a date? Do you see the silver lining in situationships? Has your experience in a throuple been wildly successful (or perhaps a total catastrophe)? Do you have any unusual insights about dating over the age of 65? Do you use a matchmaker? Any tales about dating while disabled? I’m not looking for wedding announcements or features (do consider <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/wedding-feature-submission-form.html" title="">submitting your story to Vows</a> for that). I’m also not especially interested in publicity requests. I’m really searching for personal anecdotes and dating trends.</p><p>I read all submissions, occasionally write articles inspired by them and always reach back out to ask more questions. We don’t accept anonymous responses and I will never publish anything without your explicit permission. I also will not use your contact information for any other purpose or share it outside our newsroom. Please feel free to share this with a friend. Thanks!</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Gina Cherelus covers dating, relationships and culture for The Times and writes the weekly dating column <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/third-wheel">Third Wheel</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
