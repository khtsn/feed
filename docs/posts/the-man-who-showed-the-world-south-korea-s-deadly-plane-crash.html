</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Lee described how he had first been alerted to the plane’s approach when he heard loud sounds while working in the kitchen and noticed it flying low over his restaurant. Mr. Lee shot videos that were among the first the world saw of the crash, as well as that of firefighters rushing to put out the blaze. He talked about the challenge of dealing with the shock of what he had seen.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The transcript of this interview has been trimmed and edited for clarity.</p><h2 id="link-79410f20">‘There was something definitely wrong with the plane.’</h2><p>Around 8:57 a.m., I heard bangs. They sounded like incomplete combustion from motorbikes but louder and unfamiliar. I often hear guns being fired to chase away the birds, as well as noise from different construction work currently going on for runway expansion, road expansion, bullet train construction and such, as part of what I think is a project for a special zone surrounding the airport. But never have I heard that kind of banging noise. I thought it was strange, so I left my kitchen and went outside to the restaurant parking lot and looked up at the sky.</p><p>I saw the airplane. It was above my restaurant instead of over the runway. And the plane was tilted a bit to the right. It looked to me like the plane was about to make a landing, only toward my restaurant rather than toward the runway. I see planes over the runway frequently, including ones used for practices, and have a feel for the altitude when planes are about to land. But I have never, before this time, seen a plane fly so low and over my restaurant at that. It felt very low. I thought that was strange and went to the back of my restaurant and watched the back of the plane.</p><p>The plane was higher in the sky than when I observed it initially, and as it ascended, it was making a circle toward the right, doing a U-turn. It felt like this circle was a really small one, unlike the big circles that the trainee planes made that I had often witnessed in the sky. I felt that there was something definitely wrong with this plane and thought that I should take a video. That’s why I walked up to the rooftop.</p><p>On the rooftop, I shot the first video.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/31/31vid-witness-72733-cover/31vid-witness-72733-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Lee Geun-young</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-9911416">‘Do I need to get out of here?’</h2><p>One or two seconds after the crash, I felt a sudden rush of heat on my face like you would when you opened the door to a sauna. “Do I need to get out of here?” I thought.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-8"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/31/31vid-witness-61602-cover/31vid-witness-61602-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Lee Geun-young</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>I saw two or three residual blasts during this time. The first blast — that you see in the video — was so big that I could see fragments spurting.</p><p>And I think I saw some debris. When the smaller blasts occurred, I only saw smoke and flames.</p><p>I then came down from my restaurant building rooftop and walked over to the rooftop of another building that was closer to the airport. I took another video. I continued to feel the heat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-10"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/31/31vid-witness-94990-cover/31vid-witness-94990-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Lee Geun-young </span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>I felt it after I came down from the rooftop, too, when I took another video.

Every time I closed my eyes, I kept seeing afterimages of the blast from the crash. I stared at my phone and the news because I couldn’t go to sleep. At 6 a.m. this morning (Monday), I decided to get up and go to my restaurant. I drank alcohol this evening, hoping it would help me sleep tonight.</p><p>I am actually alone at the moment because my wife is over at my in-laws. I felt a little better after talking to my wife over the phone about how I had felt that day. Every time I go on the internet and see the news of the plane crash or related footage, I choke up.</p></div></div></section><div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
