The group’s rank and file has been decimated. Many of its hide-outs and stockpiles have been captured and destroyed.</p><p>But Hamas’s killing of an Israeli colonel in northern Gaza on Sunday underscored how the group’s military wing, though unable to operate as a conventional army, is still a potent guerrilla force with enough fighters and munitions to enmesh the Israeli military in a slow, grinding and as yet unwinnable war.</p><p>Col. Ehsan Daksa, a member of Israel’s Arab Druse minority, was killed when a planted explosive blew up near his tank convoy. It was a surprise attack that exemplified how Hamas has held out for nearly a year since Israel invaded Gaza late last October, and will likely be able to even after the death of its leader, Yahya Sinwar, last week.</p><p>Hamas’s remaining fighters are hiding from view in ruined buildings and the group’s vast underground tunnel network, much of which remains intact despite Israel’s efforts to destroy it, according to military analysts and Israeli soldiers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The fighters emerge briefly in small units to booby trap buildings, set roadside bombs, attach mines to Israeli armored vehicles or fire rocket-propelled grenades at Israeli forces before attempting to return underground.</p><p>While Hamas cannot defeat Israel in a frontal battle, its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/world/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israel-fighting.html" title="">small-scale, hit-and-run approach</a> has allowed it to continue to inflict harm on Israel and avoid defeat, even if, according to Israel’s unverified count, Hamas has lost more than 17,000 fighters since the start of the war.</p><p>“The guerrilla forces are working well and it will be very difficult to subdue them — not just in the short run, but in the long term,” said Salah al-Din al-Awawdeh, a Hamas member and a former fighter in the group’s military wing who is now an analyst based in Istanbul.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians carry their belongings as they flee from areas in the northern Gaza Strip this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Al-Qattaa/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Though Israel may have destroyed Hamas’s long-range rocket caches, Mr. al-Awawdeh said, “there are still endless explosive devices and light arms at hand.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some of those explosives were stockpiled before the start of the war. Others are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/28/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-weapons-rockets.html" title="">repurposed Israeli munitions</a> that failed to explode on impact, according to both Hamas and the Israeli military. Hamas released a <a href="https://x.com/afalkhatib/status/1848091161287860477" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> this week that appeared to show Hamas combatants turning an unexploded Israeli missile into an improvised bomb.</p><p>In open combat, Hamas’s fighters are no match for Israel’s army, as the killing of Mr. Sinwar in southern Gaza last week showed. Cornered in the ruins of Rafah, Mr. Sinwar was killed by an Israeli unit that could call on tanks, drones and snipers for backup.</p><p>But his death is unlikely to affect the capacity of the Hamas fighters in northern Gaza, according to Israeli and Palestinian analysts.</p><p>Since Israel took control last November of a key thoroughfare that divides north and south Gaza, Hamas’s leadership in the south, which included Mr. Sinwar, has exercised little direct control over fighters in the north. And after over a year of guerrilla fighting, Hamas’s remaining fighters are likely now used to making decisions locally instead of taking orders from a centralized command structure.</p><p>In addition, the group said over the summer that it had recruited new fighters, though it is unclear how many it signed up, or how well trained they are.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Hamas has also benefited from Israel’s refusal to either hold ground or transfer power in Gaza to an alternative Palestinian leadership. Time and again, Israeli soldiers have forced Hamas from a neighborhood, only to retreat within weeks without handing power to Hamas’s Palestinian rivals. That has allowed the group to return and re-exert control, often prompting the Israeli military to return months or even weeks later.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli armored fighting vehicles make their way to the northern Gaza Strip, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Abir Sultan/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Israel’s current campaign in Jabaliya in northern Gaza, where Colonel Daksa was killed, is at least its third operation there over the past year.</p><p>Israeli officials say that this latest action is necessary to undercut a resurgent Hamas.</p><p>Yet the aimlessness of Israel’s strategy has led to questions from both Israelis and Palestinians about why its soldiers were sent again to Jabaliya.</p><p>“We occupy territories, and then we get out,” said Michael Milstein, an Israeli analyst of Palestinian affairs. “This kind of doctrine means that you find yourself in endless war.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Meanwhile, Palestinians say this operation in Jabaliya has been one of the most traumatic of an already brutal war. As fighting intensifies, the specter of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/gaza-hunger-war-israel.html" title="">famine</a> once again looms over northern Gaza, and health care workers have warned that the area’s last remaining hospitals are at risk of collapse.</p><p>For Palestinians, the general assumption is that this is an attempt to expel the remaining population of northern Gaza. The majority of the north’s prewar population — roughly one million people — fled south at the war’s onset, but about 400,000 are thought to remain.</p><p>The Palestinian alarm has been partly fomented by a prominent former Israeli general, Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland, who has publicly pressed Israel’s government to depopulate northern Gaza by cutting off food and water.</p><p>Under General Eiland’s plan, the Israeli military would give the remaining 400,000 one week to move south before declaring the north a closed military zone. Israel would then block all supplies to the north in an effort to force Hamas militants to capitulate and return the hostages it has been holding since last October’s attack on Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“They will face two alternatives: either to surrender or to die of starvation,” General Eiland, a former director of Israel’s national security council, said in an interview.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People mourn Colonel Daksa during his funeral in the Druze village of Daliyat al-Karmel, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shir Torem/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Any civilians who refused to leave would suffer the consequences, without any new supplies entering, the general said.</p><p>“We are giving them all the chance. And if some of them decide to stay, well, it is probably their problem,” said General Eiland.</p><p>The plan has generated significant debate and some support in Israel, including from government ministers and lawmakers, as some Israelis seek decisive solutions to a repetitive war.</p><p>Human rights advocates have said that such a policy, if carried out, would violate international law and severely threaten the welfare of civilians in northern Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Michael Sfard, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said General Eiland’s plan would involve “the deliberate creation of humanitarian crises as a weapon of war.” Besieging an enemy in a small area could be acceptable, he said, but not a siege of such a wide territory.</p><p>The general’s proposals “could very likely amount to a war crime,” said Mr. Sfard.</p><p>Both Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman, and Omer Dostri, the spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said this month that the government is not implementing the plan.</p><p>Still, Mr. Dostri said Mr. Netanyahu had studied the plan.</p><p>Palestinians speculate that a version of it has become Israeli government policy: Israel has issued evacuation warnings for more neighborhoods in northern Gaza, home to at least tens of thousands of people, and the amount of aid entering the area has sharply declined the start of October.</p><p>Montaser Bahja, 50, said he fled his home in Jabaliya to shelter elsewhere in northern Gaza at the start of Israel’s renewed operation. He said relatives who remained have described Israel’s bombardments as unusually fierce, and that the new policy appeared to be part of an attempt — along with the restriction on humanitarian aid — to force people to move south.</p><p>“They might be shy about saying it in front of the world and deny it,” said Mr. Bahja, a high school English teacher. “But based on what they’re doing on the ground, it seems like that’s what it is.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Israeli officials have said that they allow plenty of aid into all parts of Gaza and blamed shortages on the United Nations and relief organizations’ logistical challenges.</p><p>Just 410 relief trucks have entered Gaza in the first three weeks of October, compared to roughly 3,000 in September, according to the United Nations. The Israeli military’s <a href="https://gaza-aid-data.gov.il/main/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">own figures</a> show a similar drop.</p><p>Prices of vegetables and canned goods in northern Gaza’s makeshift street markets are skyrocketing, Palestinians say, adding to concerns among rights activists that Israeli restrictions have already led to widespread hunger.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians gather to receive food distributed by a charity kitchen in Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip, in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Issa/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Myra Noveck<!-- --> reported from Jerusalem and <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> from Rehovot, Israel.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
