    <h1>Colleges Warn International Students to Return Ahead of Trump Term</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With students at many colleges wrapping up final exams this week and preparing for their winter break, a number of schools, including <a href="https://www.hio.harvard.edu/news/essential-information-winter-travel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harvard</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-12-09/la-me-international-students-trump" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S.C</a>. and <a href="https://international.globallearning.cornell.edu/alerts/guidance-possible-immigration-changes-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cornell</a>, are advising their international students to return to campus before President-elect Donald J. Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20.</p><p>During his last administration, Mr. Trump imposed restrictions on entry to the United States from seven majority-Muslim countries, a policy that <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/30/students-and-scholars-are-stranded-after-trump-bars-travel-nationals-7-countries" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stranded thousands of students</a> who were abroad at the time. Later in his term, Mr. Trump added more countries to the restricted travel list. And he has spoken of wanting to reimpose those restrictions once he is back in the White House.</p><p>“A travel ban is likely to go into effect soon after inauguration,” Cornell’s Office of Global Learning warned students on its website late last month, advising them to be back in the United States before the start of spring-semester classes on Jan. 21. “The ban is likely to include citizens of the countries targeted in the first Trump administration: Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Myanmar, Sudan, Tanzania, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, and Somalia. New countries could be added to this list, particularly China and India.”</p><p>Colleges are also warning all students to prepare for possible delays at the border and in the processing of paperwork.</p></div></div>
