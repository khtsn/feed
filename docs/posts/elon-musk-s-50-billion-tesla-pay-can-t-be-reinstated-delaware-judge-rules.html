    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Delaware judge on Monday upheld her earlier ruling that a giant pay package that Tesla awarded its chief executive, Elon Musk, must be rescinded.</p><p>The pay, in the form of stock options, was worth more than $50 billion and helped make Mr. Musk the richest person in the world.</p><p>The judge, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/business/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package.html" title="">struck down the award</a> in January, ruling that shareholders had not been properly informed of its details and that members of Tesla’s board were not sufficiently independent.</p><p>But lawyers for Tesla and Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/business/elon-musk-pay-delaware.html" title="">argued</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/business/tesla-shareholder-vote-elon-musk.html" title="">a second shareholder vote in June</a> in favor of the package cleared the way for effectively reinstating it.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
