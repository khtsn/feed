    <h1>Elon Musk’s $50 Billion Tesla Pay Can’t Be Reinstated, Delaware Judge Rules</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The pay comes from a 2018 award that said Mr. Musk would get all the options only if Tesla’s stock price soared and its sales and earnings grew strongly. Few expected Mr. Musk to achieve all of those targets because Tesla was still struggling to sell enough electric cars to become profitable. But Tesla’s business took off and its stock rocketed higher, allowing Mr. Musk to earn all the options. He has to hold them for five years.</p><p>The shareholder who brought the suit, Richard J. Tornetta, contended that Tesla’s board had not acted independently of Mr. Musk when devising the package and that the company had provided “materially misleading” information to investors. In her January ruling, after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/business/elon-musk-tesla-delaware-court.html" title="">trial in 2022</a>, Chancellor McCormick said, “The process leading to the approval of Musk’s compensation plan was deeply flawed.”</p><p>To try to get the judge to change her mind, Tesla’s lawyers argued that shareholders were sufficiently informed when they voted again for the package in June. But in her ruling on Monday, Chancellor McCormick wrote that the Tesla lawyers’ arguments had several flaws. Among them was that they could not hope to flip a decision “based on evidence they created after trial.”</p><p>She also said a “stockholder vote standing alone cannot ratify a conflicted-controller transaction,” referring to a situation in which a major shareholder has influence over a board and its decisions.</p><p>Tesla’s board of directors will most likely try to fashion a new pay package that falls under the jurisdiction of Texas, where the company has since moved its corporate registration from Delaware, said Charles Elson, the founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.</p></div></div>
