That was followed by “12 rounds of weekly chemotherapy” and “three weeks of radiation,” her post said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I’m happy to say I’m feeling great,” said Ms. Fischer, who is also an author and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/arts/television/the-office-jenna-fischer-podcast.html" title="">co-host of a popular podcast</a> about “The Office” with Angela Kinsey, a former co-star from the show. Ms. Fischer said she was continuing a treatment plan that includes infusions of targeted therapy.</p><p>A representative for Ms. Fischer declined a request for an additional comment from the actress on Tuesday.</p><p>In addition to her role in “The Office,” a television show that ran on NBC for eight years and is among the most popular shows in television history, Ms. Fischer has also acted in popular comedic films, including “Blades of Glory” and the <a href="https://playbill.com/article/the-offices-jenna-fischer-joins-mean-girls-movie-musical" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">movie musical version of “Mean Girls,”</a> playing the main character’s mother.</p><p>Sprinkled within her post were jokes and references to her character on “The Office.”</p><p>“‘Take care of your ticking time bags,’” Ms. Fischer wrote, referencing a quote from Michael Scott, the boss of the paper company Dunder Mifflin in Scranton, Pa., where “The Office” takes place.</p><p>News of Ms. Fischer’s cancer diagnosis shocked fans, who wrote thousands of supportive messages in the comment section of her Instagram post. Ms. Fischer said she wore wigs to hide her hair loss so that she could keep her diagnosis private until she was ready to share the news.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Dr. Cesar Santa-Maria, a medical oncologist and associate professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins, reviewed Ms. Fischer’s post and said she had been diagnosed with an “aggressive subtype of breast cancer.”</p><p>“But because of the treatments we have now,” Dr. Santa-Maria continued, “it’s the most curable. Twenty years ago? Not the case.”</p><p>Catching the tumor early on, when it was in Stage 1, was critical for her to have a successful treatment, Dr. Santa-Maria said. Women at average risk for breast cancer should talk to their doctors about getting their annual mammograms beginning at age 40, he added.</p><p>“Again, don’t skip your mammogram,” Ms. Fischer wrote, reminding her followers that October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. She said that Michael Scott “was right. Get ’em checked ladies.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the World of Comedy</h2><hr/><ul><li><p>In the most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/television/ellen-degeneres-netflix-for-your-approval.html">insightful part of Ellen DeGeneres’s Netflix special</a>, “For Your Approval,” she says that she was a poor fit to run a workplace but that women leaders are judged differently.</p></li><li><p>It’s becoming harder for comics with more talent than connections to break through at comedy clubs. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/arts/television/comedy-club-booking.html">Is the booking process to blame?</a></p></li><li><p>Here are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/arts/adam-sandler-love-you-netflix-special.html">three stand-up specials to stream</a>, including Adam Sandler’s ‘Love You,’ which feels like a sequel to the film ‘Uncut Gems,” according to our writer.</p></li><li><p>Conner O’Malley, a cult hero in the comedy world, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/arts/conner-omalley-comedian.html">specializes in desperately ambitious men</a> doomed to fail.
