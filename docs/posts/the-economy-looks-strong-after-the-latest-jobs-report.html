    <h1>The Economy Looks Strong After the Latest Jobs Report</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The American labor market, which for months has worried even some optimistic economists, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/business/economy/jobs-report-september.html" title="">looked in remarkably good shape today</a> after the government released a new employment report. Businesses added 254,000 jobs last month, far outpacing expectations. The unemployment rate declined to 4.1 percent and wage growth remained strong.</p><p>The robust jobs numbers align with other strong economic data to paint <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/business/economy/job-market-hiring-wage.html" title="">a portrait of a solid economy</a>. Consumer spending has been holding up, overall growth has been solid and inflation has ticked town. Employers appear to be meeting resilient consumer demand by expanding their work forces.</p><p>The fresh data is good news for the Federal Reserve, the White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/business/jobs-report-harris-economy.html" title="">and Kamala Harris</a>. The report came less than a day after striking dockworkers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/business/economy/dockworkers-strike-ports-reopen.html" title="">agreed to return to work</a>, avoiding what could have been a major economic disruption before the election. The vice president has been trying to argue that she and President Biden deftly led the economy through the challenges of the pandemic.</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>a surge in pandemic era start-ups has helped drive job growth, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/business/economy/pandemic-startups-small-business-economy.html" title="">could have longer-term benefits</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People gathered for Friday prayers led by Iran’s supreme leader, in Tehran.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-59a5333e">Iran’s leader threatened to attack Israel again</h2><p>Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the Friday prayer in Tehran for the first time in nearly five years. He used the rare appearance to praise the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and warn that Iran would strike Israel again if it continued its military campaigns against his allies, Hezbollah and Hamas. At the same time, Iran’s foreign minister was in Beirut, appearing eager to convey Iran’s readiness to support a joint cease-fire in Lebanon and in Gaza. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/04/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>Overnight, Israeli warplanes carried out a strike in an area just south of Beirut that targeted Hashem Safieddine, the presumed new leader of Hezbollah. It is unclear whether Safieddine was killed.</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>American officials said that the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/sinwar-hamas-israel-hezbollah-iran.html" title="">holding out for a wider regional war</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The scene in Butler, Pa., after the shooting of Donald Trump in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-5940043a">Trump is returning to the site where he was shot</h2><p>A few days after he was shot by a would-be assassin in Butler, Pa., Donald Trump said he would tell the story once, and never again. Then he spent the next three months stitching the shooting into a campaign narrative about “them” — the Democrats, the Deep State, the Marxists and the news media — trying to stop him at all costs.</p><p>Tomorrow, that effort will culminate in Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/elections/trump-butler-assassination-attempt.html" title="">dramatic return to the scene of the shooting for a huge campaign rally</a>. The former president will be given enhanced protection, but some law enforcement officials are still concerned, and one former Secret Service officer called it “ill-advised.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Javonte Hill experienced psychosis after smoking marijuana legally purchased in Colorado.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chet Strange for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-76f22">Marijuana use is growing, and so are the harms</h2><p>Marijuana is now legal in 24 states, and people are consuming more of the drug, more often and at ever-higher potencies.
