Trump selected Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota on Tuesday to run the Homeland Security Department, a critical position in charge of the nation’s immigration system.</p><p>Mr. Trump has made an immigration crackdown a central element of his administration’s promises, with pledges to not only more aggressively police the border but to also carry out a wide-scale deportation operation throughout the country.</p><p>Ms. Noem will play a crucial role in helping Mr. Trump deliver on those promises as she will be in charge of agencies that enforce immigration laws, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p><p>In a statement on social media, Mr. Trump called Ms. Noem “very strong on Border Security,” noting that she sent National Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border as governor. Ms. Noem, in her own social media statement, pledged to “secure the border and restore safety to American communities so families will again have the opportunity to pursue the American Dream.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If she is confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Noem will lead an agency that oversees entities including the Coast Guard and the Secret Service, which has weathered criticism over two attempts on Mr. Trump’s life during the presidential campaign.</p><p>History suggests it will be challenging to keep Mr. Trump satisfied: During his first term, Mr. Trump cycled through six homeland security leaders.</p><p>During her time as governor, Ms. Noem has made immigration a key talking point. She has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration’s immigration policies.</p><p>“Biden’s open border policies are facilitating illegal border crossings,” she said in <a href="https://x.com/KristiNoem/status/1754520529250177131" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post on X</a> earlier this year. “This invasion must end. The federal government has to stop violating federal law. And we need to go back to President Trump’s successful immigration policies immediately.”</p><p>Ms. Noem has taken action on immigration enforcement as well: In line with other Republican state leaders, <a href="https://news.sd.gov/news?id=news_kb_article_view&amp;sysparm_article=KB0040356&amp;sys_kb_id=8e463def1b07695062c8a8eae54bcb50&amp;spa=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she sent</a> National Guard troops in 2023 to help Gov.

In the meantime, South Dakota will not be accepting any relocation of illegal immigrants from President Biden,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kristi.noem/videos/noem-refuses-to-accept-illegal-immigrants-in-sd/315849780180392/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she said</a> on Facebook in April 2021.</p><p>Ms. Noem became a subject of controversy when she revealed in a memoir that she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/05/us/politics/kristi-noem-biden-dog.html" title="">shot and killed a family dog</a> she was training because it was “dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz">More about Hamed Aleaziz</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/homeland-security-department">Homeland Security Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/kristi-noem">Kristi Noem</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump’s Crackdown:</strong> President-elect Donald Trump has promised the largest deportation effort in U.S. history.
