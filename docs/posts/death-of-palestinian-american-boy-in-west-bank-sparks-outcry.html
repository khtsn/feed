Two other Palestinian American teenagers who were with Amer at the time were shot and injured by the soldiers, the family said.</p><p>Amer, who was originally from Saddle Brook, N.J., moved with his family to the West Bank around 2013. The family said that since then, it had divided its time between the West Bank and New Jersey.</p><p>At a news conference on Tuesday, community leaders stood at a small wooden lectern at the Palestinian American Community Center in Clifton, N.J., to decry Amer’s death and call on the U.S. government to investigate the shooting. They were joined by Rami Jbara, an uncle of Amer’s, and by Amer’s father, Mohammed Rabee, who called in remotely from the West Bank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We cannot let this horrific crime be swept under the rug,” said Rania Mustafa, the center’s executive director.</p><p>“Our stories are consistently ignored,” she added. “Our people are consistently dehumanized. Our deaths are repeatedly ignored.”</p><p>The outcry over Amer’s death comes weeks after Israel launched a series of attacks on Gaza, breaking a cease-fire agreement in its war against Hamas. Just over 900 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers in the West Bank since Hamas’s attacks against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the United Nations</a>. Roughly 30 Israelis have been killed in the West Bank during the same period.</p><p>When asked Tuesday about Amer’s death, the Israel Defense Forces did not acknowledge the boy by name.</p><p>“During a counterterrorism activity in the area of Turmus Aya, I.D.F. soldiers identified three terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving,” a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement. “The soldiers opened fire toward the terrorists who were endangering civilians, eliminating one terrorist and hitting two additional terrorists.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>At the news conference, Mr. Rabee, 49, recounted the events surrounding his son’s death. He said he had been at home taking a nap on Sunday when Amer left to pick almonds. Mr. Rabee said he later woke to a phone call in which he learned that his son had been wounded.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mohammed Rabee, Amer Rabee’s father, said Tuesday that his son had gone out to pick almonds before he was killed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Anselm for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Rabee said he had called the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem seeking medical help, but that the aid did not arrive in time. He said he learned an hour later that his son was dead and that his body had been taken to an Israeli military camp. It was there, several hours later, that he found his son’s body in a bag, Mr. Rabee said.</p><p>Ayoub Ijbara, one of the teenagers with Amer on Sunday, was shot three times, but managed to flee and find help, according a statement from the community center, whose members spoke to Ayoub’s family. Surveillance footage showed that the soldiers fired 47 shots at the three boys while they were picking almonds, according to the statement.</p><p>“Amer was shot in the chest and fell backward to the ground,” the statement said. “The other two boys went to help him, but too many shots were fired and so they began to retreat.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ayoub, 15, had a six-hour surgery on Monday and is scheduled to have another procedure on Wednesday, according to the statement. The boy was born in Little Ferry, N.J., the community center said, and moved to Tennessee before he and his family relocated to Turmus Aya.</p><p>Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey called Amer’s death an “atrocity” in <a href="https://x.com/RepBonnie/status/1909275325709566356" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an X post on Monday</a>. The state’s governor, Philip D. Murphy, demanded in <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562025/approved/20250408a.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> that the Israeli government provide answers about why Amer had been killed, lamenting the “tragic loss of life.”</p><p>The Israel Defense Forces sent a <a href="https://x.com/idfonline/status/1908992126236385590" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">black-and-white video</a> with its statement on Tuesday that it said showed Amer and the two other teenagers throwing rocks.</p><p>Mr. Rabee said he had seen the video and that there was no way to tell if Amer was one of the three people. Even if he was, Mr. Rabee said, Amer did not deserve to die.</p><p>“This land is called holy land,” Mr. Rabee said. “There’s supposed to be peace in this land, not war.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shayla Colon is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Tensions in the Middle East</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-israel-gaza.html">President Trump is more aligned than his predecessor</a> on Gaza with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skepticism About U.S.-Iran Talks</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/israel-iran-reaction.html">Many Israelis were surprised</a> when Trump announced that the United States would engage in “direct” negotiations with Iran in an effort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html">to rein in the country’s nuclear</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html"> program.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Attempt to Fire Israeli Spy Chief:</strong> Israel’s highest court began hearing a case over Netanyahu’s decision to replace one of his top intelligence chiefs — a courtroom battle that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/israel-supreme-court-spy-chief.html">could open the door to a constitutional crisis</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Strikes in Yemen:</strong> In closed briefings, Pentagon officials have acknowledged that there has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/us-strikes-yemen-houthis.html">only limited success</a> in destroying the Houthis’ vast, largely underground arsenal of missiles, drones and launchers, according to congressional aides and allies.</p></li><li><p><strong>One Gazan Family’s Story:</strong> The Abu Teirs thought the cease-fire might mean they could start to rebuild their lives.
