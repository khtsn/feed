It took many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/13/theater/broadway-reopening.html" title="">a year and a half</a>.</p><p>Since live performances resumed, the recovery has been uneven, but there are signs that audiences are finally coming back. Here’s a snapshot of where things stand:</p><h2 id="link-6423a577">Broadway is 95 percent back.</h2><p>It’s been a slow road back for Broadway, but the industry is finally nearing its prepandemic levels. Attendance so far this season is at about 95 percent of what it was at the same point in the 2018-2019 season, its last full season before the pandemic, when it was setting records.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/theater/oh-mary-cole-escola-review.html" title="">“Oh, Mary!” has been a surprise hit this season</a>, reminding the industry that shows can work without known I.P. or famous stars. “Wicked” is defying gravity thanks to the renewed interest brought by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/movies/wicked-review.html" title="">the film adaptation</a>. For the first time since 2018, all 41 Broadway theaters have had shows in them this season. And there are more shows than usual regularly grossing more than $1 million a week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The crowds have returned to Broadway, and to the Times Square area. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But — and this is a big but — profitability is down. That’s because the costs of producing on Broadway keep rising, so even reasonably strong ticket sales are not enough.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Beyond Times Square, the picture is decidedly mixed. Touring Broadway shows have been selling quite strongly. But nonprofit theaters, both Off Broadway and in cities across the country, are struggling. Having burned through the government assistance that came at the height of the pandemic, many regional theaters are now reporting budget deficits and are programming fewer shows and attracting smaller audiences than they did previously.</p><p>— <!-- -->Michael Paulson</p><h2 id="link-77de3069">The pop touring industry is setting records thanks to big names and rising ticket prices.</h2><p>The multibillion-dollar business of pop music tours reached a new high in 2024, with fans spending $9.5 billion for tickets to the top 100 tours, according to the trade publication Pollstar. That is up an astonishing 71 percent from 2019, the last full year before the pandemic.</p><p>Those numbers are driven by superstar outings by the likes of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé and Coldplay, and by the industry’s willingness to consistently raise ticket prices. (According to Pollstar, a seat to one of the top global tours now goes for an average of almost $136, up from $79 a decade ago.) Swift’s Eras Tour alone, which spanned 149 shows in 2023 and 2024, sold a record <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/arts/music/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticket-sales.html" title="">$2.1 billion in tickets</a>, to say nothing of the small fortunes dropped by fans on merchandise and friendship bracelet beads.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour sold a record $2.1 billion in tickets in 2023 and 2024.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lindsey Wasson/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But there are still signs of potential trouble ahead. The pace of growth slowed last year. Consumers continue to gripe over high ticket prices and rampant markups by scalpers (though that has not kept fans from scooping up every available seat for Oasis and Kendrick Lamar). And for artists who are not celebrities, rapidly rising costs and stagnant performance fees have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/apr/25/shocking-truth-money-bands-make-on-tour-taylor-swift" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eating away</a> at already-thin margins, putting touring out of reach for many unsigned artists.</p><p>— <!-- -->Ben Sisario</p><h2 id="link-1b3a0ee9">Hollywood has fewer big screens, fewer wide releases and fewer moviegoers.</h2><p>When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/movies/sean-baker-oscars-speech.html" title="">Sean Baker accepted his Oscar</a> for best director at this years’s Academy Awards for his film “Anora,” he issued what he called a “battle cry” to the movie industry: “Filmmakers, keep making films for the big screen.”</p><p>There are fewer of those big screens in the United States now than there were before the pandemic: 35,481, down from 41,172, according to the London-based research firm Omdia. The total box office last year, topped by Disney’s “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool and Wolverine” was $8.7 billion, down from $11.3 billion in 2019. Total admissions were about 800 million last year, down from 1.3 billion before the pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The director Sean Baker, who won four Oscars last month for “Anora,” urged filmmakers to keep making movies for the big screen. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Last year was the first since the pandemic that the domestic box office did not improve upon the prior year — a development the industry attributes largely to the strikes that shut down filmmaking for half of 2023, which depleted the number of films ready for release. Wide releases, or films that play on more than 2,000 screens, dropped to 94 last year from 101 in 2023 — and from 112 in 2019.</p><p>With fewer films in the can, some studios upended their distribution plans and released movies that had been initially slated to debut on streaming platforms in theaters, including Disney’s “Moana 2,” Paramount’s “Mean Girls” and “Red One” from Amazon Studios.</p><p>— <!-- -->Nicole Sperling</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-7120584b">The Met Opera has pivoted to new works, and Opera Philadelphia is offering $11 seats.</h2><p>Even before the pandemic, many American opera companies were struggling to survive — with audiences aging and dwindling, and expenses rising for an art form that requires large orchestras, casts and choruses and often elaborate stagings.</p><p>So some have tried to reinvent themselves since reopening.</p><p>The Metropolitan Opera decided to focus on contemporary opera, hoping to reach new audiences. It reopened from the shutdown in 2021 with Terence Blanchard’s “Fire Shut Up in My Bones,” its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/23/arts/music/terence-blanchard-met-opera.html" title="">first work by a Black composer,</a> which sold out. But the strategy has had mixed results since then: Jeanine Tesori’s “Grounded,” which opened the current season, had attendance of 50 percent. The Met, which has drawn tens of millions of dollars from its endowment fund since reopening, is on track to hit 75 percent attendance this season, returning to prepandemic levels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Metropolitan Opera is staging more new work. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Other opera companies have also pivoted. Opera Philadelphia is now offering all seats for $11 (or a higher voluntary price), in a bid to attract audiences. Los Angeles Opera, citing rising expenses, canceled plans for two world premieres: Mason Bates’s “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay” and Missy Mazzoli’s “Lincoln in the Bardo.” Many opera companies have cut back on productions and performances to save money.</p><p>— <!-- -->Javier C.

Now fans are making up for lost time, and leagues are looking to capitalize.</p><p>The four major North American professional sports leagues — the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League — all reported attendance upticks from their most recent seasons compared to their last full seasons before the pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The cardboard cutouts are gone at sporting events, and real fans have returned in droves, including last month at the Super Bowl. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Kask for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The N.F.L. saw the sharpest percentage increase — about 18.7 million fans attended games in 2024, a 10-percent spike from just over 17 million in 2019 — in part because an extra game was added to its regular season schedule in 2021 as part of a new media-rights package. Baseball came in second with a 4.1 percent increase — 71.3 million people attended games last season, up from 68.5 million in 2019.</p><p>New state-of-the-art venues are being built, and many stadiums are being renovated to add more seats, including premium luxury suites and club areas. Leagues have also prioritized hospitality packages for high-paying customers, including better food options and expanded perks at events, such as access to the field for pictures after the Super Bowl.</p><p>— <!-- -->Emmanuel Morgan</p><h2 id="link-243ff1d7">Orchestras are recovering, but San Francisco found it could no longer afford its star maestro.</h2><p>Orchestras feared that it would be difficult to recover from the shutdown and from their uneven first years back, when many older patrons remained wary of in-person performances. But the number of tickets sold last year was roughly back to prepandemic levels, according to a study of 47 medium and large orchestras by TRG Arts, an analytics firm, in partnership with the League of American Orchestras.</p><p>While the number of single tickets orchestras sold decreased slightly, the number of tickets sold through packages to multiple concerts actually increased, bucking a yearslong decline. The League said that the gains were driven largely by existing subscribers spending more than before on larger and more expensive subscriptions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen is leaving the San Francisco Symphony, which has scaled back some of its ambitions as it seeks to cut costs. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ulysses Ortega for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But many orchestras are facing serious financial struggles, since box office revenue covers only a small portion of their expenses and fund-raising has been a challenge.
