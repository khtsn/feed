</span> and a couple close shaves against other teams earlier in the tournament. This time, the train was full steam ahead on their defense, at one point leading 8-1 after a bonus conversion and some sharp shooting from their side.</p>


<p><em>PRX disrespects the enemy Vyse&#39;s Steel Garden and cleans up with their sidearms.</em></p>

<p><span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/7378/jinggg">
		Jinggg	</a>
</span> in particular was lights-out in the first half, ending it with 20 kills to only five deaths on Sage. DRX managed a couple more rounds but still found themselves with a 9-3 deficit to overcome at halftime.</p>

<p>Despite the deficit, DRX led the second half with confidence, winning the second pistol, repeatedly shutting PRX down with aggression into Mid. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/28400/hyunmin">
		HYUNMIN	</a>
</span> came alive as the tip of their spear on Waylay, finding six total first kills as a key part of his team&#39;s defense.</p>


<p><em>HYUNMIN was a menace in Mid all throughout the second half of Ascent.</em></p>

<p>A big ultimate investment for PRX at 10-10 nearly went awry, but Jinggg saved them with a 3K in a 3v5 situation. Building on that momentum, PRX got up to 12; however, DRX wrested back control to force extra innings. While both teams continued to thrive on defense in overtime, DRX won the crucial attack round at 13-13, spurring them on to claim Ascent 15-13.  </p>

<p>HYUNMIN&#39;s individual impact surpassed even Jinggg&#39;s by the map&#39;s end; the Korean duelist put up an unbelievable 36/19/1 KDA, 220 ADR, and eight first kills compared to Jinggg&#39;s 28/19/5 KDA, 175 ADR, and seven first kills. </p>

<p>“I just had to put confidence into my team and for myself, so I just started peeking everything,” HYUNMIN said of his performance in the post-match interview. </p>

<p>The second map was PRX&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542278/drx-vs-paper-rex-valorant-champions-2025-lr3/?game=233496&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Lotus</a>. After a lackluster showing on the map against FNATIC in their <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542264/fnatic-vs-drx-valorant-champions-2025-ubqf" target="_blank">first playoff match</a>, DRX switched out HYUNMIN&#39;s Waylay for a Raze, resulting in an exact mirror of PRX&#39;s Raze-Yoru composition.</p>

<p>DRX opened with a pistol win, with HYUNMIN continuing his hot streak with a 3K. The next several rounds were back-and-forth, the score going from 2-2 to 3-3 to 5-5 as both teams attempted to respond to each other around the map. In the end, DRX pulled ahead to a 7-5, overwhelming PRX on the bombsites with strong firepower to claim a slight advantage.</p>

<p>A second pistol went DRX&#39;s way after a 4K from <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4462/mako">
		MaKo	</a>
</span>, with the ensuing bonus setting up an 11-5 lead in their favor. PRX found a few more rounds with two strong A hits and a Showstopper 1v3 from Jinggg to get the score to 12-8, but the gap proved too wide for the train to cross and DRX closed it out 13-8.</p>


<p><em>MaKo and HYUNMIN shut down A Tree to claim the second pistol on Lotus.</em></p>

<p>MaKo was a safe pair of hands for DRX in the map, ending 17/8/14 on Omen. HYUNMIN also continued to shine, going 19/13/3 to end the series with a total KDA of 55/32/4 and a remarkable 200 ADR over the course of 49 rounds.</p>

<p>With this win, DRX sends PRX home in fourth place and moves on to the top three at Champions, matching their previous best placement of third back at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1015/valorant-champions-2022" target="_blank">Champions 2022</a>. They will face FNATIC tomorrow in a rematch with the last spot in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542272/nrg-vs-tbd-valorant-champions-2025-gf" target="_blank">grand final</a>, where <span data-ref-id="8">
