    <h1>The Brooklyn Stroll Club Has Brought Together Fathers in Search of Friendship</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>On a warm Saturday morning in March, while the 20-something influencers and young finance bros of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/29/style/williamsburg-brooklyn-history-timeline.html" title="">Williamsburg</a> were still asleep, a group of more than 30 men gathered in McCarren Park.</p><p>Some were coming from as far as the Catskills and others from a few steps away. Greetings transitioned to talk of sleep training and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/14/technology/baby-gear-tech.html" title="">stroller envy</a>, and the bonding happened quickly. After all, they all had one major thing in common: babies. “How old is yours?” they asked one another as the group grew.</p><p>Benjamin Velez, 32, jogged up to the crowd with his 1-year-old daughter, Wynter, fresh from working an overnight shift as a switchboard operator and receptionist. One of the other men commented on the Monster energy drink in his stroller, and Mr. Velez pointed out that it also contained coffee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Victor Ayala, 36, a quality control inspector, and his 2-year-old, Cassius, pulled up to the park in an Uber from Cobble Hill. The pair was praised for their style: Mr. Ayala was wearing a jersey, a white canvas jacket with black stripes, yellow sneakers and a Brooklyn Stroll Club hat. Cassius was kicking back in a Bape x Airbuggy stroller that his dad’s friend had shipped from Japan.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/12STROLL-CLUB-33104-cover/12STROLL-CLUB-33104-cover-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/12STROLL-CLUB-33104-cover/12STROLL-CLUB-33104-cover-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/09/137342_1_12STROLL-CLUB-33104_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Victor Ayala shaking hands with Joe Gonzales before the group of about 35 men and babies walked to Canopy, a play space in Williamsburg.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/12/multimedia/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/12/multimedia/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/12/multimedia/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man with a beard and tattoos holds a young baby while chatting with other men, also holding babies." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/12/multimedia/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/12/multimedia/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/12/multimedia/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/12/multimedia/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf/12STROLL-CLUB-06-qzbf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/05936e4d-77f7-500c-98b4-51b7176b2d69" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“When Joe releases an event, it’s like a sneaker drop,” said one father in attendance, who’d missed out on a spot for the February meetup.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As the group prepared to take a lap around the park before heading to Canopy, a Williamsburg play space for children ages four and under, Calvin Eng, 30, the chef and owner of the Cantonese restaurant Bonnie’s and author of “Salt Sugar MSG,” joined the pack with his 2½-year-old son, Levi. He was greeted by Joe Gonzales, 32, who treated him like they’d known each other for years, except it was their first time meeting.</p><p>Walking, after all, is what the Brooklyn Stroll Club does best. The group was started in October by Mr. Gonzales, a senior producer at a creative agency and first-time father to a 10-month-old son named Sol.</p><p>“Moms have been holding it down for so long and are so great at building community,” Mr. Gonzales said. “I didn’t have a lot of dad friends in New York, and I really wanted to connect with people who were going through a similar experience,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The group has grown into a community of dads who have actually become friends. And the buzz is growing.</p><p>“When Joe releases an event, it’s like a sneaker drop,” said Colin Rocker, a 28-year-old content creator and the father of a 9-month-old son named Isaiah, adding that he had not been able to snag the free tickets for the February meetup.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Gonzales, pictured with Sol, in a Brooklyn Stroll Club cap.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Fatherhood was a very isolating experience at first,” said one father who had traveled from East Harlem for the meetup.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the colder months, the dads had to get creative and gather indoors, but with an indoor space came limited capacity. Mr. Gonzales shares the events on a Discord channel he created with more than 1,000 members, and when the 50 tickets are released at noon, there’s a mad dash to snatch them up.</p><p>Everyone was on time, a notable feat when you’re dealing with getting a child out the door. The dads cross the street in a herd of about 35 babies and men, swapping stories about what their partners are up to that morning. Somehow, no meltdowns had occurred. Yet.</p><p>The line to get into Canopy almost wrapped around the block. “We used to wait in line to get into the club,” remarked Mike McGlarkner, a 38-year-old construction flagger from Harlem, there with his 2-year-old son, Jackson, to the dad behind him. Slowly, the dads and their children pile into the elevator.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Once they’re checked in, dads and children removed their shoes. A pair of baby Air Jordans are tucked inside an adult pair.</p><p>Mr. Rocker, the 28-year-old content creator, feels like a young dad by city standards. “In New York, having a baby at 28 is a teen pregnancy,” he said, adding that none of his friends are currently sharing his experience. Nearby, Samuel Ourlicht, a 28-year-old father to a 1½-year-old daughter, Zuriah, who lives in the South Bronx and works in a cookie shop,<strong> </strong>related.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Snack time was an essential part of the hang.

By the windows, some dads took a break to feed their children a snack.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Luis Cisneros, a 34-year-old small business owner who says he “waited” to have children, sat on the floor with his son Noah, who took his very first steps that morning. And a few feet away, past a rocking horse and conversations about “Bluey” and “Miss Rachel,” Rene Jimenez, 31, the assistant dean of students at the Dalton School, balanced his 19-month-old daughter, Aubrey, on his hip.</p><p>“Fatherhood was a very isolating experience at first,” he said, and a nearby dad nodded in agreement. Mr. Jimenez had traveled from East Harlem for the meetup.</p><p>“To be in a community with other men who are trying to figure out how to be really good dads and break cycles that have been repeated for years — it’s really important,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-18"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/12STROLL-CLUB-77957-cover/12STROLL-CLUB-77957-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Eganam Segbefia, a trumpet player known as ÉGO, typically plays at halftime during Knicks games at Madison Square Garden, but that day he played hits from Disney movies.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>As the inevitable silent countdown to sleepy temper tantrums began, the buzz of the play space shifted to a bright, airy side room. Eganam Segbefia, a trumpet player known as ÉGO, broke out his instrument to wrap up the festivities.</p><p>While his typical gig involves playing at halftime during Knicks games at Madison Square Garden, on this day he played songs like “Bare Necessities” from “The Jungle Book” and “Under the Sea” from “The Little Mermaid.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>There was a lot of dancing, plenty of smiles and before long, some tears. After a long day, the children needed a nap. The dads, fighting off their own yawns and heavy eyelids, silently agreed they could use one, too.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-22"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tony Cenicola is a Times photographer.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>ST</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>11</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Fathers, With Little Ones in Tow, Find a Community<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/12/style/brooklyn-stroll-club-fathers-new-york.html">35</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/12/style/brooklyn-stroll-club-fathers-new-york.html">35</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Style Coverage</h2><h3>The latest in fashion, trends, love and more.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Scolded for a Sip of Water: </strong>Online grandstanding, intergenerational head-butting and a lost job, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/style/bode-nyc-hot-yoga-water-tiktok.html">all thanks to one poorly timed water break</a> during a hot yoga class.</p></li><li><p><strong>Being ‘Natty’?: </strong>The fitness influencer Kenny Boulet, who asks gymgoers if their muscles are natural or not, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/style/kenny-boulet-natty-steroids-videos.html">wants people to be more honest about steroids</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Forever 21: </strong>Anything the fast-fashion retailer lacked in cool or quality it made up for with the thrill of the hunt for the right thing — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/style/forever-21-bankruptcy-fast-fashion.html">or something close enough</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving a Dive Bar: </strong>When Lucy’s, a homey New York tavern, closed down and underwent a renovation, some longtime patrons feared the worst.
