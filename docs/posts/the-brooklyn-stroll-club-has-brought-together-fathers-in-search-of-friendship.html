while the 20-something influencers and young finance bros of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/29/style/williamsburg-brooklyn-history-timeline.html" title="">Williamsburg</a> were still asleep, a group of more than 30 men gathered in McCarren Park.</p><p>Some were coming from as far as the Catskills and others from a few steps away. Greetings transitioned to talk of sleep training and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/14/technology/baby-gear-tech.html" title="">stroller envy</a>, and the bonding happened quickly. After all, they all had one major thing in common: babies. “How old is yours?” they asked one another as the group grew.</p><p>Benjamin Velez, 32, jogged up to the crowd with his 1-year-old daughter, Wynter, fresh from working an overnight shift as a switchboard operator and receptionist. One of the other men commented on the Monster energy drink in his stroller, and Mr. Velez pointed out that it also contained coffee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Victor Ayala, 36, a quality control inspector, and his 2-year-old, Cassius, pulled up to the park in an Uber from Cobble Hill. The pair was praised for their style: Mr. Ayala was wearing a jersey, a white canvas jacket with black stripes, yellow sneakers and a Brooklyn Stroll Club hat.
