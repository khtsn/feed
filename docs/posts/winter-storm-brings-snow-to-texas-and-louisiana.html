A 50-mile stretch of Interstate 10 in and around New Orleans was shut down as the storm drove east, working its way toward Georgia, the Florida panhandle and the Carolinas over the next few days.</p><div><p>Here’s what we’ve covering:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Houston, we have a snowstorm</strong>: Parts of the city’s metropolitan area were under a blizzard warning and could receive four to six inches of snow by Tuesday afternoon. That would be the most significant winter weather event since at least 1960, forecasters said. The National Weather Service advised drivers to stay off the roads “at all costs.” The Texas electricity grid, crippled by a major winter storm in 2021, was holding steady on Tuesday morning.</p></li><li><p><strong>10 inches in Cajun Country</strong>: The first-ever blizzard warning for parts of southern Louisiana and southeast Texas will be in place until noon local time, the Weather Service office in Lake Charles, La., said. Up to 10 inches could fall in some places, and forecasters warned that snow may drop visibility to less than a quarter of a mile. Four to six inches of snow were in the forecast for the city of New Orleans,</p></li><li><p><strong>Not the usual emergency:</strong> Governors across the South, more accustomed to threats from hurricanes than winter storms, issued state of emergency declarations. School campuses were shuttered, in some cases through Wednesday, in <a href="https://x.com/RiceUniversity/status/1881162253111529680" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Houston</a> and <a href="https://x.com/UTAustinOEM/status/1881324572848353336" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Austin</a>, Texas, <a href="https://tulane.edu/emergency" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Orleans</a> and <a href="https://x.com/LSU/status/1881396515496685937" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baton Rouge</a>, La., <a href="https://alerts.fsu.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tallahassee, Fla.</a>, and many other communities. There were school delays announced in <a href="https://www.ccsdschools.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">South Carolina</a> and Georgia as well.</p></li><li><p><strong>Canceled flights along the coast:</strong> Houston’s airport system, which includes George Bush Intercontinental Airport, William P. Hobby Airport and Ellington Airport, said it had <a href="https://www.fly2houston.com/alerts" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shuttered all flight operations</a> at midnight. Most airlines at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport had suspended flights until Wednesday, airport officials <a href="https://flymsy.com/2025-winter-weather-updates/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, though they added that the airport would remain open as long as “conditions are safe.”</p></li></ul></div></div></div></section></div></article></div></div>
