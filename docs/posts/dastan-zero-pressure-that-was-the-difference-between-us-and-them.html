                  <p>With three of their players getting their first taste of the big stage, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/12467/parivision" data-tooltip-id="uid1281414373">PARIVISION</a> subdued expectations in the PGL Cluj-Napoca quarter-finals against <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11283/falcons" data-tooltip-id="uid846686552">Falcons</a></p>
                  <p>The series ended up decided in pressure moments, but it was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11283/falcons" data-tooltip-id="uid846686552">Falcons</a> who gave out. A 1v3 clutch from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/22929/nota" data-tooltip-id="uid1131659760">Emil <span>&#34;⁠nota⁠&#34;</span> Moskvitin</a> on Dust2 spawned new radar memes as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11283/falcons" data-tooltip-id="uid846686552">Falcons</a> gave it away, and a second-round eco win on Ancient gave <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/12467/parivision" data-tooltip-id="uid1281414373">PARIVISION</a> a massive lead to start the deciding Ancient.</p>

                    <p>My position in a young team is so nice; these teams around us are always stressed, and I feel it and my guys feel it</p>

                  <p>According to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/1865/dastan" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid773804941">dastan</a>, the difference of expectations on the two teams was what helped decide it all. &#34;We played calm, we didn&#39;t have pressure,&#34; he said. &#34;Zero pressure, that was the difference between us and them right now.&#34;</p>
                  <p>&#34;For me, the game was equal, but they threw the anti-eco against us,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/1865/dastan" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid773804941">dastan</a> went on. &#34;It was their fault one hundred percent. After that, the details decided the finish.&#34;</p>
                  <p>You can read the full interview below:</p>
                  <hr/>
                  <p><strong>As they said on the desk several times, this was the first bigger stage match for three of your guys. What does it mean for them to get this opportunity and the experience to grab a win on a big stage?</strong></p>
                  <p>First of all, it&#39;s our first big win over an elite team. I think Falcons is an elite team and it was a best-of-three, and the first big stage for my guys. I always tell them that we&#39;re just going step-by-step, and I hope this win will help them in the future. Winning constantly against them is different, but when you start with a win, it will always be easier for them that they can [do it].</p>
                  <p>We played calm, we didn&#39;t have pressure, we just played CS. And, of course, we want to win. But zero pressure, that was the difference between us and them right now.</p>
                  <p><strong>Do you think that&#39;s what made the difference today? How do you think your trio, nota, BELCHONOKK and xiELO, handled the pressure of the stage and fans?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think we were calm. In my previous team, AVANGAR and Virtus.pro, when I&#39;m talking to them, I can understand everything. I tell them they shouldn&#39;t be afraid and always be calm because, if you&#39;re too stressed, you can&#39;t play professional tier-one CS. I always control it. Maybe it&#39;s my Kazakh mentality [imprinted] on my guys.</p>
                  <p>About Falcons, for us it was a bit easier because we beat them with a substitute at BLAST. Even that win helped us because we understood that it&#39;s possible. We know the pressure is coming, but for me, the game was equal, but they threw the anti-eco against us. It was their fault one hundred percent. After that, the details decided the finish.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>On Dust2, it was a pretty big comeback from 5-10, there was big impact from BELCHONOKK at the beginning and then the 1v3 from nota. How important was that to the comeback?</strong></p>
                  <p>Dust2 was an example how you can return to the game. BELCHONOKK was 1-12, he killed three and we came back. Just imagine, they don&#39;t have experience... The difference between us and elite teams right now is situations, clutches and reading what&#39;s happening around. That comes with time.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we make misplays because we need to play more games. At the elite level, there are only two types of guys, very experienced or very talented. And we don&#39;t have supertalents, but we don&#39;t have a weak guy, either. They have good aim. Our average is good.</p>
                  <p>I&#39;m happy. As I said before, Counter-Strike is a very stressful game, and only one team can win at the end. These days, when I&#39;m winning, I&#39;m trying to be happy. I go to practice, watching games, they will be stressful... that&#39;s all.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>You don&#39;t know who you&#39;re playing yet tomorrow, but NAVI or MOUZ, do you have a preference?</strong></p>
                  <p>These two teams always beat us. NAVI beat us, they have good control, Andrei B1ad3 is creating new strategies, new plans, and for us it&#39;s a bit hard. And MOUZ also. We played two times, and yes, the first time was close at the Major, Overpass, and then we played 2-1.</p>
                  <p>I think they&#39;re confident against us. They don&#39;t respect us. But we don&#39;t care, we will play, we will try to find solutions. They also think it&#39;s PARIVISION, we want to go to the final, and the pressure will be on them. Right now, my position in a young team, it&#39;s so nice because these teams around us in the ranking are always stressed, and I feel it and my guys feel it. I&#39;m happy to be in that position.</p>
