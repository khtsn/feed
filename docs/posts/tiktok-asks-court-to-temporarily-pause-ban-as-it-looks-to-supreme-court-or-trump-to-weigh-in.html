TikTok <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861.1208687888.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked</a> the same court on Monday to temporarily block the law until the Supreme Court decided TikTok’s planned appeal of that decision.</p><p>It isn’t clear whether the Supreme Court will agree to hear the case, though experts say it is likely.</p><p>TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is facing new peril under the law that, citing national security concerns, calls on ByteDance to sell the app or face a ban on Jan. 19. TikTok, which boasts 170 million users in the United States, has said that a sale is impossible in part because of restrictions from the Chinese government and that a subsequent ban would violate the First Amendment rights of users.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>TikTok also suggested in its filing that the temporary freeze would give President-elect Donald J. Trump more time to try to rescue the app, as he has pledged to do. Right now, the ban would take effect a day before his inauguration. TikTok has asked the court to decide on the freeze by Dec. 16.</p><p>The government has already pushed back on TikTok’s emergency request for the freeze, called an injunction. Lawyers for the Department of Justice <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861.2088549.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a filing</a> on Monday that the court should deny the request, and allow TikTok and its users to directly ask the Supreme Court for the injunction.</p><p>The U.S. government appears to be keen for the law to go into effect as scheduled, said Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown University.</p><p>“The government has a win in its hands, and it hopes to run out the clock,” Mr. Chander said. “There will be pressure for President Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, including from his many admirers on TikTok, so even a short delay might change the dynamics in the case.”</p><p>The prospect of losing TikTok <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/style/tiktok-ban-reactions.html" title="">quickly sent</a> social media into a flurry over the weekend, as creators called on fans to follow them on YouTube and Instagram and talent agents told TikTok stars to hold off on big purchases, like buying a home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Lawyers for TikTok users said in a filing that the court should freeze the law, in part, because the government allowed the app to operate without restriction during a U.S. presidential election. They also noted that the law offered a potential 90-day extension, if sale negotiations were underway.</p><p>“TikTok is, at its core, its 170 million American users,” Michael Hughes, a spokesman for TikTok, said in a statement. The company pointed to data from an economic impact report that it funded, which said that small businesses on TikTok stood to lose more than $1 billion in revenue if the app went away.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The World of TikTok</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>TikTok Faces U.S. Ban:</strong> A panel of federal judges <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/business/media/tiktok-ban-court-decision.html">unanimously upheld a new law</a> that could lead to the banning of the popular Chinese-owned video app by mid-January.</p></li><li><p><strong>Women Playing Games</strong><strong>:</strong> In a series of tongue-in-cheek TikTok videos purporting to highlight #WomenInMaleFields, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/style/women-in-male-fields-tiktok.html">female users are sharing stories of negative experiences dating men</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>TikTok Under Trump:</strong> TikTok is hoping that Donald Trump will prevent a U.S. ban on the Chinese-owned video app after promises to that effect on the campaign trail.
