    <h1>Our Questions, and Yours</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Today, we’ve answering five questions about the news unfolding in Washington, the Vatican and Harvard Square — with help from beat reporters across the newsroom. Send us your questions about the news <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/briefing/questions-for-the-morning.html" title="">with this form</a>.</p><h2 id="link-55b8b4d1">1. Can Trump fire the Fed chair?</h2><p>The leader of America’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, is supposed to guard against rising inflation, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/imf-world-economic-outlook.html" title="">economists say may be imminent</a>. For that reason, he won’t lower interest rates to boost economic growth (which would speed up inflation). That frustrates President Trump — every president looks better when the economy booms. Trump has mused in recent days about ousting Jerome Powell, the head of the Fed, although yesterday the president said he had “no intention” of firing him.</p><p>Trump’s talk infringes on the central bank’s longstanding political independence, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-says-he-wont-fire-powell-his-fed-battle-may-not-be-over-yet.html" title="">writes Colby Smith, who covers the Fed</a>. When Congress set up the Federal Reserve, lawmakers hoped to shield it from political influence so it could make difficult decisions that might cause short-term economic pain. In the 1980s, for instance, the Fed deliberately tanked the economy to get inflation under control.</p><p>Still, the president can fire board members of independent agencies “for cause.” Trump could try to argue that Powell has failed at his job and fire him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the end, the markets might hold back Trump more than the law does. When investors worldwide put their money into the United States, they’re committing an act of faith — that the economy will continue to grow and prosper through proper leadership. Trump has challenged that faith by threatening the Fed’s independence. That’s why stocks fell after Trump’s initial comments.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/trump-tariff-stocks.html" title="">Markets rebounded</a> after Trump said he had no plans to oust Powell.</p><h2 id="link-78d33db9">2. Is ‘Conclave’ accurate about selecting a pope?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Carlos Diehz in “Conclave.” His character, Cardinal Benitez, is clearly reminiscent of Pope Francis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Focus Features</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In yesterday’s newsletter, we asked readers to share questions they had about Pope Francis’ funeral and the process of electing his successor. Crystal Siegel in St. Paul, Minn., asks: “How realistic is the movie ‘Conclave’? Is there as much politicking as the movie portrays?”</p><p>The dramatized papal election in “Conclave” is quite accurate, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-francis-conclave-film.html" title="">experts told our colleague Talya Minsberg</a>. The film depicts many of the actual rituals, including how cardinals count votes by reading paper ballots aloud, weaving them along a single thread and then burning them.</p><p>The details of the politicking are harder to know, because so much happens behind closed doors, and the Vatican remains a very secretive place. But the experts say there is certainly politicking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That begins in earnest after the pope has died, in a period known as “sede vacante” — the papal vacancy we have now. Some cardinals speak to the media to raise their profiles. Groups gather for informal chats, as well in formal meetings to discuss the state of the church and potential successors.</p><p>As for the film’s wilder moments — which including a vaping cardinal, a break-in at the pontifical bedroom and ecclesiastical sabotage — we aren’t so sure.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>Pope Francis’ coffin was carried <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/europe/pope-francis-coffin-lying-in-state-st-peters.html" title="">in a solemn procession</a> from his Vatican residence to St. Peter’s Square.</p><h2 id="link-697d79c0">3. Can Trump make universities comply?</h2><p>The Trump administration has asked several schools to alter their policies as a condition to receive research grants they had already been awarded. It sent Harvard a demand letter saying the university should report on students who had faced discipline, alter its curriculum and let the government audit the faculty to ensure it represents diverse political views. Harvard said no and sued.</p><p>The suit, which contests Trump’s funding freeze, hinges on the wonky Administrative Procedure Act. The law is a road map of bureaucratic timelines and processes for federal agencies. It tries to ensure due process as the government doles out punishments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Harvard argues that the administration didn’t follow these processes in its rush to punish the school, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/trump-harvard-legal-case.html" title="">Alan Blinder and Michael Bender wrote</a>. In other words, Trump has to slow down. It also says the administration has violated the First Amendment by trying to force specific viewpoints and ideologies on the university.</p><p>Conservatives <a href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/trump-could-have-a-strong-case-to-revoke-harvards-tax-exempt-status/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">point to</a> a Supreme Court case — Bob Jones University v. United States — to argue that the government can revoke tax-exempt status if the school is at odds with public policy. (Bob Jones forbade interracial relationships, a form of discrimination.) The administration could claim that Harvard failed to protect Jewish students, which goes against federal bans on discrimination.</p><p>Ultimately, the courts will decide who’s right.</p><p><strong>For more:</strong> More than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/university-leaders-letter-trump.html" title="">220 university leaders</a> signed a statement against Trump’s efforts to control them. Still, some of Harvard’s biggest donors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/harvard-trump-deal.html" title="">want the school to strike a deal</a>.</p><h2 id="link-77a70224">4. How would a reorganization change the State Department?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Oval Office. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Yesterday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio proposed major cuts to the State Department, calling the government’s diplomatic agency “bloated, bureaucratic” and “beholden to radical political ideology.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The most drastic change is the elimination of the under secretary for civilian security, democracy and human rights, an office that advances American values around the world. The Trump administration says it is a hotbed of liberal activism.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/state-department-cuts-rubio.html" title="">The plan would also reduce the number of U.S.-based employees by 15 percent.</a> Officials say that Rubio and his aides will introduce plans later to close down some embassies and consulates and fire staff members overseas. That would affect services to both U.S. citizens abroad and foreign citizens, and it would mean less contact outside world capitals between American diplomats and their counterparts.</p><p>As Rubio tries to make these cuts, “China has been expanding its diplomatic presence and influence around the globe. It has even overtaken the U.S. in number of global diplomatic missions,” said Edward Wong, who covers diplomacy. “The cuts could make it harder for the United States to compete with China, the main superpower rival to the U.S.”</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>Critics of Rubio’s reorganization say it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/rubio-state-department-overhaul.html" title="">a blow to U.S. values</a>.</p><h2 id="link-7b775d4d">5. How do you pick a piano?</h2><p>The Frick needed a piano. The museum on the Upper East Side of New York City had just completed a renovation, and its small concert hall would host chamber music performances. Officials invited a famous pianist to try out a few Steinway grands and give his opinion — and they let a Times critic, Joshua Barone, listen in.</p><p>All the instruments were nine-foot-long Model Ds. One piano from 1882 had an “eloquent” timbre but stiff keys, said the pianist. A 1965 model had a bright sound but lots of reverb — which could create a muddled echo in performances. A 2017 piano had come all the way from Germany. It had “a nice singing tone” but played loud and might not accompany other performers well.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Vondruska for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ahmed al-Shara, Syria’s new president.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><ul><li><p>In Damascus, the Times reporter Christina Goldbaum interviewed Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Shara.
