The separation of a smaller ice chunk from a larger one is called calving.</p><p>Its early life was uneventful; it sat in the Weddell Sea, east of the Antarctic Peninsula, for decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>A23a’s travels began in 2020, when it freed itself from the sea floor and began to move.

It couldn’t make it all the way to South Georgia, and is now stuck on the continental shelf, about 50 miles from the island.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>So far it seems to be sitting peacefully and has not begun breaking into smaller pieces, as some other giant bergs have after splitting from Antarctica.</p><h2 id="link-5b1d39f2">How big is this thing?</h2><p>Initially it was measured to be about 1,500 square miles. It has lost some of that girth, but <a href="https://usicecenter.gov/Products/AntarcIcebergs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still is believed to be</a> more than 1,300 square miles. In contrast, New York City is 300 square miles.</p><p>Icebergs that big are rare, Andrew Meijers, an oceanographer at British Antarctic Survey, <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/worlds-largest-iceberg-grounds-near-sub-antarctic-island-of-south-georgia/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement on the group’s website</a>. “There have been two other similarly sized bergs in the same region over the past five years or so, and sporadically before that,” he said.</p><p>“It looks like land, that’s the only way to describe it,” Alexander Brearley, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, said last summer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The iceberg that sank the Titanic was perhaps a quarter-mile long, a laughably tiny thing in comparison.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A23a in January 2024.

You’d think they could do a bit better.</h2><p>That’s science for you. “A” indicates the region of Antarctica in which the iceberg was formed. The numbers are assigned sequentially, and the little “a” means it broke off from a bigger berg.</p><p>More colorful coinages like “superberg” or “icemonster” would be sadly unscientific.</p><h2 id="link-b30f02b">What’s next?</h2><p>A23a will begin to break up and melt, though it will probably take a while, maybe years.</p><p>“Now it’s grounded, it is even more likely to break up due to the increased stresses, but this is practically impossible to predict,” Dr. Meijers said. “Large bergs have made it a long way north before — one got within 1,000 kilometers of Perth, Australia, once — but they all inevitably break up and melt quickly after.”</p><h2 id="link-3e121a66">Is this all a good or bad thing?</h2><p>It is unlikely that the seals and penguins of South Georgia will be affected by the iceberg. Still, “potentially, it could interrupt their pathway to feeding sites and force the adults to expend more energy to travel around it,” Dr. Meijers said. “This could reduce the amount of food coming back to pups and chicks on the island, and so increase mortality.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The iceberg also contains nutrients that are released into the sea as it melts: “If the berg is stimulating ocean productivity, this could actually boost populations of local predators like seals and penguins,” he said.</p><p>“It looks like the ocean has carved into it, and there are some visible cracks on the ice surface as the ice responds to the changing stresses,” said Indrani Das, a glaciologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.</p><p>“As time passes, the ocean will carve deeper into it, causing it to start fragmenting further. At some point, it may even become top-heavy and topple over. Given its size, that may take years.”</p><p>There is little fear of a “Titanic II” as boats in the region will be well aware of the iceberg’s location. Once A23a breaks up, though, the smaller bergs will be harder to track, increasing the danger.</p><p>But while the berg itself may pose little direct threat, it could be a symptom of what is unwell in the Antarctic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The ice shelves have lost billions of tons of ice over the last 25 years, which scientists attribute to climate change. Losing all this ice can contribute to a rise in the level of the sea.</p><p>“The climate is changing, and it is impacting how ice shelves melt,” Dr. Das said in 2023, when the berg was still moving. “Ice shelves are losing mass because the ocean is warming. Calving is a natural process, but that natural calving could be enhanced by climate.”</p><p>Still, it was ever thus. Mammoth icebergs “are a completely normal part of the life cycle of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets,” Dr. Meijers said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-15"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victor-mather">More about Victor Mather</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Climate and the Environment</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Climate F.A.Q.:</strong> Do you have questions about climate change? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/climate/climate-change-faq.html">We’ve got answers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> World Bank Concerns:</strong> As the Trump administration imposes deep cuts on foreign aid and renewable energy programs, the World Bank, one of the most important financiers of energy projects in developing countries, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/climate/world-bank-trump-project-2025-funding.html">facing doubts about U.S. commitments to the lender</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oil, Coal and Gas</strong>: The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/climate/army-corps-engineers-fossil-fuel-permits.html">moved to fast-track permits for fossil fuel projects</a>, which could reduce opportunities for the public and local officials to weigh in.
