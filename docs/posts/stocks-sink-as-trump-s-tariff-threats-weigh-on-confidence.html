    <h1>Stocks Sink as Trump’s Tariff Threats Weigh on Confidence</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Markets in Europe opened lower, with the Stoxx 600 index falling about 1 percent. German automakers, which are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/trump-auto-tariffs-europe.html" title="">particularly exposed to U.S. tariffs</a>, extended recent losses: Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker, fell more than 3 percent in Frankfurt.</p><p>Futures on the S&amp;P 500, which allow investors to trade the benchmark index before exchanges reopen in New York in the morning, slumped. On Friday, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/business/stock-market-inflation-consumer-sentiment.html" title="">S&amp;P 500</a> dropped 2 percent on concerns that Mr. Trump’s tariffs could recharge inflation and dampen consumer sentiment, dragging the index down to a fifth weekly decline in the past six weeks.</p><p>Investor anxiety has been reflected in other markets, too. The price of gold hit another record high, trading at around $3,150 per ounce on Monday. Gold is often sought out by investors during times of turmoil. Traders also parked money in U.S. government bonds, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield below 4.2 percent.</p><p>Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs to make imports more expensive in industries like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/business/trump-tariffs-automakers-reaction.html?" title="">automobiles</a>, arguing that the trade barriers will spur investment and innovation in the United States. He has also used tariffs, and their threat, to try to extract geopolitical concessions from countries. He has further unnerved investors by saying he does not care about the fallout of his actions on markets or American consumers, who will have to pay more for many goods if import prices rise.</p><p>Over the weekend, Mr. Trump ramped up the pressure, threatening so-called secondary sanctions on Russia if it does not engage in talks to bring about a cessation of fighting in Ukraine. The tactic echoes similar sanctions concerning Venezuela. He said last week that any country buying Venezuelan oil could face another 25 percent tariff on its imports to the United States. </p></div></div>
