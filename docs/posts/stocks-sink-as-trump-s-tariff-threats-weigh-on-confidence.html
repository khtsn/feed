    <h1>Stocks Sink as Trump’s Tariff Threats Weigh on Confidence</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Markets in Europe opened lower, with the Stoxx 600 index falling about 1 percent. German automakers, which are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/trump-auto-tariffs-europe.html" title="">particularly exposed to U.S. tariffs</a>, extended recent losses: Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker, fell by nearly 2 percent in Frankfurt.</p><p>Futures on the S&amp;P 500, which allow investors to trade the benchmark index before exchanges reopen in New York in the morning, slumped. On Friday, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/business/stock-market-inflation-consumer-sentiment.html" title="">S&amp;P 500</a> dropped 2 percent on concerns that Mr. Trump’s tariffs could recharge inflation and dampen consumer sentiment, dragging the index down to its fifth weekly decline in the past six weeks.</p><p>Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs to make imports more expensive in industries like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/business/trump-tariffs-automakers-reaction.html?" title="">automobiles</a>, arguing that the trade barriers will spur investment and innovation in the United States. He has also used tariffs, and their threat, to try to extract geopolitical concessions from countries. He has further unnerved investors by saying he does not care about the fallout of his actions on markets or American consumers, who will have to pay more for many goods if import prices rise.</p><p>Over the weekend, Mr. Trump ramped up the pressure, threatening so-called secondary sanctions on Russia if it does not engage in talks to bring about a cessation of fighting in Ukraine. The tactic echoes similar sanctions concerning Venezuela. He said last week that any country buying Venezuelan oil could face another 25 percent tariff on its imports to the United States. </p><p>The threats over the weekend add to tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and some car parts set to be implemented this week, barring any last minute reprieve. That’s in addition to previously delayed tariffs on Mexico and Canada, as well as the potential for further retaliatory tariffs on other countries.</p></div></div>
