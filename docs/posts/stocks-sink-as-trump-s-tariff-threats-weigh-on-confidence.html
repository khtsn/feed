He has threatened, imposed and in some cases then paused the start of new tariffs on goods coming into the United States.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell about 1 percent at the start of trading, extending last week’s losses. On Friday, the index <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/business/stock-market-inflation-consumer-sentiment.html" title="">dropped</a> 2 percent on concerns that Mr. Trump’s tariffs could recharge inflation and dampen consumer sentiment, dragging the benchmark down to its fifth weekly fall in six weeks. It is on track for its worst month since September 2022.</p><p>Whiplash over trade policy has fueled market volatility in the first quarter of the year. Mr. Trump’s next round of tariffs, set to be unveiled on Wednesday, is looming large, risking more swings until investors have the clarity they are seeking, analysts said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“That’s what the market is hoping for after April 2: Give us what you’re going to give us, tell us what’s going to happen and we will then try to figure it out,” said Steve Sosnick, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “But until then, it’s very difficult to invest.”</p><p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped roughly 1.6 percent in early morning trading.</p><p>On Monday, stocks in Japan and Taiwan fell more than 4 percent, while share prices in South Korea were down 3 percent. The Nikkei 225 index in Japan fell into a correction, down 12 percent from its high in late December.<strong> </strong>Technology companies were hit hard: Chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, SK Hynix, Samsung and Tokyo Electron recorded declines.</p><p>Losses in China were more muted. Hong Kong stocks dropped more than 1 percent and those in mainland China were about 0.5 percent lower. Mainland stocks got some support from a report signaling that China’s export-led industrial sector continues to expand despite Mr. Trump’s initial tariffs.</p><p>Markets in Europe slumped, with the Stoxx 600 index falling 1.8 percent. German automakers, which are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/trump-auto-tariffs-europe.html" title="">particularly exposed to U.S. tariffs</a>, extended recent losses: Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker, fell more than 4 percent in Frankfurt.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their forecast for the S&amp;P 500, citing “higher tariffs, weaker economic growth, and greater inflation than we previously assumed” in a note on Sunday. They expect the index to fall a further 5 percent in the next three months. The downturn could be deeper if the U.S. economy slipped into recession, which the analysts give a roughly one-in-three probability.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Investor anxiety has been reflected in other markets. The price of gold hit another record high, trading at around $3,150 per ounce on Monday. Gold is often sought by investors during times of turmoil. Traders also parked money in relatively safe U.S. government bonds, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note below 4.2 percent.</p><p>Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs to make imports more expensive in industries like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/business/trump-tariffs-automakers-reaction.html?" title="">automobiles</a>, arguing that the trade barriers will spur investment and innovation in the United States. He has also used tariffs, and their threat, to try to extract geopolitical concessions from countries. He has further unnerved investors by saying he does not care about the fallout of his actions on markets or American consumers, who will have to pay more for many goods if import prices rise.</p><p>Over the weekend, Mr. Trump ramped up the pressure, threatening so-called secondary sanctions on Russia if it does not engage in talks to bring about a cessation of fighting in Ukraine. The tactic echoes similar sanctions concerning Venezuela. He said last week that any country buying Venezuelan oil could face another 25 percent tariff on its imports to the United States.</p><p>The threats over the weekend come on top of tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and some car parts set to be put in place this week, barring any last-minute reprieve. That’s in addition to previously delayed tariffs on Mexico and Canada, as well as the potential for further retaliatory tariffs on other countries.</p><p>Adding to investors’ angst is the scheduled release on Friday of the monthly report on the health of the U.S. jobs market. It could provide another reading of how the Trump administration’s policy pursuits are weighing on the economy.</p><p>“I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader — nearly every person — I talk to: They’re more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory,” Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of the asset management giant BlackRock, wrote on Monday in his <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-annual-chairmans-letter" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual letter to investors</a>. “I understand why. But we have lived through moments like this before. And somehow, in the long run, we figure things out.”</p><p>Keith Bradsher<!-- --> and <!-- -->Jason Karaian<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Italian Wines on Hold: </strong>For now, President Trump’s 200 percent tariff on wine remains just a threat.
