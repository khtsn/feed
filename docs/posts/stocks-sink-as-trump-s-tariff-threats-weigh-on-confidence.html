He has threatened, imposed and in some cases then paused the start of new tariffs on goods coming into the United States.</p><p>On Monday, stocks in Japan and Taiwan fell more than 4 percent, while share prices in South Korea were down 3 percent. The Nikkei 225 index in Japan fell into a correction, down 12 percent from its high in late December.<strong> </strong>Technology companies were hit hard: Chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, SK Hynix, Samsung and Tokyo Electron recorded declines.</p><p>Losses in China were more muted. Hong Kong stocks dropped more than 1 percent and those in mainland China were about 0.5 percent lower. Mainland stocks got some support from a report signaling that China’s export-led industrial sector continues to expand despite Mr. Trump’s initial tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Markets in Europe opened lower, with the Stoxx 600 index falling about 1 percent. German automakers, which are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/trump-auto-tariffs-europe.html" title="">particularly exposed to U.S. tariffs</a>, extended recent losses: Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker, fell by nearly 2 percent in Frankfurt.</p><p>Futures on the S&amp;P 500, which allow investors to trade the benchmark index before exchanges reopen in New York in the morning, slumped. On Friday, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/business/stock-market-inflation-consumer-sentiment.html" title="">S&amp;P 500</a> dropped 2 percent on concerns that Mr. Trump’s tariffs could recharge inflation and dampen consumer sentiment, dragging the index down to its fifth weekly decline in the past six weeks.</p><p>Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs to make imports more expensive in industries like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/business/trump-tariffs-automakers-reaction.html?" title="">automobiles</a>, arguing that the trade barriers will spur investment and innovation in the United States. He has also used tariffs, and their threat, to try to extract geopolitical concessions from countries. He has further unnerved investors by saying he does not care about the fallout of his actions on markets or American consumers, who will have to pay more for many goods if import prices rise.</p><p>Over the weekend, Mr. Trump ramped up the pressure, threatening so-called secondary sanctions on Russia if it does not engage in talks to bring about a cessation of fighting in Ukraine. The tactic echoes similar sanctions concerning Venezuela. He said last week that any country buying Venezuelan oil could face another 25 percent tariff on its imports to the United States. </p><p>The threats over the weekend add to tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and some car parts set to be implemented this week, barring any last minute reprieve. That’s in addition to previously delayed tariffs on Mexico and Canada, as well as the potential for further retaliatory tariffs on other countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Adding to investors’ angst is the scheduled release on Friday of the monthly report on the health of the U.S. jobs market. It could provide another reading of how the Trump administration’s policy pursuits are weighing on the economy.</p><p>Keith Bradsher<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Italian Wines on Hold: </strong>For now, President Trump’s 200 percent tariff on wine remains just a threat.
