Instead, the app greeted them with a message that said “a law banning TikTok has been enacted.”</p><p>“We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution,” the message said. “Please stay tuned!”</p><p>TikTok also appeared to have been removed from Apple and Google’s U.S. app stores, some users said. In addition, TikTok’s sister app, Lemon8, stopped working and showed U.S. users a message saying that it “isn’t available right now.” Both TikTok and Lemon8 are owned by ByteDance, a Chinese internet giant.</p><p>TikTok became unavailable after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/supreme-court-tiktok.html" title="">Supreme Court decision on Friday upholding the law</a>, which calls for ByteDance to sell the app by Sunday or otherwise face a ban. The law was passed overwhelmingly by Congress last year and signed by President Biden. TikTok, which has faced national security concerns for its Chinese ties, had believed it could win its legal challenge to the law, but failed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The blackout capped a chaotic stretch for TikTok, which had made last-minute pleas to both the Biden administration and President-elect Donald J. Trump for a way out of the law. Until Saturday night, no one — including the U.S. government — was entirely sure what would happen to it when the law took effect. The United States has never blocked an app used by tens of millions of Americans essentially overnight.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>U.S. users of TikTok were greeted with a message on Saturday night saying the service had been disrupted.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">TikTok</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="Optimistic-4"><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
