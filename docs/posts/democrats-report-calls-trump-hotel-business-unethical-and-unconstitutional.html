Trump of accepting “hundreds of unconstitutional and ethically suspect payments” through the Trump International Hotel in 2017 and 2018, moving weeks before the election to remind voters of the ethical issues raised by his refusal to divest from his businesses while in office.</p><p><a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-10-18COA-DEM-Staff-Report-Domestic-Emoluments.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The 58-page report</a> from Democrats on the Oversight Committee includes their final findings in a yearslong investigation digging into the Trump Organization’s management of the hotel. It accuses Mr. Trump of ripping off the Secret Service by charging the agency exorbitant rates and of inappropriately accepting payments from clients who worked for state governments or were seeking appointments and pardons from him.</p><p>“Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/10/trump-wont-pledge-to-divest-from-businesses-if-he-wins-second-term.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has made clear</a> that he will not only refuse to divest from his businesses in a possible future presidency, but he will seek to multiply opportunities to commodify the Oval Office for his personal enrichment by turning thousands of civil service jobs into patronage positions — all with the attendant payoff possibilities from supplicant job-seekers and the prospective blessing of his handpicked Supreme Court justices,” said Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee.</p><p>House Republicans dismissed the report as old news and accused Democrats of hypocrisy for investigating Mr. Trump but not members of President Biden’s family, including his son Hunter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Unlike the Bidens, the Trumps actually have businesses and made money from the services they provided,” said Jessica Collins, a spokeswoman for the Republican-led House Oversight Committee. “Today’s report is more recycled garbage from the Democrats’ fruitless and close to a decadelong investigation of President Trump.”</p><p>The committee has already documented how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/us/politics/trump-hotels-foreign-business-report.html" title="">officials from other countries spent lavishly</a> at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/us/politics/trump-hotel-foreign-spending.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s hotel in Washington while he was president</a> and how the Secret Service was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/us/politics/trump-hotels-secret-service.html" title="">charged hefty prices for rooms</a>.</p><p>Eric Trump, the former president’s son, has repeatedly claimed the organization charged the Secret Service a discounted rate. He has also said that any profit the company earned on the hotel stays from foreign officials was returned to the federal government through a voluntary annual payment to the Treasury Department. The Trump Organization has also said it did not have the ability to stop anyone from booking through third parties at the hotel.</p><p>“This is just another desperate attempt by House Democrats to rehash an old unsubstantiated story just two weeks before the upcoming presidential election in a last-minute effort to gain ground in the polls,” said Kimberly Benza, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization. “To be clear, the Trump Organization does not profit whatsoever from any government officials staying at our properties.”</p><p>But the report seeks to undercut those statements.</p><p>“Not only did President Trump’s hotel often charge the Secret Service far more than authorized federal government rates, the hotel also charged the agency far more than hundreds of other patrons, including members of a foreign royal family and a Chinese business interest,” the report states.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Democrats on the panel previously found the Trump Organization charged the Secret Service <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/us/politics/trump-hotels-secret-service.html" title="">up to $1,185 per night for hotel rooms</a> used by agents protecting former Mr. Trump and his family.</p><p>The latest report compares how much the Secret Service was charged at the hotel on the same nights as other guests.</p><p>For example, it says that on Nov. 28, 2017, the Secret Service approved a waiver to pay a room rate of $600 when the per diem for that month was $201 — a 300-percent markup. Room records show that a dozen rooms were rented that same night to the Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal Co. Ltd., which is headquartered in China, for a lower rate: $338.85 each.</p><p>Ms. Benza said the rates the Trump Organization charged the Secret Service were “at cost” and “well below market value.”</p><p>“Indeed, in most instances Secret Service would pay considerably more if they had stayed at hotels directly across the street,” she said. “Federal law requires this, otherwise we would be happy to accommodate Secret Service for free.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The report also analyzes payments made by federal and state officials staying at the hotel, as well as people who sought — and obtained — favors from Mr. Trump, including federal jobs in his administration and presidential pardons. In just 11 months of the Trump hotel’s guest logs, the committee found 16 examples of state or federal officials who paid for rooms there, often while on official travel. The committee said such room rentals possibly violated the Constitution’s domestic emoluments clause if any taxpayer funds were used.</p><p>Democrats identified eight ambassadors; three people appointed by Mr. Trump to be federal judges; two governors; one delegation from a state legislature; and two executive branch officials who stayed at the hotel during the 11 months analyzed.</p><p>In addition, five people who sought and received presidential pardons — Elliott Broidy, Ken Kurson, Dinesh D’Souza, James Kassouf and Albert Pirro — stayed at the hotel, the report found. Together, they spent more than $21,000.</p><p>Democrats on the committee acknowledge that many of the transactions documented in the report were not for eye-popping dollar figures; their cumulative total was about $300,000.</p><p>The report also acknowledges its own limitations. Democrats fought aggressively through years of litigation to gain access to only a portion of Mr. Trump’s business records. After they won court rulings, Mazars USA, the longtime accounting firm for Mr. Trump that cut ties with him and his family business, began turning over documents in 2022 related to his financial dealings.</p><p>But once Republicans won control of the House, they dropped the effort to force Mazars to continue with its production of documents about Mr. Trump’s business dealings.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Luke Broadwater covers Congress with a focus on congressional investigations.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater">More about Luke Broadwater</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/house-committee-on-oversight-and-government-reform">House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/18/us/politics/trump-hotel-report.html">267</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
