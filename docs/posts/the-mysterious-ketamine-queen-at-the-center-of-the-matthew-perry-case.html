Several months later, she posted highlights from a trip to Mexico, where she enjoyed caviar at the airport, sitting poolside at the beach and admiring a drink within a coconut.</p><p>The woman, Jasveen Sangha, liked to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jasveen_s/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">share images of a glamorous life on social media</a>, of herself rubbing elbows with celebrities and traveling around the world to Spain, China and Dubai.</p><p>But her home was a midrise building for the aspiring upper class in North Hollywood, an unglamorous space in an unremarkable part of town. It was there, prosecutors say, that Ms. Sangha manufactured, stored and distributed illegal drugs for at least five years, including those connected to the deaths of Mr. Perry and another man.</p><p>When the authorities raided Ms. Sangha’s fourth-floor apartment in March, they said they found cocaine, 79 vials of ketamine and three pounds of orange pills containing methamphetamine. Prosecutors emphasized in court documents that customers knew her as the “Ketamine Queen.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Sangha in a photo taken from her Instagram account.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Given the volume of drugs defendant sold, there are likely more victims,” they wrote in court documents.</p><p>Ms. Sangha was initially arrested in March on drug charges and released on bail, but in August federal prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/arts/television/matthew-perry-charges-ketamine.html" title="">brought a new indictment</a> accusing her and four other people of playing a role in Mr. Perry’s death. A judge revoked her bail, citing concerns that she was a flight risk and a danger to the community, and sent her to jail to await trial.</p><p>Two months later, her name still appeared on a buzzer box in North Hollywood. The wood paneling on her apartment door was cracked and mostly missing, exposing a busted lock.</p><p>On a recent weekday morning, a cleaner stood on a stool inside the barren unit that prosecutors say had spent years as a “stash house,” busy scrubbing the cabinets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-22829458">A Jet-Setter</h2><p>Mr. Perry died on Oct. 28, 2023, of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/15/arts/matthew-perry-cause-death-friends.html" title="">the “acute effects of ketamine,”</a> a powerful anesthetic that has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/arts/television/matthew-perry-ketamine-treatment.html" title="">increasingly popular as a therapy for depression</a> and is also used as a recreational drug. The actor, known for his role as Chandler Bing on the 1990s sitcom “Friends,” had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/23/arts/television/matthew-perry-friends-lovers-and-the-big-terrible-thing.html" title="">written openly about his struggles with addiction</a> in a memoir.</p><p>Ms. Sangha, 41, has pleaded not guilty to charges connected with Mr. Perry’s overdose, including distribution of ketamine resulting in death, and is scheduled to stand trial in March; if convicted of all charges, she would face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison.</p><p>A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment. When the charges were announced, Martin Estrada, a U.S. attorney in California, said in a statement, “Drug dealers selling dangerous substances are gambling with other people’s lives over greed.”</p><p>Mark Geragos, a lawyer whose firm is handling Ms. Sangha’s case, declined to comment. But in <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/lawyer-for-perrys-ketamine-queen-its-tragedy-not-criminal/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview with NewsNation</a> in August he questioned how the authorities could be sure they knew the origin of the ketamine that killed Mr. Perry.</p><p>“Just because it’s a tragedy doesn’t mean it’s criminal,” he said.</p><p>Ms. Sangha graduated from high school in Calabasas, an affluent Los Angeles suburb, in 2001 before earning an undergraduate degree in social sciences from the University of California, Irvine, and an M.B.A. from Hult International Business School in London.</p><p>On an Instagram account, Ms. Sangha advertised herself as a curator of art and events and a jet-setter who routinely hopped between London and Los Angeles. She bolstered that image with photos and videos from pools, dance parties and fancy dinners around the world, appearing with <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13750261/brooke-mueller-connection-matthew-perry-jasveen-sangha-ketamine-queen.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Charlie Sheen</a>, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/12213251/ketamine-queen-charlie-sheen-matthew-perry/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DJ Khaled</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/22/entertainment/how-jasveen-sangha-became-hollywoods-ketamine-queen/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Perla Hudson</a>, the ex-wife of the guitarist Slash. (Representatives for Mr. Sheen and DJ Khaled did not respond to a request for comment. Attempts to reach Ms. Hudson were unsuccessful.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When Ms. Sangha turned 40 last year, she celebrated in a feathery, pale pink dress and a matching cowboy hat, according to videos she posted online. At the party in the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang lounge inside a boutique hotel in Los Angeles, hot pink lights radiated out from a disco ball rotating overhead. The music made the comfy seats vibrate while silver buckets awaited ice and champagne.</p><p>Prosecutors say that it is unclear how Ms. Sangha financed her lifestyle — they say she drove a Range Rover and B.M.W. at various times — and that it appears she had been unemployed since at least 2019. Before that, she had for a time been involved with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stilettonailbar/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stiletto Nail Bar</a> in Studio City, an upscale neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley, according to business records.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The building in North Hollywood where, prosecutors say, Ms. Sangha manufactured, stored and distributed illegal drugs for at least five years.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Morgan Lieberman/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>When Ms. Sangha was initially arrested in March on a charge of drug dealing, her mother, Nilem Sangha, secured the $100,000 bond for her release, according to court records. </p><p>Nilem Sangha did not respond to requests for comment, and several attempts to reach other members of Jasveen Sangha’s family by phone and in person were unsuccessful. A woman who answered a number listed in court records for Ms. Sangha declined to comment.</p><p>Much remains unknown about Ms. Sangha beyond what she has presented publicly online. In her senior portrait inside the Calabasas High School yearbook, she wears an inscrutable expression not unlike the Mona Lisa. The accompanying quotation reads, “It isn’t what they say about you, it’s what they whisper.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-661a93ef">Deadly Ketamine</h2><p>Mr. Perry was not the only person who died after buying ketamine from Ms. Sangha, prosecutors allege in the indictment. The court documents say that <a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/nytimes/name/cody-mclaury-obituary?id=16299407" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cody McLaury died of an overdose</a> shortly after Ms. Sangha sold him ketamine in August 2019.</p><p>Despite knowledge of Mr. McLaury’s death, prosecutors say, Ms. Sangha continued to distribute illegal drugs from her apartment for the next five years.</p><p>Ms. Sangha heard of Mr. Perry’s interest in ketamine through an acquaintance who was in touch with the actor’s personal assistant and offered to send a sample, court documents say. She sought to project an air of exclusivity, calling her supply “amazing” and telling her acquaintance, Erik Fleming, “Take one and try it and I have more if he likes.” </p><p>Two days after the offer, prosecutors say, Ms. Sangha sent the actor a ketamine sample in an unlabeled glass vial with a blue cap. The government says Mr. Fleming and Mr. Perry’s assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, acted as intermediaries. The next day, Mr. Iwamasa bought 25 vials on Mr. Perry’s behalf, according to the indictment; when he bought 25 more vials two weeks later, Ms. Sangha threw in some ketamine lollipops as well.</p><p>One of those 50 vials contained the ketamine that killed Mr. Perry, prosecutors say.</p><p>Mr. Fleming and Mr. Iwamasa have both pleaded guilty to criminal charges. After Ms. Sangha learned of the actor’s death through news reports, she quickly sought to destroy evidence of her involvement, prosecutors said in court documents. “Delete all our messages,” she told Mr. Fleming.</p><p>That level of caution appeared to dissipate over the following months, prosecutors say.</p><p>In July, not long before she was arrested in connection with Mr. Perry’s death, Ms. Sangha posted a photo on social media of a bracelet with several mushroom charms and the message, “Pulling out old raver candy #ravetothegrave.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Prosecutors later wrote in a court filing that the post suggested Ms. Sangha would “persist in her drug lifestyle until death,” and that the “#ravetothegrave” hashtag was “a callous choice of words, considering that her actions have sent two victims to theirs.”</p><p>Kitty Bennett<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
