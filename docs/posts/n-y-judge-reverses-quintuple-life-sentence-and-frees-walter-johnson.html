He freed Mr. Johnson, who hours later walked out of prison and back into society.</p><p>“Judges gain insights that with the passage of time only can come with experience on the bench and their judicial maturation,” Judge Block wrote in his decision granting Mr. Johnson’s petition for release. He added: “Just like prisoners who have evolved into better human beings during their lengthy periods of incarceration, judges also evolve with the passage of years on the bench.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At 90, Judge Block is a senior jurist on the same federal bench in the Eastern District of New York from which he sentenced Mr. Johnson as a second-year judge. He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/federal-sentencing-first-step-act.html" title="">seen shifts</a> in sentencing standards and wrestled with the issue enough to prompt him to <a href="https://thenewpress.com/authors/judge-frederic-block" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publish a book</a> last month that presents some of his past cases in making the argument for revisiting overly punitive sentences.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judge Frederic Block said that decades on the bench would change any jurist.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">New York Daily News Archive/Ny Daily News, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>And on Thursday, he put that philosophy into action with a remarkable filing, correcting a sentence that, while lawful, he now regarded as “excessively harsh.”</p><p>That morning, Mr. Johnson, mellowed at age 61 and plagued with a litany of health problems, was called to the phone at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville in upstate New York, where he had spent the past 16 years. He was told he would be released within hours.</p><p>“Judge Block gave me a gift I never thought was coming,” Mr. Johnson said by phone just after his release.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a phone interview, Judge Block called his decision “the mother of all compassionate release decisions so far” and one that reflected a changing outlook on prisoners enduring their punishments long into old age.</p><p>Mr. Johnson’s story began decades earlier in the Cypress Hills public housing apartment in Brooklyn where, as a teenager, he began running with robbery crews that targeted drug dealers.</p><p>Their misdeeds included sticking up entire subway cars on the F line. In 1982, Mr. Johnson was convicted of robbing 300 Jehovah’s Witnesses at his own mother’s church. And in 1983, he was convicted of holding up the passengers on a city bus.</p><p>Through the mid-1990s, he amassed more than a dozen arrests and served numerous sentences in state prison and on Rikers Island.</p><p>Mr. Johnson was acquitted in a 1993 nonfatal shooting of two off-duty New York City police officers during the robbery of a Brooklyn barbershop that had led to a shootout.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Perhaps most prominently, he was questioned in connection with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/nyregion/rap-artist-tupac-shakur-shot-in-robbery.html" title="">shooting</a> of the rapper Tupac Shakur outside a Manhattan recording studio in 1994. Mr. Shakur in his 1996 song “Against All Odds” warned: “Here we come, gunshots to Tut.” Mr. Johnson denied being at the shooting.</p><p>Mr. Johnson said that while he deserved to be punished, the sentence initially stunned him.</p><p>“I knew I was a troublesome individual and made some mistakes, but I said to myself, ‘I can’t be this guy who deserves five life sentences,’” said Mr. Johnson, who spent his first day of freedom with his wife, <a href="https://www.coachcococares.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Natoka Johnson</a>.</p><p>In prison, Mr. Johnson’s disciplinary record was stellar, said Judge Block and <a href="https://www.federaldefendersny.org/mia-eisnergrynberg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mia Eisner-Grynberg</a>, Mr. Johnson’s lawyer and a federal public defender in Brooklyn.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After Mr. Johnson was released, he visited the harbor in Stamford, Conn., with his wife, Natoka Johnson.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Georgiana Dallas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Johnson immersed himself in prison programs and helping other inmates, motivated by the attitude that, “Even if I got to die in jail, let me be the guy who tries to make a change,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The judge doesn’t realize what he did was actually one of the best lessons that’s ever been taught to me — he actually saved my life, because when I was in society I didn’t think much of myself,” Mr. Johnson said.</p><p>After his first arrest at 14, Mr. Johnson said, he became increasingly caught up with violent gangs that dominated street life in his neighborhood.</p><p>“I was taught violence and destructive behaviors,” he wrote in a letter to Judge Block. “I felt like a captive of the pain, confusion, fear and hate that I saw on a daily basis” and believed “that I could only be a thug, pariah, criminal and gangster.”</p><p>In the case before Judge Block, prosecutors said that Mr. Johnson had raped a woman, Crystal Winslow, during a drug robbery. Though he was not convicted of that, the judge said in his order that he had nonetheless weighed the accusation in his sentencing.</p><p>But Ms. Winslow wrote a letter to Judge Block as Mr. Johnson sought his release, saying that while the episode had a “profound impact on me” she forgave Mr. Johnson, whose “incarceration serves as a constant reminder of a painful past, hindering my ability to fully embrace the present.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Johnson has “served a substantial sentence and has had ample time to reflect on his actions,” she wrote.</p><p>Not everyone was pulling for Mr. Johnson. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn opposed his sentence reduction.</p><p>“Nothing about the defendant’s current circumstances or time in prison support a sentence reduction given the heinous nature of these crimes,” the prosecutor Amanda Shami wrote in a court filing in opposition to Mr. Johnson’s motion for a sentence reduction.</p><p>Patrick Hendry, the president of the New York City Police Benevolent Association, called the decision to release Mr. Johnson “dangerous for both police officers and the communities we serve.”</p><p>“The justice system sends a very dangerous message when it gives notorious, violent repeat offenders a free pass,” he said in a statement. “When someone with this kind of horrendous record walks out of prison, criminals take notice.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Johnson’s sentencing came when New York and the nation were ravaged by violent crime and the crack epidemic. In response to a public outcry, a federal “three strikes” law was passed in 1994 to mandate life sentences for certain repeat offenders — criminals like Mr. Johnson.</p><p>In the years after, critics called the law ineffective and rigid, and said it created lockups filled with aging prisoners who were disproportionately men of color.</p><p>In 2018, the federal First Step Act was enacted by enormous bipartisan margins and with President Donald J. Trump’s backing. It overhauled federal sentencing and allowed district court judges to reconsider their sentences and prisoners to seek compassionate release.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At 61, Mr. Johnson says he is no longer the sort of person who would rob parishioners while they were in church.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Georgiana Dallas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Ms. Eisner-Grynberg wrote in a letter to Judge Block in support of Mr. Johnson’s motion that his sentence was “now out of step” with current standards and that he deserved a second chance given “his excessively long, unusual sentence” and “extraordinary rehabilitation and remorse.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At the same time, Judge Block was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/federal-sentencing-first-step-act.html" title="">rethinking his philosophy and surveying his career</a>.</p><p>His book, “A Second Chance: A Federal Judge Decides Who Deserves It,” argues for giving judges wider discretion to revisit sentences that seemed appropriate when imposed but might be eased years later, especially given changes in laws and in attitudes toward rehabilitation.</p><p>In his filing this week, Judge Block commended the First Step Act for giving him “a second chance to reconsider the sentences I imposed on Johnson 27 years ago.”</p><p>He ordered Mr. Johnson’s sentence reduced to time served, plus three years of supervision.</p><p>“I was really against this guy at the time,” the judge said on Thursday. “He was a bad dude, way back when. He was.”</p><p>That was one reason for the five lifetime sentences, a punishment the judge said he could not recall any other federal defendants having received. But over time, he realized that “my job as a judge is to care about people.”</p><p>“Judges,” he said, “are not the same 27 years later.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Corey Kilgannon is a Times reporter who writes about crime and criminal justice in and around New York City, as well as breaking news and other feature stories.<span> </span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/18/nyregion/life-sentence-walter-johnson-reversed.html">125</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/18/nyregion/life-sentence-walter-johnson-reversed.html">125</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Racing to Plug a Tunnel Breach:</strong> A leak in the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/nyregion/queens-midtown-tunnel-leak.html">the scramble to repair it</a> revealed the fragility of New York City’s aging transportation network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Going Full Trump:</strong> In one of the most hostile, and consequential, House races in the country, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/nyregion/marc-molinaro-josh-riley.html">a moderate New York Republican is embracing Donald Trump</a> and leaning heavily on anti-immigrant sentiment.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Co-op Co-Founder Calls It Quits:</strong> In 1973, Joe Holtz helped start the Park Slope Food Co-op, a Brooklyn institution that is equally loved and ridiculed. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/nyregion/park-slope-food-coop-joe-holtz.html">Will it survive his retirement?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>What It Costs:</strong> Why does <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/nyregion/nyc-soft-gel-nail-extensions-price.html">this rainbow gel manicure</a> (with a chrome finish) cost $255?
