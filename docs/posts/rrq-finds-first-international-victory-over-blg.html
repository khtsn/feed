		<p>In the lower bracket of the Champions group stage, the number one seed from CN Bilibili Gaming faced off against Pacific&#39;s two seed Rex Regum Qeon. The Pacific team managed to find a 2-1 victory, sending China&#39;s best team home early without a win.</p>

<p>All three maps were convincing wins, with BLG taking Sunset 13-7, and RRQ taking Lotus and Abyss 13-8 and 13-4 respectively.</p>

<p>RRQ will go on to face MIBR to decide who will go to playoffs, while BLG becomes the second CN team to be eliminated.</p>
