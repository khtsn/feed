Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>World leaders at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro gathered for a group photo.

Those already there kept glancing around to see if the American president was going to join them.</p><p>By the time he settled into his spot in a back corner, sandwiched between the leaders of Thailand and Vietnam, Mr. Biden appeared to embrace the moment.</p><p>He slowly looked from side to side before exchanging a playful shrug with the prime minister of Malaysia.</p><p>It was Xi Jinping, the president of China and one of Mr. Biden’s chief global rivals, who commanded the position in front and at the center of the stage next to the summit’s host, President Dina Boluarte of Peru. (The placement of guest leaders was in alphabetical order by country.)</p><p>One of the more high-stakes moments of Mr. Biden’s trip was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/world/americas/biden-xi-meeting.html" title="">a meeting on Saturday with Mr. Xi</a> at the hotel where the Chinese leader was staying.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It was also the only time at either summit that a president who has a history of verbal miscues and has largely avoided news interviews answered any questions. Asked how he would work with China to handle North Korea, Mr. Biden simply said, “Peacefully.”</p><p>When a reporter shouted questions about Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden turned his back and walked with Mr. Xi into their meeting.</p><p>As they sat across from each other, Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi shared a moment of levity.</p><p>“Can you put on your earpiece?” Mr. Xi told his counterpart. “We have simultaneous interpreting.”</p><p>“I’ve learned to speak Chinese,” Mr. Biden joked, adding, “Wish I did.”</p><p>They then proceeded with their discussion on matters of great importance, including Taiwan and the contested South China Sea, as well as the growing economic competition between the two superpowers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>But they also paused to reminisce.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Biden signed a proclamation designating Nov. 17 as “International Conservation Day” when he visited Manaus,  a Brazilian city in the Amazon.  </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>When their meeting ended, they set aside their notes, Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, told reporters later.</p><p>They then reflected, Mr. Sullivan said, on “the fact that they’ve known each other for quite a long time now, that they have worked together closely, that they obviously haven’t always seen eye to eye, but they’ve always been straight with one another.”</p><p>Mr. Biden appeared more relaxed a day later, on Sunday, when he landed in Manaus, in the Brazilian Amazon, under a scorching sun, wearing bluejeans, a navy shirt and aviator glasses.</p><p>After climbing aboard the presidential helicopter, Marine One, he flew over the Rio Negro and the murky brown waters of the Amazon River.</p><p>Joined by his daughter, Ashley, and his granddaughter, Natalie, Mr. Biden was greeted with a traditional Indigenous ceremony. Three Indigenous leaders held maracas filled with seeds native to the rainforest and shook them to the rhythm of an ancestral chant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Biden then went on a brief exploration in the forest, walking over ant hills before delivering a speech on the importance of combating climate change.</p><p>“It’s true that some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that’s underway in America,” Mr. Biden said. “But nobody — nobody — can reverse. Nobody.”</p><p>Back in Rio on Tuesday, world leaders gathered for another group photo — this time ensuring that Mr. Biden would be in the picture.</p><p>Asked why the leaders had not waited for Mr. Biden the first time, Paulo Pimenta, Brazil’s minister of communications, said Brazilians prioritized punctuality.</p><p>“When it’s time, it’s time,” Mr. Pimenta said on Tuesday. </p><p>Mr. Biden took part in one more meeting on climate change on Tuesday, pleading with leaders to take the crisis seriously.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“History is watching us,” said Mr. Biden, who turns 82 on Wednesday. “I urge us to keep the faith and keep going.”</p><p>“I have much more to say,” he said, before reconsidering. “I’m not going to.”</p><p>Ana Ionova<!-- --> contributed reporting from Manaus, Brazil.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
