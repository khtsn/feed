A month earlier, on Valentine’s Day, she had tried to kill him by spiking his favorite sandwich, according to court documents. </p><p>Prosecutors said Ms. Richins had killed her husband for financial gain, as she was deeply in debt, and that she was planning a future with a man she had been having an affair with.</p><p>Ms. Richins faces a total of 11 charges, including attempted murder, multiple counts of forgery, intent to distribute a controlled substance, mortgage fraud and insurance fraud. Ms. Richins has denied any wrongdoing. She pleaded not guilty to all counts and jury selection is scheduled to start on April 28, 2025.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We firmly believe the charges against Kouri do not withstand thorough scrutiny and are confident that a jury will find the same,” her lawyers said in a statement.</p><h2 id="link-2e8e40bb">Ms. Richins, who wrote a children’s book about grief, was charged with murder last year.</h2><p>In March 2022, Ms. Richins and Mr. Richins were celebrating the closing of a home sold by Ms. Richins, a real estate agent, according to court documents. She made her husband a Moscow Mule, which prosecutors allege Ms. Richins drugged and then brought to their bedroom, where Mr. Richins drank it in bed.</p><p>Ms. Richins later told investigators that she woke up around 3 a.m., when one of their sons had a nightmare. When she went back to the couple’s bedroom, she said she found Mr. Richins unresponsive and called 911. Emergency responders found Mr. Richins at the foot of the bed and tried to revive him. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>About one year later, Ms. Richins published “Are You With Me?,” a children’s book she said she hoped would help her three boys process the loss, and <a href="https://www.abc4.com/gtu/a-childrens-book-to-aid-in-coping-with-grief/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promoted the book on a local news station</a>.</p><p>An autopsy report determined Mr. Richins had five times the lethal dose of fentanyl in his system. When confronted with the news, Ms. Richins told investigators she believed Mr. Richins had consumed a fentanyl-laced gummy, according to court documents. She was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/09/us/utah-murder-book-kouri-richins.html" title="">charged with his murder in May 2023</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Forensic analysis of burner phones used by Ms. Richins showed searches for “women utah prison,” “can cops.uncover deleted.messages iphone,” “if someone is poisned what does it go down on the death certificate as,” “how long does life insurance companies takento.pay” and “what is a lethal.does.of.fetanyl.”</p><h2 id="link-67d88274">It was not Ms. Richins’s first attempt, prosecutors said.</h2><p>Prosecutors claim that Ms. Richins began purchasing fentanyl pills from a housekeeper in January 2022.</p><p>Prosecutors also say that on the morning of Feb. 14, 2022, Ms. Richins bought a sandwich, poisoned it with the fentanyl and left it with a Valentine’s Day note in Mr. Richins’s truck for his lunch, according to a court brief. She then left to spend the day with a man she was having an affair with.</p><p>Mr. Richins felt so sick, breaking out in hives, that he drank a bottle of Benadryl, according to court documents, and self-administered one of his son’s EpiPens. After a deep sleep, Mr. Richins woke up and called a friend, to whom he said, “I think my wife tried to poison me,” prosecutors wrote in their brief.</p><p>Prosecutors said Ms. Richins’s “failed attempt” explained why 12 days later she asked the housekeeper “for something stronger,” adding the lethal dose to the Moscow Mule.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Richins’s lawyers have argued that the evidence against her is circumstantial, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/utah-killing-childrens-book-author-bail-hearing-0d468b50b3b8438f2cda1c2141a8bd59" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The A.P. reported</a>, and said last year that no drugs were found at the family home after Mr. Richins’s death. They also suggested that the housekeeper who claimed to sell Ms. Richins the drugs had motivation to lie for leniency on drug charges. </p><h2 id="link-38beb6f0">Prosecutors say Ms. Richins was deeply in debt from her house-flipping business.</h2><p>In 2019, Ms. Richins started her business flipping houses. To help fund her endeavors, Ms. Richins took out a $250,000 home equity line of credit on Mr. Richins’s house in Summit County, Utah.</p><p>But Mr. Richins, who was an owner of a stone masonry business, would not learn about the line of credit until a year later, when he stumbled upon the information during a bank visit, according to court documents. A handwriting expert for the prosecution said there was a strong probability that Ms. Richins had forged her husband’s signature to obtain the credit line.</p><p>On the day Mr. Richins died, Ms. Richins owed more than $3.1 million, court documents show.</p><p>“Her bank accounts were exhausted, and she was spiraling toward total financial collapse,” prosecutors wrote in their brief.</p><p>Mr. Richins, on the other hand, was worth about $5 million. In January 2022, Ms. Richins opened life insurance policies totaling nearly $2 million on her husband without his knowledge, prosecutors said, believing she would inherit his estate under the terms of a prenuptial agreement. However, Mr. Richins had quietly put much of his estate into a trust under his sister’s name.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
