		<p>&#34;but that he has been allowed by the organization to seek opportunities with a new team.&#34; does this mean that bbl just doesnt want him</p>

			<p>No it means that BBL want to let him explore other options and not keep him in a contract jail. They probably have other options as well but if none of those options pan out or they are picked up by other people then they would highly likely resign him.</p>
<p>Another scenario is that magnum was only signed till the end of 2025 (since he was only really a stand in) and now he&#39;s deciding on whether to resign or find another team. </p>		</div>

		<p>This is wild. BBL had amazing potential. Let&#39;s hope that they know what they are doing with this roster change...</p>

	<div data-post-id="5421040">
		
		
		<p>Magnum just got in the Team because Chiwawa couldnt Play. So I guess they let him Go and now Chiwawa is finally in this place </p>

		<p>magnum played really well, i don&#39;t think he was the problem </p>

	<div data-post-id="5421391">
		
		
		<p>its not abt him being the problem its that chiwa has to play in the roster at some point and magnum&#39;s contract is expiring befre next year</p>
