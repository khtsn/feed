		<p>Is he not still able to resign with them? I wonder who they would sign instead. Dude is crazy experienced and a good fragger. </p>

		<p>They picked up Chiwa last year but bc of visa issues he couldn&#39;t come, got his visa after Toronto but they decided to keep Magnum till season end. Chiwa &gt; Magnum so theres little to no chance he resigns</p>

		<p>CHIWA is right there compared to magnum he is quite an upgrade</p>

		<p>&#34;but that he has been allowed by the organization to seek opportunities with a new team.&#34; does this mean that bbl just doesnt want him</p>

			<p>No it means that BBL want to let him explore other options and not keep him in a contract jail. They probably have other options as well but if none of those options pan out or they are picked up by other people then they would highly likely resign him.</p>
<p>Another scenario is that magnum was only signed till the end of 2025 (since he was only really a stand in) and now he&#39;s deciding on whether to resign or find another team. </p>		</div>

		<p>This is wild. BBL had amazing potential. Let&#39;s hope that they know what they are doing with this roster change...</p>

	<div data-post-id="5421040">
		
		
		<p>Magnum just got in the Team because Chiwawa couldnt Play. So I guess they let him Go and now Chiwawa is finally in this place </p>

		<p>magnum played really well, i don&#39;t think he was the problem </p>

	<div data-post-id="5421391">
		
		
		<p>its not abt him being the problem its that chiwa has to play in the roster at some point and magnum&#39;s contract is expiring befre next year</p>

	<div data-post-id="5419426">
		
		
		<p>chiwa hasn&#39;t been playing too bad on joblife so I wonder if bbl is finally play with him lol.</p>
