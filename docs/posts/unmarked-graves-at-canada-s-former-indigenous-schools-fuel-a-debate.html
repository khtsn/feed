Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ordered flags to fly at half-staff, as many Canadians wore orange T-shirts with the slogan “Every Child Matters.”</p><p>Three years later, though, no remains have been exhumed and identified.</p><p>Many communities are struggling with a difficult choice: Should the sites be left undisturbed and transformed into memorial grounds, or should exhumations be done to identify any victims and return their remains to their communities?</p><p>While there is a broad consensus in Canada that children were taken from their families and died in these schools, as the discussions and searches have dragged on, a small universe of conservative Catholic and right-wing activists have become increasingly vocal in questioning the existence of unmarked graves. They are also skeptical of the entire national reconsideration of how Canada treated Indigenous people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Three years after the announcement about the former Kamloops residential school site, they ask, why has no proof of any remains been uncovered anywhere in the country?</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/06/multimedia/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/06/multimedia/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/06/multimedia/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A woman wearing Indigenous clothes sits in a chair." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/06/multimedia/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/06/multimedia/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/06/multimedia/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/06/multimedia/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc/00canada-mass-graves-casimir-qmbc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk’emlups te Secwepemc Nation said her tribe was still analyzing the results of its ground and document searches before deciding whether to conduct exhumations at the Kamloops site.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“There’s, so far, no evidence of any remains of children buried around residential schools,” Tom Flanagan, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Calgary and an author of “Grave Error: How the Media Misled Us (and the Truth About Residential Schools),” said in an interview.</p><p>“Nobody disputes,” he added, “that children died and that the conditions were sometimes chaotic. But that’s quite different from clandestine burials.”</p><p>The arguments by Mr. Flanagan and other skeptics have been roundly denounced by elected officials across the political spectrum who say evidence clearly suggests that there are many sites of unmarked burials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Chief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk’emlups te Secwepemc Nation, who made the announcement about the Kamloops site, said, “The denialists, they’re hurtful.

Some records show where remains may be buried, the coroner said, but there’s uncertainty about those findings.</p><p>At the Kamloops school site, where one of the largest number of potential gravesites was reported, Chief Casimir said her tribe was still analyzing the results of its ground and document searches before deciding whether to conduct exhumations.</p><p>Doing so, she added, would be “very intrusive.”</p><p>Kimberly Murray, a lawyer and a member of a Mohawk First Nation, was <a href="https://osi-bis.ca/about/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appointed by the federal government in 2021</a> to examine the issues surrounding potential Indigenous graves and make recommendations about protecting and commemorating the sites.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>She says she reminds communities that the work they are doing is because “the government purposely disappeared” Indigenous children, “by not proper record keeping, by not telling the families, by refusing to send them home.”</p><p>Many communities, Ms. Murray said, have expanded their physical searches and have employed additional methods to find remains.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A line of children’s clothing set along a highway in British Columbia in 2021 represented the children who died at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>One involves placing probes into the ground to detect specific soil acidity that is created by buried human remains.</p><p>Another process involves using short pulses of laser light to scan the surfaces of areas where government and church records, as well as the memories of former students, suggest there were burials. The process, using a technology known as lidar, can reveal patterns consistent with burial sites.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Some Indigenous communities have also brought in dogs trained to find remains.</p><p>In some cases, Ms. Murray said there was evidence that schools resorted to burying students in mass graves because of disease sweeping through the institutions or to store bodies until the spring thaw made digging graves possible.</p><p>Still, Indigenous communities have faced obstacles finding graves, Ms. Murray said, as they struggle getting access to records about the children who died at the schools from the Canadian government and the Catholic Church, despite pledges of cooperation.</p><p>Even if exhumations uncover remains, identifying individual bodies or determining a cause of death will likely be impossible, said Dr. Rebekah Jacques, a forensic pathologist who has been working with Indigenous communities that have potential gravesites.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kalamalka Lake in traditional Indigenous territory near Vernon, British Columbia.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Dr. Jacques has met members of Indigenous communities while serving as a member of a national committee on potential graves at school sites, and she said the question of exhumations hangs heavy over many groups.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“I don’t always have consensus myself about what to do,” she said. “So for me to expect for our communities to have consensus — well, I can really relate to that.”</p><p>She also believes that nothing Indigenous communities do, including exhumations, will satisfy skeptics.</p><p>For Mr. Flanagan and others who share his viewpoint, their disbelief that there are many gravesites is part of a broader argument against the key conclusion of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission: that the residential schools were a system of brutality that led to “cultural genocide.’’</p><p>“The narrative that’s been constructed pulls out all the bad stories and retails those and minimizes the benefit of residential schools,” Mr. Flanagan said, adding that converting Indigenous people in nations colonized by Europeans to Christianity and eradicating their cultures was once common worldwide.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>“The churches believed that it was their religious duty, and the politicians thought that it helped to civilize the Indians,” He said. “Would we do that today?

Obviously not,” Mr. Lametti, a former law professor now practicing law in Montreal, said. “But there’s enough preponderant evidence already that is compelling.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Many Indigenous people who favor exhumations want their communities to move more quickly to find remains.</p><p>On his ranch in the Tk’emlups te Secwepemc Nation, Garry Gottfriedson, a poet, retired academic and rodeo rider, said that as a former residential school student he wants more openness and progress from leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Garry Gottfriedson at his ranch in Tk’emlups te Secwepemc, British Columbia.
