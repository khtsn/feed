Edgar Hoover in aluminum flanked by two giant fingerprints.</p><p>Pfizer commissioned its mural from Mr. Bel-Jon as a statement piece that would greet visitors to its International Style tower, which opened in 1961. He created the artwork<strong> </strong>in his studio on East 72nd Street, in a converted synagogue where he lived with his family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Under Mr. Bel-Jon’s watchful eye, workers install the mural in the lobby of Pfizer’s world headquarters in 1961.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Art Green</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The mural was a mash-up of the conservative and the cutting-edge. The thousands of hand-cut tiles that comprised its background were an ancient art form, mosaic, rendered in the modern industrial material of aluminum. The portraits of medical figures were done in a traditional representational style, but the dynamic play of colored light on metal was an artistic innovation that evoked the innovation of Pfizer’s scientific research.</p><p>Michele H. Bogart, the author of “Public Sculpture and the Civic Ideal in New York City, 1890-1930,” said that the mural belonged to a noteworthy tradition of large-scale corporate patronage of civic public art.</p><h2 id="link-24a55354">Destined for the Dumpster?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The mural in the lobby of the old Pfizer headquarters on East 42nd Street, after the pharmaceutical giant had vacated the building for its new home on Manhattan’s west side.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ted Shaffrey/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-14"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The mural depicted a parade of historical figures representing medical progress through the millennia.

The building’s owners immediately agreed to donate the mural if a suitable home for it could be found in time, and Mr. Cronson quickly formed the Bel-Jon Art Preservation Alliance with art historians, the muralist’s daughters and seasoned preservationists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fragments of the dismantled mural in the lobby of Pfizer’s former headquarters on Oct. 9. “We only found out it was being moved when someone walked by and took a picture,” said Rhea Bel-Jon Calkins, a daughter of the artist.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Declan Gill</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Simultaneously, he cold-called strangers to try to assemble an intricate jigsaw puzzle of pieces: a public-facing institution with the space and desire to reinstall the fragile mural, an expert art handler to move it, and a donor to foot the bill.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The City University of New York School of Medicine wanted the mural and was prepared to send a team to assess whether its staff could perform the removal, likely to a storage facility with the hope of someday installing it on campus.</p><p>Acumen Capital Partners, owner of a 19th-century former Pfizer headquarters in Brooklyn, offered climate-controlled storage.

No. But it’s still a good thing because they’re saving a wonderful work of art, and they’re somewhere along the line acknowledging they made a mistake.”</p><p>Jack Berman, director of operations for Metro Loft, a co-owner of the former Pfizer building, said of the artwork in an email, “It is my understanding that the recent press about us trying to find a new home for it” reached Pfizer “and they decided to take it after all.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>He added that the mural “was owned by us” but that “we consented” to let Pfizer have it back.</p><p>Pfizer did not respond to questions from a reporter about whether the work would again be visible to the public, as it was for six decades.</p><p>“I’m concerned the public will not be afforded a proper opportunity to see an artwork that has universal significance,” Mr. Cronson said. “Beyond the stories the mural tells, it also speaks to Bel-Jon’s life as an immigrant who came to America to find a new path as an artist and was able to really make something out of nothing to develop a technique that was uniquely his own.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
