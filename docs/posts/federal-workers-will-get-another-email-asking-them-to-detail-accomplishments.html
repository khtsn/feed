The decision comes after O.P.M. leaders met with agency representatives on Thursday and advised them to send out the emails, according to the person. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>It was not clear as of Friday afternoon how widely the plans had been communicated across the federal work force, however. It was also unclear what consequences, if any, there would be if employees fail to comply. </p><p>Civilian workers at the Department of Defense received a heads-up on Friday afternoon that they would receive the email on Monday, and that a response was expected.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Reply to that email and cc your supervisor within 48 hours,” the notice said. “Submissions must exclude classified or sensitive information and will be incorporated into weekly situation reports by supervisors. Noncompliance may lead to further review.”</p><p>That amounts to significantly more guidance than federal employees received last weekend, when they were surprised by a mass email from the Office of Personnel Management that instructed them to reply with a list of five accomplishments from their previous workweek.</p><p>The blast came shortly after the billionaire Elon Musk, whom President Trump has tasked with overseeing a major downsizing of the federal work force, said on <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893386883444437415" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a> that it would be coming — and that failure to respond would be “taken as a resignation.”</p><p>“Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager. Please do not send any classified information, links, or attachments,” that first email read. The deadline to respond was 11:59 p.m. on Monday.</p><p>Although Mr. Musk said he was acting at the encouragement of President Trump, the directive sowed chaos and led to mass confusion across the federal government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In some cases, federal employees do not have access to their government email when they are not working. Some managers instructed employees to respond, while others told them not to. Privately, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/politics/elon-musk-email-doge-federal-workers-trump.html" title="">some agency leaders worried</a> that complying with Mr. Musk’s orders could result in employees revealing national security secrets and other sensitive information. By Monday afternoon, the Office of Personnel Management informed agencies that they did not have to require employees to respond.</p><p>It is possible that more employees will be expected to respond to an email with such instructions if it comes from their agency, and not the Office of Personnel Management.</p><p>The decision to send out another round of emails was first reported by The Washington Post.</p><p>Recent legal challenges have tested the limits of power that the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources arm, wields over the federal civilian work force, which is made up of roughly 2.3 million people. On Thursday night, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/politics/federal-layoffs-trump-opm.html" title="">federal judge ruled</a> that the agency had exceeded its authority when it issued memos outlining steps to fire most federal workers on probation.</p><p>“Congress has given the authority to hire and fire to the agencies themselves,” Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California said. “The Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute — in the history of the universe — to hire and fire employees within another agency.”</p><p>Earlier this week, Mr. Musk explained why he wanted federal employees to respond to the email.</p><p>“What we are trying to get to the bottom of is, we think there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead, which is probably why they can’t respond,” Mr. Musk said during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. “So, we’re just literally trying to figure out are these people real, are they alive, and can they write an email, which I think is a reasonable expectation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/latest-memos/guidance-on-government-wide-email-what-did-you-do-last-week.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">memo</a> published on Monday, the Office of Personnel Management urged agencies to consider whether they should require employees to submit bullets about their achievements as part of weekly activity reports.</p><p>The memo also directed agencies to “consider any appropriate actions regarding employees who fail to respond” and that it was up to their leadership to determine what actions should be taken.</p><p>Greg Jaffe<!-- --> and <!-- -->Zach Montague<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Madeleine Ngo covers U.S. economic policy and how it affects people across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/madeleine-ngo">More about Madeleine Ngo</a></span></p></div><div><p>Eileen Sullivan is a Times reporter covering national security and public safety policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eileen-sullivan">More about Eileen Sullivan</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/office-of-personnel-management">Office of Personnel Management</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Elon Musk’s Government Role</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Musk’s Email:</strong> After Elon Musk threatened to fire federal workers who failed to detail what they did during the workweek, cabinet secretaries tried to figure out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/politics/elon-musk-email-doge-federal-workers-trump.html">how to respond to a directive from President Trump’s most powerful adviser</a> without angering the president.</p></li><li><p><strong>Musk’s Cameo:</strong> At the first cabinet meeting of his second term, President Trump asked Musk to speak first.
