The decision comes after O.P.M. leaders met with agency representatives yesterday and advised them to send out the emails, according to the person.

By Monday afternoon, the Office of Personnel Management informed agencies that they did not have to require employees to respond to the email.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
