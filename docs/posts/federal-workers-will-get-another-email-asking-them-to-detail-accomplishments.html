    <h1>Federal Workers Will Get Another Email Asking Them to Detail Accomplishments</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In some cases, federal employees do not have access to their government email when they are not working. Some managers instructed employees to respond, while others told them not to. Privately, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/politics/elon-musk-email-doge-federal-workers-trump.html" title="">some agency leaders worried</a> that complying with Mr. Musk’s orders could result in employees revealing national security secrets and other sensitive information. By Monday afternoon, the Office of Personnel Management informed agencies that they did not have to require employees to respond.</p><p>It is possible that more employees will be expected to respond to an email with such instructions if it comes from their agency, and not the Office of Personnel Management.</p><p>The decision to send out another round of emails was first reported by The Washington Post.</p><p>Recent legal challenges have tested the limits of power that the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources arm, wields over the federal civilian work force, which is made up of roughly 2.3 million people. On Thursday night, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/politics/federal-layoffs-trump-opm.html" title="">federal judge ruled</a> that the agency had exceeded its authority when it issued memos outlining steps to fire most federal workers on probation.</p><p>“Congress has given the authority to hire and fire to the agencies themselves,” Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California said. “The Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute — in the history of the universe — to hire and fire employees within another agency.”</p><p>Earlier this week, Mr. Musk explained why he wanted federal employees to respond to the email.</p><p>“What we are trying to get to the bottom of is, we think there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead, which is probably why they can’t respond,” Mr. Musk said during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. “So, we’re just literally trying to figure out are these people real, are they alive, and can they write an email, which I think is a reasonable expectation.”</p></div></div>
