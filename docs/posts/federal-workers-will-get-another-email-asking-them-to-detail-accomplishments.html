    <h1>Federal Workers Will Get Another Email Asking Them to Detail Accomplishments</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Federal workers are expected to receive another email as soon as Saturday asking them to describe what they achieved this past week, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>The email will come directly from agencies’ human resources division this time, instead of from the Office of Personnel Management, the person said. The decision comes after O.P.M. leaders met with agency representatives yesterday and advised them to send out the emails, according to the person. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>The decision to send out another round of emails was first reported by The Washington Post.</p><p>Last Saturday, federal workers received an email from the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources arm, instructing them to detail their achievements from the past week by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on Monday.</p><p>“Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager. Please do not send any classified information, links, or attachments,” the email read.</p></div></div>
