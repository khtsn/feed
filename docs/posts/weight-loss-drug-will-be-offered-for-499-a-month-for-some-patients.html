    <h1>Weight Loss Drug Will Be Offered for $499 a Month for Some Patients</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Novo Nordisk will cut the price of its blockbuster weight loss medication Wegovy to $499 per month for certain patients who pay using their own money instead of going through insurance, the drug maker <a href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/media/news-archive/news-details.html?id=915288" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>The move could cause more patients to start taking the drug. But the impact stands to be limited, because the decision does not lower prices for patients who get their health insurance through government programs or for employers that are struggling with the huge costs of medications like Wegovy, which have revolutionized the treatment of obesity.</p><p>To be eligible for the reduced price, patients must be uninsured or commercially insured on plans that don’t cover the drug. Previously, the drug maker had <a href="https://www.novocare.com/obesity/products/wegovy/savings-offer.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offered a coupon</a> to such patients allowing them to get a month’s supply of the drug for $650; Wednesday’s move translates into savings of $150 per month for such patients.</p><p>The new offering is not available to tens of millions of Americans who get their insurance through government programs like Medicare and Medicaid — a demographic that largely lacks insurance coverage for weight loss drugs like Wegovy. To get Novo Nordisk’s drug, these patients must generally pay $1,300 or more per month out of pocket at a pharmacy.</p></div></div>
