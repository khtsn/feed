It was Rossy&#39;s old team in T1 that put an end to their hot streak in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/424008/t1-vs-cloud9-red-bull-home-ground-5-gf" target="_blank">grand finals</a>, where they were bested 3-1 in the series. Throughout the whole tournament, Rossy played lights out. He boasted the best performance of the main event with a 1.34 rating, clearing the next highest rating by a margin of 0.11.</p>

<p>Cloud9 stated in their announcement that Rossy&#39;s removal was a result of his in-game leading &#34;not [meshing] with how the team wanted to play,&#34; and was a unanimous decision from players and coaches. Rossy has <a href="https://x.com/RossyUA/status/1863703920029405248" target="_blank">announced</a> that he is now looking for a new team and that he holds “no hard feelings towards anyone apart of C9.”</p>

<p>For mitch, this will be his second stint on Cloud9. His <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/1161/cloud9-confirm-mitch" target="_blank">first</a> was as a part of Cloud9&#39;s founding roster when they joined the Valorant scene in 2020. He was the longest lasting member of that original roster, and even helped Cloud9 earn their only international qualification, that being to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/449/valorant-champions-2021" target="_blank">Champions 2021</a>. He was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/149516/cloud9-officially-part-with-mitch" target="_blank">let go</a> after the 2022 season, and moved to compete in NA Challengers as the IGL for <span data-ref-id="11">

The players rightfully refused and got stuck in contract jail for a bit. From 2019 to 2023 EG’s ceo basically did everything she could to kill the org(tried to run it like a normal business which just doesn’t work in esports) so they’ve been perpetually broke since she took over which is why they demanded the players take the pay cut</p>

<p>I mean, yes... the offseason doesn&#39;t mean a lot, but he was literally their best player during that just-for-fun REDBULL tourney. He showed that he is an awesome team player etc. and still got the good numbers.</p>
<p>This has to be because of health issues or other serious problems. No way they are replacing him because of his performance or whatever.</p>

<p>I get that team chemistry is important, but it&#39;s important because it helps you win, not the other way around. These are professionals who are getting paid to win games; if winning means being uncomfortable because your IGL is criticising you, maybe suck it up or find a different job.</p>
