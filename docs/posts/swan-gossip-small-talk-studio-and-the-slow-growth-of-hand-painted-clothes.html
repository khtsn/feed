She grabbed acrylic paint and some of her daughter’s old clothes and began creating an aquatic scene: pink koi swimming beneath white and green water lilies.</p><p>The birthday boy wasn’t much impressed by the artful present, but it planted a seed in Ms. Louthan’s mind.</p><p>A few months later, she tried her hand at a collection of about a dozen hand-painted adult sweatshirts and found a more appreciative audience. It was the beginning of Covid lockdowns, and Ms. Louthan, an artist in Philadelphia who graduated from Temple University’s<strong> </strong>Tyler School of Art and Architecture, was working as a freelance textile designer while at home with her husband and 1-year-old daughter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/23/multimedia/HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-pix-01-pzbq/HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-pix-01-pzbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/23/multimedia/HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-pix-01-pzbq/HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-pix-01-pzbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/23/multimedia/HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-pix-01-pzbq/HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-pix-01-pzbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Emma Louthan, wearing glasses and a green printed short-sleeve dress, sits at a wooden kitchen table with her hands folded.

She’s partnered with local boutiques; the streetwear brand, Teddy Fresh; and national retailers including Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and Free People on small batches of shirts, socks, bags and dresses.</p><p>“People say they can sense a certain energy in the hand-painted stuff,” Ms. Louthan said one afternoon this summer, while carefully adding green to a tendril on a pair of bluejeans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/23/00HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-57543-cover/00HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-57543-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/23/00HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-57543-cover/00HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-57543-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/07/23/121310_1_00HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-57543_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Ms. Louthan in the line-work stage of her three-part process.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Although her brand now has national reach, Ms. Louthan still paints her clothing at home, mostly on her kitchen table. Her process usually takes multiple days and consists of three stages: outlining forms, painting them and then heat-setting everything with an iron.</p><p>“I feel like with the rise of A.I., people are swinging the other way pretty intensely,” she said. “I think when everything feels so impersonal, people do gravitate toward art.”</p><p>Ms. Louthan’s work is fantastical, depicting off-kilter, edenic scenes of cherubs, rabbits, butterflies, devils, swans, moons and streams. She creates storybook worlds, where the sun smiles and jesters run wild.</p><p>She draws inspiration from illustrators of vintage children’s books (like Beatrix Potter and Roald Dahl); the Impressionist artist Mary Cassatt (known for her reverent paintings of domestic life); and ancient art.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-14"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/23/00HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-63394-cover/00HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-63394-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/23/00HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-63394-cover/00HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-63394-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/07/23/121309_1_00HAND-DRAWN-FASHION-63394_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">“I feel like with the rise of A.I., people are swinging the other way pretty intensely,” Ms. Louthan said. “I think when everything feels so impersonal, people do gravitate toward art.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Her daily walks to Awbury Arboretum, half a mile from her house, are also creative fodder. “There’s no roadblock,” she said, between what she sees blooming there and what she paints.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Before she had her first daughter, Rosie, in 2018, Ms. Louthan designed prints for mass market brands. Back then, she also painted by hand, but her designs would later be scanned, photoshopped and printed onto fabrics that would then be sold to companies like Gap, Old Navy and Alfred Dunner.</p><p>Ms. Louthan said her work today is “kind of the exact opposite of trying to design for thousands of people who want the same thing.”</p><p>Though Ms. Louthan occasionally orders plain white shirts or finds light-colored clothes in thrift stores, customers more frequently provide their own garments for her to paint (they have ranged from $800 Acne jeans to favorite old tees). It’s a way of giving clothes a second life, Ms. Louthan said, and making precious garments even more special.</p><p>The popularity of hand-drawn designs like hers can pose challenges. Producing a single garment is time consuming for artists and can also be physically taxing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-18"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cherries, berries and other fruits and botanicals often appear on Ms. Louthan’s clothes.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An old pair of jeans get a new life.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Ms. dela Roche of 69 Tearz used to joke that she was a “doodle machine.” But now, because of arthritis and bone spurs in her hand, she said, “I literally can’t hand-draw anything anymore.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Last year, she and Mr. Campanelli, her business partner, began screen-printing outlines of her designs onto garments.

When she works with brands like Anthropologie and Free People, she is often<strong> </strong>tasked with fulfilling bulk orders of the same garment — 60 pairs of natural-dyed socks, for example, or 40 T-shirts emblazoned with kittens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>“They know that it won’t be all the same, but it’s as similar as possible,” she said. “I just work in batches, you know, kind of assembly-line style.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A finished Swan Gossip T-shirt.
