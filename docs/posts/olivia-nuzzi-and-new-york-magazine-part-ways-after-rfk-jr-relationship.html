Kennedy Jr., has left the magazine.</p><p>New York Magazine said in a <a href="https://nymag.com/press/article/an-update-to-our-readers.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">note to readers</a> on Monday that an investigation by the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine had found “no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias” in Ms. Nuzzi’s coverage of the 2024 campaign.</p><p>“Nevertheless, the magazine and Nuzzi agreed that the best course forward is to part ways,” the statement read. “Nuzzi is a uniquely talented writer and we have been proud to publisher her work over her nearly eight years as our Washington correspondent. We wish her the best.”</p><p>A lawyer for Ms. Nuzzi, Ari Wilkenfeld, said in a statement on Monday that Ms. Nuzzi was “gratified though not surprised that two different investigations have determined that her reporting on the 2024 campaign was sound and that she did nothing wrong.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p> “She looks forward to the next chapter of her career,” Mr. Wilkenfeld added.</p><p>Ms. Nuzzi’s relationship with Mr. Kennedy came to light in September, after it was reported in the media newsletter <a href="https://www.status.news/p/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-new-york-magazine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Status</a>. New York magazine put her on leave, <a href="https://nymag.com/press/article/a-note-to-our-readers.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a> the personal relationship was “a violation of the magazine’s standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures.” The magazine’s editor reiterated in an email to the staff on Monday that the situation had “created at the very least the appearance of a conflict.”</p><p>Ms. Nuzzi has said that the relationship was never physical. A representative for Mr. Kennedy said he had only met Ms. Nuzzi “once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece.”</p><p>The fallout soon encompassed Ms. Nuzzi’s former fiancé, Ryan Lizza, Politico’s chief Washington correspondent. Ms. Nuzzi filed a temporary protective order against Mr. Lizza and accused him of threatening her with violence, hacking her devices, handing over “damaging information” to her employer and blackmailing her as a means of getting back into a relationship.</p><p>In a court filing last week, Mr. Lizza denied all of Ms. Nuzzi’s accusations and said she was “abusing the protections meant for survivors of domestic violence to ruin my reputation in a last-ditch effort to salvage her own.” Politico said earlier this month that Mr. Lizza and the publication had “mutually agreed” for him to take a leave of absence while an internal investigation was conducted.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
