    <h1>Olivia Nuzzi and New York Magazine Part Ways After RFK Jr. Relationship</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p> “She looks forward to the next chapter of her career,” Mr. Wilkenfeld added.</p><p>Ms. Nuzzi’s relationship with Mr. Kennedy came to light in September, after it was reported in the media newsletter <a href="https://www.status.news/p/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-new-york-magazine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Status</a>. New York magazine put her on leave, <a href="https://nymag.com/press/article/a-note-to-our-readers.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a> the personal relationship was “a violation of the magazine’s standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures.” The magazine’s editor reiterated in an email to the staff on Monday that the situation had “created at the very least the appearance of a conflict.”</p><p>Ms. Nuzzi has said that the relationship was never physical. A representative for Mr. Kennedy said he had only met Ms. Nuzzi “once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece.”</p><p>The fallout soon encompassed Ms. Nuzzi’s former fiancé, Ryan Lizza, Politico’s chief Washington correspondent. Ms. Nuzzi filed a temporary protective order against Mr. Lizza and accused him of threatening her with violence, hacking her devices, handing over “damaging information” to her employer and blackmailing her as a means of getting back into a relationship.</p><p>In a court filing last week, Mr. Lizza denied all of Ms. Nuzzi’s accusations and said she was “abusing the protections meant for survivors of domestic violence to ruin my reputation in a last-ditch effort to salvage her own.” Politico said earlier this month that Mr. Lizza and the publication had “mutually agreed” for him to take a leave of absence while an internal investigation was conducted.</p></div></div>
