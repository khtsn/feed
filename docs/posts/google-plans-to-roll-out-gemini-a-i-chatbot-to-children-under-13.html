To sign up for a child account, parents provide the tech company with personal data like their child’s name and birth date.</p><p>Gemini has specific <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-bard-expansion-teens/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guardrails for younger users</a> to hinder the chatbot from producing certain unsafe content, said Karl Ryan, a Google spokesman. When a child with a Family Link account uses Gemini, he added, the company will not use that data to train its A.I.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Introducing Gemini for children could accelerate the use of chatbots among a vulnerable population as schools, colleges, companies and others grapple with the effects of popular generative A.I. technologies. Trained on huge amounts of data, these systems can produce humanlike text and realistic-looking images and videos.</p><p>Google and other A.I. chatbot developers are locked in a fierce competition to capture young users. President Trump recently <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/advancing-artificial-intelligence-education-for-american-youth/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged schools to adopt the tools</a> for teaching and learning. Millions of teenagers are already using chatbots as study aids, writing coaches and virtual companions. Children’s groups warn the chatbots could pose serious <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/technology/characterai-lawsuit-teen-suicide.html" title="">risks to child safety</a>. The bots also sometimes make stuff up.</p><p>UNICEF, the United Nation’s children’s agency, and other children’s groups have noted that the <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innocenti/generative-ai-risks-and-opportunities-children" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A.I. systems could confuse, misinform and manipulate</a> young children who may have difficulty understanding that the chatbots are not human.</p><p>“Generative A.I. has produced dangerous content,” UNICEF’s global research office said in a post on A.I. risks and opportunities for children.</p><p>Google acknowledged some risks in its email to families this week, alerting parents that “Gemini can make mistakes” and suggesting they “help your child think critically” about the chatbot.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The email also recommended parents teach their child how to fact-check Gemini’s answers. And the company suggested parents remind their child that “Gemini isn’t human” and “not to enter sensitive or personal info in Gemini.”</p><p>Despite the company’s efforts to filter inappropriate material, the email added, children “may encounter content you don’t want them to see.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Google email to parents this week warned about the risks of Gemini for children.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Over the years, tech giants have developed a variety of products, features and safeguards for teens and children. In 2015, Google <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-kids/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced YouTube Kids</a>, a stand-alone video app for children that is popular among families with toddlers.</p><p>Other efforts to attract children online have prompted concerns from government officials and children’s advocates. In 2021, Meta halted plans to introduce an Instagram Kids service — a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/technology/instagram-kids.html" title="">version of its Instagram app</a> intended for those under the age of 13 — after the attorneys general of several dozen states sent <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/naag-letter-to-facebook/download" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a letter to</a> the company saying the firm had “historically failed to protect the welfare of children on its platforms.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some prominent tech companies — including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html" title="">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/31/technology/amazon-25-million-childrens-privacy.html" title="">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/06/ftc-will-require-microsoft-pay-20-million-over-charges-it-illegally-collected-personal-information" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> — have also paid multimillion-dollar fines to settle government complaints that they violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. That federal law requires online services aimed at children to obtain a parent’s permission before collecting personal information, like a home address or a selfie, from a child under 13.</p><p>Under the Gemini rollout, children with family-managed Google accounts would initially be able to access the chatbot on their own. But the company said it would alert parents and that parents could then manage their child’s chatbot settings, “including turning access off.”</p><p>“Your child will be able to access Gemini Apps soon,” the company’s email to parents said. “We’ll also let you know when your child accesses Gemini for the first time.”</p><p>Mr. Ryan, the Google spokesman, said the approach to providing Gemini for young users complied with the federal children’s online privacy law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Natasha Singer is a reporter for The Times who writes about how tech companies, digital devices and apps are reshaping childhood, education and job opportunities.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/alphabet-inc">Alphabet Inc.</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Coverage of Artificial Intelligence</h2><hr/><p><strong>News</strong><strong> and Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Google’s Antitrust Case and the A.I.
