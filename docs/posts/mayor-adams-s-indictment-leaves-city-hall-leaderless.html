    <h1>Mayor Adams’s Indictment Leaves City Hall Leaderless</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The indictment of New York City’s Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday for charges that include bribery and soliciting foreign donations represents the lowest point of a failed mayoralty that has delivered stunningly little to the city it was meant to serve.</p><p>Adams was elected in 2021 vowing to improve public safety and trust in the Police Department. He said he would be a voice for working-class residents in the city. He promised a campaign focused on literacy in the nation’s largest public school system.</p><p>What New York City received instead was a mayor who filled City Hall with his cronies and patronage hires. Several of his highest-ranking appointments, including his former police commissioner, schools chancellor and a top deputy mayor, are under separate federal investigations, and several are among a widening group of city officials who have resigned, either in protest or disgrace.</p><p>According to federal officials, Adams used his office for personal gain, soliciting a contribution from foreign officials, committing wire fraud and bribery. He took discounted trips and luxury travel benefits from the Turkish government, the indictment said, and engaged in a conspiracy to accept and conceal foreign campaign contributions, which are illegal. In exchange, he let a Turkish consular building open without a proper Fire Department inspection.</p></div></div>
