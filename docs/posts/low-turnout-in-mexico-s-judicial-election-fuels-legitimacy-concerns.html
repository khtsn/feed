The nationwide election of thousands of judges over the weekend was marked by an exceptionally high level of abstention, with nearly 90 percent of voters opting not to take part.</p><p>Only 12.6 percent to 13.3 percent of voters cast ballots in Sunday’s election, according to estimates from the national electoral authority, fueling legitimacy concerns. That means <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/world/americas/mexico-judiciary-election-supreme-court.html" title="">the contentious judicial election</a> had one of the lowest turnouts in any federal election since the early 2000s, when Mexico transitioned to a democracy.</p><p>The dismal turnout points to the confusion and indecision across the country over the election, which shifts the judiciary from an appointment-based system to one in which voters choose judges. Supporters of the plan have argued that it makes the system more democratic, while critics have characterized it as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/world/americas/mexico-election-morena-democracy.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">a power grab</a> by the governing leftist Morena party.</p><p>Some voters who did turn out expressed puzzlement over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/01/world/americas/mexico-judicial-election-ballots.html" title="">the bewildering number of candidates</a> vying for nearly 2,700 judgeships, including those who will sit on the Supreme Court and hundreds of other federal and local tribunals. Electoral monitoring groups reported that several voters simply used cheat sheets provided by Morena, President Claudia Sheinbaum’s party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It did not seem to me to be a democratic exercise — it was a clear attempt to manipulate the vote,” said Laurence Pantin, an expert on judicial independence and director of <a href="https://juiciojusto.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Juicio Justo</a>, or Fair Trial,<span>  </span>a nonprofit organization that seeks to broaden access to justice in Mexico.</p><p>Ms. Pantin and other volunteers said they had detected several irregularities on Sunday, including voters carrying printed sheets indicating which candidates to select, multiple people entering voting booths at once and voters taking photos of their filled ballots — a possible indication of vote buying.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Claudia Sheinbaum and her husband, Jesús María Tarriba, arriving to vote in Mexico City on Sunday.

By contrast, turnout was about 60 percent in last year’s election, in which Ms. Sheinbaum won the presidency.</p><p>Still, she said that the high end of the estimated voter turnout, 13 percent, was double that for a 2021 referendum on whether to investigate former presidents, which saw a participation of about 7 percent.</p><p>But the stakes were much lower in 2021, when the government was simply polling the population. This time, in one of the most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/americas/100000010195231/why-mexicos-judicial-election-is-a-controversial-experiment.html" title="">far-reaching judicial overhauls</a> attempted by any major democracy, voters were called upon to replace about half of Mexico’s judges; they will elect the rest in 2027.</p><p>The idea to elect judges by popular vote was proposed by Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Ms. Sheinbaum’s predecessor as president and her political mentor. He contended that the overhaul was needed to root out corruption and nepotism, and he pushed for it after the Supreme Court and federal judges stymied or blocked some of his flagship infrastructure projects and plans, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/world/americas/mexico-electoral-bill-supreme-court.html" title="">weakening Mexico’s electoral watchdog agency</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A demonstrator shouting slogans against the country’s first judicial elections at a protest in Mexico City on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fernando Llano/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Because Mexico votes with paper ballots, which must be counted by hand, results for the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court, were not expected to be announced until Monday or later this week. Still, <a href="https://computospj2025.ine.mx/scjn/nacional/candidatos" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">preliminary results</a> made available on Monday signaled that various candidates aligned with the governing party were expected to win seats on the Supreme Court.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Opposition figures and legal experts had feared such an outcome, arguing that Morena could use its current popularity among voters to consolidate control over the judiciary well into the future, eroding the separation of powers in Mexico’s political system.</p><p>Despite such concerns, some voters said they were simply perplexed by having to vote for so many judges at the same time.</p><p>“I didn’t know anyone,” said Jorge López Lozaya, 58, who voted in Ciudad Juárez, across the U.S. border from El Paso, Texas. “So I just picked eeny, meeny, miny, moe to see how it turns out.”</p><p>Viri Ríos, a political analyst, said that voter turnout had been similar to that for judicial elections elsewhere in the world — albeit smaller in scale than Mexico’s — and that any institutional overhaul would generate problems and not be seamless.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>She added, however, that these elections would pose a “serious problem” for Morena down the road, because “solving the problems of the judicial system is complex.”</p><p>Many Mexicans agree that the judicial system needed reform. But now that the overhaul pushed by Morena has been achieved, Ms. Ríos said, the party will have to show results.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Poll workers in Mexico City on Sunday.

Adding to the confusion, the judiciary filed more than 600 legal actions to stop the vote, even though it was opposing an election that had already been enshrined in the Constitution.</p><p>Rocío Gallegos<!-- --> contributed reporting from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emiliano Rodríguez Mega is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.</p></div><div><p>James Wagner covers Latin America, including sports, and is based in Mexico City.
