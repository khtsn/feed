    <h1>A Trip to New York</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/11/30/style/holiday-windows-saks-macys-christmas" title="">window displays at Bergdorf Goodman</a> beckon. There’s a new riverside ice rink in Williamsburg. Buildings, brownstones and bodegas across the city pop with decorations. A woman I saw holding court on the 6 train last week was accessorized with felt antlers, a gaudy Christmas sweater and three large dogs also wearing holiday sweaters.</p><p>But the crowds these days, and oh, the prices! The cost of everything, from sandwiches to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/nyregion/new-york-city-hotels.html" title="">hotel rooms</a>, has soared. And the city expects to get nearly 65 million visitors this year, <em>this close </em>to prepandemic levels. In recent days, it has felt as if all of those people are on the sidewalks of Midtown, furiously trying to elbow their way into Bryant Park’s holiday market.</p><p>In today’s newsletter, I’m going to share eight tips for enjoying New York — whether you’re visiting for the holidays or any other time of the year — without going broke or getting lost in the crowd.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Louis Vuitton flagship store during the holidays this year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><strong>1. The city that never sleeps tends to wake up late. </strong>Crowds are sparse in the early mornings across all the boroughs, even at the top tourist spots. So grab a bodega coffee and enjoy Rockefeller Center at 5 a.m., when the Christmas tree lights up daily, or walk across the Brooklyn Bridge at sunrise.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>2. You need to book that table, reserve that slot, buy those tickets in advance.</strong> This is crucial for the must-do activities on your itinerary, including fine dining (here is The Times’s list of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-nyc-restaurants.html" title="">New York City’s 100 best restaurants</a>), some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/broadway-tickets-tips.html" title="">Broadway shows</a> and even visits to Santa at Macy’s. You may pay less for off-peak times, or reservations might even be free, but you’ll still need a reservation.</p><p><strong>3. Otherwise, New York remains a frenetic place.</strong> For inspiration, look to our recently published 36 Hours columns on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/06/travel/things-to-do-nyc.html" title="">New York City</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/06/travel/things-to-do-brooklyn.html" title="">Brooklyn</a>, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/travel/christmas-holiday-nyc-guide.html" title="">our locals’ guide to celebrating the holidays</a>. (A few suggestions from me: Walking is free and entertaining, and rooftop bars are still a thing, even in winter.) But remember to pace yourself.</p><p><strong>4. And remember, there’s more than Manhattan. </strong>For cold, gray days, visit offbeat museums like Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, or the New York Transit Museum in Downtown Brooklyn. Summertime could mean <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/24/nyregion/climate-hub-governors-island.html" title="">Governors Island</a> for camping, taking in views of the Statue of Liberty and sliding down the city’s longest slide. In the fall, the Queens County Farm Museum has one of the East Coast’s best corn mazes. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-food-scene/bronx-sidewalk-clam-heaven" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oysters served curbside on Arthur Avenue</a> are worth a trip to the Bronx, but so is the Bronx Zoo, City Island or the New York Botanical Garden.</p><p><strong>5. You actually don’t need to spend a ton. </strong><a href="https://www.nyctourism.com/articles/free-museums-in-nyc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Free and sometimes-free museums</a> abound. Check out newsletters like <a href="https://donyc.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DoNYC</a> and <a href="https://theskint.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Skint</a>, which list free events, cheap tickets and discounts. Of course, New York also has the best <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-nyc-pizza-pizzeria.html" title="">pizza</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-bagels-nyc.html" title="">bagels</a> and other inexpensive eats. Our Frugal Traveler columnist, Elaine Glusac, recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/travel/new-york-budget-travel.html" title="">explored New York on a budget</a>; she walked the city and ate takeout, saw free art and found cheap theater tickets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>6. Don’t be part of our congestion problem. </strong>Our traffic is the worst in the world (always No. 1!), so for all of the places you want to go, take the subway, unlock a Citi Bike, hop on a ferry or walk.</p><p><strong>7. New Yorkers like to complain, but</strong> <strong>it’s not all that bad.</strong> Yes, there are crowds. But it’s still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8da1KdwgwFE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the greatest city in the world</a> with countless reasons to visit. The last few years have seen more developed green spaces, more ferry routes and more e-bikes in the bike-share program. We have a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/arts/design/perelman-performing-arts-center-review.html" title="">new performing arts center</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/25/arts/design/gilder-center-natural-history-museum.html" title="">a new wing of an old friend</a>, even a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/arts/little-island-barry-diller.html" title="">new island</a>.</p><p><strong>8. Enjoy our city of contradictions.</strong> We New Yorkers love to have you here. Just don’t talk loudly, walk slowly, stop suddenly on the sidewalk or make direct eye contact on the subway. Feel free to ask for directions, however. We’ll not only help with a smile, but probably show you the way.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-73787e10">South Korea</h2><ul><li><p>President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment and suspension from office has left South Korea, one of the United States’ most important allies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment.html" title="">without a strong​ elected leader</a>.</p></li><li><p>South Korea faces challenges like a threatening North Korea and deep political polarization at home. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment-yoon-explained.html" title="">We explained the impeachment</a>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-51e2f62f">Politics</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Stephanopoulos, the ABC News star at the center of Trump’s lawsuit.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paula Lobo/ABC</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Tel Rifaat, Syria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rainatou Diallo, 32, in her brother’s home, where she fled to after her husband was killed in Burkina Faso.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arlette Bashizi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><ul><li><p>Burkina Faso is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/africa/africa-burkina-faso-militia-violence.html" title="">on the brink of civil war</a>.

It has sold almost three million copies, been published in more than 20 languages and been on the Times best-seller list for 243 weeks (and counting) — all by showing us how to repair our relationship with the natural world. Now, in her latest best seller, Kimmerer helps us reframe our priorities using the abundant serviceberry as a guide. What <em>is</em> a serviceberry, you might wonder? It’s a harbinger of spring, “the best of the berries,” Kimmerer, a plant ecologist and member of the Potawatomi Nation, writes in this persuasive treatise about the supremacy of the natural world over the economic one. John Burgoyne’s line drawings bolster her timely argument with a simplicity reminiscent of Garth Williams’s illustrations in “Charlotte’s Web.”</p><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>Before we look forward to 2025, why not take stock of the past through the lenses of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/books/review/new-historical-fiction.html" title="">these new historical novels</a>? “The Last Whaler” and “Pearly Everlasting” pair especially well with “The Serviceberry.”</p></li><li><p>Nikki Giovanni, the renowned and unafraid poet, died this week.

We spoke about the transformational power of travel, which he still very much believes in despite a growing nativist sentiment around the world, as well as his recent cancer diagnosis.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>You’ve been very open about receiving a diagnosis of prostate cancer. How are you doing?</strong></p><p>Well, thank you. I’m doing as well as you can be doing when you have prostate cancer. A month ago, I said goodbye to my prostate. I see it as a journey. I don’t speak the language. The locals are friendly. I don’t know exactly where it’s going. I’m not in control of the itinerary. I want to tackle it with what I consider a traveler’s mind-set. But it’s scary at the same time.</p><p><strong>Has it given you more of an urgency to do things you haven’t done before?</strong></p><p>No, but it gives me an awareness of what you might regret when you’re wrapping up your life. You know, you think about that.</p><p><strong>What have been the sacrifices of being on the road so much? Because you have spent such a huge portion of your life going out elsewhere and discovering.</strong></p><p>There are regrets. It has not been good for my family. I got divorced. It has not been great for relationships with loved ones. It’s a choice you have to make. You know, I would love to be the person I was before I was a travel writer. I would have had a very, very beautiful life being a piano teacher and coming home every night for dinner and mowing the lawn and joining clubs and being regular and reliable. But I’ve chosen a different path. It’s a mission for me. And I don’t spend a lot of time explaining to people why my values are the way they are, my priorities are the way they are. And in a way I’m sad about it, but again, you have to make a choice.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/magazine/rick-steves-interview.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id="link-640bc3b8"><span><strong>THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photo illustration by Vanessa Saba.
