    <h1>A Powerful Earthquake Devastated Myanmar</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>A 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar today and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/28/world/myanmar-earthquake" title="">wrought destruction across a vast expanse of Southeast Asia</a>. The quake — one of the three largest to hit the region in a century — gouged open roads, toppled century-old religious monuments and destroyed many multistory buildings.</p><p>The U.S. Geological Survey, which tracks seismic activity, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/myanmar-earthquake-thailand-mandalay.html" title="">estimated that the death toll was likely to surpass 10,000 people</a>, and that there was a possibility of a much higher toll. A preliminary count from Myanmar’s military government said that at least 144 people had been killed and 732 injured in just three cities. That did not include Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, which is just 10 miles from the epicenter.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/myanmar-thailand-earthquake-photos.html" title="">Photos and videos from the country showed stunning scenes of destruction</a>. A giant metal bridge near Mandalay partially collapsed into the river. Monks cried out as a monastery building toppled over. And patients at Mandalay General Hospital laid on the concrete in the 100-degree heat.</p><p>The quake was strong enough to level a 33-story building that was under construction more than 600 miles away in Bangkok, in neighboring Thailand. At least eight people died there, the authorities said. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/28/world/asia/myanmar-earthquake-tracker.html" title="">Here’s a map of the affected area</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The full extent of the devastation was hard to assess in a country that has largely been isolated from the rest of the world. Electricity and communication lines were down. Myanmar’s ruling junta, which is under heavy U.S. sanctions, made an extraordinary plea for international assistance. President Trump promised that the U.S. would help, and the U.N. set aside initial relief funds.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump at the White House today. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-7f1967a4">The legal world is split over Trump’s attacks</h2><p>Trump announced today that he had made a deal with the elite law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. The firm agreed to provide $100 million in pro bono work on issues that Trump supported. The deal was an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/28/us/trump-greenland-vance-news" title="">effort to avoid the kind of punishing executive orders</a> that the president recently imposed on firms that employed lawyers whom he perceived as enemies.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/business/jenner-block-wilmer-hale-trump-lawsuit.html" title="">Other firms have decided to fight back</a>. Today, two big firms sued the Trump administration, seeking to stop executive orders that could significantly harm their businesses. The firms, Jenner &amp; Block and WilmerHale, had previously employed lawyers who investigated Trump’s ties to Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vice President JD Vance, center, in Greenland today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Jim Watson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-79b67e54">Vance went to Greenland, a place that didn’t want him</h2><p>Vice President JD Vance, his wife, Usha, and a couple other top U.S. officials spent roughly three hours today in Greenland, a territory of Denmark that Trump has vowed to acquire “one way or the other.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/greenland-jd-vance-usha.html" title="">He found the weather, and the reception, chilly</a>.</p><p>The trip was significantly scaled back after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/jd-vance-greenland-visit-denmark-us.html" title="">island’s government blasted the trip</a> as “highly aggressive” and residents geared up to protest.

Kennedy Jr., now the health secretary, said the Trump administration would advise all states to remove fluoride from public water.</p><p>Since 1945, fluoride has been added to U.S. drinking water to prevent cavities. Research suggests it has improved oral health. But the mineral has come under renewed scrutiny, as studies have linked extremely high levels of fluoride exposure — more than twice as high as people are generally exposed to through community fluoridation — with lower childhood I.Q.s.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-55bd377a">More top news</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Ukraine: </strong>After losing much of the ground it gained in a previous incursion into Russia, Kyiv <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/ukraine-attack-russia-belgorod.html" title="">appears to have staged another cross-border push</a>, this time into the Belgorod region.</p></li><li><p><strong>Economy: </strong>Ahead of Trump’s escalating trade war, new data indicates that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/business/economy/us-inflation-pce-trump-trade-tariffs.html" title="">inflation remained sticky in February</a>.
