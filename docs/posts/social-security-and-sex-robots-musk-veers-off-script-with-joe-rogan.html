And it created a fresh headache for Republicans who have labored to explain how they plan to cut the budget drastically without slashing popular programs like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/trump-budget-medicaid.html" title="">Medicaid</a>.</p><p>These are the remarkable and at times surreal risks inherent in Trump’s decision to turn his presidency into a kind of co-production with a world-famous, often undisciplined billionaire. And the interview laid them bare.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The appearance — Musk’s most extensive solo interview since the beginning of Trump’s second administration — offered a window into his worldview that was by turns crude and contradictory. Musk defended his efforts with his Department of Government Efficiency, alternatively casting it as existential and downplaying its scope, while expounding on not-safe-for-work interests like A.I. sex robots.</p><p>Here are some takeaways from the conversation.</p><h3 id="link-707f73de"><span><strong>Musk acknowledged he has far-reaching goals.</strong></span></h3><p>Musk repeatedly acknowledged just how radical his aims are, calling his project of slashing the government work force, cutting contracts and eliminating regulations a “revolution” against the federal bureaucracy.</p><p>“Normally, the bureaucracy eats revolutions for breakfast,” he said. “This is the first time that they’re not, that the revolution might actually succeed.”</p><p>It is, he admitted, very different from the slower pace of change during Trump’s first administration.</p><p>“This is nothing like the first term,” Rogan later agreed.</p><p>“Yeah, this is a revolutionary cabinet,” the billionaire said, “and maybe the most revolutionary cabinet since the first revolution.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h3 id="link-70f573de"><span><strong>But at times he downplayed his role.</strong></span></h3><p>Several lawsuits against Musk and his department involve the question of just what his role is, and whether he is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-lawsuits.html" title="">legally obligated</a> to be more transparent around his work.</p><p>In the interview, Musk appeared well aware of the need to downplay his role as a result. Even as he portrayed his efforts as transformational, he cast his department as a nonbinding adviser to government agencies.</p><p>“These are cuts that DOGE recommends to the department. And usually these recommendations are followed,” Musk said. “But these are recommendations that are then confirmed by the department.”</p><h3 id="link-2d7e4456"><span><strong>He expounded on his futurist beliefs.</strong></span></h3><p>Musk described artificial intelligence as “something we should be worried about,” but suggested he had gotten involved in the technology in order to develop a system that “doesn’t tell you that misgendering is worse than nuclear war.”</p><p>Musk said he believed A.I. would be smarter than any individual human in the next year or two, and predicted that A.I. would be smarter than all humans combined by 2029 or 2030. He said he thought there was an 80 percent chance that A.I. would have a “good outcome,” and that there was a 20 percent chance of “annihilation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He also talked about his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/technology/elon-musk-spacex-mars.html" title="">long-held dream of populating Mars</a>, which he described as “incredibly important in ensuring the long-term survival of civilization.”</p><p>He characterized it as a race against time.</p><p>“Can we make Mars self-sufficient before civilization has some sort of future fork in the road where there’s either, like, a war, nuclear war or something, or we get hit by a meteor or simply civilization might just die with a whimper in adult diapers instead of with a bang?”</p><h3 id="link-6aa88ab5"><span><strong>Musk invoked numerous conspiracy theories.</strong></span></h3><p>At one point, Musk seemingly referred to a tenet of the so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/15/us/replacement-theory-shooting-tucker-carlson.html" title="">great replacement theory</a>, which holds that Western elites want to “replace” white Americans with immigrants.</p><p>“The more illegals that the Democrats can bring in, the more likely they are to win, so that’s what they’re going to do,” he said.</p><p>He then described a conspiracy theory that liberals were planning to turn swing states blue by legalizing undocumented immigrants, calling it “an attempt to destroy democracy in America” and saying that preventing that outcome had been the “fork in the road” moment that led him to support Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We will be a permanent one-party-state country — a permanent deep-blue, socialist state, that’s what America will become,” he warned.</p><p>During the interview, Musk also suggested that the government was keeping secret “a mountain of evidence,” including videos and recordings, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/business/jeffrey-epstein-files-pam-bondi.html" title="">made by Jeffrey Epstein</a>; speculated that federal government programs to prevent the spread of Ebola were actually involved in creating new strains of the virus; and claimed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/vance-duffy-trump-dei-crash.html" title="">without evidence</a> that “a bunch of really good, talented old white guys” had been pushed out of the Federal Aviation Administration as air traffic controllers to make room for less qualified women and people of color.</p><p>“We should not put the public safety at risk because of some demented philosophy,” he said.</p><h3 id="link-31652bf4"><span><strong>Musk said he’s not a Nazi — and seemingly made light of such accusations.</strong></span></h3><p>At one point, Rogan asked Musk what it was like to have purchased Twitter, “and then people call you a Nazi on that same thing you bought?”</p><p>Musk seemed to respond with puns. “I did not see it coming,” he said, seemingly pronouncing the word “Nazi” in the middle of the sentence, a joke he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/business/elon-musk-tesla-firing-worker.html" title="">also made in writing</a>. “It’s classic,” he said.</p><p>“People will Goebbels anything down,” he said, seeming to pronounce the last name of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi politician, instead of the word “gobble.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Rogan said it was “strange” that Musk had been accused of doing a Nazi salute after he made a hand gesture that looked like one after Trump’s inauguration. “Now, I can never point at things diagonally,” Musk said.</p><p>“Hopefully, people realize I am not a Nazi,” Musk said, adding that one would have to be invading Poland, committing genocide and starting wars to be considered a Nazi. “The war and genocide is the bad part,” he said, “not their mannerisms and their dress code.”</p><h3 id="link-23cfa258"><span><strong>Musk and Rogan talked about A.I.-powered sex robots.</strong></span></h3><p>Improbably, the opening minutes of the interview featured Rogan and Musk, who is a special adviser to the president and who has an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, discussing how quickly sex robots powered by A.I. technology could be brought to market.</p><p>“Probably not long,” said Musk, who recently unveiled his own A.I. software. “Less than five years probably.”</p><p>“Really?” Rogan asked. “Will it be warm?”</p><p>“You can probably have whatever you want,” Musk replied, before the two men discussed the possibility of having sex with a “furry lady” or an alien from the movie “Avatar.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-13"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jess Bidgood is a managing correspondent for The Times and
