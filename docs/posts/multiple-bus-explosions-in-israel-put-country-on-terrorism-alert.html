There were no injuries reported.</p><p>After the explosions, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that he had instructed the military to carry out “a massive operation” in the West Bank targeting militant hubs and had ordered the police and intelligence forces to step up preventive measures in Israeli cities to thwart any subsequent attempted attacks.</p><p>The three buses were parked at different depots in Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv, Tzvika Brot, the city’s mayor, said in a statement. Unexploded bombs were also found in parking lots in the nearby city of Holon, the mayor noted.</p><p>Mr. Brot said he had ordered additional security patrols throughout Bat Yam. “The city will remain on high alert throughout the weekend,” he added. “However, the city’s routine continues as usual. There is no change to school tomorrow or any other activities.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ofir Karni, director of the Dan bus company, told Israeli news media that the last passenger on one of the buses that exploded had noticed a suspicious bag on a back seat and had alerted the driver. They drove into the depot, got off the bus and it exploded after they exited, he added.</p><p>The series of explosions in central Israel came on what was already a difficult day for Israelis and for the country’s tenuous truce with Hamas.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/middleeast/bibas-hostages-israel.html" title="">Four coffins said to contain the remains of hostages</a>, including two children, who were captured from a community near the Gaza border in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack, were released and repatriated for burial on Thursday. But the Israeli military said in a statement early on Friday that only three of the bodies belonged to the hostages slated to be handed over.</p><p>One of the bodies it received could not be identified, it said, adding it did not belong to Shiri Bibas — the mother of the two children handed over — and did not match the identity of any other hostage. The military called the issue a “violation of utmost severity” of the cease-fire terms.</p><p>The attempted bus attacks around Tel Aviv, which no one has yet claimed direct responsibility for, could also undermine mediators’ efforts to get Israel and the militant group to negotiate the next phase of the cease-fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Since late January, the Israeli military has been conducting intense raids in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, saying it is trying to root out Hamas and other militant groups.</p><p>The operation across several West Bank cities has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/world/middleeast/west-bank-palestinian-displacement.html" title="">displaced roughly 40,000 Palestinians</a> from their homes, making it the biggest displacement of civilians in the territory since the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, according to historians and researchers.</p><p>The military has destroyed houses and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-raid.html" title="">ripped up roads</a> in what it has said is an effort to uncover improvised explosive devices. The operations have killed dozens of Palestinians, according to both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities.</p><p>Defense Minister Israel Katz directed the military to intensify those operations in refugee camps in the West Bank in response to the attempted attacks on Thursday.</p><p>“We will chase after the terrorists and destroy the terror infrastructure — whoever provides cover for terror will pay a heavy price,” he said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A West Bank arm of Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, issued a statement that appeared to praise the explosions but did not explicitly claim responsibility for them. </p><p>The Israeli military said in a statement late on Thursday that it was working with intelligence authorities and the police to investigate the incident in Bat Yam. It said that “intensified antiterror activity” in the West Bank was continuing, and that it had blocked entry to certain parts of the territory “accordingly.”</p><p>Bus and train service in Israel will remain paused until the police and intelligence authorities give directives that it can resume, according to a statement from the transportation ministry.</p><p>Johnatan Reiss<!-- -->, <!-- -->Fatima AbdulKarim<!-- -->, <!-- -->Isabel Kershner<!-- --> and <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Ephrat Livni is a reporter for The Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/dealbook">DealBook</a> newsletter, based in Washington.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni">More about Ephrat Livni</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Tensions in the Middle East</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israeli Presence in Lebanon: </strong>Israel pulled out from towns in southern Lebanon, said the U.N., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/middleeast/lebanon-israel-forces-hezbollah.html">but held onto strategic positions near the border</a> as a deadline passed for both Israel and Hezbollah to withdraw.</p></li><li><p><strong>Palestinian Displacement:</strong> A wide-scale Israeli military operation across several West Bank cities has displaced roughly 40,000 Palestinians, in what historians and researchers say is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/world/middleeast/west-bank-palestinian-displacement.html">the biggest displacement of civilians in the territory</a> since 1967.</p></li><li><p><strong>Untenable for Jordan: </strong>President Trump’s plan to relocate Gazans would send a huge number of refugees into the kingdom, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-takeover-jordan.html">adding new frictions to its often tense, sometimes violent history with displaced Palestinians</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Payments for Prisoners: </strong>The United States and Israel have long condemned the payment of stipends to families of Palestinian prisoners involved in attacks on Israel.
