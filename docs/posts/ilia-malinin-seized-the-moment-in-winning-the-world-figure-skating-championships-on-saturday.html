Among them were young skaters, including three from the Washington Figure Skating Club, Malinin’s club, and others who at times would use the rink in Reston, Va., where he trains.</p><p>A coach, a skater and his father, and a whole family — two young sisters and their parents — from that club died, and Malinin, who is 20, was so brokenhearted in the weeks afterward that he could not even bear to say their names, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Skating usually helps me handle hard things going on in my life, but it was just too emotional to be there,” Malinin said in an interview with The New York Times the first week of March. “I tried to have a productive day of skating. But I just couldn’t take my mind to another place. I just couldn’t.”</p><p>When he returned to the rink several days later, he said, he redoubled his efforts to be the best men’s singles skater in the world, one bound for stardom at the Olympics nearly 10 months from now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Malinin is the overwhelming gold medal favorite for next year’s Olympics in Italy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He said he focused on fine-tuning his programs and immersed himself in them, determined to dedicate his performances at the World Figure Skating Championships this week to the people who died. His performances should be worthy of their memory, he said.</p><p>The results were two programs that were so spectacular that they brought him his second consecutive world championship, which he won by 31 points, a colossal edge in a sport in which margins of victory are often measured in single digits, or even tenths.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The sold-out crowd at TD Garden in Boston was on its feet long before his program was done, and for good reasons: Malinin, a student at George Mason University from Vienna, Va., is a dynamic skater who is single-handedly lifting the sport into another stratosphere with his technical skills and his ability to connect with a new, younger audience.</p><p>He landed a breathtaking six quadruple jumps, including the quad axel, which requires a mind-boggling four-and-a-half rotations in the air. No one else in the world has done it. No one else has landed six quads in one program, either.</p><p>For years, the top skaters in the world could only dream of landing the quad axel, a jump made harder by its forward-facing entry. But Malinin first landed it at an international event when he was 17.</p><p>As a teenager, Malinin — a hoodie and jeans kind of guy — started calling himself “Quad God” for his ability to execute quad jumps. But now his unique performances are just as memorable: With his flowing movements and unique body shapes, his routines could double as modern dances. The music he often chooses for them is the opposite of the long-used classical pieces the sport has been known for. He performs to music he likes to listen to, he said.</p><p>On Thursday, in his short program, he bounded onto the ice and performed to the song “Running” by the rapper NF. He sang along to it as if he were alone in his car.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>For the long program on Saturday, he marched into the rink, taking each step with determination, as if heading for a street fight. His song was “I’m Not a Vampire (Revamped)” by the rock band Falling in Reverse, and his outfit matched the theme: It was a blinged out version of Dracula’s tuxedo, and under the lights the array of silver, purple and red sequins made him look sprinkled with glitter.</p><p>For the crowd, he wasn’t just a skater, he was an entertainer. It could feel the emotion as he moved masterfully, in synchronicity with the song’s every note, and he even shouted along with a few of the more aggressive vocals. His thick, tousled blond hair became a golden blur as he shunned gravity and went airborne to perform jump after jump. Along with the conventional jumps, Malinin included a move he calls the Raspberry Twist, which is a twisting version of a butterfly jump during which he is nearly parallel to the ice. He christened the move for his last name: In Russian, “malina” means raspberry. He also did a backflip, and the crowd erupted in a loud, sustained roar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Malinin skating at a tribute earlier this month.

Like Simone Biles in gymnastics, the base scores of his technical elements were so high that it would have been hard for anyone to surpass him. Malinin showed that at nationals in January, when he won by nearly 47 points. At worlds, Malinin scored 318.56 points overall, crushing second-place Mikhail Shaidorov of Kazakhstan, who had 287.47 points. Adam Siao Him Fa of France was third, 40.37 points back.</p><p>“At his age and especially at his level of purity of technique and everything else he brings, not only do I think no one can beat him, but I don’t think that there’s a way to understand what his ceiling is,” Scott Hamilton, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist and television skating analyst, said of Malinin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“What more could Ilia do?” Hamilton added. “Anything he wants. Nothing is impossible for a skater with that kind of natural talent.”</p><p>Malinin said his practices before worlds were easy. The jumps. The spins. The movements to the music. It all felt so right, he said.</p><p>Yet at the rink, there were times when he thought about the skaters who died, he admitted, forcing him to pause. His parents — Tatyana Malinina and Roman Skornyakov, who skated for Uzbekistan at past Olympics — coach him and helped him regroup, he said.</p><p>Those skaters he knew were not there anymore, gliding by or standing back, wide-eyed, to watch him and learn from him, or to train next to him, and that “really upsets me,” Malinin said. Honoring them through his performances has helped him move forward.</p><p>“I’m also really glad that I was able to get through this,” he said, “and really just have this mind-set of, you know, skating for them now.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Juliet Macur is a national reporter at The Times, based in Washington, D.C., who often writes about America through the lens of sports.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/juliet-macur">More about Juliet Macur</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
