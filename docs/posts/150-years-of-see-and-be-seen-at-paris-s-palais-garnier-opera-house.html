And long before the appearance of the selfie-stick, the Garnier was a place not just to see art, but to be seen.</p><p>At a 150th anniversary gala on Friday, before guests reach the marble staircase, the baroque sculptures, the inlaid golden mosaics and the elaborately painted ceiling, they will pass two giant mirrors set on the ground floor.</p><p>These were the architect Charles Garnier’s gift to season ticket holders, for a quick once-over before they stepped onto a marble catwalk beneath four levels of viewing galleries.</p><p>“They were there to give them some psychological reassurance. To look at themselves and say, ‘Everything is good. You are ready,’” said Sandrine Lamiable, a Palais Garnier tour guide leading a group of tourists up the marble steps earlier this month. “Then, they were plunged into a veritable palace, as princesses and princes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The point of the Garnier Opera building was never just the show onstage. It was the show of being on display, particularly for the rising bourgeoisie that had profited off France’s booming industrial revolution.</p><p>“The point of the opera was to parade, for the elites of the time to offer a spectacle: themselves,” said Lamiable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/22/multimedia/22palais-garnier-final4/22palais-garnier-final4-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/22/multimedia/22palais-garnier-final4/22palais-garnier-final4-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/22/multimedia/22palais-garnier-final4/22palais-garnier-final4-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Ballet tutus hang from hangers in a large wood-paneled room." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/22/multimedia/22palais-garnier-final4/22palais-garnier-zfhm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/22/multimedia/22palais-garnier-final4/22palais-garnier-zfhm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/22/multimedia/22palais-garnier-final4/22palais-garnier-zfhm-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/22/multimedia/22palais-garnier-final4/22palais-garnier-zfhm-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f4b2c0a4-f9ae-5409-9ab4-e8788087a83b" decoding="async" width="600" height="480"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The wood-paneled “central costumes” area, where costumes are brought out of storage, carefully inspected, then repaired and refit.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-6"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adjusting a dancer’s costume in the atelier.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dresses in the one of the costume ateliers.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The grand opera house is home to the Paris Opera, but since the opening of the much larger Opéra Bastille theater across town in 1989, the Palais Garnier has become a bastion of ballet. This is where the Paris Opera Ballet performs, though the opera company still presents some smaller works on the Garnier stage. Around 400 permanent employees work in the building, from musicians to stage hands.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Up on the sixth floor on a recent afternoon, Xavier Ronze was rushing between five costume ateliers where dozens of seamstresses work on tutus, tailored coats, feathered headdresses. Over the years, Ronze, the head of the building’s dress making and sewing department, has worked with star designers including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/obituaries/karl-lagerfeld-dead.html" title="">Karl Lagerfeld</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/fashion/christian-lacroix-paris-opera-ballet-costumes.html" title="">Christian Lacroix</a>.</p><p>“This building has a soul,” Ronze said, stepping into a wood-paneled room where costumes are brought out of storage for repair. White and yellow tutus hung from overhead metal rails for the dancers in the upcoming production of “The Sleeping Beauty.” His current staff of 62 were working on 300 costumes for the show, Ronze said.</p><p>The opera house was born, in part, from an assassination attempt in 1858. Emperor Napoleon III of France ordered a new more spacious and secure building after he and his wife, Eugenie, survived a bomb attack on their carriage outside the Salle Le Peletier, an earlier Paris opera house.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Charles Garnier, the building’s architect, wanted to create a palace for 19th-century Paris’s burgeoning middle class.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Universal Images Group, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>His government held a competition. More than 170 proposals were submitted, including by famous architects like Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, who was in the midst of restoring Notre Dame cathedral.</p><p>Garnier’s win was a surprise. He was relatively unknown and had extremely modest roots. The son of a blacksmith and a lace maker, he had risen to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and then won the prestigious Grand Prix de Rome.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Garnier represented the esprit of his time’s burgeoning middle class, when artists, writers and businessmen could get ahead through merit and skill, not birth, said Christopher Mead, a retired art history professor who wrote <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262132756/charles-garniers-paris-opera/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a book about the Palais Garnier</a>.</p><p>His idea was to build a palace for that growing class, Mead said by phone from Albuquerque, where he lives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The golden <em>grand foyer</em>, open to anyone with a ticket.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-15"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The ceiling of the s<em>alon du soleil</em>, which incorporates the image of a salamander into the design.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Garnier picked wine red and gold colors, because he believed they better flattered women.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Instead of being the reserve of the emperor and his entourage, the <em>grand escalier</em> and the golden <em>grand foyer</em> were for anyone who had a ticket — whether a very expensive season pass or a cheaper evening seat.</p><p>“Everyone performed there, everyone got a star turn,” said Mead. “It was quite radical in that way.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Garnier set up his atelier on the site, chosen by the Emperor’s prefect Georges-Eugène Haussman, who had been charged with modernizing Paris. For the next 14 years — with a pause during the Prussian invasion of the city and the civil uprising known as the Commune — Garnier oversaw the construction closely.</p><p>He mixed elements of neoclassical, romantic and baroque architecture and introduced mosaics and gilding for the first time to Paris, according to Gérard Fontaine’s book “<a href="https://www.monuments-nationaux.fr/editions-du-patrimoine/les-ouvrages/l-opera-de-charles-garnier" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Charles Garnier’s Opera</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-19"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Palais Garner was built from 1861 to 1875 — with a break in the middle for a war and an uprising.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">George Eastman House/Delmaet &amp; Durandelle, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The building stands on the Place de l’Opera in Paris’s 9th Arrondissement.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Print Collector, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-21"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the 1870s and ’80s, it was a place for the rising bourgeoisie that had profited off France’s industrial revolution to be seen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Universal Images Group, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The building remains largely as it was on the day it opened — though the painter Marc Chagall reworked the auditorium ceiling in 1964.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Keystone-France/Gamma-Rapho, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Garnier designed the bronze grills of the balconies and ticketing counters, as well as the vases on display, and personally traveled to quarries as far away as Algeria and Sweden to pick out red, green, yellow and white marble for the building — a riot of color in a city whose palette tends toward cream and gray.</p><p>Still today, workers in the building speak about Garnier, who died in 1898, as though he was a treasured colleague.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“He chose everything. He designed the curtains in the <em>grand foyer,</em> he picked all the artists,” said Benjamin Beytout, a marketing director at the Paris Opera, who has worked at the Palais Garnier for two decades. “It was his masterpiece.”</p><p>Garnier had the audacity to write his name on the building — something few architects dared to do 150 years ago. Like many of his touches, it’s subtle — almost an inside joke between Garnier and those who love him. Guides regularly use laser pointers to trace the curly, overlapping letters on the ceiling of the first floor rotunda: “Jean Louis Charles Garnier, architect 1861-1875.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The stage was built with a slight incline, so viewers in the back of the auditorium could see better.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-26"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Untangle the curly script on the ceiling of the first floor rotunda and it reads, “Jean Louis Charles Garnier, architect 1861-1875.”</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marc Chagall painted the ceiling of the auditorium in 1964 — one of the few additions to the Palais Garnier since it opened in 1875.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>He tucked sculptures and paintings of salamanders throughout the building, mostly near wiring and gas outlets. They were to symbolically ward off fire, since European myth held salamanders could survive flames. In 1873, the Salle Le Peletier theater was destroyed by a blaze. By then, Napoleon III had died in exile, and it was unclear whether the Palais Garnier would ever be completed. But, with the Salle Le Peletier gone, there was renewed motivation to finish: The city needed an opera house.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Philippe Moyal, a bartender at the Garnier who has served champagne to the likes of Bruce Willis and Catherine Deneuve, said he had considered the salamanders a symbol of regeneration. “Even when we are tired, given how magnificent it is, we find momentum again,” he said, adding that he often pops into the show before intermission champagne service, to catch a snippet of inspiration.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-30"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Anissa Bouchlaghmi, a bartender, who recently started working at the Palais Garnier.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rubens Simon, who has been a dancer in the corps de ballet of the Paris Opera Ballet since 2021.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-31"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Laurent Dybski, a wig-maker and make-up artist, has worked at the Paris Opera for 29 years.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Isabelle Jandeau greets guests on their arrival at the Palais Garnier.

That’s to allow the dancers to get used to one of the building’s many quirks: The stage was built that way, so viewers in the back of the auditorium could see better. It took some getting used to, when she first joined the Paris Opera Ballet 11 years ago, Stojanov said.</p><p>“Especially when it comes to pirouettes, it can be destabilizing,” Stojanov, 29, said in an interview between rehearsals.</p><p>Before and during performances, dancers warm up in the <em>foyer de la danse</em>, a gilded room with dripping chandeliers at the back of the stage, where season ticket holders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/arts/design/degas-at-the-opera.html" title="">would court ballerinas</a> a century ago. Stojanov said she had heard of a secret corridor to get to a hidden viewing balcony in the room, but she has never found it.</p><p>A few years ago, while repairing the empress’ box, workers uncovered another secret: a door hidden behind the crimson fabric wall covering. It led to a closet, containing a commode and a water pitcher.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>“I don’t know if it was ever used,” said Beytout, the marketing director. “We are always discovering — and rediscovering — new things here.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-35"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Young spectators arriving for a special preview of “Castor et Pollux.” For new productions, the Paris Opera offers seats for just 10 euros to people under 28.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-36"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maxime Ayrault attending the “Castor et Pollux” preview for young people.

But still, company administrators work to bring in a younger clientele — offering choice seats for just 10 euros to people under 28 during special previews of new productions.</p><p>Young fiancés Pierre-Antoine Richet, 22, and Sidonie Duvivier, 21, both chemistry students, got dressed up recently to see the American director Peter Sellars’ take on Jean Rameau’s opera “Castor et Pollux.” For both, it was their first time in the building.</p><p>They were awed by “the explosion of gilding, chandeliers with crystals,” Richet said, and got lost in the building’s myriad halls and rooms. They were bewitched, both said, to be sitting beneath the auditorium ceiling that the artist Marc Chagall painted in 1964 — one of the few additions to the building since it opened in 1875.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>“When Chagall’s ceiling was installed, there were strong reactions.
