    <h1>FCC’s Net Neutrality Rules Struck Down by Federal Appeals Court</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A federal appeals court struck down the Federal Communications Commission’s landmark net neutrality rules on Thursday, ending a nearly two-decade effort to regulate broadband internet providers like utilities.</p><p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, <a href="https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/25a0002p-06.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that the F.C.C. lacked the authority to reinstate rules that prevented broadband providers from slowing or blocking access to internet content. The decision <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/technology/fcc-net-neutrality-open-internet.html" title="">put an end to the Biden administration’s hallmark tech policy</a>, which had drawn impassioned support from consumer groups and tech giants like Google and fierce protests by telecommunications giants like Comcast and AT&amp;T.</p><p>“Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair,” Jessica Rosenworcel, chairwoman of the F.C.C., said in a statement about the ruling. “With this decision, it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality and put open internet principles in federal law.”</p><p>In its opinion, a three-judge panel pointed to a Supreme Court decision in June, known as Loper Bright, that overturned a 1984 legal precedent that gave deference to government agencies on regulations.</p></div></div>
