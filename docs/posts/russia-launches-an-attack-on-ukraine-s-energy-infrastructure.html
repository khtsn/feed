As rescue workers and energy repair crews raced to assess the damage in the morning, alarms sounded again and more missiles streaked through the skies. At least six people were wounded in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, and one person was killed in Dnipro, but officials said that the toll from strikes around the country may rise.</p><p>The Ukrainian military <a href="https://t.me/GeneralStaffZSU/19595" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said air defense teams shot down</a> 59 missiles and either shot down or disabled most of the drones used in the attack. Ukraine’s largest private energy company said the attacks caused serious damage to equipment emergency, and power outages were declared across the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was the 13th large-scale bombardment of the Ukrainian energy grid this year in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-infrastructure.html" title="">a campaign</a> that has left the country’s energy network devastated and forced the authorities to turn to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/europe/ukraine-electricity-winter.html?unlocked_article_code=1.jE4.H90j.-Z8kx08PDNdK&amp;smid=url-share" title="">unconventional measures</a> to try to prevent a total collapse of the grid.</p><p>Ukrainians are exhausted by years of bombardments and mourning the loss of tens of thousands fighting on the front. Instead of getting a reprieve this Christmas, many Ukrainians were huddled in bomb shelters, not celebrating with friends and family.</p><p>Nika Chervonna, 26, said she was planning to spend Christmas with friends, but after a missile strike in her hometown, Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine, on Christmas Eve and more explosions in the morning, she canceled her plans and “decided to stay home with my dog.”</p><p>“The morning shelling and power outages were frightening and completely destroyed any sense of ‘celebration,’” she said in a phone interview.</p><p>“I have been taking antidepressants for six months,” she said. “But even they no longer give me a sense of peace.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>As Russia tries to undermine Ukraine’s will to fight, the number of civilians killed over the past year has soared. At least three times as many civilians were killed by aerial bombing from January to November in 2024 compared with 2023, according to <a href="https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k10/k103tf1mnj" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine</a>. In that period, the U.N. group found, aerial attacks alone killed 341 civilians and wounded 1,803 others.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A military chaplain holding a service near the frontline town of Chasiv Yar, in eastern Ukraine, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The latest attacks came as rescue workers were still combing through the rubble after a missile struck an apartment building in Kryvyi Rih on Christmas Eve, killing one person and injuring more than a dozen others, according to local officials.</p><p>Dmytro Klymenko, 20, said he was shopping for food for Christmas Eve dinner with his family when an explosion shook the supermarket.</p><p>“I dropped everything and ran to the shelter,” he said by phone on Wednesday. He works as a local journalist and visited the blast site, where he said he watched crowds anxiously gather in the bitter cold as rescue workers pulled survivors from the ruins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Honestly, with this war, there’s no sense of the holiday season at all,” he said. “I didn’t even put up a Christmas tree at home because it just doesn’t feel appropriate. In the trenches, there are no holidays.”</p><p>“It’s terrifying to live in such times,” he said. “There are constant thoughts that this could be the last day or that my home could be hit at any moment. My imagination spirals into a dead end, making it even harder to cope.”</p><p>The Ukrainian government <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3258-IX#Text" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed a law</a> in 2023 changing the date of Christmas to Dec. 25, from Jan. 7, the traditional Orthodox date that Russians celebrate. It was part of a broader effort in Ukraine to reclaim its own identity and has been embraced by many across the country.</p><p>At the Church of St. Nicholas in Kyiv, a Catholic cathedral that had its windows blown out after a missile slammed into the heart of the capital on Friday, white tarps were strung up on the ceiling to catch falling debris as people gathered for Christmas Mass.</p><p>There was no heat in the building, but people bundled up against the cold as they sought solace in tradition and found hope in faith.</p><p>Nataliia Novosolova<!-- --> and <!-- -->Anastasia Kuznietsova<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia. He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.
