The operation surprised even Kyiv’s closest allies, including the United States, and has pushed the limits of how Western military equipment would be permitted to be used inside Russian territory.</p></div><div><div><p>For Russia, it was a moment nearly as shocking as the mercenary Yevgeny V. Prigozhin’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/world/europe/prigozhin-wagner-russia-putin.html" title="">march on Moscow</a> in June 2023: the vaunted security state that President Vladimir V. Putin had built crumbled in the face of the surprise attack, failing in its basic task of protecting its citizens. And the unwritten social contract that has largely accompanied Mr. Putin’s 30-month campaign — that most Russians could get on with their normal lives even as he waged war — was cast into question anew.</p><p>Mostly on the defensive since a failed counteroffensive last year, Ukraine has pushed seven miles into Russia along a 25-mile front and taken dozens of Russian soldiers as prisoners, analysts and Russian officials say. The governor of Russia’s Kursk region said on Monday that Ukraine controls 28 towns and villages there. More than 132,000 people have been evacuated from nearby areas, Russian officials said.</p></div></div><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="kursk-incursion-map" data-id="100000009628060" data-source-id="100000009628060"><div data-sourceid="100000009628060" id="embed-id-100000009628060">

If Ukrainian troops are able to hold territory, they could stretch the capacity of Russian troops, deliver a major embarrassment for Mr. Putin and get a bargaining chip for any peace negotiations. But if Russia manages to push Ukrainian troops out of Kursk and simultaneously move forward in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian military leaders could be blamed for giving the Russians an opening to gain more ground, particularly in the Donetsk region.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/13/multimedia/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/13/multimedia/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/13/multimedia/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="An elderly woman being carried on a stretcher by an evacuation team." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/13/multimedia/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/13/multimedia/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/13/multimedia/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/13/multimedia/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt/13ukraine-russia-incursion-02-mckt-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nina Klymenko, 90, being carried on a stretcher by a Ukrainian evacuation team in the village of Yunakivka in Ukraine’s Sumy region, near the border on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>U.S. officials told The Times they were given no formal heads-up about the high-risk mission — possibly because Ukrainian officials feared the Americans would try to persuade Ukraine to call it off, possibly because of Ukraine’s obsessive concern over leaks. Ukraine was also using American-supplied vehicles, arms and munitions, despite President Biden’s caution in May that Ukraine could only use American-made weapons inside Russia for limited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/us/politics/biden-ukraine-russia-weapons.html" title="">self-defense strikes</a>.</p><p>U.S. officials have said that Ukraine’s cross-border offensive didn’t violate that policy. “They are taking actions to protect themselves from attacks,” Sabrina Singh, the Pentagon’s deputy press secretary, said on Thursday.</p><p>Ukrainian officials have remained tight-lipped about the mission, including whether they intend to hold ground or fall back to defenses on their side of the border. Mr. Zelensky only acknowledged the operation publicly for the first time on Saturday. Ukrainian soldiers said they didn’t know the plan in advance. Military analysts who spend their days tracking the war said they were surprised.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“This is a good example of how a modern successful operation requires extreme operational security measures and deception,” said Pasi Paroinen, an analyst from the Black Bird Group, a Finland-based organization that analyzes battlefield footage. He added that if analysts couldn’t detect it, the Russians might not be able to either.</p><h2 id="link-42db28d5">A quiet buildup</h2><p>There were hints of what was to come.</p><p>Maps of the battlefield compiled by independent analysts show that soldiers from brigades long fighting in the east had moved discreetly into Ukraine’s Sumy region, just across the border from Kursk. A drone battalion from the 22nd Mechanized Brigade, which for nearly a year had defended <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-chasiv-yar.html" title="">the beleaguered frontline town of Chasiv Yar</a>, was spotted near the border in mid-July. Troops from the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, engaged in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/world/europe/ukraine-russia-vovchansk.html" title="">fierce combat near Vovchansk</a> in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, also shifted to the area. So did soldiers from the 80th Air Assault Brigade, which was at the forefront of fighting in the Kharkiv region this spring.</p><p>A few Russians noticed. A report was submitted to Russian military leadership about a month before the attack saying that “forces had been detected and that intelligence indicated preparations for an attack,” Andrei Gurulyov, a prominent member of Russia’s Parliament and a former high-ranking army officer, said after the incursion.</p><p>“But from the top came the order not to panic, and that those above know better,” Mr. Gurulyov <a href="https://t.me/agurulev/5129" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lamented on national television</a>.</p><p>Any movement could have been misconstrued as a new defensive posture. The Ukrainian Army sometimes splits brigades into smaller battalions scattered across the battlefield, and <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-13-communities-in-sumy-oblast-injuring-1/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sumy</a> has long been rumored as a place where Russia might try opening a new front.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Few expected Ukraine to be able to launch a new offensive. Ukrainian brigades were running <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/us/pentagon-ammunition-ukraine-russia.html" title="">low on ammunition</a>. Even as new weapons started arriving this spring and summer from the West, an almost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/europe/ukraine-russia-peace-mood.html" title="">fatalistic mood</a> had taken hold of many Ukrainians, that they were losing ground in the east, foot by foot.</p><p>Ukraine shuffled parts of brigades into the Sumy area under the pretenses of training and picking up new equipment, said one brigade’s deputy commander, Lt. Col. Artem, who asked to be identified only by his first name and rank, in keeping with military protocol.</p><p>Heavy weaponry moved in. Soldiers piled into houses. The Ukrainians hid in plain sight. Officers were told to avoid wearing military uniforms when entering towns and cities so they didn’t draw attention, said one officer, who identified himself by his call sign, “Tykhyi,” in keeping with military protocol.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ukrainian man pushing his bicycle past a tank along a road, about 10 miles from the Russian border in Ukraine’s Sumy region on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Some residents noticed the buildup. “Maybe they were reinforcing the border, or maybe building something?” said Elena Sima, the head of the Yunakivka district, about five miles from the border. “Everybody was guessing.”</p></div><div><div><p>In the village of Khotyn, the rumble of heavy, tracked vehicles woke up Natalya Vyalina, a 44-year-old kindergarten teacher, several nights in a row. She assumed others heard it, too. But in the village, she said, “nobody said anything.”</p><p>Even within the army, many were kept in the dark. Tykhyi — which means “quiet one” in Ukrainian — said some units were told of their mission only at the last moment.</p><p>On Aug. 3, Colonel Artem said, his brigade commander summoned senior officers to a meeting on the side of a forest road to announce the mission’s goals. To divert Russian troops to help fellow soldiers fighting in the eastern Donbas region. To push Russian artillery out of range of Sumy. To demoralize the Russians by showing their intelligence and planning failures.</p><h2 id="link-26e0b7f7">‘Difficult challenges ahead’</h2><p>The Ukrainian military hadn’t tried a serious push into Russia since the beginning of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Commandos had made quick forays across the border, one in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/world/europe/russia-belgorod-ukraine-attacks.html" title="">May 2023</a> and another this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/12/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attacks-putin.html" title="">March</a>. They were claimed by two shadowy paramilitary groups with ties to Ukraine: the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of a paramilitary group with ties to Ukraine that made an incursion into Russia this March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Away from the fighting, the Kursk region posed an easier target than elsewhere along the 600-mile front in the east and south of Ukraine. It had fewer anti-armored vehicle ditches, fewer of the anti-tank pyramid obstacles known as dragon’s teeth and fewer manned fighting positions, said Brady Africk, <a href="https://read.bradyafrick.com/p/russian-field-fortifications-in-ukraine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an American analyst who maps Russia’s defenses</a>. Russia also appeared to have sown fewer mines in the Kursk region than in occupied Ukrainian territories.</p><p>“Russia’s fortifications in Kursk are less dense than in other areas where Russian forces have built formidable defenses, such as in the south,” Mr. Africk said.</p><p>Just before noon on Aug. 6, Russian authorities claimed about 300 soldiers, more than 20 armored combat vehicles and 11 tanks from Ukraine’s 22nd Mechanized Brigade had crossed into the country. But those <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-72833e25fed6075350fe970e3ce57d7d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initial reports</a> were greeted with a shrug. Disinformation and propaganda have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/03/world/europe/ukraine-war-tv-news-telemarathon.html" title="">another kind of front</a> in this war, and no one thought such an incursion made any tactical sense. </p><p>Hundreds more Ukrainian forces surged forward, breaching border checkpoints and pushing through two lines of defense. With fewer mines and fewer anti-military obstacles, Ukrainian mechanized brigades moved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/world/europe/russia-border-ukraine.html" title="">quickly</a>.</p><p>Oleksandr, a Ukrainian infantry soldier who declined to give his last name, citing military security protocols, said many Russian soldiers fled as the Ukrainians pushed forward. Eight Russian soldiers surrendered at one checkpoint, he added.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People who were evacuated from the border regions, including from Sudzha, Russia, at dinner at a temporary shelter in Kursk on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Early Wednesday, senior U.S. officials woke up to a shock: They learned that more than 1,000 regular Ukrainian Army forces had crossed the border the day before, equipped with mobile air defenses and electronic-warfare equipment to jam Russian radar. Some were driving in armored vehicles sent by Germany and the United States. The soldiers appeared to be planning for an extended fight.</p><p>As late as Thursday, U.S. officials said, they were still seeking clarity from Ukrainian officials on the operation’s logic and rationale. Since then, Ukrainian leaders have briefed senior U.S. civilian officials and top military commanders on their goals.</p><p>The American officials said they were surprised at how well the operation has gone so far, but were skeptical that the Ukrainians could hold onto their gains. And in making the incursion, they said, Ukraine has created new vulnerabilities along the front where its forces are already stretched thin.</p><p>Videos show Ukrainian forces may have faced resistance at times, although there is not visual evidence of widespread losses.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Outside the Russian village of Kremyanoye, a video filmed by a Russian soldier shows Russian soldiers ransacking a <a href="https://t.me/lost_warinua/86091" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">captured Ukrainian armored vehicle,</a> and taking away what appeared to be ammunition and other supplies. In another video filmed a few hundred meters away, a Russian soldier tried to rip a Ukrainian flag patch from the uniform of a dead soldier lying in the grass. Other footage, <a href="https://t.me/mod_russia_en/15662" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on Telegram</a> by Russia’s Ministry of Defense, appeared to show Russian forces firing on a Ukrainian brigade around the Kursk region.</p><p>“We all have joy in our hearts,” the Ukrainian soldier, Oleksandr, said in a phone interview at 5 p.m. on Thursday, from somewhere inside Russia. “But we realize that there are still difficult challenges ahead.”</p><p>Some Ukrainian troops haven’t been able to stop themselves from publicizing their moves. They’ve posted videos and selfies from Russian towns like Sudzha or villages like Poroz and Dmitriukov, bragging about how they have finally taken the fight to Russia.</p><p>Outside a Pyatyorochka store in Sudzha, about six miles from the Russian border, one <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@badcop30/video/7401916490376596742" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukrainian soldier</a> said that a Ukrainian supermarket chain, ATB, was much better. “Glory to Ukraine,” he said in a video, which like others were verified by The Times. “No Pyatyorochka, ATB will be here soon.”</p></div></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/12/12vid-russia-incursion-87083-cover/12vid-russia-incursion-87083-cover-square640-v2.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>@badcop30 via TikTok</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><div><p>Four Ukrainian soldiers <a href="https://x.com/ukrpravda_news/status/1821973716806594826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1821973716806594826%7Ctwgr%5Eb613b5d8e0d03dd90633328196d21dca5ef610c5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pravda.com.ua%2Fnews%2F2024%2F08%2F9%2F7469741%2F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posed</a> outside a nearby Gazprom facility, the Russian state-owned gas monopoly.</p><p>“From Sudzha, our news is as follows: The town is controlled by the armed forces of Ukraine,” one said, holding a rifle and standing in front of three soldiers brandishing a blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag. “Peace in the town.
