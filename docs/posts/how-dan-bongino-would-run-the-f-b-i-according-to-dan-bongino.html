His podcast and radio show will end production on March 14.</p><p>The job, which does not require Senate confirmation, has traditionally been filled by a senior agent with vast operational experience and a deep understanding of how the bureau’s various divisions work. The last two deputy directors together had more than 35 years of experience before they assumed the role. Mr. Bongino served as a police officer and a U.S. Secret Service agent years ago, but has no experience with the F.B.I.</p><p>Mr. Bongino’s precise plans for the agency remain opaque, but on recent podcasts he has said he would rid the agency of politicization and focus on crimes like drug dealing — despite the bureau’s <a href="https://www.justice.gov/doj/federal-bureau-investigation#:~:text=Protect%20the%20U.S.%20from%20terrorist,public%20corruption%20at%20all%20levels" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broad mandate</a> to protect national security, investigate crimes and root out <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/public-corruption" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">corruption by public officials</a> at all levels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Taken together, Mr. Bongino’s years of comments on his radio show and podcast have painted a vision for “dramatic change” at the F.B.I., as he put it last week. Those ideas largely align with criticisms put forth by his friend <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/kashyap-patel" title="">Kash Patel</a>, who was recently confirmed as the director of the agency. Some of their ideas, however, would probably require additional funding.</p><p>The F.B.I. declined to comment, but it recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/fbi-kristi-noem-dhs.html" title="">rejected charges of “corruption”</a> leveled by a Republican cabinet secretary, saying such claims are not “supported by any evidence” and “undermine the men and women of the F.B.I.”</p><p>Responding during his radio show Wednesday to questions sent by The New York Times, Mr. Bongino said: “It’s my job to produce political opinions.” He added: “Your political opinions aren’t a prerequisite for a job like that, obviously. My law enforcement experience was.”</p><p>Here’s what Mr. Bongino has said in the past about his vision for the F.B.I.</p><h2 id="link-6a501dc7">Fire ‘everyone’</h2><p>Mr. Bongino has frequently focused on F.B.I. officials who, in his mind, showed disloyalty to Mr. Trump by pursuing investigations against him or his supporters.</p><p>“How do we fix this? We fire everyone who stood by,” he said in June 2023 after Mr. Trump was indicted in a classified documents case. The charges included willfully retaining national defense secrets in violation of the Espionage Act, making false statements and a conspiracy to obstruct justice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“We don’t just fire the people who did this. Everyone who stood by and did nothing while the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. have been ravaged, ravaged by corrupt crowds. Everyone gets fired.

The investigation was started by the F.B.I. in 2022 but was ultimately taken over by an independent special counsel. The charges were dismissed after Mr. Trump’s re-election, because Justice Department policy prohibits indicting and prosecuting a sitting president.</p><h2 id="link-651bbd4a">Restructure the F.B.I.</h2><p>On past shows, Mr. Bongino endorsed Mr. Patel’s suggestions that the F.B.I. was bloated and that its agents in Washington should be dispersed throughout the country to fight crime.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“The corruption needs to be immediately defunded,” he said during a show in June 2023. “The F.B.I. should no longer exist as it’s constituted now.

He announced in February plans to move about 1,500 agents and others from the Washington region to field offices and other facilities around the country.</p><h2 id="link-5ff585cf">Expose the F.B.I.’s ‘cover-ups’</h2><p>Mr. Bongino has claimed the F.B.I. knows the truth about various mysteries that have animated right-wing influencers for years.</p><p>Among them is the mystery surrounding two pipe bombs that were planted outside the headquarters of both political parties in Washington <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/january-5-pipe-bomb-investigation-new-footage-of-suspect-placing-bomb-at-dnc/view" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the day before</a> Mr. Trump’s rally on Jan. 6, 2021. The bombs never exploded, and it remains a mystery who planted them, though the F.B.I. released <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/us/politics/fbi-capitol-riot-pipe-bomb-suspect.html" title="">new details about the case</a> in January, including new surveillance video.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Bongino has said the F.B.I. tried to cover up the crime in what he called the “biggest scandal in F.B.I. history.” Citing no evidence, he has said that F.B.I. officials know the identity of the bomber and that they are keeping it secret to protect Democrats or government insiders. Former F.B.I. officials who worked the case said that was false.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-13"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Mr. Bongino has suggested, without citing evidence, that the F.B.I. tried to cover up the identity of the person who planted two pipe bombs in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>And why do you think, according to Julie’s exclusive here, that the F.B.I. stopped investigating almost immediately after the Jan. 6 pipe bomb incident. Why do you think that is? The answer is because they found out who it was. And when that subject turned out to be an insider and not a MAGA terrorist, the F.B.I. realized it had a problem on its hands that the entire insurrection narrative was going to fall apart.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/04/biz-bongino-48055-cover/biz-bongino-48055-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Mr. Bongino has suggested, without citing evidence, that the F.B.I. tried to cover up the identity of the person who planted two pipe bombs in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>He has said the F.B.I.’s next leaders need to “get to the story on Day 1 and re-establish trust.”</p><p>“It is absolutely crystal clear to me that this was an inside job,” he said about the bombs during a broadcast in November. “I don’t necessarily mean inside government. Could be. But there’s zero doubt in my mind that this was not a MAGA person that planted that bomb. This was an anti-Trump lunatic, and the F.B.I. knows who it is and they will not tell you.”</p><h2 id="link-3c66cd1d">End ‘politicized’ investigations …</h2><p>Mr. Bongino has said Trump supporters were unfairly targeted by the F.B.I. when it investigated crimes committed on Jan. 6.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“We’re not investigating bad guys because we’re wasting F.B.I., H.S.I. and D.O.J. time investigating who?

They should go back to Bank robbery, investigations, kidnapping, serious stuff that isn’t, this is serious stuff that needs to get done. Go back to their roots, move the intelligence function out. They’ve lost the trust of the American people.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/04/04visualUploader-47906-cover/04visualUploader-47906-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Mr. Bongino wants the F.B.I. to focus on what he deems “serious” crimes.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>What really happened: The F.B.I. investigated people based on evidence that they had committed crimes such as entering the U.S. Capitol illegally, assaulting police officers or engaging in seditious conspiracy. During the sentencings of a handful of defendants, federal prosecutors asked for what is known as a terrorism enhancement.</p><p>Christopher A. Wray, who stepped down as F.B.I. director before Mr. Trump took office, has described the attack, in which supporters of Mr. Trump ransacked the Capitol, resulting in five deaths and scores of injuries to police officers, as domestic terrorism. Mr. Wray was confirmed during Mr. Trump’s first administration.</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Bongino has suggested that the F.B.I. should focus on other violent offenses like drug dealing, even though the F.B.I. is in charge of investigating any violation of federal law.</p><p>“I actually think the intelligence function should be removed from the F.B.I. completely,” Mr. Bongino said in November last year. “They should go back to bank robbery investigations, kidnapping, serious stuff.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The F.B.I. has not abandoned those pursuits. The agency’s <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent announcements</a> include arrests related to an attack by the Islamic State, a string of A.T.M. robberies in New York and money laundering in St. Louis.</p><h2 id="link-48644315">… and potentially start investigations against Democrats.</h2><p>Mr. Bongino has claimed for years that progressive leaders, including former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have committed crimes, and has said leaders at the F.B.I. should be investigated.</p><p>“When Kash Patel goes in there, I think many of these people involved should be investigated,” he said in January about his belief that the F.B.I. played a role in the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. “If there were crimes committed, prosecuted.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-21"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Mr. Bongino has echoed Republican claims that the F.B.I. was weaponized against conservatives.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>This is what power looks like when you use it.
