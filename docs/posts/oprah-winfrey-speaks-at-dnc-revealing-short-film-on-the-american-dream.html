Her message of uplift and optimism is a neat fit for the themes that Democrats have sought to emphasize at this week’s jamboree. And as far as political campaigns go, she has carefully picked her battles, withholding the Oprah seal of approval for all but a few candidates.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In 2007, Ms. Winfrey endorsed a presidential hopeful for the first time: Barack Obama, a close friend and a compatriot from Chicago’s power circles. Ms. Winfrey hosted fund-raisers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/us/politics/09oprah.html" title="">barnstormed cities in Iowa</a> to round up votes for Mr. Obama, who at the time seemed a long shot to win the nomination.</p><p>In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s campaign sought to capitalize on Ms. Winfrey’s popularity by lobbying her for <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/11/oprah-hillary-clinton-trump-2016-336976" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a full-throated endorsement</a>. It never came. Ms. Winfrey mostly stayed away from politics that year, although she did tell one morning show interviewer, “I’m with her.”</p><p>In 2018, Ms. Winfrey <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/politics/oprah-president-2020.html" title="">stirred speculation</a> that she herself might seek the White House. A speech she delivered at the Golden Globes, where she was accepting a lifetime achievement award, was shared widely for its stirring delivery and approach to grand themes like sexism and racism in America.</p><p>The conversation died down after Ms. Winfrey poured cold water on the idea of a run, but it highlighted the thirst among Democrats, in the midst of Donald J. Trump’s administration, for a media-savvy contender who could wave the party flag.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
