There were no independent observers present to verify that assertion, and the electoral council did not post the results online, as it had done in elections before 2024.</p><p>Some Venezuelans said the turnout also signaled loyalty to the country’s leading opposition figure, María Corina Machado, who had called on people to abstain from voting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The announcement comes less than a year after a presidential election in which Mr. Maduro also claimed victory, despite a vote count that showed that he had lost decisively to his opponent, Edmundo González. That count was found to be accurate <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/venezuela/venezuela-final-report-2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by the Carter Center</a>, an independent monitoring group, which said Mr. Maduro’s claim was a “falsification.”</p><p>Speaking on state television on Sunday night, the vice president of the electoral body, Carlos Quintero, said that an alliance of parties that support Mr. Maduro had won more than 80 percent of votes in an election for legislative seats. The same alliance had won governors’ seats in 22 of the country’s 23 states, Mr. Quintero said.</p><p>Previously, four states had been held by governors not aligned with the government. Now, just one, Cojedes, in central Venezuela, will be controlled by a dissenting voice.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Turkewitz is the Andes Bureau Chief for The Times, based in Bogotá, Colombia, covering Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
