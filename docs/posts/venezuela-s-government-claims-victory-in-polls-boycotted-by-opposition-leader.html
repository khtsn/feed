The electoral council did not post the results online, as it had done in elections before 2024.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Benigno Alarcón, a political scientist with the Andrés Bello Catholic University in Caracas, said the vote lacked the minimum requirements to count as democratic.</p><p>The announcement comes less than a year after a presidential election in which Mr. Maduro also claimed victory, despite a vote count that showed that he had lost decisively to his opponent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/world/americas/edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-elections.html" title="">Edmundo González</a>.

The same coalition had won governors’ seats in 22 of the country’s 23 states, Mr. Quintero said.</p><p>Previously, four states had been held by governors not aligned with the government. Now, just one, Cojedes, in central Venezuela, will be controlled by a dissenting voice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The voting took place amid a bitter fight among opposition leaders about whether to participate in the vote.</p><p>The country’s most prominent opposition leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/world/americas/venezuela-election-opposition-machado.html" title="">María Corina Machado</a>, a former legislator who had backed Mr. González in the presidential race last year, had called for people to abstain, saying that the government should recognize the result of the July 2024 election.</p><p>“Empty the streets!” she told her supporters in a message before the vote.</p><p>But a cluster of others, including two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, called for candidates to run and people to cast ballots, saying that the election — even if it was ultimately stolen — could be used to rally and energize the opposition for the next fight.</p><p>“I don’t understand how staying at home, staying at home in silence, we’re going to defeat the Maduro government,” he said in an interview before the election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Henrique Capriles campaigning in Santa Teresa del Tuy, Venezuela, this month.

The streets of Caracas and major cities like Maracaibo, the capital of Zulia State, were eerily quiet on Sunday, and polling stations were sparsely populated.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At Andrés Bello High School, the largest polling station in Caracas, only 793 of the 11,542 registered voters had cast their ballots by noon, said one worker.</p><p>The situation was similar in the working class neighborhoods of La Vega and Petare — traditional strongholds for Mr. Maduro’s party — and at Mr. Capriles’ voting center, in the wealthy Caracas neighborhood of Las Mercedes, a bastion for the opposition. By midday at his polling station in Las Mercedes, just 115 of 4,788 voters had voted, according to a poll worker.</p><p>Across the country, Zulia had been one of few places still run by someone not aligned with the government — in this case Manuel Rosales, a three-time governor who had previously been viewed as more amicable with the government than other opposition politicians.</p><p>Alberto Méndez, 35, said that he come out to vote specifically to try to keep Mr. Rosales in office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I can’t understand why people aren’t voting,” he said. In supermarkets, pharmacies and even fast food stands, there were only employees, he explained, no customers.</p><p>“This isn’t normal. It’s as if no one here wants to fight for anything anymore, as if we’ve all given up.”</p><p>Before the results were announced, Ms. Machado, pointing to the abstention rate, called the day a success.</p><p>“Today, we Venezuelans once again defeated this criminal regime,” she said in a video message. “Since no one wants to go down in that sinking ship,” she said of the Maduro government, “the few that remain today are abandoning them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>María Corina Machado, Venezuela’s opposition leader, in Caracas last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adriana Loureiro Fernandez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Quintero of the electoral council said that Mr. Capriles, the former presidential candidate, won the position he had campaigned for — a seat in the legislature.</p><p>On Sunday, Venezuelans had also been asked to vote for a governor and legislators to represent Essequibo — an oil-rich region that is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/world/americas/venezuela-election-essequibo-guyana.html" title="">recognized internationally</a> as a part of neighboring Guyana.</p><p>Mr. Maduro has claimed the region for Venezuela, using a longstanding border dispute to try to stoke national pride. A governor was chosen, said Mr. Quintero: Neil Villamizar, a navy admiral who is a member of Mr. Maduro’s party.</p><p>For years, the government of Mr. Maduro has shaped elections in its favor, turning them into tools to rally support and barring popular opposition candidates, often turning them against each other by qualifying some to participate, and not others.</p><p>But in so boldly falsifying the results last year, Mr. Maduro went further. Protests followed, but were quickly crushed by security forces. Since then, hundreds of people have been locked up, including protesters, poll workers, journalists and activists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. Machado has accused Mr. Maduro and his cohort of lashing out at the population because they fear losing power, and has said that the only tool they have left to stay in control is violence.</p><p>There are more than 900 political prisoners in government custody, according to a watchdog group, Foro Penal, including dozens who were detained on Friday.</p><p>The decision to vote or not had even divided families.</p><p>In Zulia, Juan Bautista Casanova, 60, a university professor, arrived at his polling place without his wife, who had declared that she would be abstain. (He was without his three daughters, too, he explained — they had migrated.)</p><p>“My wife says they’ll cheat anyway, that Maduro wants to declare a dictatorship now,” said Mr. Bautista. “I told her to vote, because if that’s what happens, it might be the last time we’ll have the right to vote in Venezuela.”</p><p>In Caracas on Sunday, tanks lined the entrances to poorer neighborhoods that had been the scenes of protest the year before. Some of the vehicles bore a message: “Doubt is treason.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>On state television throughout the day, newscasters and officials spoke of high turnout, and a peaceful and efficient process. The hashtag #elpueblodecide2025 (“the people decide 2025”) flashed on screens.</p><p>Mr. Maduro’s movement, called Chavismo, has been in power for a quarter century; this was its 32nd election.</p><p>“Venezuela is the country with the most free, sovereign and democratic elections in the last 100 years of humanity,” Mr. Maduro claimed to reporters on Sunday before the results were announced. The vote had been uneventful, he said, pulled off without “a single punch.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Turkewitz is the Andes Bureau Chief for The Times, based in Bogotá, Colombia, covering Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
