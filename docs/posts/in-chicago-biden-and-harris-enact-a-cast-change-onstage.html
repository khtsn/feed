Less than a month ago, the party upended the election when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/arts/television/biden-withdraw-debate-tiktok.html" title="">President Biden withdrew</a> from the campaign, and Kamala Harris became the presumptive nominee. Suddenly, the previously scheduled rerun of the 2020 election, tuned out by many weary voters, was new programming, with a new cast.</p><p>The first night of the convention wasted little time unveiling its new star — even as it also had to finish off the last one’s story arc.</p><p>Early in the evening, Ms. Harris made a surprise appearance onstage in Chicago to her campaign anthem, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/style/beyonce-kamala-harris-freedom.html" title="">Beyoncé’s “Freedom.”</a> The crowd of delegates exploded with cheers.</p><p>This was an energy that the party had been missing for a while, and the prime-time production was designed to flaunt it. Ms. Harris’s kickoff remarks were brief —“We are moving forward!” — but there was a showmanship to the moment that suggested that the candidate plans to take the fight to Donald Trump where he lives, in the TV lights.</p></div></div><div><div><p>If Ms. Harris’s unexpected cameo had a measure of Mr. Trump’s theatricality, however, it had a different energy: expansive and effusive rather than brassy and bold. Beaming and waving to the crowd in a camel-colored suit, she reflected the room’s energy back to it rather than basking in it and soaking it up.</p><p>This was a big change from the convention Democrats anticipated having just weeks ago, under the tentative, 81-year-old Mr. Biden. The slogans onstage — “For the People, For the Future” — emphasized the message of newness.</p><p>The night had the feeling of a high-profile new brand launch: We’ve listened to your feedback, America, and we’ve updated our product for the tastes of today! The networks’ coverage seemed to pick up the theme of energy and rejuvenation; we saw multiple interviews with a group of young delegates from Washington dressed in “Cowboy Kamala” outfits.</p><p>The City of Big Shoulders was, for the night, the City of Big Vibes.</p><p>The speaker lineup, too, put heavy emphasis on the party’s newer talents, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive superstar representative from New York; Jasmine Crockett, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/11/us/politics/jasmine-crockett-democrats-oversight.html" title="">freshman representative</a> from Texas; and Raphael Warnock, elected senator from Georgia in 2021. Mallory McMorrow, the Michigan state senator who gave a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/us/politics/mallory-mcmorrow-michigan.html" title="">viral speech</a> on L.G.B.T.Q. rights in 2022, got the prop of the night, brandishing a comically oversized copy of the conservative Heritage Foundation’s book “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/opinion/project-2025-trump-administration.html" title="">Mandate for Leadership</a>: The Conservative Promise” to warn about the presidential blueprint Project 2025.</p><p>There was, however, was still some old business yet to attend to. Ms. Harris’s convention, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/arts/kamala-harris-tiktok-trump.html" title="">to borrow a meme</a>, still exists in the context of all that came before it — in this case, the two previous Democrats to run against Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Hillary Clinton, whose convention in 2016 featured the special effect of her image smashing a virtual glass ceiling, made the case for electing the first woman president, an angle that Ms. Harris has resisted emphasizing. Mrs. Clinton placed Ms. Harris in a line of political women that included Shirley Chisholm and the suffragists. (She referenced the dramatic passage of the 19th Amendment, a scene dramatized in the musical “Suffs,” which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/theater/suffs-broadway-hillary-clinton.html" title="">she produced</a>.) She also wryly drew a parallel to herself. Mr. Trump, she said of Ms. Harris, was “mocking her name and her laugh. Sounds familiar.”</p><p>But the most challenging piece of political staging came last: having President Biden give a valediction and an endorsement of his vice president in a race that he had been pressured to leave. The night’s climax had to convey both celebration of Mr. Biden’s first term and excitement at the fact that he wasn’t seeking a second; it needed to be the kind of sad that leaves you with a smile on your face, not a pit in your stomach.</p><p>Mr. Biden took the stage after a warm introduction by his daughter Ashley Biden, pulling out a handkerchief to dab away a tear. His address was in the shouty, fierce style of his more effective recent speeches, a marked contrast to the happy-warrior style that Ms. Harris has already made her campaign’s hallmark. But there were moments of emotion too, as he faced the sudden end of a long career: “America, I gave my best to you.”</p><p>In the room, at least, the speech seemed to go over, if not without some dissonance. Nancy Pelosi, a key figure in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/pelosi-biden.html" title="">pressuring Mr. Biden to leave the race</a>, was on camera hoisting a “We [Heart] Joe” sign. Meanwhile, Fox News commentators became Mr. Biden’s most ardent sympathizers. “Poor Joe unfortunately was kicked to the curb in a political coup,” said Sean Hannity.</p><p>Cramming together past and future, anticipation and commemoration, takes a lot of time, however. The program, stuffed with speakers and behind schedule, ran so late that Mr. Biden didn’t take the stage until well after prime-time in the Eastern time zone. Not that he seemed in a rush to leave.</p><p>But with Ms. Harris embracing him at the end of his farewell, the cast change was complete. She has three more nights to make the show her own.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>James Poniewozik is the chief TV critic for The Times.
