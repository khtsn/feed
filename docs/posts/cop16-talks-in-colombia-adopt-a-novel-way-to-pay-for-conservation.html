That means there are now vast amounts available in databases for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, biotechnology and other companies to analyze as they seek to develop new products.</p><p>Delegates at the talks, known as COP16, shorthand for 16th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, called the agreement an important breakthrough.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Conservation is mostly funded by governments and philanthropy,” said Amber Scholz, head of the science policy department at Leibniz Institute DSMZ, a German research institute that focuses on microbial and cellular biodiversity. “Now, businesses that profit from biodiversity will pay into a new fund.”</p><p>The final declaration made the fund voluntary, saying that companies “should” contribute.</p><p>The agreement lays out specifics on how much they should pay: 1 percent of their profits or 0.1 percent of their revenue, as a guideline.<em> </em>Governments are “invited” to take legislative or other measures that could require companies to contribute.</p><p>Such a fund could raise perhaps $1 billion per year for biodiversity conservation, according to research commissioned by the secretariat that governs the treaty.</p><p>In a move that signals the growing recognition of Indigenous people as custodians of biodiversity, half the funds are directed toward them, though countries reserved some wiggle room.</p><p>The talks ran past their Friday evening deadline and ended abruptly on Saturday when delegates began leaving for the airport and quorum was lost. Certain agenda items, including a contentious one on how to mobilize and distribute $200 billion a year by 2030, remained unresolved.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
