Donald J. Trump made the first move.</p><p>Since Adams’s indictment in late September on federal corruption charges, those close to him told us, he had felt abandoned and isolated, a mayor unmoored. Here was a relative stranger, the once and future president, edging his way at a white-tie charity dinner. “He actually put his arm around him,” David Paterson, a former New York governor and a fellow attendee, told us. Adams looked touched. He said little the rest of the night. “He was kind of quiet, almost like he’s thinking about it,” Paterson, a longtime friend, said. “Like: ‘Is this possible? Boy.’”</p><p>Once they reached the dais, Paterson recalled, Trump had a parting message for Adams: “Hang in there.” At the microphone moments later, before an audience of city dignitaries who largely disdained them both, Trump turned the subtext to text: A connection had been made. “We were persecuted, Eric,” he told the crowd at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a $5,000-a-plate annual benefit for Catholic charities that historically hosts presidential candidates. “I was persecuted, and so are you, Eric.”</p><p>The chance encounter set in motion what would become the signal political emergency in New York’s modern history, perpetrated by two sons of Queens with a shared instinct for brazen survival and naked transaction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But, really, what could surprise the city by now? Elected to deliver New York from disorder and disrepair, Adams established himself as the avatar of its chaos well before his arrest — a proper ambassador for a place that increasingly seemed to be losing its collective mind.</p><p>For reasons by turns entirely, partly and not particularly his fault, New York in the time of Eric Adams has become surreal and dislocating even by the city’s lofty historical standards. Its overlapping crises — mental health, housing, immigration, identity — have collided with enough force to knock the city itself off its bearings, overpowering the head-down-keep-it-moving impulse that has long been our default setting. There is no staring at phones, no overinspecting subway ads, pretending not to see.</p><p>Migrant mothers trudge through moving train cars with sleeping newborns strapped to their backs, selling marked-up candy. Men warm their bare legs over steaming curbside grates outside $10 million apartments, tattered sweatpants around their shins, as packs of deliveristas e-rocket past them ferrying $100 app orders from ghost kitchens. Drugstores protect toothpaste and deodorant as if they were launch codes, to be accessed only by uniformed authorities with keys. Undocumented middle schoolers in Brooklyn tuck little red cards into their pockets outlining their rights, as the new secretary of homeland security, fresh from South Dakota, hits the Bronx in a bulletproof vest and camera-ready makeup for a predawn raid tied to Venezuelan gang violence.</p><p>And tasked with corralling an unruly city from inside City Hall, many of Adams’s top aides have instead resigned — some in scandal, some later in protest — amid a hail of phone seizures and incendiary prosecutorial filings. His re-election looked iffy even before the audacious, cynical, possibly brilliant, highly quid-pro-questionable gambit to which he seemingly committed himself after the ballroom run-in: convincing Trump that there was room in the MAGA movement for Eric Leroy Adams and that he was willing to pay handsomely, with New York as collateral, for entry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Food delivery workers and their e-bikes have become ubiquitous across the city.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Thousands of homeless people sleep on the streets and in the subway system as commuters and pedestrians pass by.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>As Brooklyn’s borough president during Trump’s first term, Adams <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/01/23/eric-adams-video-mlk-trump-bashing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flamed</a> the Republican president’s “idiot behavior” and “three-card-monte” huckster-hustle. Now he was scolding fellow Democrats for unproductive name-calling and declaring himself “an Elon Musk guy.” He was gushing about working with Trump to deport criminal migrants. He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/nyregion/adams-trump-tucker-carlson.html" title="">sitting</a> in January for a chummy interview with Tucker Carlson, the far-right podcast host with whom the mayor had grown closer than publicly known. “We just have a lot of gut-level agreements,” Carlson told us, suggesting that Adams had previously been “intimidated into supporting things he doesn’t believe” by doctrinaire Democrats. Shortly after the Al Smith dinner, Carlson added, the mayor even considered attending Trump’s campaign rally at Madison Square Garden, with Carlson’s encouragement, before ultimately staying away.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Despite their superficial differences — party, race, ostensible ideology — a Trump-Adams alliance made some visceral sense. Both are relentless strivers from the boroughs, determined to propel themselves to high power. Both have toggled between America’s major political parties, flip-floppers passing in the night during the Giuliani and Bloomberg eras. Both can seem teleported from a very specific New York City moment, somewhere in the splotchy memory of the 1980s, when ties were fat, steakhouses were full and everyone talked about squeegee men — when Adams was a perp-chasing transit cop and Trump, a grasping real estate developer, took out newspaper ads demanding the death penalty after five teenagers were accused (wrongly, it turned out) of raping a jogger in Central Park.</p><p>Both prize loyalty and scorn elite consensus, having acquired their posts by rewarding the first and ignoring the second. “He ran with his gut — and he won,” Carlo Scissura, a construction-industry executive and friend of the mayor’s, told us. “It’s like a Trump mentality.”</p><p>Still, even for a politician as nimble and shape-shifting as Adams — a 64-year-old onetime police captain who led racial-justice protests against his own department, a self-branded “street cat” who has traveled prolifically (and mysteriously) abroad, a permanent-address-averse man who never quite dispelled pre-election suspicions that he lived in New Jersey — the path from blue-city leader to Trump-world luminary would be treacherous.</p><p>“You should resign! You’re embarrassing the city!” a passerby shouted one night in January as Adams, hard to miss in a blue jacket that said “MAYOR” on the back and “Eric Adams” in white cursive on the front, greeted transit cops in Brooklyn, the heckler’s voice echoing down the G train platform at Metropolitan Avenue. “<em>Resiiiiiign</em>!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“[Expletive] you, Eric Adams,” a woman said calmly, mid-stride, a short time later.</p><p>“Eight point three million people,” Adams said with a tight smile once she passed, “35 million opinions.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/23/magazine/23mag-adams-04/23mag-adams-04-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/23/magazine/23mag-adams-04/23mag-adams-04-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/23/magazine/23mag-adams-04/23mag-adams-04-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Protests with “Adams Out!” signs." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/23/magazine/23mag-adams-04/23mag-adams-04-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/23/magazine/23mag-adams-04/23mag-adams-04-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/23/magazine/23mag-adams-04/23mag-adams-04-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 768w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/23/magazine/23mag-adams-04/23mag-adams-04-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1536w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/47097dce-d061-5bab-b6a0-ec1ad852c7e2" decoding="async" width="600" height="800"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adams is deeply unpopular, and many New Yorkers want him removed from office.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Criminally accused of trading on his position, Adams seemed determined to clear his name by trading on his position. Once mythologized as a swaggering lawman who stayed up late and answered to no one, Adams presented now as a flailing defendant plainly beholden to Trump and his acolytes, paraded on “Fox &amp; Friends” by Trump’s border czar after acceding to the White House’s immigration demands. “I got him on the couch in front of millions of people,” the official, Tom Homan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/nyregion/adams-homan-fox-interview.html" title="">told viewers</a> in February, all but mailing a ransom note to voters. “He can’t back away from this now.” Days later, half of Adams’s deputy mayors announced plans to resign amid allegations, supported by federal prosecutors, that Adams had agreed to support Trump’s agenda in exchange for a Justice Department reprieve. (He has denied this — and the corruption charges.)</p><p>What followed has been a test case for what happens to a city — <em>the</em> city — when its City Hall is rudderless, responding to incentives his constituents could never have imagined, answering to forces with more to offer him than campaign votes and a job title.</p><p>But in nearly 100 interviews with aides, allies, adversaries and other counterparts across Adams’s decades in public life, what becomes clear is that the mayor’s fate, and New York’s under him, were something close to inevitable, even if their particulars are without precedent in the city’s 400 years. His arc with Trump, several details of which have not been previously reported, stands as the desperate thrashing of a mayoralty premised on a proudly chaotic man somehow taming a proudly chaotic city. That mayoralty’s crumbling is less a shock than a confirmation — and, in some ways, a validation — of Adams’s own view of the office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The mayor must fit the characteristic of the city,” he observed at City Hall late last year. This mayor does: self-regarding, sleepless, electric, a little fast and loose, more innately conservative than anyone likes to admit, riddled with persistent crime problems.</p><p>When he ran four years ago, Adams often defined himself by a three-word message: “I am you.” His story was ours.</p><p>He wasn’t wrong.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>Early in his</strong> term, Adams sometimes bewildered his audiences, publicly and privately, with an immodest question: “When does the hard part start?”</p><p>The mayor had long been enthralled by his own curated (and often difficult-to-confirm) legend: beaten by cops in Queens at age 15 after a trespassing arrest; employed as a numbers-runner and a squeegee boy; bullied for his dyslexia; rid of a diabetes diagnosis in his 50s after changing his diet; placed in City Hall, he has said quite explicitly, by the hand of God. Well before his swearing-in, he declared himself “the face of the Democratic Party,” the answer to its weaknesses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Covid-era crime on the rise? Let the former officer take his turn — and take credit for the anticipated decline. Repulsed by the far left? Adams called himself “the Biden of Brooklyn” after his revenge-of-the-moderates primary victory. Need an antidote to Bill de Blasio, Adams’s professorial predecessor, who loathed the socializing and cheerleading endemic to the job? Here was a new mayor who never met a ribbon he wouldn’t cut, who loved to “test the product,” as he put it, of New York after dark.</p><p>The case for pessimism could feel almost schoolmarmish: Adams hadn’t detailed many plans beyond a general commitment to public safety. He lacked an ideological core. Mystery shrouded where he lived and with whom. His circle, inside and outside of government, remained a hodgepodge of gamy New York characters — old police buddies, felonious restaurateurs, crypto bros — even as some allies warned him about dysfunction in his orbit. “I’m going to make sure my people are taken care of,” Adams said privately just after his win in the primary, according to a person present, noting that the white mayors before him did the same.</p><p>Some close to Adams have long cited his tolerance and enabling of associates’ failings and conflicts as a fatal flaw. At minimum, he worried little about appearances. He initially tasked his brother Bernard, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/nyregion/eric-adams-brother-bernard.html" title="">a Virginia parking administrator and retired police sergeant</a>, with a $210,000 job overseeing his security detail. The mayor cited concerns over “anarchists” and “white supremacy” in reasoning that he could trust only a blood relation to keep him safe, but the arrangement was quickly thwarted by the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board.</p><p>Weeks into his tenure, in the winter of 2022, the mayor dined publicly (at a Midtown eatery, Osteria La Baia, run by the felonious restaurateurs) with Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former governor who resigned months earlier amid nearly a dozen accusations of sexual harassment. Pressed in private about why he would help a still-radioactive Cuomo rehabilitate himself by association, Adams was sheepish, according to an associate: “He has good ideas.”</p><p>The mayor’s first major test came in his first summer, as busloads of migrants arrived from Texas and elsewhere to a city with pre-existing sanctuary laws. In his past elected jobs, as a state legislator and in the largely ceremonial role of borough president, the hard part never especially arrived. For all the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/23/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor-nyc.html" title="">early uncertainty</a> around Adams’s lifestyle, the most meaningful reveal was always going to be his crisis management, reinforced by an informal cabinet that defaulted first to protecting the principal’s reputation. The answers came quickly enough.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At first, the mayor greeted some asylum seekers personally as a gesture of give-me-your-tired support, smiling behind a mask at Port Authority Bus Terminal. His team began the unprecedented and jumbled work of housing and feeding what would grow to be more than 200,000 newcomers, bound largely by a local provision requiring officials to shelter the homeless. Sprawling tents popped up on an abandoned airfield in Brooklyn and an island off Manhattan. A grand old hotel in Midtown, the Roosevelt, became a processing hub for shelter-seekers — nicknamed “the new Ellis Island” — but a more searing snapshot consumed the wider public imagination: migrants filling the surrounding sidewalks as they waited for beds.</p><p>In time, Adams’s tone zagged. “This issue,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/nyregion/adams-migrants-destroy-nyc.html" title="">he said in 2023</a>, “will destroy New York City.” He proposed (and then sometimes unproposed) steep budget cuts to libraries, prekindergarten and other popular programs to account for the unforeseen billions being spent, even as he <a href="https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/spending-on-new-arrivals-january-2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overestimated</a> the cost of the influx. And he wanted New Yorkers, and fellow elected leaders, to know who was responsible: a Democratic White House that had abandoned the city and its leader, financially and morally.</p><p>“Joe Biden is trying to hang me out to dry, and I’m not going to let him,” he told a congressional delegation visiting City Hall in September 2023, according to an attendee. “I’m going to take care of Eric.” Adams informed his visitors, who had come to help build a case for increased federal assistance, that migrants were picking pockets and engaging in sex work, repeating concerns from some locals. He warned that national Democrats would soon have a widening political problem.</p><p>He was right about the party’s vulnerabilities, staking his position well before Biden removed himself from the ticket and Kamala Harris lost on it. But despite a kingly penchant for possessive adjectives — “my workers,” “my bond rating,” “my nail salons”— Adams has made a habit of suggesting that the blame for New York’s ills should fall on feckless Democrats and other authorities: hopeless idealists pushing bail-reform laws in Albany, shortsighted judges fueling recidivism, lefties on the City Council.</p><p>He can sound sometimes like a powerless visitor to his own city, marveling at its degraded condition. Fielding quality-of-life complaints in December at an Upper West Side community center, flanked by six flags (three American, three New York City), Adams echoed a favored refrain from the incoming president (“These criminals are laughing at us”). He seconded concerns about the city’s ambient aroma (“I smell weed everywhere!”).</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-20"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The city’s struggles to house more than 200,000 migrants became a defining crisis of Adams’s term.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fare beaters hurdle turnstiles every day as a matter of course.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>At one point, a woman, dismayed at the location of a nearby homeless shelter, lurched toward a restrictive view of the city: “You know what? Maybe not everybody gets to live in New York City if they can’t make it.” The room burbled with the whispered regrets of a group that had said the quiet part aloud. “Hold on,” the mayor shot back. “I don’t subscribe to ‘Maybe everyone should not live in New York City.’”</p><p>And besides, he hastened to add a short time later, other Democratic cities were worse. “Go Google ‘San Francisco,’” he said, swatting away concerns about New York’s record homelessness. “Go Google ‘Los Angeles.’” (Even with the migrant population decreasing, about <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/facts-about-homelessness/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">125,000 people</a> were staying in New York’s shelters each night as of December.)</p><p>To hear Adams describe the mismanagement and futility at every level of Democratic governance, it is no surprise that New York, like most major cities, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/trump-nyc-voters.html" title="">moved decidedly</a> toward Trump in 2024, even if it remains solidly blue. Southern Brooklyn, Northern Queens, Lower Manhattan and the eastern edges of the Bronx all got redder. Biden won the city by 54 points in 2020; Harris won it by 38. “Trump,” David Axelrod, a former chief adviser to Barack Obama, told us, “is a magnet for the dissatisfied.”</p><p>Still, Adams has in recent months pointed, fairly, to some encouraging data points. Nearly 350,000 jobs have been created during his term, outpacing 45 states. More than 64 million tourists visited in 2024, the second-most ever. The city’s murder tally fell to 382 last year, the fewest since 2019, if still stubbornly north of the prepandemic norm and in keeping with national trends.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>But Adams can seem most earnestly passionate about the symbolism of his position, in being the kind of mayor who shows up where predecessors would not: sleeping on a cot in a migrant tent shelter; sitting with loiterers said to be dealing drugs at a Burger King near City Hall; raising international flags in some 90 Lower Manhattan ceremonies that he describes as central to his work. A locally viral YouTube supercut showed Adams calling New York City the Athens, Istanbul, Kyiv, Seoul, Tel Aviv, Islamabad, Zagreb, Lima, Mexico City and — wearing an Irish fisherman’s sweater — Dublin of America. “This is why I wanted to be mayor,” he said in November, this time honoring Suriname.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adams on Feb. 17, the day half his deputy mayors announced their resignation.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>His belief in image-forward governance has extended even to the city’s most flammable episodes, when most mayors might default to sober risk aversion but when Adams has seemed to envision a more superheroic close-up for himself.</p><p>On Dec. 4, 2024, UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive, Brian Thompson, was executed outside his Midtown hotel. Bullet casings inscribed with anti-insurance-industry messages speckled the crime scene — a short walk from a newsstand’s stack of New York Posts with the mayor’s face on the cover. (Headline: “Mayor Adams Unleashed: ‘Cancel Me. I Don’t Care!’”) As the manhunt for Thompson’s killer unfurled across the northeast, Adams ended the day at Rockefeller Center, a few blocks south of where Thompson had bled, smiling beside Kelly Clarkson and Al Roker for the grand Christmas-tree lighting, which proceeded as scheduled.</p><p>And when Luigi Mangione was apprehended in Pennsylvania and flown back to the city, he was met on the blustery tarmac by a mean-mugging mayor in a blue overcoat, marching beside a phalanx of armed men in uniform toward waiting vehicles in a spectacle of a perp walk. “I wanted to look him in the eye and say, ‘You carried out this terroristic act in my city,’” he said, “and I wanted to be there to show the symbolism of that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Mangione would appear before the same Manhattan magistrate judge to whom the indicted mayor had recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/nyregion/eric-adams-arraignment-bribery-fraud.html" title="">pleaded his innocence</a>.</p><p><strong>Throughout his political</strong> career, Adams has seemed willing to consort with the kinds of throwback rogues more prudish politicians took pains to avoid: a Brooklyn party regular who, citing his Sicilian heritage, <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/09/dem-leader-frank-seddio-threatens-activist-in-caught-on-video-rant/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threatened</a> to tear a local official’s heart out; a parishioner-extorting pastor known as the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/lamor-whitehead-bling-bishop-sentenced.html" title="">Bling Bishop.</a>” His comfort with the tawdry side of an already tawdry business seemed rooted as much in the circumstances of his rise as in his personal constitution. Adams came out of the Brooklyn Democratic machine, a resilient city relic, in which patronage was paramount and judgeships were won on fealty as much as merit.</p><p>“I grew up in Brooklyn, and I knew cops that always hung out with the mobsters,” the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has known Adams since the 1980s, told us. “It may appear to somebody that didn’t grow up in their culture incongruous. But to me, that’s the way things were.”</p><p>Adams’s first elected office delivered him to a similar kind of place, where loyalties ruled and lawmakers and lawbreakers commingled: the Albany Legislature.</p><p>In 2010, a Queens Democrat named Hiram Monserrate faced a mutiny from his own State Senate peers after being convicted of assault for dragging his bleeding girlfriend down a hallway by her hair. Fellow Democrats wanted him expelled. But in a private meeting, former colleagues recalled, Adams implored Monserrate to hang on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>“Don’t resign,” he said. “This is all you’ve got. Don’t let them take it away from you.”</p><p>Soon after, 53 senators voted to eject Monserrate. Adams was one of eight opposed.</p><p>While most recent legislators have worked with future convicted criminals, Adams seemed to keep such figures especially close, while managing, sometimes barely, to stay out of serious trouble himself.</p><p>As chairman of the Senate’s racing-and-gaming committee, Adams raised money from bidders for a casino contract and fraternized with their lobbyists. A 2010 inspector general’s <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/attachments.readmedia.com/files/19595/original/Inspector_General_s_Aqueduct_Report.pdf?1291270537" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> hammered him for “exceedingly poor judgment.” (The matter was referred to federal prosecutors, who ultimately declined to pursue it.) The next year, he invited further ethical concerns after claiming to use campaign funds to travel to South Korea.</p><p>Perhaps the coldest evaluation of Adams’s reputation came in 2012. While under F.B.I. investigation, another Democratic senator from Queens, Shirley Huntley, agreed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/nyregion/court-to-name-officials-recorded-in-corruption-inquiry.html" title="">secretly record</a> conversations with colleagues, hoping that ensnaring other offenders would help her case. She invited Adams into her home with the tape running. (Adams was never accused of wrongdoing in connection to Huntley.)</p><p>“Corruption adjacency,” Brad Lander, the city comptroller and a 2025 primary opponent, told us when asked what he remembered of Senator Adams, whom he has known for two decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>As a lawmaker, with a BMW convertible and a wispy mustache now lost to time, Adams was undistinguished in record but memorable on camera. He led a “Stop the Sag” campaign to shame low-slung-pants-wearing among Brooklyn’s youth, placing his own headshot on neighborhood billboards. He spoke passionately of the need for legislative pay raises, roaring “Show me the money!” from the Senate floor. He filmed a how-to video urging parents to investigate the contraband-carrying children in their homes. “Look and see what’s inside your bookcases,” he said, retrieving a baggie with a powdery white substance in what he said was his own home. “Perfect place to hide cocaine.”</p><p>Through each of his elected offices, Adams has argued that New Yorkers should not simply rely on the police to maintain order but actively police themselves, instructing father to confront son, neighbor to confront neighbor, even in potentially precarious situations.</p><p>As borough president, Adams discouraged residents from calling the police or other city agencies to report illicit fireworks use, which became rampant across Brooklyn during the summer of 2020. “Those three numbers that we all dial, 911 — get over that,” he said, asking New Yorkers to engage directly with nominally nonviolent offenders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-32"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Drugstores keep sundries locked away from shoplifters — and everyone else.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Signs of drug use are common in the subway.

Adams expressed sympathies but declined to revise his position.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>His 2021 campaign reflected this tension within his view of law enforcement. To those seeking a return to order amid Covid-era volatility and crime spikes, Adams could be the former officer who spent 22 years on the force. To those appalled by police excesses through the years, especially in the reckoning that followed the death of George Floyd in 2020, Adams could point to the advocacy group he helped found, 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, to rally for racial justice from within the ranks.</p><p>His aspirations were amorphous enough that his divergent predecessors — the self-described progressive de Blasio and the technocratic billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg — separately offered their assistance to Adams’s team, ignoring the ethical clouds in the hope that he might validate their own visions for the city. Adams’s pitch was broad enough to be embraced by civil rights activists and The New York Post, which helpfully reinforced his hair-on-fire rendering of city crime and positioned him as Gotham’s last, best hope. Adams was, in his own telling, a “pragmatic moderate” and “the original progressive” depending on the day, even if some old friends knew better.</p><p>“Eric always was more right of center,” Sharpton said. “He was not a fellow traveler.” And yet Sharpton was his frequent ally — close enough, Sharpton said, that Adams offered him off-duty protection years ago after hearing a police colleague muse into a walkie-talkie about shooting the reverend at a protest.</p><p>Sharpton was speaking in his Midtown office in December, a cluttered shrine to his own influence, its walls and corridors lined with pictures and news clips of himself with leaders and celebrities: Barack Obama, the Clintons, James Brown, Kamala Harris, Michael Jackson, de Blasio. (Adams was not immediately visible.) “I don’t think that a Donald Trump or an Eric Adams or an Al Sharpton could have probably been what we were in any other city,” Sharpton said. “It’s that mixture of being rough-and-tough and showbiz and serious at the same time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-36"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At a Black History Month celebration at Gracie Mansion, Adams said some people were disposable matches and others were flames worth protecting.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>As he spoke, an MSNBC news alert flashed across his television. A verdict had been reached in the epochal non-Adams legal drama of Adams’s tenure: the negligent-homicide trial of Daniel Penny. In May 2023, Penny, a white former Marine, choked Jordan Neely, a Black former subway performer who was behaving erratically on an F train. Neely had a history of mental illness severe and documented enough that he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/13/nyregion/jordan-neely-top-50-mental-illness.html" title="">included on a city shortlist</a> of homeless people considered particular risks to themselves and others. When Neely frightened passengers, Penny held him in a chokehold for about six minutes, according to prosecutors, even after a bystander warned him that he could kill Neely. New Yorkers, including the mayor, held up the case as a testament to both a broken mental-health system and an abiding unease about public safety.</p><p>But Adams appeared to publicly back Penny even before the jury did, suggesting he had done what anyone should. Like most New Yorkers, the mayor seems to accept the city’s indiscriminate havoc as core to its identity, even intimating that its darkest traumas are part of the bargain. “Every day you wake up, you could experience everything from a plane crashing into our Trade Center to a person who’s celebrating a new business that’s open,” he <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/970-23/transcript-mayor-eric-adams-appears-pix-11-s-pix-politics-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told PIX11</a> in 2023. “This is a very, very complicated city, and that’s why it’s the greatest city on the globe.”</p><p>He was widely mocked, but he was onto something. To ride the city’s subways, especially, is to find many of New York’s highest delights — deliriously flummoxed tourists, busker sax solos timed perfectly to platform waits, dogs too big for bags standing expressionless in bags (per M.T.A. rules about animal transport). It is to see both teenagers with school bags and commuters in suits hurdle turnstiles as a matter of course.</p><p>And it is to risk exposure to the city’s gravest horrors, posted and reposted across social media: a woman burned alive in a Brooklyn subway car the same day that a man was fatally stabbed on a train in Queens; a man, shoved to the tracks in Manhattan, fracturing his skull the day before two unrelated stabbings minutes apart. Felony assaults in the subway system have <a href="https://www.vitalcitynyc.org/articles/vital-signs-state-of-the-city-on-crime-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than tripled</a> since 2009. (En route to an interview for this article, its co-author had her phone stolen as part of a subway-station-wide spree that law-enforcement officials later said involved a knife and three other victims, one of whom went to the hospital with a head laceration.)</p><p>Even veterans of New York’s bleakest chapters in memory, from its near-bankruptcy in the 1970s to its 2,000-plus annual murders in the early 1990s, say — perhaps nostalgically — that there was some predictability to the bad old days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><p>“As long as you kept a polite distance from certain areas, you were basically OK,” Paterson, the former governor, told us.

(Sliwa is the son of Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, the red-beret-wearing civilian anti-crime group formed in the 1970s. The elder Sliwa was Adams’s Republican opponent in 2021 and is running again.)

His approval rating had sagged into the mid-20s. The New York Post was inching away. The mayor who was elected by highlighting chaos in his city, and who governed while highlighting chaos in his city, now regularly accused the news media of lying and fear-mongering about chaos in his city. (Adams declined to be interviewed through his office. In recent months, he has bypassed most major print outlets, dismissing legacy journalists as openly dishonest while gravitating toward long-form interviews with national personalities like Tucker Carlson and Stephen A. Smith.)</p><p>Adams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/nyregion/eric-adams-dinkins-race.html" title="">began comparing himself often with David Dinkins</a>, the city’s first Black mayor, a one-termer in the early 1990s untainted by corruption but still lampooned in the tabloids as a lightweight, often in racist caricature.</p><p>“He said to me on several occasions, ‘They destroyed David Dinkins, and they’re trying to destroy me, and I’m not going to let it happen,’” Ken Sunshine, a prominent public-relations executive and Dinkins’s former chief of staff, told us. “I never asked who ‘they’ is.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p><strong>From the beginning,</strong> Adams always insisted that corruption concerns were overblown, that he knew how to keep himself clean when it mattered. A few months after his 2021 primary victory, Adams was describing his plans for the job during an interview at a diner near Brooklyn’s Borough Hall, sipping a peppermint tea he would leave without paying for. (A restaurant manager said “Eric Adams’s table is fine.”) The key, Adams suggested, would be limiting distractions.</p><p>“This is going to be a hard-enough job,” he said. “One of my mentors said, ‘You start too many fires, you will burn yourself up.’”</p><p>That mentor was Timothy Pearson, a friend of more than three decades who was once Adams’s police supervisor and could soon be described as one of his primary arsonists, an emblem of a mayoralty unbound.</p><p>When Adams was elected, Pearson was overseeing security at an electronic gambling den next to a faded horse track in Queens. The city, still largely shut down amid the ongoing pandemic, was scrambling to reopen schools while meeting the exacting standards of the teachers’ union. Pearson had an idea.</p><p>He rang a senior state official and introduced himself as someone who would be running things for the mayor. Pearson, a person familiar with the call told us, thought the city could put teachers in Tyvek.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-22"><div><p>Astonished, the official told Pearson that outfitting educators in the sort of hazmat gear depicted in movies about biological warfare was unworkable, in part because it would terrify students. She advised him not to mention the proposal to anyone else. (Pearson says he has no recollection of this conversation.)</p><p>Weeks later, Pearson joined Adams on a Times Square stage as he was sworn into office. Before long, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/nyregion/adams-timothy-pearson-casino-salaries.html" title="">he was on the payroll of a nonprofit controlled by the mayor</a>, simultaneously pulling in a city salary, a casino salary and a city pension. The mayor allowed this triple-dipping to go on for months even though the casino had expansion plans that would benefit from his support.</p><p>Pearson’s title, “senior adviser” to the mayor, belied his power. Adams gave him supervision of a new government-efficiency unit, where staff members took to calling Pearson “Crumbs” for complaining that he wasn’t getting any from a municipal contract, according to lawsuits. (Four of Pearson’s subordinates, all police officers detailed to the unit, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/nypd-pearson-adams-lawsuit.html" title="">would later sue</a> him for sexual harassment and retaliation, three of them men appalled by his treatment of their female colleagues. Pearson has denied all wrongdoing.)</p><p>Though Pearson did not technically work at the Police Department, Adams gave him significant control over many discretionary promotions at the agency, according to lawsuits. The mayor’s first police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, a respected Long Island chief of detectives, retired 18 months in, after saying that Adams and his aides had undermined her. Pearson, she told one confidant, reversed promotions that she had made. (He denies this too.)</p><p>Sewell’s replacement, Edward Caban, faced a scandal involving <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/15/us-news/nycs-ex-top-cop-edward-cabans-twin-pretended-to-be-him-complaint/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">allegations</a> of an old-timey protection racket and his identical twin brother. (Caban has denied all wrongdoing.) Caban’s replacement, Thomas Donlon, had documents seized from his home as part of a separate investigation. Late last year, Adams made Jessica Tisch, a scion of the billionaire Loews family, commissioner of the N.Y.P.D., where she had once worked as deputy commissioner of information technology. She has purged some, but not all, of the department’s pre-existing leadership.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-23"><div><p>Pearson retained his privileged position even after October 2023, when he <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doi/reports/pdf/2025/10TouroRpt.Release.02.20.2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sparked a physical altercation</a> with security guards at a migrant shelter by refusing to show his ID, in accordance with shelter rules, and had the guards arrested under false pretenses.</p><p>“Tim,” Adams explained in December 2023, “is one of my Knights of the Round Table.”</p><p>Within a year, that table would be lonely. Nearly all of Adams’s most trusted advisers, including Pearson, made their exits amid an endless loop of scandal, phone seizures and subpoenas. More than a dozen aides and confidants — Adams’s chief adviser, his first deputy mayor, his schools chancellor, his police commissioner, his interim police commissioner — either attracted law-enforcement attention, resigned under duress or were arrested (and sometimes all three) in several unrelated investigations. “Too many friends with too many problems in too many high places,” Bill Bratton, who served as police commissioner under de Blasio and Rudy Giuliani, told us. “That’s the shame of it.”</p><p>Even Adams’s longtime romantic partner, Tracey Collins, <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2024/11/08/eric-adams-partner-tracey-collins-retires-amid-investigations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">left</a> a more-than-$250,000-a-year role in the city’s Department of Education amid allegations that Adams had installed her in what was effectively a no-show job.</p><p>And on Sept. 26, 10 months after F.B.I. agents approached him outside New York University, directed his security detail to step aside and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/nyregion/adams-fbi-investigation-phones.html" title="">took his phones</a>, prosecutors announced an indictment of the mayor on five federal corruption counts. “OFFICER DOWN,” read a collection of stickers, with a grinning Adams, pressed to the scaffolding outside N.Y.U.

It depicted Adams, as borough president, mayor-elect and then new mayor, leveraging his public power for private gain, indulging in free and heavily discounted travel arrangements courtesy of the Turkish government and its national airline. In 2017, Adams, a close relative and an aide traveled business class on Turkish Airlines to France, Turkey and China. They paid nothing. The airfare and a discounted stay at a luxury hotel were worth more than $41,000. The next year, he traveled with his partner, Collins, to Hungary on heavily discounted Turkish Airlines tickets that saved them more than $12,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-50"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A federal indictment showed the mayor of the nation’s wealthiest city soliciting illegal donations from foreign interests — which he has denied.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-24"><div><p>Shortly before he won the 2021 Democratic primary, Adams had an aide acquire two business-class tickets to Istanbul from the national airline’s general manager in New York. “I am going to charge $50,” the general manager texted. “That would work wouldn’t it.” The aide responded that it actually would not. “His every step is being watched right now,” the aide wrote. “$1,000 or so. Let it be somewhat real.” The indictment claimed that the market value of the tickets was more than $15,000. That trip was ultimately canceled. But after he won the November election, Adams flew Turkish Airlines to Ghana for a trip he cast as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/nyregion/eric-adams-ghana.html" title="">spiritual in nature</a>. He got a discount of $12,000. The airline manager got a position on the mayor’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/nyregion/nyc-adams-turkey-raid-aide.html" title="">transition committee</a> — something he acquired after playfully threatening the mayor with having to sit in “seat number 52” on future travels.</p><p>The indictment showed a Turkish government eager to cultivate a rising star in the Democratic Party, someone who two Turkish businessmen speculated could someday be president. It showed the mayor of the nation’s wealthiest city soliciting illegal donations from foreign interests, with the understanding that they would be routed to his campaign through straw donors. It said that the Turkish consul general had helped arrange some of those donations and that Adams, then the presumptive mayor-elect, had helped him accelerate the opening of a new consulate building. The 36-story skyscraper was cleared just in time for a planned visit by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, despite a written warning from a fire official that the building was “not safe to occupy.” It showed a new mayor continuing to solicit illegal foreign donations and promising, in apparent recompense, to refrain from honoring Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day.</p><p>The document painted a picture of lawlessness at the highest reaches of city government that, in its crumb-seeking grubbiness, echoed the toothpaste-swiping crime on city streets.</p><p>The mayor pleaded not guilty. “When I read it, I was like, Where are the bags of cash?” Adams later said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-25"><div><p>Fabien Levy, his deputy mayor for communications, dismissed the case to us recently as much ado about “leg room.”</p><p>“God got me,” the mayor texted Jackie Rowe-Adams, a gun-safety activist and friend (who is unrelated to him). “I did nothing wrong.” She, like several supporters, defended Adams as a good man too trusting of those around him. “He’s been failed,” she told us.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-54"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adams rallied at a Brooklyn church with supporters who prayed for him amid calls for his removal.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-26"><div><p>Beyond the courtroom, Adams’s political prospects, tenuous for months, began to crater. Possible rivals, including Cuomo, sensed weakness. Though thirsting for a comeback, the former governor was once privately adamant that he would not run against Adams. Now he was hedging. Whatever he did, Cuomo told one associate, Adams was political roadkill, anyway. “He has no shot,” he said.</p><p>Money was drying up for the mayor’s campaign, to say nothing of his legal defense, with a trial set to start in April, two months before the primary. Initially, his defense fund supplied a new channel for potential favor-currying, drawing from business owners and others who wanted to show support. Bloomberg donated $5,000, the maximum allowed. De Blasio, who faced his own federal fund-raising investigation in office, publicly called the Adams case “<a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/inside-city-hall/2025/02/13/de-blasio-says-charges-against-adams-were--flimsy-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flimsy</a>.” But given the high cost of the mayor’s legal team — led by Alex Spiro, who is also a lawyer for Elon Musk — the fund was nearly $1 million in the hole as of January. (The city’s Law Department previously hired Spiro last spring to defend the mayor against a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/nyregion/eric-adams-sexual-assault.html" title="">sexual-assault claim</a> dating to Adams’s time as an officer. Adams has denied wrongdoing.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-27"><div><p>Even after he was indicted, Adams seemed to view himself as a singular victim and martyr, hounded by the press, the elite, the old guard discomfited by a “straight-up South Jamaica, Queens, street cat.” In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/nyregion/adams-pardon-biden-trump.html" title="">news conference</a> at City Hall in December, he compared himself to Muhammad Ali on a famed 1968 Esquire cover: the boxer, stripped of his titles for refusing to fight in a war he opposed, stood with his hands behind his back, his eyes cast upward, his body riddled with arrows.</p><p>Adams has publicly maintained that Biden’s government was punishing him for speaking out about the migrants, somehow directing the U.S. attorney for the Southern District to bring phantom charges. (The investigation began before both Adams and the U.S. attorney took office.)</p><p>More to the point, people close to Adams say, he sees no crime in what he was accused of. But he did take precautions. The mayor changed the password on his personal phone before giving it to investigators, purportedly to ensure that his staff would not delete anything that investigators might need. He then claimed to have forgotten the new code, conveniently depriving prosecutors of whatever evidence it might contain.</p><p>“They don’t believe what they did is wrong,” Scissura, the construction-industry executive, whom Adams’s team recommended we speak with, said of the mayor and his aides. “They’re like: ‘Why? Why is this wrong?’”</p><p><strong>Three days before</strong> his re-inauguration as president, Trump rolled up to the main dining room of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., heading a retinue of heavily armed golf carts. Adams was waiting for him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-28"><div><p>The stated purpose of the gathering was civic collaboration, a chance for the two leaders to discuss shared priorities for the city that shaped them both. The reality, typical for each of them, was more scattershot and self-interested. With Adams at his side, Trump looked up regularly at multiple televisions airing coverage of his cabinet picks, often redirecting the conversation to whatever had just played. Around the table, Steve Witkoff, a billionaire New York real estate executive and Trump’s new special envoy to the Middle East, held forth on Israel and Gaza. Frank Carone, a longtime Adams adviser, gabbed with Eric Trump, a New York acquaintance of his who helped bring the two sides together, according to two people familiar with the lunch. At one point, Sylvester Stallone, munching nearby, wandered over to say hello.</p><p>But before Adams’s hour was up, the conversation — some details of which have not been previously reported — drifted toward a nominally forbidden subject. In defending the meeting with Trump, Adams has sworn that his case was never discussed. This was, perhaps, narrowly accurate. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/justice-department-trump-charges-eric-adams.html" title="">spoke</a> broadly about a “weaponized” justice system under Biden, a person familiar with the lunch told us, and suggested that he understood what the mayor was going through. He told him to stay strong.</p><p>Since their first encounter, Adams had seemed to be angling for precisely this chance. The two crossed paths the week after Trump’s election, at a UFC fight at Madison Square Garden, but the discussion was brief, requiring Adams to brush past Tulsi Gabbard and Trump’s eldest sons to greet the president-elect at his cageside perch.</p><p>Publicly, Adams declined to criticize Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/nyregion/adams-trump-tucker-carlson.html" title="">and vowed not to</a>, playing up their natural kinship. (“He grew up miles away from me in Queens, so he knows how important this city is.”) Privately, he went on to tell his administration’s officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/nyregion/eric-adams-trump-nyc-officials-cooperation.html" title="">not to criticize Trump either</a>. “A New York City mayor’s bully pulpit is without parallel,” de Blasio told us. “Any time a mayor wants to challenge the president, they can go on national television and get their message across instantly.” Adams was choosing deference.</p><p>In December, Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/nyregion/trump-pardon-eric-adams.html" title="">dangled</a> a pardon when reporters asked about Adams’s case. A person familiar with the matter told us Adams received no advance warning but was surprised by and grateful for the remarks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-29"><div><p>What Trump stood to gain from the relationship was clear enough. Beyond exerting dominance over the mayor of the financial capital of the United States, he has long hoped to buttress his dimmed standing here; the Trump Organization has made it <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/13/us-news/trump-organization-will-make-comeback-bid-to-run-central-parks-wollman-rink/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">known</a>, for starters, that it wants to reclaim control of (and restore his gilded name to) Wollman Rink in Central Park. (“Nearly 38 years ago, my father saved Wollman Rink,” Eric Trump told us in a statement. “We truly hope we can save it once again.”) And surely Trump did not mind hearing a famous Democrat perpetuating his unfounded claims of rank corruption in Biden’s Justice Department. “President Trump feels his pain,” John Catsimatidis, a gadfly billionaire and New York Republican, told us. Catsimatidis is one of several mutual friends of the mayor and the president.</p><p>The day after the lunch, Adams was due in Harlem for an event hosted by Sharpton to honor Martin Luther King Jr. “Should I still come?” Adams texted him. Sharpton said yes, placing Adams on a stage that included most of Trump’s New York political combatants: Letitia James, the state attorney general who won a $454 million civil-fraud judgment against the Trump Organization; Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who won a conviction that made Trump a felon; Gov. Kathy Hochul; Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand.</p><p>“I don’t know what Trump did to you down there,” Sharpton told the crowd of 150 or so, introducing the mayor. “If he did something to you, I can baptize you again. I’ll baptize you. I might have to put you down in the water this time.”</p><p>Adams laughed and stepped forward to polite applause. He suggested that he had seen Trump only for the city’s own good. “There’s nothing enjoyable,” the mayor said, “about what I’m going through.” He told the room that King, too, had been criticized for sitting down with the wrong people. (Asked later if he found that analogy resonant, Sharpton stared straight ahead for a beat before answering: “No.”)</p><p>Two days later, after announcing a slate of local appearances honoring King on the official holiday, Adams scrapped those plans, corralled his security detail and was driven to Washington around 3 a.m. after receiving a last-minute invitation to Trump’s inauguration. Inside the Capitol, he took his place in an overflow room for not-quite-V.I.P. elected officials and others — the mayor of America’s largest city, mingling among the YouTubers and congressional spouses. (“He should have gone to M.S.G.,” Tucker Carlson said of the Siberian seat assignment, recalling the October rally that Adams skipped.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-30"><div><p>By February, Adams’s legal team was nearing a breakthrough. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/adams-lawyers-justice-department-dismissal.html" title="">After requesting a White House pardon,</a> his lawyers settled for what seemed like the next best thing. The acting No. 2 in the Justice Department, Emil Bove III, a grim-faced former prosecutor who was one of Trump’s personal lawyers for his criminal trial in New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/10/nyregion/adams-case-dismiss-memo.html" title="">directed</a> the Trump-appointed interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District to dismiss the charges, saying they interfered with the upcoming mayoral election and impeded Adams’s ability to govern — and to help Trump. Bove said the department could reconsider the matter after the November election, seemingly ensuring that Adams would be in hock to Trump. (On March 7, a court filing raised the likelihood that the charges would be dismissed entirely.)</p><p>When word of Bove’s initial memo leaked, Adams was at a steakhouse with Catsimatidis, gleefully reading from the billionaire’s phone. But days later, Danielle R. Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney — a Federalist Society <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/nyregion/adams-prosecutor-danielle-sassoon-profile.html" title="">member</a> and former Scalia clerk — <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/24535586a908999e/3801d435-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused</a> Bove and Adams’s lawyers of crafting an illegal quid pro quo: The Justice Department would drop the indictment; Adams would help Trump deport migrants. (Spiro, Adams’s Musk-affiliated lawyer, has denied this.) She said her office planned to file new charges against the mayor, for conspiracy to obstruct justice, “based on evidence that Adams destroyed and instructed others to destroy evidence and provide false information to the F.B.I.”</p><p>Adams’s implicit defense against quid-pro-quo allegations was a complicated one for someone seeking re-election as a Democrat: that he has essentially been Trumpy all along. Before the 2021 campaign, an associate told us, Adams said he was considering running for mayor as a Republican. He has explored the option again this time. “Is Eric Adams QAnon?” Steve Bannon joked late last year, addressing the New York Young Republican Club.</p><p>Adams’s politics are at least bespoke enough to muddy standard boundaries. When the mayor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/nyregion/fluoride-water-eric-adams.html" title="">equivocates</a> on the value of fluoridated tap water, a city staple since the 1960s, as he did in November, is he parroting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s skepticism or reflecting his own interest in medical opinions beyond the mainstream? When he allows federal immigration authorities back into the Rikers Island jail complex, is he solely doing Trump’s bidding? Or is this all common sense to a mayor long infuriated by the immigration policies of the last president?</p><p>In early January, Adams hosted Carlson at Gracie Mansion for a 50-minute interview, asking that it not be aired until after Trump’s inauguration, Carlson told us. After a charitable 2021 segment about Adams on Carlson’s Fox News show (unhelpful to Adams during his Democratic primary), the candidate described the host as a purveyor of “racist, anti-immigrant propaganda” and disavowed any support. Now they were sitting in cushioned chairs beside a fireplace draped in seasonal garlands, as Carlson laughed openly at what he described as Adams’s “ridiculous” indictment. Adams said he was glad that his mother, whose framed portrait he often carries to public events, was not alive to see this political persecution of her son. He summarized the consistent message he received from the Biden White House — “Be a good Democrat, Eric” — and delivered his own to those who questioned his recent positioning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-31"><div><p>“People often say, well, you know, ‘You don’t sound like a Democrat’ and, you know, ‘You seem to have left the party,’” he said. “No, the party left me, and it left working-class people.”</p><p>Carlson titled the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY1NzHE-730" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> “New York Mayor Eric Adams Sounds a Lot Like a Trump Voter.”</p><p><strong>The arcane bylaws</strong> of New York afford its governor a nuclear option so unpalatable that it has never been used in the state’s nearly 237-year history: the unilateral removal of the mayor.</p><p>From her city office on Third Avenue in February, Hochul made a show of taking meetings with elected leaders and others, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/nyregion/adams-crisis-city-hall.html" title="">including Sharpton</a>, to assess the municipal appetite beyond the protests flickering outside City Hall, where a repurposed MAGA sign was held aloft: “Make Adams Go Away.”</p><p>The nearest precedent dates back a century. Franklin D. Roosevelt, then the governor, presided over hearings in 1932 investigating corruption by Jimmy Walker, the absentee Jazz Age mayor. Walker was known for his love of nightclubs and travel and his poor taste in friends. “He found it hard to believe that any of his friends were bad — or even wrong,” a Tammany Hall boss once said. Walker resigned and fled to Europe to meet the Ziegfeld showgirl who became his wife, before Roosevelt could act.</p><p>“I’m not stepping down,” Adams has insisted over and over. “I’m stepping up.” Such assertions of strength, credible and otherwise, have become something of a theme for the city. Trump, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/nyregion/trump-congestion-pricing-nyc.html" title="">moving to unravel a new traffic-congestion-pricing program</a>, hailed his own monarchical might. “Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED,” he wrote on his social media platform. “LONG LIVE THE KING!” Cuomo, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-mayor-nyc.html" title="">beginning his own mayoral campaign</a> in March with an early polling lead, framed his re-entry in a 17-minute video: Only his iron hand could “save our city,” he suggested, amid “the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-32"><div><p>In many ways, the three men understand one another as few can. “If you told Cuomo, Eric and Trump, ‘You’re indicted, your days are over, hand in your stuff,’ they would tell you to go [expletive] yourself,” Todd Shapiro, a publicist who is close with both Adams and Cuomo, told us. “You could throw an 800-pound block of cement at them. They’ll still run again.”</p><p>Yet for all the bluster, and the bluster to come, it has been difficult to shake the feeling that New York is effectively on its own. “We’re drifting,” Dan Doctoroff, a deputy mayor under Bloomberg, told us. “And drift is not a good place.”</p><p>The city government under Adams did seem to operate more professionally after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/nyregion/phil-banks-resigns-eric-adams.html" title="">mass resignations</a> of those closest to him late last year. Many were replaced by capable technocrats. The new dynamic was referred to internally as “revenge of the nerds.” But as the mayor’s courtship of Trump accelerated, and as Trump reciprocated in kind, the nerds worried. Had they traded a cronyist government for a City Hall tethered to a president they deplored?</p><p>Alarmed that Adams might functionally hold New Yorkers hostage to evade charges, half of his remaining deputy mayors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/nyregion/adams-deputy-mayors-resign-trump-immigration.html" title="">announced their resignations in February</a>. The governor unveiled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/nyregion/hochul-adams-nyc-oversight.html" title="">series of guardrails</a> designed to make Adams more answerable to her. But in declining to remove him outright, Hochul also suggested that no one could save New York but its own voters.</p><p>Adams, weakened but unbowed, maintains that there is still a path. Just after Valentine’s Day, he spoke at Maranatha Baptist Church, a Black church near where he grew up in Southeast Queens. He cast his life as a hero’s journey, with Adams slaying each villain only to rise and find himself grappling with a “new devil”: cops beating him in the basement of a precinct house; school bullies berating him for his dyslexia; peers calling him “Uncle Tom” as an officer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-33"><p>“They danced on my grave when I was indicted,” Adams said, to building cheers as the church organ crescendoed. “God said, ‘Eric, rise up.’ They’re dancing on my grave right now.” This was not a dead man walking, he said. This was a dead man reborn. He was Lazarus.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-70"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the face of dwindling poll numbers, Adams maintains he still has a path to re-election.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ashley Gilbertson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-34"><div><p>“I think he still thinks he’s in control,” Paterson told us, recalling a private remark from Adams to him recently about his increasingly explosive rhetoric. “He said to me, ‘You know how I’m playing with these people, right?’”</p><p>Celebrating Black History Month at Gracie Mansion later in February, Adams went further in narrating his “biblical moment.” “When Jesus was on the cross, he said, ‘God, forgive them, for they know not what they do,’” the mayor said. “All these Negroes who were asking me to step down, God, forgive them.”</p><p>People were angry, he continued, because “I am you.”</p><p>Any mayor can be myopic, tempted to conflate his own fortunes with his city’s. Adams has taken the symbiosis to its logical extreme. He <em>is</em> the city, their fates entwined. As far as he is concerned, he might as well be campaigning alone.</p><p>“I’m running against myself,” he has said repeatedly. And in Eric Adams, New York has found a worthy opponent.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
