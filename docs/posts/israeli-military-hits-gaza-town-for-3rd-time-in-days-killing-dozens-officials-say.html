Gaza’s Health Ministry put the toll higher, saying that at least 93 people had been killed, including 25 children.</p><p>The Israeli military, which asserts it is fighting a regrouped Hamas presence in northern Gaza, said that it was “aware of reports that civilians were harmed” and was looking into the details. The area was previously evacuated, it said, and was “an active combat zone.”</p><p>Matthew Miller, a U.S. State Department spokesman, called the strike in Beit Lahia “a horrifying incident with a horrifying result” and noted that many of the children reportedly killed had probably fled strikes in other parts of Gaza. He said the Biden administration had contacted the Israeli government for more information.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hamas condemned the strike as a “horrific massacre” and demanded international action to stop Israel.</p><p>Israeli forces struck <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/world/middleeast/israel-strike-beit-lahia-gaza.html" title="">another residential block</a> in Beit Lahia on Sunday, killing and wounding dozens, according to the civil defense service.

During that assault, militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 others to Gaza as hostages.</p><p>This October has already been the deadliest month of the year for the Israeli military, with at least 59 troops killed in Gaza and Lebanon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-lebanon-invasion-map.html" title="">where Israel is fighting Hezbollah</a>, the Lebanese militia that, like its ally Hamas, is backed by Iran. The toll includes four soldiers who were killed overnight in Jabaliya, a town in northern Gaza, about three miles southwest of Beit Lahia, the Israeli military said.

But UNRWA has played a critical role in coordinating desperately needed humanitarian aid in Gaza. The Biden administration had urged Israel not to pass the bills.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Miller, the State Department spokesman, warned that Israel could face unspecified “consequences” under U.S. law and said the Biden administration was watching to see if there were any legal challenges to the laws.</p><p>“We are deeply troubled by this legislation,” he told reporters in Washington. “It could shutter UNRWA operations in the West Bank, in Gaza, in East Jerusalem. It poses risks for millions of Palestinians who rely on UNRWA for essential services, including health care and primary and secondary education.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Israel has criticized UNRWA for decades, arguing that its work aiding Palestinian refugees and their descendants perpetuate longstanding territorial conflict with Israel.

The group and the Israeli military traded fire for months, forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes in both countries.
