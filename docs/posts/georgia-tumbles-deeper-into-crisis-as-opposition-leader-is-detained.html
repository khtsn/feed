The agents said they were conducting “investigative actions,” according to widely broadcast footage of the arrest.</p><p>When Nika Gvaramia, an opposition leader, insisted on being let into the office to observe what was going on, the agents refused. After Mr. Gvaramia yelled at the security agents and insisted he had a right to be inside, they grabbed him and dragged him away, according to footage of the confrontation that was filmed by several journalists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The footage shows the officers carrying Mr. Gvaramia by the arms and legs through a crowd of stunned supporters and then stuffing him into a waiting car.</p><p>“Take your masks off so we can see who you are!” one woman yelled as Mr. Gvaramia was hauled away.</p><p>Later, a television station allied with the opposition said that Mr. Gvaramia had not been seriously hurt and would probably be fined for not cooperating with security agents.</p><p>The arrest fueled the fury already coursing through Tbilisi’s streets. Since the ruling party announced last week that it was delaying the process to join the European Union by several years, protests have erupted across the country, especially in the capital.</p><p>Security forces have beaten dozens of protesters and detained hundreds, according to local media reports. In a sign of a widening crackdown, security agents have searched political offices and the homes of prominent activists.</p><p>Many Georgians fear their government is turning away from Europe and closer to Russia, which it borders. Surveys have shown that the vast majority of Georgians want to join the European Union.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In 2008, Russian and Georgian troops engaged in a short war.
