In a string of blows from September until late last month, when the cease-fire took effect in Lebanon, Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html" title="">detonated the group’s wireless devices</a>, bombarded it with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-deaths.html" title="">intense air raids</a>, attacked its positions with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-lebanon-invasion-map.html" title="">a ground invasion</a> and killed many of its commanders.</p><p>Mr. Qassem took over as the group’s secretary general in October, a month after its leader of three decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">Hassan Nasrallah</a>, was assassinated in Israeli airstrikes south of Beirut.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Naim Qassem, now Hezbollah’s leader, speaking in September in Beirut at a memorial for a senior commander killed by an Israeli airstrike.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>So far, the cease-fire has appeared to hold <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-cease-fire-violations.html" title="">despite periodic exchanges of fire</a>. Hezbollah entered into its terms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-ceasefire.html" title="">badly battered</a> by the war: Hezbollah’s arsenal, once thought by <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weapons analysts</a> to be one of the world’s largest in the hands of a nonstate armed group, was largely destroyed, according to Israeli officials.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The lack of access to Syrian territory is also a blow to Iran, which had long propped up Mr. al-Assad and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/irans-syria-axis-of-resistance.html" title="">used Syria as a hub to network and supply its proxies</a> in the region, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq.</p><p>Hezbollah and Iran intervened in Syria’s 13-year civil war to bolster Mr. al-Assad’s troops, but, sapped by the last year of conflict with Israel, were unable or unwilling to come to his defense as rebels <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/world/middleeast/syria-assad-damascus.html" title="">raced to Damascus in a sudden offensive</a> this month. Russia, another supporter of the regime that has been focusing on battles elsewhere, was similarly disinclined to get involved this time.</p><p>Mr. Qassem said Saturday that he hoped for cooperation between the people and governments of Lebanon and Syria — positioning Hezbollah as open to working with whoever takes over, much <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/syria-us-israel-turkey.html" title="">as regional and global powers have done</a> in the past week. (The United States has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/middleeast/blinken-jordan-syria-transition.html" title="">been in direct contact</a> with the leading rebel group, the secretary of state said on Saturday, despite the group’s designation as a terrorist organization.)</p><p>The Hezbollah leader also expressed concern that the new government in Damascus might normalize relations with Israel after decades of hostility under Mr. al-Assad.</p><p>Mr. Qassem defended the decision to abide by the cease-fire, saying that it did not mean the end of the group’s “resistance” but was necessary to “stop the aggression” of Israel in southern Lebanon. He added that Hezbollah’s survival in the war was itself a triumph.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
