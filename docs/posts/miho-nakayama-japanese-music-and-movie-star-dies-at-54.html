She was 54.</p><p>Ms. Nakayama was found dead in a bathtub, according to a statement from her management company. The statement added, “We are still in the process of confirming the cause of death and other details.”</p><p>The Japan Times reported that Ms. Nakayama had canceled an appearance at a Christmas concert in Osaka, Japan, scheduled for that same day, citing <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2024/12/06/miho-nakayama-obituary/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">health issues</a>.</p><p>Born in the city of Saku in Nagano Prefecture on May 4, 1970, and raised in Tokyo, Ms. Nakayama — known by the affectionate nickname Miporin — rocketed to fame in 1985, becoming one of Japan’s most successful idols, as popular young entertainers there are known, with the release of her first single, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XCO2EOXuH0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“C</a>.” That same year, she took home a Japan Record Award for best new artist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>She exploded on both the big and small screens that same year with starring roles in the comedy-drama series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10461354/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cdt_t_54" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Maido Osawagase Shimasu”</a> (roughly, “Sorry to Bother You All the Time”) and the film “Bi Bappu Haisukuru” (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVtfBijP7-8&amp;t=1890s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Be-Bop High School”)</a>, an action comedy set on a dystopian campus filled with uniformed schoolgirls and brawling schoolboys.</p><p>Such stories were popular teenage fare at the time, as evidenced by her subsequent role in “Sailor Fuku Hangyaku Doumei” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXsrYwuvQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Sailor Suit Rebel Alliance”),</a> a television series that made its debut in 1986, in which Ms. Nakayama played a member of a group of martial arts-savvy girls who squared off against wrongdoers at a violence-marred high school.</p><p>She starred in the popular Japanese comedy series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1973541/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cdt_t_47" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Mama wa Aidoru!”</a> (“Mama Is an Idol!”), about a widowed high school teacher who marries a pop star, which ran for one season in 1987, and the 1989 romantic comedy series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13260696/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cdt_t_42" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Kimi no Hitomi ni Koishiteru!”</a> (roughly, “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You”).</p><p>But it was singing that established her as a star, something of a Japanese Britney Spears.
