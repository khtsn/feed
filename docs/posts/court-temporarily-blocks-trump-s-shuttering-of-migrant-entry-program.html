    <h1>Court Temporarily Blocks Trump’s Shuttering of Migrant Entry Program</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“This ruling is a victory not just for our clients and those like them, but anyone who cherishes the freedom to welcome,” said Karen Tumlin, the director of the Justice Action Center, an immigrant advocacy group. “Our clients — and our class members — have done everything the government asked of them, and we’re gratified to see that the court will not allow the government to fail to uphold its side of the bargain.”</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The judge’s decision came as the Trump administration has moved to end legal protections for migrants from many countries, including by shutting down a program granting legal status to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/us/politics/trump-tps-afghanistan-cameroon.html" title="">Afghan and Cameroonian migrants</a>. A separate effort to revoke Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans in the United States was also blocked by a federal judge.</p><p>The Biden-era program allowed more migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti to fly into the United States and stay temporarily with access to work permits if they had a financial sponsor and passed security checks. They were allowed to stay for up to two years.</p><p>More than 500,000 migrants entered the country under the program. Biden officials said it was part of an effort to deter migrants from those countries from crossing into the country illegally, and encourage a legal pathway instead.</p><p>Trump officials, announcing the move to end the program last month, said the program added to immigration problems in the United States by granting some protections to “a substantial population of aliens in the interior of the United States without a clear path to a durable status.”</p></div></div>
