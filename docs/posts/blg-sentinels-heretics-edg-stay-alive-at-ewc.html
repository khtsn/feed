</span>, G2 played with assistant coach <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/6899/shhhack">

</span> in place of <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/7873/leaf">

</span>, while BLG ran the same roster that won them <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/512237/funplus-phoenix-edg-starts-vct-china-stage-2-off-strong" target="_blank">their first match in VCT China 2025 Stage 2</a>.</p>

<p>That substitution couldn&#39;t be more evident in the first map for G2, as it was truly dominant for BLG. Despite both teams running relatively normal compositions for Sunset, it was a masterclass for <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/10698/nephh">
		nephh	</a>
</span> on KAY/O to help BLG reach the half up 10-2. When G2 lost the second pistol, it was only a matter of time for BLG, as they won Sunset quickly, 13-3.</p>

<p>Pearl was next, but this time it was a reversal of momentum between the two teams. Moving shhhack onto Killjoy seemed to pay dividends for G2, as they decided to run a Tejo composition and give BLG the strong taste of defeat. The half ended 9-3 for G2, and they won the second pistol to quickly end the map 13-4 and tie the series 1-1.</p>

<p>It all came down to Icebox, which ended up as the most entertaining map of the series. G2 ran their version of the no-Duelist Sage composition that FNATIC popularized in 2025, while BLG ran the Harbor composition with <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4885/whzy">
		whzy	</a>
</span> on Jett, which is where he shines most. Even as G2 ended the half up 7-5 with <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/15500/trent">

</span> popping off on Sova, BLG matched and surpassed G2 on their defense side. </p>

<p><em>whzy gets two big kills to win map three and eliminate G2.</em></p>

<p>It was whzy who ended up getting BLG over the edge as they won the map 13-11 and the series 2-1, eliminating G2 from the EWC.</p>

<p>With this win, BLG will face Karmine Corp for both teams&#39; final chance to make it to the EWC playoffs.</p>



<p>In a similar fashion to Group A, Group B also had two Masters Toronto teams looking to stay alive, while one of them ran a coach on their starting roster. This time around, it was XLG, who were still trying to fill in the hole that YOU left, using hvoya for the EWC. </p>

<p>The series began on Lotus, with Sentinels running their Vyse composition to face off against the double Duelist from XLG. Despite losing the pistol, Sentinels were in form to begin the series, especially <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4004/zekken">
		zekken	</a>
</span>. On Raze, zekken ended his attack half a perfect 5-0 on first kills to first deaths, leading to a 7-5 lead at the half. Then, on the defense side, it was <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3880/bang">
		bang	</a>
</span> who stepped up to prevent any runs from XLG. Sentinels won the second pistol, and despite losing the bonus, were able to cleanly end map one 13-9 to take the series lead.</p>

<p>Sunset was next, and XLG decided to put everyone in their comfort roles, with <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/1348/hvoya">
		hvoya	</a>
</span> filling in on Deadlock. Sentinels ran their standard Sunset composition, but their attack struggled against the double Sentinel from XLG. <span data-ref-id="17">

<p><em>happywei gets aggressive on the retake to win a round for XLG.</em></p>

<p>Then, when the sides swapped, it was all in for XLG. The recent regional champs got the pistol round, and even after losing their bonus, ended the map 13-8 to take the series to map three.</p>

<p>That left the series on Haven, where Sentinels pulled out the Viper pick. Despite some strong efforts from XLG, Sentinels won the pistol and looked right back in form, just like their map one performance. Once again, it was zekken on the attack side that took the team to an 8-4 lead, and bang on the defense side to close out the map 13-9 and win the series 2-1. </p>

<p>With this win, Sentinels will face <span data-ref-id="20">

</span> to see which team makes it out of Group B to the playoff stage of the EWC.</p>



<p>This matchup in Group C, on paper, was one of the most expected wins of the tournament so far. Team Heretics, one of the best teams from EMEA trying to make up for some poor international performances, faced off against Titan Esports Club, a VCT China team that has yet to make an VCT international tournament.</p>

<p>That made it all the more surprising when TEC won first pistol and entered the first half of Icebox up 7-5. Even as Heretics won the second pistol, <span data-ref-id="21">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/7841/tvirusluke">
		TvirusLuke	</a>
</span> stomped over Heretics to quickly get the lead right back. Then, just as Heretics threatened to tie the game late, <span data-ref-id="22">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4720/haodong">
		Haodong	</a>
</span> started to frag to stop the EMEA team right in their tracks. It was <span data-ref-id="23">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/47629/coco">
		Coco	</a>
</span> with three kills to secure Icebox 13-10 to put all the pressure on Heretics.</p>

<p><em>coco gets three kills to win Icebox for TEC over Heretics.</em></p>

<p>Haven was next, and Heretics decided to run their double Duelist with Wo0t on Iso, winning pistol. The confidence from Heretics looked much improved on Haven, taking frequent aggressive duels on the defense side with <span data-ref-id="24">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/21328/wo0t">
		Wo0t	</a>
</span> as the spearhead. <span data-ref-id="25">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/1144/boo">
		Boo	</a>
</span> even joined the fun with an ace on round eight, helping Heretics end the half up 9-3. </p>

<p>TEC won the second pistol to start hinting at a comeback, and converted the bonus to make it possible. Both Haodong and <span data-ref-id="26">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/19677/lucas">
		lucas	</a>
</span> were pulling some amazing rounds out of seemingly nowhere, tying the map at 11-11. Once again, lucas landed a clutch shock dart to give TEC their first lead of the map, but <span data-ref-id="27">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/10971/riens">
		RieNs	</a>
</span> calmly won a 1v2 to take the map to overtime. It looked like the defenders were going to win to extend OT, but RieNs once again was smart to close out the map 14-12 and take the series to map three.</p>

<p>The deciding map was Sunset, a map that Team Heretics was dominant on when it was first released in pro play. To try and beat it, TEC ran their Deadlock composition, and won the first pistol to start the defense off right. TEC was unable to convert the bonus, and then the half started slipping away. Heretics were quick to reach six round wins, and it took a lucas ace to stop the bleeding. Even then, Heretics entered the half up 8-4, and converted the second pistol to put the squeeze on TEC.</p>

<p>TEC were able to stop Heretics from converting the bonus, but that was the last notable round win they had at EWC. Heretics were able to complete the map 13-6 and win the series 2-1, eliminating TEC from the tournament.</p>

<p>With this win, Heretics will face <span data-ref-id="28">

</span> in the final game of Group C.</p>



<p>The series began with a banger of a Haven match, as EDG were constantly trying to outsmart the double Duelist from 100 Thieves. <span data-ref-id="29">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/601/asuna">

</span> on Neon was frying early on, as <span data-ref-id="30">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4147/cryocells">
		Cryocells	</a>
</span> on Yoru only got better as the match stretched in the second half. EDG was down 8-4 at the half, and <span data-ref-id="31">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> tried his best to bring the game back, but 100 Thieves closed it out 13-11 by winning a 2v4 post-plant.</p>

<p>Next up was Sunset, but even with their roster changes, this is still a great map for EDG. ZmjjKK on Neon was able to take more fights than on Haven, and nobody hit some nasty shots to enter the half up 7-5 despite losing the first pistol. EDG was able to win the second bonus to reach double-digit rounds, and the rest of their defense was near immaculate as they quickly won 13-7 and tied the series.</p>

<p><em>EDG uses flanks on flanks to defeat 100T handily on Sunset.</em></p>

<p>The series all came down to Ascent, with EDG surprising by choosing Waylay and winning the first pistol off a great performance from <span data-ref-id="32">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span>. EDG nearly ran away with the attack side, but Zander had some amazing rounds to win 100T their first defense rounds on Ascent. That bought time for Cryo to get an Operator, but ZmjjKK quickly got rid of it. He was on fire to start Ascent, helping EDG win seven attack-side rounds at the half. </p>

<p>100T would have to match that firepower on their attack to stay alive, but nobody clutched the pistol 1v1 to put EDG far ahead. It looked like a clear victory up 11-7, but 100 Thieves slowly but surely started to pull the game within reach, thanks to some clutches from Asuna and some smart calls from <span data-ref-id="33">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/604/boostio">
		Boostio	</a>
</span>. However, one fast flood from EDG was all they needed, and the former champs won Ascent 13-10 and the series 2-1.</p>

<p>With the win, EDG will face <span data-ref-id="34">
