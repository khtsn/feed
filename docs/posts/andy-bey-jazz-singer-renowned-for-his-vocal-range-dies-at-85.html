He was 85.</p><p>His nephew, Darius de Haas, confirmed the death, at a retirement home.</p><p>Mr. Bey’s life in jazz spanned over 60 years, from his early days as a child prodigy singing in Newark and at the Apollo Theater in Manhattan, to a late-career run of albums and lengthy tours that kept him active well into his eighth decade.</p><p>The sheer reach of his voice, and his expert control over it, could astound audiences. Not only could he climb from a deep baritone to a crisp tenor, but he could also do it while jumping ahead of the beat, or slowing to a crawl behind it, giving even well-worn songs his personal stamp.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybbv-HFBsMg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">At a typical show</a>, he might start out singing and playing piano, alongside a bass and drums, then switch between them, sometimes singing without piano, sometimes playing the piano alone.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Bey performed as part of the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival at Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem in August 2015.

But as a singer you have to be willing to take it. For me it’s like a cleanser.”</p><p>Mr. Bey went far beyond jazz, looping in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFQIctnU-pA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blues</a>, R&amp;B and soul, whether performing standards or his own compositions. Later in his career, he became known for his rendition of “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nick+drake+river+song+andy+bey&amp;sca_esv=cf65d87ff3121f3e&amp;ei=-SERaNPsEMqm5NoPj4X1kAk&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTzZfl9v2MAxVKE1kFHY9CHZIQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=nick+drake+river+song+andy+bey&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiHm5pY2sgZHJha2Ugcml2ZXIgc29uZyBhbmR5IGJleTIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGJ8FSMcNUMYBWKQMcAF4AZABAJgBbqABpgaqAQM3LjK4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgqgAtEGwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR8ICBhAAGBYYHsICCBAAGBYYChgewgILEAAYgAQYhgMYigXCAggQABiABBiiBMICBRAAGO8FwgIFECEYqwKYAwCIBgGQBgiSBwM4LjKgB6hDsgcDNy4yuAfMBg&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:8e0cdbcb,vid:i4KOyrFSWJM,st:0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">River Man</a>” (1969) by the British folk-rock musician Nick Drake.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>He liked to say that he had four careers, one after the other.

He worked with jazz artists like Sonny Rollins and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/19/arts/music/horace-silver-85-master-of-earthy-jazz-is-dead.html" title="">Horace Silver</a>, and spent long stints in Europe.</p><p>It was not until 1996 that he released his next solo album in the United States, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjhe5DGBMx8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Ballads, Blues &amp; Bey.”</a> By then, the industry had largely forgotten him — 25 record companies turned him down before Evidence, a small jazz label, said yes. (In 1991, he recorded an album called “As Time Goes By,” on Jazzette, a Yugoslavian label.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>When Mr. Bey released this album in 1996, the industry had largely forgotten him. But it proved to be a success. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Ballads” was a success, and led to a career renaissance. Mr. Bey had lost none of his vocal range; if anything, his voice had taken on a smooth patina. He released seven more albums over the next 18 years, received two Grammy nominations and became a fixture on the global jazz-club circuit.</p><p>“The attention doesn’t surprise me, because I believe I deserve it,” he told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1999. “But I didn’t realize I’d get this much attention. I’ve been an underground figure, or a cult figure, all these years. An acquired taste, as some writers have called me.”</p><p>Andrew Wideman Bey Jr. was born on Oct. 28, 1939, in Newark. His father, a window washer born Andrew Wideman, was an adherent of the Moorish Science Temple of America, an offshoot of Islam, and followed its practice of adopting Bey as a surname. His son kept the surname but did not share his father’s faith.</p><p>His mother, Victoria (Johnson) Wideman, raised Andy and his eight older siblings.</p><p>He is survived by his sister Geraldine (Bey) de Haas.</p><p>At 3, Andy was already teaching himself to play boogie-woogie piano, and at 8 he was singing shows alongside the saxophonist Hank Mobley. His singing in venues around Newark caught the attention of record labels, and he released his first solo album, “Mama’s Little Boy’s Got the Blues,” when he was 13, in 1952.</p><p>He was no doubt gifted with preternatural talent, but he was also surrounded by a musical family and a close-knit community in Newark that produced jazz stars like the singer Sarah Vaughan and the saxophonist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/02/arts/music/wayne-shorter-dead.html" title="">Wayne Shorter</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Bey credited his high vocal range to his decade-long run alongside his sisters, though he also closely modeled his style on Vaughan and Nat King Cole.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Bey in Paris in 1997.

He’s still the one for me.”</p><p>Just before releasing “Ballads, Blues &amp; Bey,” Mr. Bey revealed that he was gay. He had never hidden his sexuality, but he decided to publicize it after he found out he was H.I.V. positive.</p><p>In a way, his sexuality only added to his uniqueness as a Black male singer, and an older one at that. His age, he said, made his performances more persuasive.</p><p>“You have to kind of put yourself out there if you’re going to make somebody believe something,” he told The South Florida Sun-Sentinel in 2005. “It’s trying to focus on what the song is saying and hopefully that it communicates something through sound, melody, rhythm — through all those components that help to make great music.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Clay Risen is a Times reporter on the Obituaries desk.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
