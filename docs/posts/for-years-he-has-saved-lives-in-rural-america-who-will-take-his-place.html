This will be a fun call.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Anyone who has spent time in an ambulance with VanCoughnett knows that 14 Grange Avenue is never a fun call. Kevin was Kevin Fuller, a 65-year-old man who would be the first to admit that some days he drinks a few too many beers. He lives with his wife, Valarie, in a second-floor apartment around the corner from the ambulance squad headquarters, and together they call 911 several times a month for a constellation of health concerns.</p><p>VanCoughnett and the other medical workers climbed into the ambulance, drove for a minute and parked in front of a tattered gray house that stands on a crab-grass hill. It was 3 p.m. on a hot Sunday in July, and VanCoughnett’s face turned red the moment he left the air-conditioned ambulance.</p><p>He climbed the narrow back stairway to find Kevin in the living room, face down on the floor. Valarie stood in the opposite corner, arms folded across her chest. As VanCoughnett gave directions, the other medical technicians rolled Kevin onto a stretcher.</p><p>“I’m going to die!” Kevin wailed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From its base in the village of Adams, the rescue squad covers 252 square miles of upstate New York.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Not today, brother,” VanCoughnett said. “This is Bob. You know who I am.”</p><p>He knelt and shined a flashlight into Kevin’s eyes. He took hold of Kevin’s hands and ordered him to squeeze. Kevin’s eyes were unfocused, his squeeze weak.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>VanCoughnett had taken Kevin’s blood pressure dozens of times, and every time he found it was unusually low. On this day Kevin’s systolic blood pressure hit 195, so high that<span>  </span>VanCoughnett feared Kevin had experienced a stroke.</p><p>“If I didn’t know you, Kevin, I might not be as concerned,” he said.</p><p>After decades in an ambulance, he has come to know the medical history of many people in the 252 square miles his squad covers. Even so, the vast distances an ambulance must travel from patients’ homes to the nearest hospital increase the risk that patients will die before they reach an emergency room.</p><p>If it was a stroke, the nearest unit was at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, an hour away by ambulance. Alternately, VanCoughnett could order a medical helicopter to land in the nearby town of Pulaski, pick Kevin up and fly him to Syracuse, shaving 20 minutes off the trip. But he knew that helicopters are finicky — fog in this part of the state can force them to abort.</p><p>In the back of the ambulance, Kevin groaned in pain. Aside from a few clouds, the sky seemed mostly clear. VanCoughnett called for a helicopter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“Let’s go to Pulaski,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At a call for an older man who fell.

Yet VanCoughnett, for all his experience and professionalism as an emergency medical technician, is not paid. Nor were his three assistants in the ambulance. And neither are most emergency responders across much of New York; of the 989 emergency medical providers in the state, 80 percent rely in part or entirely on volunteers, according to a <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/local-government/publications/pdf/ems-report-2024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report published in March</a> by Thomas DiNapoli, the state comptroller.</p><p>Volunteers like VanCoughnett — older adults with flexible jobs and free time — are the lifeblood of rural ambulance corps. As his generation of volunteers retires, rescue squads find that few young people are willing to take their place.</p><p>The result is a staffing crisis that imperils ambulance corps across the country.</p><p>As early as 2007, the <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/11629/emergency-medical-services-at-the-crossroads" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Academy of Medicine warned</a> that rural population decline was causing a shortage of emergency workers. Even before Covid, more than half of all volunteer-based squads in New York <a href="https://ubmdems.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Download-2019-NYS-EMS-Workforce-Report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that a shortage of volunteers was forcing delays in ambulance response times; nearly a third of agencies had to turn down calls entirely.</p><p>Losses accelerated after the pandemic. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NorthshoreVolunteerEmergencySquad/posts/pfbid0L114J83jEYD4a9KYuMDxva7sNvMm1KYLiCwUbMy3M98SZDvr2wKPtAMN57Mjfq3Yl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Some agencies closed</a>. Black River Ambulance Squad, far upstate, survives by the effort of a single aging retiree.</p><p>“It is a crisis,” DiNapoli said.</p><p>Bob VanCoughnett is 60. He responded to 230 emergency calls last year. If he’s lucky, he thinks, maybe he can keep taking ambulance calls for another five years. When he started, in 2004, several volunteers donated that much time. Today, many young people volunteer just eight hours a week, the minimum required by the squad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-14"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>To many new recruits, following VanCoughnett’s example is unfathomable. Dawson Reardon is a 19-year-old who joined the squad in May. He leaves his full-time job washing dishes in the cafeteria of an assisted-living facility to volunteer 10 hours a week, hoping to gain experience for a career as a paid paramedic. He only learned about VanCoughnett’s situation in July, after helping transport a patient with chest pains to Samaritan Medical Center in Watertown.</p><p>“Wait, Bob’s a volunteer?” he asked when VanCoughnett was out of earshot. “He does all this work for no money? Whoa. That’s insane.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In addition to the many hours VanCoughnett spends in the ambulance, he also helps coach a variety of sports, including his grandsons’ baseball team.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-55bfaa93">‘Could have become a doctor’</h2><p>Bob VanCoughnett (pronounced van-COE-nit) grew up on a dairy farm with 70 cows on 150 acres of green hillside overlooking Sandy Creek, three miles upstream of Adams. By age 10, he was joining his parents before sunrise every morning to start the milking. At 17, when he was a senior and a linebacker for the Adams High School football team, his father leased a neighboring farm, Bob used his savings to buy 45 cows, and the family ran both farms simultaneously. He quit farming four years later, in 1985, pushed out by the ever-dropping price of milk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He got a job at a local company driving trucks and rose to become the district manager, overseeing an empire of rock quarries and concrete plants. The schedule was demanding but flexible, allowing him to coach and referee the football, baseball, softball and basketball teams of his son and two daughters.</p><p>As the assistant coach of the Adams High School football team for 12 years, VanCoughnett became friends with the medical teams assigned to work the games in case of a health emergency, and in 2004 he decided to join his local ambulance squad.</p><p>“He’s so smart,” said Cindy VanCoughnett, Bob’s wife of 42 years. “If he’d liked school, he could have become a doctor.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The VanCoughnett family farm near Adams, N.Y.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>He arrived just before the volunteer crisis began. In the years after World War II, people in rural communities <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/download/11629" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">across the country</a> who needed emergency medical care were usually transported to the hospital by funeral home directors, whose hearses were capable of carrying people on stretchers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>As the number of ambulance calls increased, many undertakers stopped making hospital runs. So in 1969, people in Adams created the South Jefferson Rescue Squad. They purchased a Cadillac station wagon and outfitted it with rudimentary medical supplies, said Bob Simpson, who led the effort to create the squad.</p><p>“We could bandage people up, we could splint them,” said Simpson, 76, who became the squad’s first chief. “It was a ride to the hospital, lying down.”</p><p>The quality of care grew steadily, as did demands placed on volunteers, who are expected to pay for their own education. Between getting his own certifications and teaching others, VanCoughnett has logged thousands of hours in training. He and his crew are expected to be confident inserting IVs, giving drugs and using defibrillators to restart patients’ hearts.</p><p>The latest protocols for basic life support in New York State stretch to 115 pages.</p><p>“You can’t keep all this stuff in your head,” VanCoughnett said — especially volunteers who work only one shift a week. “That’s why I drill these kids constantly.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The South Jefferson Rescue Squad at the Adams Fourth of July parade.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>The July 4 holiday was surprisingly quiet except for a call to a beach party on Lake Ontario, where the drummer in a cover band reported feeling dizzy. During the ambulance ride from the party to the hospital, VanCoughnett introduced the drummer to Seth Strader, 18, one of the squad’s newest volunteers.</p><p>“Seth is here as my protégé,” VanCoughnett said. “Hopefully he’ll be taking over for me someday.”</p><p>Strader smiled and shook his head. He wouldn’t be in the squad for long. On his 20th birthday, he hopes to become a New York State trooper.</p><p>Volunteering, Strader said, makes him a better candidate.</p><p>“It gives me a step up on the totem pole,” he said.</p><p>The ambulance deposited the drummer at the hospital and returned to base at 8:33 p.m. VanCoughnett drove to his home, a double-wide trailer he built in 1985 on his father’s farm, where he waits for the next emergency while on call. He collapsed into bed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Fourth of July call at a beach party on Lake Ontario.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Four hours later he awoke to radio squawk. He drove back to base, rounded up a couple of volunteers, and took the ambulance to a trailer home south of Adams, where James Groff lay prone on the living room carpet, wearing only underwear and white compression socks.</p><p>“Are you out of Adams?” asked Groff, whom VanCoughnett remembered as the once-strapping janitor at Adams High School.</p><p>“Yeah, you know me,” VanCoughnett said as he strategized how to get the patient from the floor to a blue recliner. “Everybody knows me. Are you related to Gary?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Groff said. “That’s my nephew.”</p><p>The volunteers lifted Groff into his recliner, satisfied he would be OK for the night.</p><p>“He was a guy who’d cut his own leg off before he’d call anyone for help,” VanCoughnett said when he returned to the ambulance. “That’s why I do this. This is the most vulnerable moment of his life. And a strong, proud guy like that knows he can call us, and we’ll come and help him.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>VanCoughnett headed home to sleep. Before he could get there, the next call hit: a one-car accident on a gravel road outside the no-stoplight town of Lorraine, N.Y. He arrived to find a red Jeep jammed into the trees. The driver was a little banged up but otherwise fine.</p><p>VanCoughnett chatted with her and the friends who’d arrived to pick her up.</p><p>“There’s Bob, running for mayor,” Strader said. </p><p>VanCoughnett turned to a young firefighter at the scene. He had trained her in basic emergency medicine.</p><p>“So,” he asked, “when are you going to start running calls with us?” It was 3:30 in the morning. “I’ll make you famous.”</p><p>The firefighter smiled, but she said nothing. The ambulance returned to headquarters at 4:08, too late for VanCoughnett to get any more sleep before his workday at the concrete plant started. Instead he filled out paperwork on the night’s calls and drove to the Stewart’s convenience store in Adams for a 24-ounce cup of black tea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>Then he drove to a second Stewart’s in Black River, 40 minutes closer to the concrete factory, to pick up his usual: ham-sausage-bacon-and-egg sandwich, hold the bread.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The South Jefferson Rescue Squad covers five townships — though its range grows when neighboring ambulance crews go on vacation or are short of staff.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>By 7 a.m. VanCoughnett was on the job at the Cranesville Block Company, trying to diagnose why the engines on his new trucks kept failing.</p><p>“I guess I’ll forgo the fork this morning,” he said, picking up the breakfast with his fingers. “We’ve got to just get this done.”</p><p>VanCoughnett’s schedule did not relent. After tracing the engine failures to an exhaust system sensor, he ordered a worker to test the plant’s latest batch of concrete for the correct mix of softness and solidity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>“Too much water kills it,” he said. “Concrete is not forgiving.”</p><p>At the end of the workday, VanCoughnett drove to the family farm, where his daughter Jessica and his son, Justin, have built homes on either side of his own. He was helping Justin install the electrical wiring needed to turn the farm’s old hay barn into an event hall. After VanCoughnett worked in the open sun, his normally gravelly voice deepened into a grumble. He was annoyed by the heat, the tangle of wires, his lack of sleep.</p><p>Cindy VanCoughnett stood in the shade of the barn and smiled at her husband.</p><p>“Bob’s a softy,” she said. “He’ll never admit it, but he is. He takes care of the kittens when they need to be bottle-fed.”</p><p>VanCoughnett walked into the barn and guzzled a bottle of water. His mood brightened. Then he left for baseball practice, where he helped Jessica coach a team that included his grandsons Landon, 10, and Jackson, 8. He was by turns gentle and grouchy, displeased by the sight of Jackson sitting cross-legged at second base, combing the grass for worms.</p><p>“Get off the ground!” VanCoughnett barked.</p><p>This was followed by pitching practice, where he taught the boys to end their throws with their right hands tapping their left knees.</p><p>“Throw it nice and soft,” he said. “We’re not trying to kill anybody.”</p><p>Sweaty, sleepy and happy, VanCoughnett finished practice and walked slowly to his white pickup, reflecting on his last two days — 36 hours of concrete, baseball and emergency medicine, and maybe four hours of sleep.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-39"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>VanCoughnett at his day job at the Cranesville Block Company, in Felts Mills, N.Y.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>“It’s better than being at home and doing nothing for two hours,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-41766d34">‘It was terrifying’</h2><p>VanCoughnett thinks of himself as a former athlete and a retired farmer, and when he’s spending time with his family or his concrete truck drivers, those sides of him — gruff, competitive — come out. (A running challenge in the VanCoughnett family is to see which member can put the most miles on their vehicle in a year.) But when he’s in the back of an ambulance, he slows down, speaks softly, looks patients in the eye and smiles. </p><p>It helps that he’s been a patient himself. On Nov. 4, 2020, VanCoughnett woke up early, as he always does. He opened his phone and saw the bad news: it looked like Donald Trump, his candidate, was going to lose the election.</p><p>The left side of VanCoughnett’s body went limp. He sat down in a chair in his living room and had a massive stroke. His own ambulance squad came and saved his life. VanCoughnett likes to joke about “watching these bozos shove me into the back of a helicopter” bound for SUNY Upstate.</p><p>“It was terrifying,” he said. “I got pretty lucky there.”</p><p>A week after the stroke, VanCoughnett went back to work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>Four years later, Kevin Fuller experienced the same weakness in his left arm and leg. VanCoughnett knew Kevin as a lifelong carpenter in town whose sons played on VanCoughnett’s football and Little League teams.</p><p>Both men can seem dour. So as the ambulance sped down Interstate 81, toward a helicopter and the same hospital that saved his life, VanCoughnett talked tough, but his eyes stayed gentle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-43"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>James Groff having his blood pressure checked. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>“You’re gagging me!” Kevin said as VanCoughnett readjusted a pillow, trying to make Kevin more comfortable.</p><p>“All right, this is Bob you’re talking to,” he said. “You know better. I’m not gagging you.”</p><p>“I don’t care who you are,” Kevin said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>VanCoughnett laughed. “You will in a minute!” he said.</p><p>At the helicopter pad in Pulaski, VanCoughnett braced Kevin’s head with his hands as the paramedics rolled the stretcher to the helicopter. Kevin was pushed inside. The blades dipped, the engine whine crescendoed to a roar and the helicopter lifted off gingerly. (Doctors at Upstate Medical would determine that Kevin had suffered a minor stroke; within weeks he had recovered fully.)</p><p>VanCoughnett, red-faced and sweating in the heat, treated his fellow volunteers to bottles of water and soda at a nearby Stewart’s. Then he invited them to the farm, where his wife and daughter had prepared a picnic lunch.</p><p>They arrived in the ambulance. Just as the volunteers loaded their paper plates with hamburgers and potato salad, the radio squawked again — another emergency call. Bob VanCoughnett set his plate down and walked toward the ambulance. His wife smiled, telling the younger volunteers not to worry.</p><p>“This is our life,” she said. “Go!
