The conflict has slowly been heating up since late last year after the end of the rainy season. With the escalating deaths, injuries and attacks on civilians, activists have been calling on the United Nations to deploy a peacekeeping mission in the country.</p><p>In January, the army captured a strategic oil refinery north of Khartoum and broke the siege on its main headquarters in central Khartoum.</p><p>The army chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sudanese.armed.forces/posts/pfbid0o7QeVDwUG7VqUmBSJg9VuEiLCXfHCL3iQ6mh84UxGjrf9qk3j8RruLvF4hH2QUael" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visited the facility</a> days later, and promised to remove the paramilitary forces from “every corner of Sudan.”</p><p>But even as army officers celebrated their victory, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights accused fighters and militia allied with them of <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/01/sudan-un-human-rights-chief-alarmed-summary-executions-khartoum-north" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summarily executing</a> at least 18 people in the newly liberated areas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Fighting has also escalated in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/world/africa/sudan-war.html" title="">Omdurman</a>, a city across the Nile from the capital that is home to about 2.4 million people and is Sudan’s second-largest city. Sudan’s Health Ministry said that at least 54 people were killed and 158 others injured on Saturday when the paramilitary forces shelled a busy market there.</p><p>Just days later, on Tuesday, the ministry said that six people were killed and 38 others were wounded when mortar shells hit a main hospital that was already treating people who had been injured in the fighting.</p><p>Fierce clashes have also ensued this week in South Kordofan, which shares a border with South Sudan, and Blue Nile states, where millions were already facing dire humanitarian crises.</p><p>In Kadugli city in South Kordofan, the latest infighting has left at least 80 people dead, the <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/protect-civilians-trapped-crisis-south-kordofan-and-blue-nile-statement-united-nations-resident-and-humanitarian-coordinator-sudan-clementine-nkweta-salami" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Nations said</a> this week.</p><p>Mr. Musa, who lives in the city, said many people did not have access to adequate food or medicine. Workers were unable to receive their salaries, he said, and many families had limited cash, especially after Sudan introduced new bank notes last month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Clashes have continued all over the city, he said, and the thud of shelling and gunfire had forced many people to hunker down.</p><p>“Kadugli is currently an active zone,” Mr. Musa said, adding the whole situation was “tragic.”</p><p>The western region of Darfur has also been the site of intense clashes recently, an agonizing reprise for an area that experienced a genocide just over two decades ago.</p><p>Since the beginning of the conflict, the paramilitary forces, or the R.S.F., and their allies have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/world/africa/war-sudan-darfur-region.html" title="">ratcheted up attacks</a> in the region and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/world/africa/sudan-darfur-fighting.html" title="">consolidated their control</a> over major cities.</p><p>They also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/19/world/africa/sudan-darfur-siege.html" title="">laid siege to El Fasher</a>, the capital of North Darfur, where they have been clashing with the army and its allies. An attack on the only functioning hospital in El Fasher in late January killed 70 people and injured 19 others, according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization.</p><p>Fighting across the region has also <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-conflict-al-fasher-north-darfur-flash-update-no-01-12-may-2024-enar" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">displaced</a> hundreds of <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/dtm-sudan-flash-alert-conflict-nyala-janoub-nyala-town-south-darfur-update-023-06-february-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">families</a>, according to the United Nations, pushing some of them to <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/dtm-sudan-flash-alert-tina-tina-town-north-darfur-update-001-06-february-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flee across the border</a> into Chad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The latest conflict has not spared children. At least 40 children were killed in just three days this month, UNICEF said this week.</p><p>“As the conflict persists, children’s lives and futures hang in the balance and for their sakes, the violence must end immediately,” the UNICEF Sudan representative, Annmarie Swai, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/least-40-children-reportedly-killed-three-days-across-sudan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>For now, the warring sides insist that they can ultimately quash the other.</p><p>Despite incurring losses in the capital, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, the paramilitary leader, delivered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odC9uBboWEE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recorded video speech</a> last week in which he sought to restore sagging morale among his forces and promised to seize fresh territory.</p><p>“We must think of what we intend to take,” he said. “Look forward and not backward.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Abdi Latif Dahir is the East Africa correspondent for The Times, based in Nairobi, Kenya.
