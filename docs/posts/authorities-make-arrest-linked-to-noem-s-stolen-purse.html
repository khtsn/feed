    <h1>Authorities Make Arrest Linked to Noem’s Stolen Purse</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Investigators have arrested a person accused of being involved in the theft of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s handbag at an upscale Washington hamburger restaurant last weekend, the Secret Service said Sunday.</p><p>Matt McCool, a special agent at the Secret Service, said in a statement that the suspect did not seem to have targeted Ms. Noem because of her position. He did not release the suspect’s name, but he described the person as “a serial offender” who had tried to use Ms. Noem’s credit card and gain access to her electronic devices.</p><p>Ms. Noem’s purse was snatched from underneath her chair on April 20, Easter Sunday, as she dined with her family at The Capital Burger in downtown Washington. The bag contained the secretary’s driver’s license, medication, apartment keys, blank checks, department badge, passport and $3,000 in cash.</p><p>Ms. Noem’s spokeswoman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/kristi-noem-handbag-stolen.html" title="">previously said</a> that the thief had hooked the secretary’s bag with his foot, dragged it across the floor and put a coat over it before leaving the restaurant. Although several Secret Service agents were accompanying Ms. Noem, they were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/noem-stolen-purse-homeland-security.html" title="">more than 20 feet away</a> from her at the time to give her privacy to enjoy a meal with her family.</p></div></div>
