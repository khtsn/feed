    <h1>The Largest Immigration Surge in U.S. History</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>My colleagues and I worked with government officials and outside experts in recent weeks to analyze the magnitude of the recent immigration surge in the United States. We published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/briefing/recent-immigration-surge-has-been-largest-in-us-history.html" title="">the results of that analysis</a> this morning.</p><p>In today’s newsletter, I’ll give you seven highlights, with help from charts by Albert Sun, a graphics editor at The Times.</p><p><strong>1. The immigration surge since 2021 has been the largest in U.S. history</strong>, surpassing even the levels of the late 1800s and early 1900s. Total net migration — the number of people coming to the country minus the number leaving — will likely exceed eight million people over the past four years, government statistics suggest. That number includes both legal and illegal immigration.</p><p>Never before has annual net migration been close to two million for an extended period, according to data from the Census Bureau and the Congressional Budget Office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><strong>2. Even after adjusting for today’s larger population, the surge is slightly larger than that during the peak years of Ellis Island traffic</strong>, when millions of Europeans came to the United States. This chart tells that story:</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>3. The share of the U.S. population born in another country has reached a record high as a result. </strong>That share hit 15.2 percent in the summer of 2023 (and continued rising over the past 18 months). The previous high of 14.8 percent occurred in 1890, and the share remained high for decades afterward.</p><p>It began to decline after the passage of a tough immigration law in 1924. That restrictive era lasted until 1965, when a new law expanded immigration. (On a recent episode of “The Daily,” Michael Barbaro and I told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/podcasts/the-daily/election-immigration.html" title="">the story of that 1965 law</a> and its unintended consequences.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><strong>4. President Biden’s welcoming immigration policy has been the main reason for the recent surge. </strong>During his 2020 campaign, Biden encouraged more people to come to the U.S., and he loosened several policies after taking office.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Biden administration officials sometimes argue that outside events, such as the turmoil in Haiti, Ukraine and Venezuela, have been the main cause of the surge, and those events did play a role. But the sharp decline of migration levels since this past summer — when Biden tightened the rules — indicates that the administration’s policies were the biggest factor:</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>5. More than half of net migration since 2021 has been among people who entered the country illegally. </strong>Of the roughly eight million net migrants who came to the U.S. over the past four years, about five million — or 62 percent — were unauthorized, according to an estimate by Goldman Sachs.</p><p><strong>6. The unprecedented scale of recent immigration helps explain why the issue played such a big role in the 2024 election. </strong>Polls showed that the sharp rise in immigration was unpopular with most Americans, especially among working-class voters, some of whom complained of strained social services, crowded schools and increased homelessness.</p><p>The issue appears to have been Kamala Harris’s second biggest vulnerability, after only the economy. Donald Trump made striking gains near the border in Texas, winning six counties along the Rio Grande that he lost badly only eight years ago. And Democrats who outpaced Harris and won tough congressional races — in Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, New York and elsewhere — often criticized Biden’s immigration policies.</p><p><strong>7. The recent immigration surge has probably ended. </strong>Trump has promised to impose even tougher border rules next year than Biden recently imposed. Trump also campaigned on a plan to deport millions of immigrants who entered the country illegally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>It remains unclear how far Trump will go and whether his plan will remain popular once he begins to implement it. Either way, the pace at which immigrants enter the U.S. has already fallen significantly from the peak levels of 2022 and 2023 and may continue to fall after Trump takes office. Historically, in both the U.S. and other countries, very high levels of immigration often cause a political backlash that leads to new restrictions.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/briefing/recent-immigration-surge-has-been-largest-in-us-history.html" title="">Our full story includes more details</a>, including an explanation of why experts believe recent census numbers underestimate the size of the immigration surge.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Democratic governors are resisting parts of Trump’s deportation agenda. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/democrats-trump-immigration-crackdown.html" title="">But they’re offering to help him</a> enact stricter border control and deport people convicted of crimes.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-38b9f1">Syria</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At a Damascus prison morgue.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><ul><li><p>Syrians are searching prisons for disappeared family members. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/syria-prisoners-dead.html" title="">Some are finding their bodies</a>.</p></li><li><p>The rebels who overthrew Syria’s Assad government vowed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-justice.html" title="">punish officials implicated in torture</a>, but promised an amnesty for rank-and-file soldiers.</p></li><li><p>Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria.html" title="">destroyed Syria’s navy</a>, officials said.
