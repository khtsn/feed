Putin of Russia said Wednesday that he planned to lower the threshold for his country’s use of nuclear weapons, an escalation in the Kremlin’s efforts to deter the United States from expanding its military aid to Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Putin, in a televised meeting with top officials, said Russia would adjust its nuclear doctrine — the document defining when the country could use nuclear weapons — to address “new sources of military threats and risks.”</p><p>In particular, Mr. Putin said, Russia would treat “aggression against Russia by any nonnuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state” as a “joint attack on the Russian Federation.” The language was a clear reference to Ukraine, which does not have nuclear weapons, and the military support it receives from nuclear-armed NATO countries like the United States and Britain. </p><p>Mr. Putin also said that Russia would be prepared to use a nuclear weapon even in response to an attack carried out with conventional weapons that creates “a critical threat to our sovereignty.” Ukraine last month pressed a cross-border offensive that captured territory in Russia for the first time since the war began and has been lobbying Washington for permission to use Western missiles for strikes deep into Russian territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The debate over the threat of Russian nuclear use has come to a head this week with a visit by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to the United States, in which he has kept up that lobbying effort to use Western missiles against targets deep inside Russia. Mr. Putin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/europe/putin-warning-nato-missiles.html" title="">said this month</a> that such a move would “mean that NATO countries — the United States and European countries — are at war with Russia.”</p><p>On Wednesday, the Russian leader said that Moscow would consider nuclear use if it detected the start of a massive launch of missiles, aircraft or drones against it. </p><p>Russia’s <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/acts/bank/45562#sel=23:1:2CG,23:39:xpk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">current doctrine</a> says Russia’s nuclear deterrence is directed mainly against countries and alliances that have nuclear weapons. And it has a different phrasing for the kind of conventional attack that could trigger nuclear use, specifying that such an attack must threaten “the very existence of the state.”</p><p>Mr. Putin described the new doctrine as a “draft,” and the Kremlin did not immediately publish it. But given Russia’s autocratic system, Mr. Putin’s description of it in his four-minute, televised remarks appeared virtually certain to be codified.</p><p>Ever since he launched his invasion in February 2022, Mr. Putin has struggled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/world/europe/russia-tactical-nuclear-exercise.html" title="">wield the might of his enormous nuclear arsenal</a> to scare the West into backing down in the war, in which Ukraine is fighting with arms, funds and military intelligence provided by a Western coalition led by the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>For months, Russian analysts have been saying that the West hasn’t been getting Mr. Putin’s message: that, eventually, increased Western aid to Ukraine could lead Russia to use nuclear weapons. In response, Mr. Zelensky, and supporters of Ukraine, have argued that fears of Russian nuclear use are overblown, especially because Russia has not used those weapons despite the repeated ratcheting-up of military capabilities that the West has been providing.</p><p>Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based analyst of Russian nuclear forces, said it was clear the change to the doctrine was being made “for additional deterrence against Ukraine’s Western allies.”</p><p>“There is a lot of room for interpretation for what constitutes aggression and what doesn’t,” Mr. Podvig said in a telephone interview. “But it still lowers the rhetorical threshold for potential use of nuclear weapons.”</p><p>In recent months, as the West has mulled allowing Ukrainian strikes inside Russian territory, Mr. Putin has tried to signal that he was prepared to use nuclear weapons in the conflict — even if he hasn’t used them yet. In May, Russia released footage that it said showed troops conducting drills on the use of tactical nuclear weapons — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/world/europe/russia-tactical-nuclear-exercise.html" title="">smaller-yield bombs that could be used</a> on the battlefield in Ukraine.</p><p>But Mr. Putin and his top officials have also made veiled threats about bombing the United States and its NATO allies. Last week, the chairman of Russia’s lower house of Parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, touted Russia’s new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile in a social media post about a European Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240913IPR23906/meps-ukraine-must-be-able-to-strike-legitimate-military-targets-in-russia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolution</a> calling for Western governments to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike deep inside Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The flight time of the Sarmat missile to Strasbourg is 3 minutes 20 seconds,” Mr. Volodin wrote, referring to the French city where the European Parliament meets.</p><p>The execution, however, has not always lived up to the messaging. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/world/europe/russias-sarmat-missile-test.html" title="">Satellite imagery taken last Saturday showed</a> that a test of the next-generation Sarmat missile ended in a catastrophic failure, with a 200-foot-wide crater at the launch site indicating that the missile had exploded in its silo.</p><p>Despite that failure, there is little doubt that Russia’s nuclear arsenal — deployed on ground-launched missiles, submarines and bombers — wields enormous destructive potential. Mr. Putin appeared to make reference to that arsenal when he announced his invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and warned that any country that tried to interfere with Russia’s actions would face consequences “such as you have never seen in your entire history.”</p><p>Since then, Mr. Putin and his aides have regularly raised the specter of nuclear weapons use — so often, in fact, that Ukrainian officials and some experts say it has muted the effectiveness of the threats. They have yet to stop Ukraine’s allies, for example, from providing ever more sophisticated weaponry with which to battle Moscow’s forces, though the threats may have slowed the pace of that support. </p><p>In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Putin said that specialists at Russia’s Defense Ministry, Foreign Ministry and the Kremlin had spent a year conducting “a deep, comprehensive analysis and assessed the need to adjust our approaches to the possible use of nuclear forces.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It is proposed that aggression against Russia by any nonnuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, be considered as their joint attack on the Russian Federation,” Mr. Putin went on, describing the updated doctrine.</p><p>And he said that an attack against Belarus — Russia’s closest ally, neighboring Ukraine to the north — would also be considered an attack against Russia.</p><p>“We reserve the right to use nuclear weapons in case of aggression against Russia and Belarus,” Mr. Putin said. “Including if the enemy, using conventional weapons, creates a critical threat to our sovereignty.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anton Troianovski is the Moscow bureau chief for The Times.
