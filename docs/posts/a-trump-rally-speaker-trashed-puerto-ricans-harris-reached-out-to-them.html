Trump at Madison Square Garden in New York.</p><p>Before Mr. Trump had even taken the stage, warm-up speakers had called Puerto Rico an “island of garbage,” referred to Ms. Harris as “the devil” and “the Antichrist,” and made racist or derogatory remarks about Latinos generally, African Americans, Palestinians and Jews.</p><p>The remarks at the rally came as Ms. Harris wrapped up a day in Philadelphia, where she spent time courting Pennsylvania’s significant Puerto Rican population by visiting a local Puerto Rican restaurant. While there, she talked about <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fact-Sheet_Puerto-Rico_EN.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new plan she announced on Sunday</a> to bring economic opportunities to Puerto Rico, discussed her visit there after Hurricane Maria, and said that even as a senator she had “felt a need and an obligation” to “make sure Puerto Rico’s needs were met.”</p><p>“This is not a new area of focus for me,” she said. She received a warm reception from the crowd, with chants of “Sí, se puede.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Before the Trump rally on Sunday, Ms. Harris had already taken aim at her Republican rival in <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1850586660662100394" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video message</a> to Puerto Rican voters. She noted that, as president, Mr. Trump had resisted sending aid to the island after back-to-back hurricanes, adding that he had offered nothing but “paper towels and insults.”</p><p>“I will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,” she said.</p><p>The video was widely shared, and the Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny posted it on Instagram. He is one of the biggest recording artists in the world and among the most influential Latino artists. Other celebrities with Puerto Rican backgrounds also shared the video, including Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin.</p><p>“Quite a split screen,” Kevin Munoz, a Harris campaign spokesman, said in a statement, calling the offensive language at the Trump rally “no surprise.” The campaign also sent out a news release titled “All the Crazy Things (So Far) at Trump’s ‘Closing Argument’ Madison Square Garden Rally.”</p><p>The Trump campaign appeared wary of the political fallout from the “island of garbage” remark and other comments. A senior adviser, Danielle Alvarez, said in a statement, “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Fresh off a blitz of star-studded rallies, Ms. Harris focused on retail politicking in Philadelphia on Sunday as her campaign makes its final push to mobilize working-class communities and people of color to the polls.</p><p>In neighborhoods across the city, Ms. Harris delivered tailored messages to different groups of voters as she continued her effort to secure the crucial “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. It was Ms. Harris’s 14th visit to Pennsylvania since she became the Democratic presidential nominee, and her seventh to the Philadelphia area.</p><p>“Victory runs through Philly,” she said while visiting a Black bookstore, Hakim’s Bookstore and Gift Shop.<strong> </strong>“It runs through Pennsylvania.”</p><p>Ms. Harris started the day at a predominantly Black church, where she warned parishioners that “these next nine days will test us,” and brought them to their feet when she told them, “We were born for a time such as this.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><p>transcript</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“These next nine days will test us.

[cheers] And I have faith He is going to carry us forward. And the road ahead won’t be easy. It will require perseverance and hard work.

So let’s spend these next nine days knowing we did everything we could, that we connected with each other, with our neighbors, that we went up to perfect strangers in the grocery store and said: “You know what? I see you.” Let’s approach this moment in a way that in the face of a stranger, we see a neighbor.
