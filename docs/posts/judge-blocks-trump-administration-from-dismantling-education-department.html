Joun of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts was a preliminary injunction, meaning it will remain in force until the case is resolved or a higher court overturns it.</p><p>The injunction was requested by a pair of school districts in Massachusetts, the American Federation of Teachers and 21 Democratic state attorneys general who sued Mr. Trump in March to block his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/trump-education-department.html" title="">executive order</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/nyregion/democratic-attorneys-general-education-department-suit.html" title="">reverse</a> a massive round of layoffs. Judge Joun agreed with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/trump-education-department-lawsuit.html" title="">their argument</a> that the actions equated to an illegal shutdown of the agency, which only Congress can abolish.</p><p>“The record abundantly reveals that defendants’ true intention is to effectively dismantle the department without an authorizing statute,” Judge Joun wrote in his order.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Madi Biedermann, the Education Department’s deputy assistant secretary for communications, said the administration would immediately challenge the decision while taking aim at the judge.</p><p>“Once again, a far-left judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs,” Ms. Biedermann said in a statement. “President Trump and the Senate-confirmed secretary of education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected judge with a political ax to grind.”</p><p>Judge Joun, an Army and National Guard veteran, was a board member of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts before President Biden appointed him to the federal bench in 2022.</p><p>In March, he temporarily ordered the Trump administration to release $65 million in teacher-training grants that had been suspended over Mr. Trump’s efforts to root out diversity, equity and inclusion policies. While an appeals court upheld that order, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/supreme-court-trump-teacher-grants.html" title="">the Supreme Court in April overruled Judge Joun</a> and said that the suspension could remain in place.</p><p>The administration has maintained that firing nearly half of the Education Department’s employees was lawful and aimed at making the agency more efficient and functional. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Linda McMahon, the education secretary, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/linda-mcmahon-house-appropriations.html" title="">told</a> the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday that as many as three-fourths of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-education-department-firings.html" title="">roughly 2,000 staff members who had been fired at her agency</a> had lost their jobs because of downsizing efforts overseen by Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p>About 74 workers had since been rehired, she said.</p><p>Ilana Krepchin, chairwoman of the Somerville School Committee, which is one of the plaintiffs, hailed the ruling as a victory for students, teachers and families.</p><p>“Our public education system is too important to be undermined by actions that threaten our students’ rights and opportunities,” Ms. Krepchin said. “We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that our students’ futures remain bright.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael C.
