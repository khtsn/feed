Trump win the presidency, similar sentiments in New Zealand thrust in the nation’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/world/asia/new-zealand-election-national-wins.html" title="">most conservative government</a> in decades.</p><p>Now, New Zealand bears little resemblance to the country recently led by Jacinda Ardern, whose brand of compassionate, progressive politics made her a global symbol of anti-Trump liberalism.</p><p>The new government — a coalition of the main center-right party and two smaller, more populist ones — has reversed many of Ms. Ardern’s policies. It has rescinded a world-leading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/world/australia/new-zealand-smoking-ban.html" title="">ban on smoking for future generations</a>, repealed rules <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/world/asia/new-zealand-ban-oil-drilling.html" title="">designed to address climate change</a> and put a former arms-industry lobbyist in charge of overhauling the nation’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/world/asia/new-zealand-guns-jacinda-ardern.html" title="">strict gun laws</a>.</p><p>And in a country that has been celebrated for elevating the status of Māori, its Indigenous people, it has challenged their rights and the prominence of their culture and language in public life, driving a wedge into New Zealand society and setting off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/world/asia/new-zealand-parliament-maori-haka.html" title="">waves of protests</a>. On Tuesday, tens of thousands of demonstrators — including some who wore traditional Māori attire and performed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4691873/2023/07/19/new-zealand-world-cup-haka/" title="">hakas</a> — converged on Parliament.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This is nothing more than us having to defend that we exist,” Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, the co-leader of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/world/asia/new-zealand-maori-politics-clothes.html" title="">Te Pāti Māori</a> party, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYZqQKa8k1k&amp;ab_channel=RNZ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> before the protesters reached Wellington, the capital.</p><p>This rightward shift is, in a way, reflective of Ms. Ardern’s complicated legacy at home. Her coronavirus policies were lauded initially but ended up being divisive. The pandemic also left the country with a bruising cost of living.

But the economy has also slowed, he said.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the government can stimulate economic growth, Mr. Wesselbaum said. But it has a much clearer plan to do so than Ms. Ardern’s government did, he added, pointing to its policies aimed at creating international investment opportunities, cutting taxes and reducing red tape.</p><p>The government is promoting a bill that would allow some infrastructure projects — like mines, roads and housing developments — to bypass the usually required environmental assessments.</p><p>It has vowed to repeal some Ardern-era measures — like a plan to tax farm animals’ methane emissions and a ban on offshore oil and gas exploration — with the argument that they hurt businesses’ bottom line. And it has expanded mining operations, which it argued could become “an attractive prospect for investors and a source of economic prosperity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The government is promoting a bill that would allow some infrastructure projects, like roads and housing developments, to bypass typically required environmental assessments.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Mcdowall for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>These changes have led to accusations by some conservation groups that the government is waging a “<a href="https://www.forestandbird.org.nz/resources/governments-war-nature-attack-our-national-identity-forest-birds-nicola-toki" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">war on nature</a>” and <a href="https://wwf.org.nz/news/our-planet/nzs-war-nature-flouts-terms-european-trade-deal-warns-wwf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prioritizing economic gains above environmental protection.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>During the eight years that Ms. Ardern’s Labour Party spent in power, some citizens grew disenchanted with government efforts to address disadvantages faced by Māori, who make up about 20 percent of New Zealand’s 5.3 million people.</p><p>To these voters, measures such as a specialized Māori health body and affirmative action for the Indigenous people were unfair “special advantages,” said Lara Greaves, an associate professor of politics at Victoria University of Wellington.</p><p>Two smaller parties, New Zealand First and Act, campaigned on those issues, advocating the “same rights” for everyone and promising to repeal “race-based” policies.</p><p>“We are watching our democracy being eroded through the enforcement of an ideological and cultural tone that exists only to serve the nation’s elite leftist cabal,” Winston Peters, the leader of New Zealand First, <a href="https://x.com/winstonpeters/status/1544465126354751488" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> during Ms. Ardern’s tenure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>These views are held by only a small portion of New Zealanders; Act won 8.6 percent of the votes in the election and New Zealand First took 6 percent. But under New Zealand’s so-called proportional voting system, the government is typically formed by a coalition. Consequently, Mr. Luxon’s Nationals, who garnered about 38 percent, needed both smaller parties to cross the finish line — and have been pulled further to the right.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some New Zealanders grew disenchanted with Jacinda Ardern’s efforts to address disadvantages faced by Māori.
