The lawsuits are part of a campaign to extend a Supreme Court ban on race-conscious admissions at civilian universities to military academies.</p><p>The plaintiffs, Students for Fair Admissions, filed their suit in Federal District Court in Colorado, site of the Air Force Academy, as they push to bring the issue to the Supreme Court for review.</p><p>Students for Fair Admissions successfully sued Harvard University and the University of North Carolina over their admissions policies, resulting in a Supreme Court decision last year that barred the use of affirmative action in admissions at those schools. The decision also forced colleges and universities across the country to end the use of racial preferences in their admissions systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The court’s decision, however, carved out an exemption for the military academies, saying they might have special interests.</p><p>The complaint filed this week argued that the Air Force Academy “has no justification” for its policies, however.</p><p>“The United States Air Force Academy is one of the American military’s premier institutions and the most prestigious source of commissioned officers in the Air Force,” the complaint says. “It is also one of the last remaining universities to expressly consider race as a factor in admissions.”</p><p>It accuses the academy of discriminating based on race and of violating the Fifth Amendment. The Harvard and U.N.C. cases were based on the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause.</p><p>The Air Force Academy does not comment on pending litigation, a spokesperson said.</p><p>In addition to the Naval and Air Force Academies, Students for Fair Admissions has sued West Point. The federal judge in the Naval Academy case, Richard D. Bennett, ruled that diversity in the officer corps of the Navy and the Marines is a matter of national security.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The arguments in each case are similar, but Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said the group seems to be hoping judges in different parts of the country will see the matter differently. (Judge Bennett’s ruling in Maryland, where the Naval Academy is, does not bind judges or academies outside that state.)</p><p>“There may be some argument to differentiate the Naval Academy from the Air Force Academy, but I doubt it,” Mr. Tobias said.</p><p>The debate over whether the academies should be held to a different standard than civilian universities has been raging since at least 2003, when Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote the Supreme Court decision upholding the limited use of race in admissions at the University of Michigan Law School.</p><p>In it, she took account of a brief written by high-ranking retired military officers that argued that the benefits of affirmative action were significant.</p><p>“There’s certainly grounds for distinguishing U.N.C. and Harvard from the academies, and maybe hearkening back to what O’Connor had said, because it’s been influential,” Mr. Tobias said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There are five military academies, but the plaintiffs have not sued the Coast Guard Academy, in Connecticut, or the Merchant Marine Academy, in New York.</p><p>The Air Force Academy produces only 17 percent of newly commissioned Air Force officers a year, the complaint said, which “barely moves the needle” in determining the demographics of the officer corps.</p><p>The complaint cites a 2022 Air Force memorandum listing officer applicant goals, broken down by race, ethnicity and gender.</p><p>The purpose of the directive, the complaint says, was to create a more representative and competitive force. The goals were for the pool of officer candidates to be 67.5 percent white, 15 percent Hispanic, 13 percent Black, 10 percent Asian, 7 percent multiracial, 1.5 percent American Indian and 1 percent Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. It does not specify the actual racial breakdown at the time.</p><p>“Because race is a ‘positive’ factor for some candidates, it is necessarily a ‘negative’ factor for others,” the complaint argues, saying that the academy could achieve more diversity through aggressive advertising and recruitment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The academy has defended its use of race-based admissions, saying it reduces any sense of isolation and alienation among minorities and encourages more participation in the classroom.</p><p>It has also argued that as a matter of national security, the racial makeup of the officer corps should reflect that of the enlisted corps and of the general population. It has said that a racially balanced force improves unit cohesion and performance in the battlefield.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
