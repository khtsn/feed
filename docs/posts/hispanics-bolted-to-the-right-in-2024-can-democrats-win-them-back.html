He sees the turmoil both on the border and in the nation’s capital as a return ticket for Hispanic voters attracted by Mr. Trump’s appeals to the working class, and potentially repelled by the emergence of a billionaire, Elon Musk, as a force in the president’s government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Uscanga turned 18 during the 2022 midterms and broke with his family by voting for Republicans.

Mr. Trump took 12 of the 14 counties along the border with Mexico, more than double the five in 2016. Eight of the top 10 Democratic counties that swung hardest toward Mr. Trump are within a short drive to Mexico. The area is where many local residents have cultural ties, perplexing political experts who assumed that Mr. Trump’s campaign promise of mass deportations and his condemnation of illegal immigration would sour Latino voters.</p><p>“He talks like everyday people,” Mia Vela, 18, explained, capturing the appeal of Mr. Trump beyond policies and promises.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>More confounding may be what happened down ballot, where many border-region Democrats managed to win tightly drawn districts, including Representatives Vicente Gonzalez and Henry Cuellar.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Professor Robert W.

Velez, a lecturer in the political science department at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, said that the new political reality along the border is clear: “Any social stigma about voting Republican has been lifted.”</p><p>Still, he added, whether Republicans will be able <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/us-mexico-border-trump.html" title="">to retain their allure once Mr. Trump no longer leads the party</a> remains to be seen.</p><p>“I mean, that’s the real question,” Mr. Velez said. “Once Trump is not on the ballot anymore, will it stick?”</p><p>Gary Groves, a longtime Republican who leads so-called Trump Trains, or convoys of supporters, in and around McAllen, said that the question would be decided by young people, like Mr. Uscanga.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Uscanga and his friends said they were up to the task, but as they canvassed the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley a recent day, resistance came quickly.</p><p>From a larger group of left-leaning voters gathered on an open field, Josselyn Chavez, 18, a freshman, approached his group and asked: “This is a question for all of you guys: Do you believe that Donald Trump is a good man, generally?”</p><p>Mr. Uscanga did not waste time. “He may not be the best man,” he said, “but I think he’s the man for the job.”</p><p>Ms. Chavez also wanted to know why the young Republicans opposed a woman’s right to an abortion, which is all but banned in Texas.</p><p>“Trump has been very clear that it should be up to the states,” Mr. Uscanga replied with a civilized smile. “In California, abortion is very popular over there. They should have that right in California, but in Texas it’s not as popular.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Víctor Ibarra, a student and a Trump supporter, being interviewed by Josselyn Chávez, a fellow student, at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriel V.

If we want to go ahead and get an abortion or turn from a boy to a girl, that’s our free will,” she said.</p><p>That exchange took place just as Mr. Trump was launching a blitz of initiatives that caught his rivals off guard, including the deployment of troops to the border, raids on undocumented migrants, the opening of a migrant detention camp in Guantánamo Bay and the unleashing of Mr. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency to slash government funding.</p><p>Still, José Menéndez, a Democratic state senator from San Antonio, said the party needed to lift up its traditional working-class messaging, without ignoring marginalized groups.</p><p>“We need to go back and focus on the on the kitchen table issues that concern and bother every family,” Mr. Menendez said. “We are the party of the working class.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Sylvia Bruni, the leader of the Democratic Party of Webb County, which includes Laredo, agreed that the party needed to go <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/19/us/texas-laredo-abortion.html" title="">beyond abortion and gender issues</a> if it wanted to win back socially conservative Latinos.</p><p>“The Republicans kept telling voters: I promise you, eggs are going to be down to $1 a dozen,” Ms. Bruni said. “Economics is what did us in.”</p><p>Dresden Sanchez, a 19-year-old freshman at University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, identifies with the left end of the Democratic spectrum, but he noted, “When I went to vote I saw a lot of signs from Republicans that said: The price of groceries are going to go down if you vote for me.”</p><p>“I think we need stuff like that,” he said, “focus on how policies are going to change your life. I think people will vote for Democrats again if they feel like they will do things to change their lives.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Students at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley protesting the policies of President Trump.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriel V.

He was taught at home and in the news that he consumed that Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric meant that the man did not like Hispanics, he said.</p><p>“I just couldn’t believe that he was a candidate for president,” he recalled.</p><p>He didn’t meet a Trump supporter until his freshman year of high school in Harligen, Texas. “Why were they being so supportive?” he remembered asking himself. “I wanted to keep an open mind.”</p><p>He became convinced that Mr. Trump supported legal immigration and also wanted to secure the border from dangerous elements, a nuance he had not heard at home.</p><p>At the same time, his parents flourished, starting their small business and buying a new home and a new truck during Mr. Trump’s first term. The Biden administration was a turning point. He came to agree with Mr. Trump’s assessment that Mr. Biden was too soft on immigration enforcement and had fumbled the economic recovery after the Covid pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>He turned 18 during the 2022 midterms and broke with his family by voting for Republicans. Then others in his family followed suit.</p><p>When his father “came through and said, ‘I’m not going to vote Democrat ever again,’ I was like, Wow,” he recalled. “I knew the valley was going to go for Trump.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Edgar Sandoval covers Texas for The Times, with a focus on the Latino community and the border with Mexico.
