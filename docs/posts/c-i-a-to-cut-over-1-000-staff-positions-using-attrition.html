    <h1>C.I.A. to Cut Over 1,000 Staff Positions, Using Attrition</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The C.I.A. plans to cut more than 1,000 staff positions through attrition over the next few years as the Trump administration shrinks the federal government, according to officials briefed on the plans.</p><p>The agency does not plan any more mass firings. About 80 recently hired employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/cia-officer-firings.html" title="">were let go in March</a>. The C.I.A. is also firing officers who had worked on diversity issues, although a judge has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/elon-musk-cia-doge.html" title="">temporarily halted</a> that effort.</p><p>For the next rounds of reduction, the agency plans, for now, to use normal attrition, including retirements and resignations.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the agency did not directly confirm the plan to reduce its size but said in a statement that John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, was “moving swiftly” to ensure that its work force was “responsive to the administration’s national security priorities.” The cuts were confirmed by officials who were not authorized to speak publicly about them.</p></div></div>
