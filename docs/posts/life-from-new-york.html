In fact, I was born only one week after its premiere, which means that along with being a comedy revolution, a career launchpad and a pop culture juggernaut, the show is also a good way for me to keep track of time.</p><p>Every cast represents a different era in my life. I missed the storied original group — including Chevy Chase and Jane Curtin, both of whom will appear on a prime-time 50th anniversary special tonight — as I was busy learning how to walk, talk and eat solid food. And yet its jokes (“It’s a floor wax <em>and</em> a dessert topping”) were repeated in my house enough to make their way into my consciousness.</p><p>It wasn’t until I was 10 that I stayed up to watch “S.N.L.,” during the strange and spectacular season starring Billy Crystal and Christopher Guest. I was the perfect age to appreciate Martin Short’s Ed Grimley, a giddy, prancing innocent who exuded the nervous energy of childhood. But it was the next hit era, featuring Phil Hartman, Jan Hooks and Dana Carvey, that got me hooked on sketch comedy. The cable-access spoof “Wayne’s World” showed up just after puberty. Perfect timing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mike Myers and Dana Carvey during a “Wayne’s World” skit in 2015.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dana Edelson/NBCUniversal, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Just as teenagers rebel against their parents, “S.N.L.” fans eventually start rolling their eyes at the show. In my 20s, I first indulged in the popular tradition of loudly lamenting that it wasn’t as funny as it used to be. I stopped watching and missed some of the best years of Chris Farley and Adam Sandler. I returned for the Tina Fey era, which ended in my 30s, and became a devoted fan of the cast that featured Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig and Andy Samberg. In recent years, the perspective and mellowing of middle age have helped me enjoy some less-than-perfect seasons. Yet my kids watch those same episodes with an excited fandom and snorting exasperation that I can no longer muster.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The celebration of half a century of “Saturday Night Live” is a major event because the show transcends comedy. More than 26 million people watched its 40th anniversary special. This one feels even more significant, one of the last gasps of the monoculture. “S.N.L.” has been culturally relevant for so long that it’s woven into the background of our lives — continually reinventing itself, always there. The New York Times has tried to capture its impact on the culture in the past few weeks. We’ve singled out the show’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/arts/television/saturday-night-live-ad-parodies.html" title="">13 greatest ad parodies</a>, its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/arts/music/saturday-night-live-snl-musical-moments.html" title="">38 most important musical moments</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/31/arts/television/-saturday-night-live-skit-catchphrases-quotes.html" title="">50 catchphrases it has ushered</a> into our vocabulary. I explored how its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/arts/television/breaking-saturday-night-live.html" title="">cast members’ extensive history of breaking character</a> has become an unlikely signature of its sketch comedy.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cast members breaking character over the years.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“S.N.L.” spans generations, and tonight’s anniversary show reflects that. The special will feature former cast members Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell and Bill Murray; guest hosts Dave Chappelle, Kim Kardashian and Robert DeNiro; and musical guests Bad Bunny, Paul McCartney and Sabrina Carpenter. And these are just the announced stars. Expect familiar characters (fingers crossed for Ed Grimley) and surprises. I doubt Donald Trump will show up, but I bet there will be at least one impression of him.</p><p>Last night, NBC aired the first-ever episode of “Saturday Night Live” from Oct. 11, 1975. It made for a revealing bookend, an illustration of how a scrappy, countercultural show has become the sturdiest, most powerful comedy institution in the history of television.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3e19dd36">More coverage</h2><ul><li><p>“I don’t feel I’m done”: Lorne Michaels, 80, has shaped comedy for half a century.

That’s what Charlotte Woods’s narrator does in “Stone Yard Devotional,” her Booker-shortlisted novel about an atheist who seeks refuge at a convent in New South Wales. This meditative (but by no means uneventful) account includes a mouse infestation, a celebrity nun, a pair of complicated homecomings and countless reminders that the sacred and the profane not only coexist but complement one another. As our reviewer put it, “Activism, abdication, atonement, grace: In this novel, no one of these paths is holier than another.” Does our narrator find what she’s looking for? The answer to this question turns out to be less important than how she contributes to her community.

Gallego had plenty to say about where Democrats went wrong and how they can win over Trump voters while also standing up to Trump.</em></p><p><strong>I want to talk through some demographic groups that Democrats really need to win back if they want to be competitive.</strong></p><p>Everybody?</p><p><strong>Men, for example.</strong></p><p>Yep.</p><p><strong>You’ve been described to me as a bro.

A lot of times we forget that we still need men to vote for us. That’s how we still win elections. But we don’t really talk about making the lives of men better, working to make sure that they have wages so they can support their families. I also think some of this is purely psychological — like we just can’t put our finger on it. During my campaign, I noticed when I was talking to men, especially Latino men, about the feeling of pride, bringing money home, being able to support your family, the feeling of bringing security — they wanted to hear that someone understood that need. And a lot of times we are so afraid of communicating that to men because we think somehow we’re going to also diminish the status of women. That’s going to end up being a problem.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/magazine/ruben-gallego-interview.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id="link-640bc3b8"><span><strong>THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Devin Oktar Yalkin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>Click the cover image above to read this week’s magazine.</strong></p><h3 id="link-7fc2b962"><span><strong>THE MORNING RECOMMENDS …</strong></span></h3><p><strong>Make </strong><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/article/fast-dessert-recipes" title="">sweet treats at home</a>.</p><p><strong>Revamp </strong>your bedroom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/lists/wirecutter-picks-to-revamp-your-bedroom/" title="">on a budget</a>.</p><p><strong>Shop </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/money/presidents-day-sale-2025-0213/" title="">Presidents’ Day sales</a>.</p><h3 id="link-757e1587"><span><strong>MEAL PLAN</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shrimp scampi with orzo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linda Xiao for The New York Times.
