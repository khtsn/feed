    <h1>A New Push to Open the Doors on Childhood Sexual Abuse</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Like the children of many affluent evangelical families in Dallas, Elizabeth Carlock Phillips and her younger brother Trey Carlock spent their summers at a Christian sports camp in Missouri. After Mr. Carlock suffered years of sexual abuse by one of the camp’s directors, he reached a financial settlement to compensate him for his trauma, but at a suffocating price: He could never tell anyone about what had happened.</p><p>Mr. Carlock, a neuroscience researcher, cycled in and out of more than a dozen hospitals and treatment centers, and tried electroconvulsive therapy. He became increasingly detached from family and friends, and took his own life in August 2019. He was 28.</p><p>“Trey told a therapist, ‘They will always control me, and I’ll never be free,’” said Ms. Phillips, who added that the family still had no idea what his nondisclosure agreement had dictated, or what truly had happened to him. “He called his settlement dollars blood money, because taking that money in exchange for an NDA felt like a bribe.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>She added, “He was silenced to his grave.”</p><p>Thanks to the efforts of Ms. Phillips and other victims’ relatives, Texas and Missouri are among several states now aiming to ban such nondisclosure agreements in cases of childhood sexual assault.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Elizabeth Carlock Phillips shuffles through some papers on a desk." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb/00NAT-NDA-trippy-2-03-zqmb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/aa69a262-17f4-5284-8905-3686987bc752" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elizabeth Carlock Phillips sifting through research and evidence against Kanakuk Kamps inside her office in Dallas.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>To critics, the agreements impose a lifetime gag order and deny survivors the ability to heal by sharing their trauma. They also shield perpetrators and the institutions that effectively protect them, allowing abusers to prey upon more unknowing children.</p><p>Companies <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nda.asp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have long used nondisclosure agreements</a> in different contexts to protect trade secrets, confidential data and intellectual property. In civil cases, confidential settlements can resolve matters that might have taken years to go to trial, by allowing those accused of wrongdoing to minimize any publicity.</p><p>In recent years, many companies and institutions have used nondisclosure agreements when settling workplace claims of sexual harassment and assault, especially those involving high-profile figures. Yet few such agreements are as potentially fraught as those tied to childhood sexual abuse, involving victims struggling with self-doubt who may have needed <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213418304551" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decades to come forward</a>.</p><p>Statute of limitations provisions act as another barrier to victims of childhood sexual abuse, with the legal window for filing claims often closing by the time victims reach adulthood and truly understand the damage done.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The extent of the potential liability became clear last week, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/los-angeles-county-abuse-settlement.html" title="">a proposed $4 billion legal settlement in California</a> for plaintiffs who said they were sexually abused as children in Los Angeles County’s juvenile detention and foster care systems, in cases dating to the late 1950s.</p><p>This year, lawmakers in Texas and Missouri, led by a number of conservative Republicans, have introduced more than 20 bills related to childhood sexual abuse. Some seek to void existing NDAs and outlaw future ones, allowing victims past and present to disclose what happened and who was responsible. Others aim to loosen the statute of limitations to give survivors more time to file civil lawsuits.</p><p>“To me it’s clear — you either stand with victims, or you stand with the people who harmed them,” said State Representative Jeff Leach of Texas, the chair of the state’s House Judiciary Committee, who is sponsoring <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB748" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the bills</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>State Representative Jeff Leach of Texas is the sponsor of a Texas House bill known as Trey’s Law.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>To date, only <a href="https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/110/Bill/HB2523.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tennessee</a> has enacted similar NDA legislation.

Mr. Newman <a href="https://baptistnews.com/article/kanakuk-sex-abuser-pete-newman-denied-parole/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pleaded guilty in 2010 to sexual abuse</a>, and others were also accused. The prosecutor who handled the case has told reporters there were probably <a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/new-witnesses-allege-kanakuk-kamps/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of victims</a>.</p><p>A few years later, Mr. Carlock was among <a href="http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/201002191606/BREAKING01/100219033" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dozens of camp attendees</a> who either sued or reached settlements with Mr. Newman and Kanakuk using John Doe pseudonyms, on the condition that they stay mum. Several former Kanakuk campers have died by suicide, according to Ms. Phillips and other advocates for victims of childhood sexual abuse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ms. Phillips, a 37-year-old Dallas entrepreneur who runs a <a href="https://phillipsfdtn.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">family foundation</a>, cautioned that people may not always know what drove their loved ones to suicide. But she said that the enforced silence required by the NDA her brother signed had added to his despair.</p><p>Kanakuk and its lawyers did not respond to requests to discuss the litigation and legislation. But camp officials acknowledged <a href="https://kanakuk.com/our-response/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> that “we were wrong in our understanding of the language of many of these agreements, and we failed to recognize the restrictions — both real and perceived — that many victims are under,” and said that they were “deeply regretful and apologetic.”</p><p>Still, Kanakuk said that while they “support the right of victims to share their stories in pursuit of healing,” insurers may insist that the specific terms of any settlement “must remain confidential.”</p><p>One supporter of the proposed new legislation in Texas is State Senator Angela Paxton, a Republican from McKinney, north of Dallas. In an interview at her State Capitol office, she said she had been heartbroken upon learning from Ms. Phillips that a former student from Senator Paxton’s days as a high school math teacher had been abused at Kanakuk. He had signed a nondisclosure agreement under duress, he had told Ms. Phillips, and later had become so despondent that he thought about killing himself.</p><p>“There are a handful of issues that people really come together over, and I believe this is one that has,” said Senator Paxton, who is the wife of Ken Paxton, Texas’ attorney general.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Then, she reached for a Bible on her desk, and found a passage in Deuteronomy 30:19 urging people to “choose life, so that it may go well for you and your children,” as she put it.</p><p>“This is why God brought me here — this legislation, this package around protecting children from future sexual abuse,” she said, tearing up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“There are a handful of issues that people really come together over, and I believe this is one that has,” said State Senator Angela Paxton of Texas.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Lawmakers in Missouri have also been supportive and, like their counterparts in Texas, are calling the NDA bill <a href="https://treyslaw.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Trey’s Law”</a> in memory of Mr. Carlock.</p><p>At a hearing in the <a href="https://www.kmbc.com/article/missouri-senate-considers-historic-child-sex-abuse-reforms-heart-of-the-matter/64321776" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Missouri Senate</a>, Senator Brad Hudson, a Republican who represents Branson and is also a pastor, said if the bills were not adopted, “we are siding with abusers and perpetrators in making Missouri a sanctuary state for pedophiles.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>No one at the hearing opposed the NDA bill, though three business lobbyists <a href="https://www.ky3.com/2025/03/28/treys-law-would-make-it-easier-missouri-child-sexual-abuse-survivors-prosecute-perpetrators/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticized a statute of limitations bill</a>, wary of the costs.</p><p>“If you had an unlimited liability for an unknown amount of years for an unknown amount of money, how would you as a company be able to set that insurance rate?” said Richard AuBuchon, executive director of the <a href="https://www.mcjrc.org/about.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Missouri Civil Justice Reform Coalition</a>.</p><p>Three <a href="https://house.mo.gov/bill.aspx?bill=HJR58&amp;year=2025&amp;code=R" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bills in Missouri</a>, and <a href="https://www.legis.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HJR120" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three</a> in <a href="https://www.legis.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HJR25" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Texas</a>, call for constitutional amendments that, if approved by voters, would allow for retroactive laws for civil actions related to sexual abuse of children.
