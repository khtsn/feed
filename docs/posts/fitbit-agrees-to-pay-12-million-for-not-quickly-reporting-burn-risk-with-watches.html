But according to U.S. officials, the company did not quickly report, as the law requires, that the battery inside the watch was creating an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death to consumers.</p><p>On Thursday, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced that Fitbit had agreed to pay a $12.25 million civil penalty over its delay in reporting that the lithium-ion battery in the watch can overheat, creating a burn hazard.</p><p>The commission noted that in early 2020, Fitbit had issued a firmware update to reduce the potential for battery overheating, as consumers continued to report suffering burns because of the watch. But Fitbit did not voluntarily recall the Ionic smart watch until <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/Fitbit-Recalls-Ionic-Smartwatches-Due-to-Burn-Hazard-One-Million-Sold-in-the-U-S" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">March 2, 2022</a>.</p><p>By then, the commission said, Fitbit had received at least 174 reports globally of the lithium-ion battery’s overheating, leading to 118 reported injuries, including two cases of third-degree burns and four of second-degree burns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><em>“</em>Fitbit should have immediately reported numerous overheating incidents, including second- and third-degree burns,” Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. said Thursday in a statement. “Instead, Fitbit broke the law by delaying its reporting, leaving consumers exposed to the burn hazard. Many of these injuries could have been prevented.”</p><p>In a statement on Friday, a Fitbit spokesman said, “Customer safety continues to be our top priority, and we’re pleased to resolve this matter with the C.P.S.C. stemming from the 2022 voluntary recall of Fitbit Ionic.”</p><p>About one million of the devices, which track activity, heart rate and sleep, were sold in the United States from September 2017 through December 2021, with an additional 693,000 sold globally. Fitbit said that the injury reports represented fewer than 0.01 percent of all Ionic watches sold. The company stopped production of the Ionic in 2020, according to the consumer commission.</p><p>At the time of the 2022 recall, owners were offered $299 after returning their Ionic watches and received a discount code for select Fitbit devices, according to the consumer commission.</p><p>As part of the settlement agreement, Fitbit agreed to submit an annual report, including updates on the effectiveness of its revamped compliance policies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Google <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/business/after-a-yearlong-review-europe-approves-googles-fitbit-acquisition.html" title="">bought</a> Fitbit for $2.1 billion in early 2021 after agreeing not to use the health and wellness data that Fitbit had created to target ads at internet users.</p><p>In 2014, Fitbit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/business/after-product-recall-fitbit-faces-a-new-safety-inquiry.html" title="">recalled</a> more than a million of its Force wristbands after customers complained of severe skin irritation.</p><p>But the company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/technology/personaltech/fitbit-says-it-will-make-changes-to-address-complaints-about-allergic-reactions-.html" title="">avoided</a> a recall of its Flex wristbands later that year, after similar complaints, by adding a warning about nickel allergies and a sizing guideline to prevent users from wearing the wristbands too tightly.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adeel Hassan is a reporter and editor on the National Desk.
