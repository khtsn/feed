Today<strong> </strong>it’s<strong> </strong>come back to life as a boutique hotel after a seven-year renovation.

And you don’t have to be a star to check in.</p><p>Set amid 12 acres of lush gardens by<strong> </strong>a quiet stretch of beach, Potlatch takes its name from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/science/16tierney.html" title="">feasts and gift-giving ceremonies</a> of Native Americans of the Northwest Pacific Coast. Bright white buildings with interior designs by the Bahamas-based designer and book author <a href="https://www.amandalindroth.com/about-amanda-lindroth" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amanda Lindroth</a> are accented inside with pastels.

Treat yourself to a massage, be it at the <a href="https://www.thepotlatchclub.com/acqua-spa-gym/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spa</a>, in your guest room or even on the beach. Try paddle-boarding or kayaking at nearby Governor’s Harbour, or let the hotel arrange an itinerary, like a boat charter to take you swimming with turtles. Prices from $775 a night.
