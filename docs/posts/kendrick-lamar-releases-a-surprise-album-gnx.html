In the spring, two songs that came out of a rapid-fire diss-track war with Drake — “Like That” and “Not Like Us” — became some of his biggest hits in years. “Not Like Us” went to No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart and was nominated for both record and song of the year at the Grammys.</p><p>In February, Lamar is also set to headline the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show.html" title="">Super Bowl halftime show</a>.</p><p>“GNX,” with 12 tracks, appeared on streaming services midday on Friday, with little accompanying information. The album’s cover art, and a one-minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7liwdjvhWc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">teaser video</a> that was released at the same time, revolve around an image of a black vintage muscle car. On the cover, Lamar slouches against the rear of the vehicle, and the video — with swelling strings and Lamar’s multi-tracked, rapid-fire vocals — shows Lamar with the car in an empty, monumental space.</p><p>Among the songs is one titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-PO1_fzxVM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Heart Pt. 6,”</a> the latest in a series of tracks with similar titles, which has become a Lamar signature. It is also an implicit rejoinder against Drake, who had released a diss track in May called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJeY-FXidDQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Heart Part 6.</a>”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“GNX” is Lamar’s first album after he left Top Dawg Entertainment (T.D.E.), the Los Angeles label that discovered him more than a decade ago. The copyright notice for “GNX” on streaming services credited the release to pgLang, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/27/magazine/kendrick-lamar-dave-free.html" title="">creative agency that Lamar started with his longtime collaborator, Dave Free</a>. (The album was released “under exclusive license” to Interscope Records, a major label under the giant Universal Music Group.)</p><p>Lamar’s last album, “Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers,” was released in 2022 after a five-year wait.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-sisario">More about Ben Sisario</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
