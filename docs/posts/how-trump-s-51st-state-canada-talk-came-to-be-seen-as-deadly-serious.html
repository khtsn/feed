They did not want to be publicly identified discussing a sensitive topic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump has taken issue with Canada’s protected dairy sector, among other trade grievances.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On those calls, President Trump laid out a long list of grievances he had with the trade relationship between the two countries, including Canada’s protected dairy sector, the difficulty American banks face in doing business in Canada and Canadian consumption taxes that Mr. Trump deems unfair because they make American goods more expensive. </p><p>He also brought up something much more fundamental. </p><p>He told Mr. Trudeau that he did not believe that the treaty that demarcates the border between the two countries was valid and that he wants to revise the boundary. He offered no further explanation. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The border treaty Mr. Trump referred to was established in 1908 and finalized the international boundary between Canada, then a British dominion, and the United States.</p><p>Mr. Trump also mentioned revisiting the sharing of lakes and rivers between the two nations, which is regulated by a number of treaties, a topic he’s expressed interest about in the past. </p><p>Canadian officials took Mr. Trump’s comments seriously, not least because he had already publicly said he wanted to bring Canada to its knees. In a news conference on Jan. 7, before being inaugurated, Mr. Trump, responding to a question by a New York Times reporter about whether he was planning to use military force to annex Canada, said he planned to use “economic force.”</p><p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>During the second Feb. 3 call, Mr. Trudeau secured a one-month postponement of those tariffs. </p><p>This week, the U.S. tariffs came into effect without a fresh reprieve on Tuesday. Canada, in return, imposed its own tariffs on U.S. exports, plunging the two nations into a trade war. (On Thursday, Mr. Trump granted Canada a monthlong suspension on most of the tariffs.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Glimpses of the rupture between Mr. Trump and Mr. Trudeau, and of Mr. Trump’s aggressive plans for Canada, have been becoming apparent over the past few months.</p><p>The Toronto Star, a Canadian newspaper, <a href="https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/the-inside-story-of-a-high-stakes-call-between-justin-trudeau-and-donald-trump-as/article_26ba872c-e562-11ef-b4a0-bb36874cfd39.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has reported</a> that Mr. Trump mentioned the 1908 border treaty in the early February call and other details from the conversation. And the Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2dfa3c11-64a7-49f6-83df-939b8d1cfb8e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has reported</a> that there are discussions in the White House about removing Canada from a crucial intelligence alliance among five nations, attributing those to a senior Trump adviser. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A small obelisk marking the Canada-U.S. border east of Coutts, Alberta.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amber Bracken for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h3 id="link-3de99cd4"><span>Doubling Down</span></h3><p>But it wasn’t just the president talking about the border and waters with Mr. Trudeau that disturbed the Canadian side.</p><p>The persistent social media references to Canada as the 51st state and Mr. Trudeau as its governor had begun to grate both inside the Canadian government and more broadly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>While Mr. Trump’s remarks could all be bluster or a negotiating tactic to pressure Canada into concessions on trade or border security, the Canadian side no longer believes that to be so.</p><p>And the realization that the Trump administration was taking a closer and more aggressive look at the relationship, one that tracked with those threats of annexation, sank in during subsequent calls between top Trump officials and Canadian counterparts.</p><p>One such call was between Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick — who at the time had not yet been confirmed by the Senate — and Canada’s finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc. The two men had been communicating regularly since they had met at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s home and club in Florida, during Mr. Trudeau’s visit there in early December. </p><p>Mr. Lutnick called Mr. LeBlanc after the leaders had spoken on Feb. 3, and issued a devastating message, according to several people familiar with the call: Mr. Trump, he said, had come to realize that the relationship between the United States and Canada was governed by a slew of agreements and treaties that were easy to abandon.</p><p>Mr. Trump was interested in doing just that, Mr. Lutnick said.</p><p>He wanted to eject Canada out of an intelligence-sharing group known as the Five Eyes that also includes Britain, Australia and New Zealand. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>He wanted to tear up the Great Lakes agreements and conventions between the two nations that lay out how they share and manage Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie and Ontario.</p><p>And he is also reviewing military cooperation between the two countries, particularly the North American Aerospace Defense Command.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trudeau visited the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado, in 2022.

A spokesperson for Mr. LeBlanc declined to comment. </p><p>In subsequent communications between senior Canadian officials and Trump advisers, this list of topics has come up again and again, making it hard for the Canadian government to dismiss them.<span>  </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The only soothing of nerves has come from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the four people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Rubio has refrained from delivering threats, and recently dismissed the idea that the United States was looking at scrapping military cooperation.</p><p>But Canada’s politicians across the spectrum, and Canadian society at large, are frayed and deeply concerned. Officials do not see the Trump administration’s threats as empty; they see a new normal when it comes to the United States.</p><p>On Thursday, at a news conference, a reporter asked Mr. Trudeau: “Your foreign affairs minister yesterday characterized all this as a psychodrama. How would you characterize it?”</p><p>“Thursday,” Mr. Trudeau quipped ruefully.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>12</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Why Canada Is Taking ‘51st State’ Talk Seriously<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tariffs Could Help Tesla:</strong> All of the cars that Elon Musk&#39;s company sells in the United States are built in California and Texas, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/asia/trump-trade-musk-tesla.html">shielding it from tariffs that could devastate competitors</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>China Hits Canada With Tariffs:</strong> Beijing, which set steep duties on canola, peas and pork, wants Canada and Mexico to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/business/china-tariffs-canada.html">resist U.S. pressure to raise tariffs on Chinese goods</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Canada Pulls U.S. Alcohol:</strong> Canadian provinces have restricted American alcohol sales as part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/world/canada/canada-liquor-boycott-tariffs.html">retaliatory measures against President Trump’s tariffs</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reprieve for</strong><strong> Mexico</strong><strong> and Canada:</strong> Trump suspended tariffs for both countries after Mexico’s leader presented her security successes, and after U.S. markets fell and business leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/world/americas/mexico-trump-tariffs.html">urged the White House to change course</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Who’s Got Trump’s Ear on Tariffs?:</strong> On tariffs, there are two key, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/business/dealbook/trump-lutnick-tariffs-deals.html">seemingly polar opposite, figures</a>: Howard Lutnick, who is a moderate on trade and now commerce secretary, and Peter Navarro, a proponent of high tariffs who is generally opposed to trade deals.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
