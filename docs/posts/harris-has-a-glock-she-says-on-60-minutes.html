And she has taken it to the shooting range.</p><p>In a wide-ranging interview that ran on Monday night during a “60 Minutes” election special on CBS News, Ms. Harris revealed more details about her firearm, which she had teased last month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/us/politics/kamala-harris-oprah-winfrey-event.html" title="">in an interview with Oprah Winfrey</a>.</p><p>“I have a Glock, and I’ve had it for quite some time,” she told her “60 Minutes” interviewer, Bill Whitaker. “Look, Bill, my background is in law enforcement, so there you go.” When he asked if she had fired it, Ms. Harris laughed. “Of course I have,” she said. “At a shooting range. Yes, of course I have.”</p><p>In her September chat with Ms. Winfrey, Ms. Harris said, “If somebody breaks in my house, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/us/politics/kamala-harris-gun-oprah.html" title="">they’re getting shot,”</a> which elicited laughter from the host and the crowd.</p><p>Ms. Harris has been talking about guns in a new way for a Democrat, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/politics/harris-guns-campaign.html" title="">with a focus on “freedom,”</a> while also saying she supports red-flag laws and universal background checks, policies she has long backed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And she has changed her stance on other gun issues. In 2019, she said she supported a rule that assault-weapons owners sell their guns to the government. At the time, she was among <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/us/politics/democrats-gun-control.html" title="">five Democratic candidates</a> in the 2020 race who supported mandatory buybacks. In July, her campaign said this was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-positions.html" title="">no longer Ms. Harris’s position</a>. She supports a ban on assault weapons but does not demand buybacks.</p><p>Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, Ms. Harris’s running mate, is also an avid shooter and has said he uses a shotgun to hunt pheasants.</p><p>Before he joined the ticket, Mr. Walz previously received an A rating from the National Rifle Association, which once endorsed him, but that plummeted to an F after he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/politics/harris-trump-flip-flops.html" title="">began supporting tighter gun restrictions</a> as governor.</p><p>“I know guns. I’m a veteran. I’m a hunter. I was a better shot than most Republicans in Congress, and I have the trophies to prove it,” Mr. Walz said in his speech at the Democratic convention in August. “I believe in the Second Amendment, but I also believe that our first responsibility is to keep our kids safe.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
