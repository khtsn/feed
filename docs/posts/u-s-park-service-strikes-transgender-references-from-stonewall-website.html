To attempt to erase their existence is utterly shameful.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Dr. Carla Smith, the chief executive of the L.G.B.T. Community Center, said in a statement that the website changes were “factually inaccurate” and “an affront to our entire community,” and she urged the Park Service to “immediately restore accurate and inclusive language.”</p><p>The Stonewall Inn, a tavern on Christopher Street, has been considered a cradle of gay rights activism since a police raid there in 1969 touched off three days of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/stonewall-rebellion" title="">protests that helped galvanize a long-marginalized population</a> into a force for political and social change.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/nyregion/stonewall-inn-named-national-monument-a-first-for-gay-rights-movement.html" title="">The 7.7-acre national monument</a> — which includes the bar, Christopher Park across the street, and several other nearby streets and sidewalks — was established under President Barack Obama in 2016.</p><p>On Wednesday, according to a version of the Park Service website saved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250212021949/https://www.nps.gov/ston/index.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a>, the introductory text on the monument’s main page said: “Before the 1960s, almost everything about living openly as a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ+) person was illegal.”</p><p>By Thursday afternoon, the word “transgender” and the letter T in the abbreviation <a href="https://www.nps.gov/ston/index.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had been removed</a> from the page. By Thursday evening, the word “queer” and “Q+” had also been removed from the website.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A Park Service ranger <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/nyregion/stonewall-visitor-center-opens.html" title="">at the monument’s visitor center</a> said on Thursday afternoon that she had not been informed about the changes to the website and had just noticed that the “T” was missing. She declined to provide her name and would not comment further.</p><p>The Park Service’s public affairs department said the agency took the actions to implement an executive order signed by President Trump, “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” and a second order signed by the former acting secretary of the interior. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stacy Lentz, right, an owner of the Stonewall Inn, with Angelica Christina, a trans woman and board member of an affiliated nonprofit.

A plaque on the facade of the building identifies it as a place associated with “monumental change for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer” Americans.</p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul, in a statement posted online, condemned the changes to the monument website as “cruel and petty.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Transgender people play a critical role in the fight for L.G.B.T.Q.+ rights, and New York will never allow their contributions to be erased,” she said.</p><p>The website changes included the virtual elimination of a page listing interpretive flags associated with the L.G.B.T.Q. movement, including the pink, blue and white one representing transgender people, and the times when the flags typically fly in Christopher Park.</p><p>On Thursday, the transgender pride flag still waved over the park.</p><p>Randy Wicker, an L.G.B.T. activist since 1958, was close to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/obituaries/overlooked-marsha-p-johnson.html" title="">Marsha P. Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/20/nyregion/sylvia-rivera-50-figure-in-birth-of-the-gay-liberation-movement.html" title="">Sylvia Rivera</a>, two transgender women who are widely seen as mothers of the movement and as pivotal figures in the Stonewall uprising. The scrubbing of the monument website left him aghast.</p><p>“It’s frightening what is happening, the extent of it and the venom of it,” Mr. Wicker, 87, said, adding that “the idea that they would try to take transgender people out of the Stonewall National Monument — you can’t just erase history.”</p><p>Raquel Willis, a founder of the Gender Liberation Movement, a trans activist group, echoed that sentiment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The Stonewall riots happened because trans people, particularly of color, rose up against state violence,” she said. “You can’t tell the story without us.”</p><p>The changes to the monument website followed a series of other moves by the Trump administration to strip transgender people of federal recognition, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/health/trump-gender-ideology-research.html" title="">by altering other government websites</a>. The effort began with an executive order Mr. Trump signed on his first day in office that was described as “restoring biological truth to the federal government.”</p><p>The measures have included moving to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bar transgender people</a> from identifying as they choose on documents like passports; <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imposing a national restriction</a> on gender-affirming medical care for transgender youths; <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/education-dept-investigation-all-gender-restroom-colorado-school-rcna189880" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investigating schools</a> with gender-neutral bathrooms; <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criminalizing teacher support</a> for transgender students; and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commanding federal prison officials</a> to force an estimated 1,500 transgender women in custody to be housed with men.</p><p>Stacy Lentz, an owner of the Stonewall Inn and the chief executive of the nonprofit Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative, said she had learned about the website changes Thursday morning.</p><p>“I want to say that I’m shocked, but I am not shocked,” she said.</p><p>Still, it was almost incomprehensible to her that the anti-trans campaign had arrived at Stonewall.</p><p>“Coming into our home, into our place, and trying to erase folks who are instrumental to this movement is insanity,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ed Shanahan is a rewrite reporter and editor covering breaking news and general assignments on the Metro desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ed-shanahan">More about Ed Shanahan</a></span></p></div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter who covers the culture and politics of the New York City region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
