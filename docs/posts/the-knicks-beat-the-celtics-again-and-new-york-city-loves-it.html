Nobody believed we had a chance — none of the media, the experts, nobody but us. We always believe. But I’m also kind of in shock.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Powell’s surprise was the product of the Knicks’ stunning, last-minute, come-from-behind victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 2 of the second round of the N.B.A. playoffs. It followed an equally unexpected, last-minute, come-from-behind win in Game 1, both of them in Boston, as the Knicks took control of the best-of-seven series. They are the first team in N.B.A. history to complete <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/starting-5-may-8-knicks-make-another-massive-comeback-2025-playoffs-off-to-historic-start" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 20-point comeback</a> in consecutive playoff games.</p><p>Hundreds of Knicks fans watched both games in the 33rd Street plaza outside Madison Square Garden, the Knicks’ home arena. With a large screen and a fenced-in area, it resembled a pop-up, outdoor concert. Another smaller screen, facing uptown, allowed overflow fans to see the action, too. A D.J. amped up the crowd and M.S.G. ushers and security guards, along with police officers, patrolled the area.</p><p>For most of both games against the Celtics, fans were relatively quiet because the Celtics, the defending champions and heavy favorites, jumped out to large leads. But the Knicks never gave up, winning in improbable fashion. And though the players were in another state, their cheers — echoing off the surrounding canyon of steel and glass — could be heard blocks away in every direction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Larry Johnson, the former Knicks forward, signs a hat at the watch party.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eva Woolridge for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After the third quarter, Sumaya Nagi and her cat Basa stayed hopeful as the Knicks trailed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eva Woolridge for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Many people picked the Celtics to win the title again. The Knicks adjusted their roster this season, adding Karl-Anthony Towns and Mikal Bridges to a core of Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and OG Anunoby, but nobody gave them much of a chance to win a championship. In the regular season, the Knicks won one more game than last year’s total of 50. But it was enough for a devoted fan base that has had only close calls to celebrate since 1973, the last time the team won the championship. Last year, the Knicks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/nyregion/new-york-knicks.html" title="">enchanted New York City</a> and the entire metropolitan region with their playoff run.</p><p>It is happening again, because no local team captivates New York quite like the Knicks. The region has divided loyalties in professional baseball, football, soccer and hockey, but in basketball the Knicks are pre-eminent. Brooklyn is home to the Nets and the Liberty, who won their first W.N.B.A. title last year. But neither team commands the multigenerational loyalty generated by the Knicks.</p><p>“There is a certain love that New York has for the Knicks,” said Travis Bowers, a Knicks fan and entrepreneur from the Soundview section of the Bronx, who said he goes by TB WhoBetta. “The whole city gets behind them. Everything we go through, the hardships, the expenses — we all know what New Yorkers go through. But we are tough, and that’s why we love these Knicks, because they are like us.”</p><p>Along with the legions of regular-citizen fans who can’t afford the hundreds of dollars necessary to get into a Knicks game, a long list of celebrities also attach their devotion to the Knicks, including Spike Lee, Tracy Morgan, Edie Falco, Pete Davidson, Ben Stiller, John McEnroe and a host of current and former professional athletes who sit courtside at home games. Politicians, who may have distanced themselves from the team during its fallow years, <a href="https://x.com/andrewcuomo/status/1919575021090959836" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are on the bandwagon</a>, too.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Caleb Claybon watches as the Knicks struggle during the first half of Game 2.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eva Woolridge for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Knicks forward Mikal Bridges, left, steals the ball from Celtics forward Jayson Tatum in the last seconds of Game 2 to seal the comeback victory.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Charles Krupa/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But the ordinary New Yorkers like Adrian Lloyd, a financial adviser from Long Island, are the kinds of loyal fans who pushed deep into the outdoor pen to watch Wednesday’s Game 2. In the third quarter, though, Mr. Lloyd said he needed a break from the pit, and before the Knicks’ latest impossible comeback had really started, he wandered across the street for a breather.</p><p>“It’s like when the Yankees are winning, except that’s all the way up in the Bronx,” he said. “This is centralized, right here in the middle of the city.”</p><p>As the last seconds ticked down and Bridges ended the game with a steal at the buzzer, as he had in Game 1, the crowd on 33rd Street erupted, their hands thrust into the air, cellphone cameras glowing against the night sky. The celebratory crowd, consisting mostly of young men, migrated toward Seventh Avenue alternating chants — “Knicks in four!” and invectives aimed at the Celtics — hopeful that as the series shifts to New York for Game 3 on Saturday, the Knicks will proceed to a four-game sweep.</p><p>“There is so much energy right now,” beamed Ms. Powell, the fan from Mount Vernon. “The crowd just grew and grew. But it’s all positive. It’s all about the Knicks.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“There is a certain love that New York has for the Knicks,” said one Knicks fan from the Bronx. “The whole city gets behind them.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eva Woolridge for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hundreds of Knick fans attended the Madison Square Garden watch party.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eva Woolridge for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Waldstein writes about the greater New York region with an emphasis on sports.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Beekeeper Charged With a Genocidal Secret:</strong> Faustin Nsabumukunzi lived quietly in New York.
