    <h1>T1 reaches first-ever international final with 3-1 win</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>After defeating 2024 Champions EDward Gaming, T1 has made history, reaching first-ever grand final at a VCT global event. With a 3-1 victory, the South Korean team guaranteed a new winner, as G2 Esports awaits T1 in the final.</p>

<p>An ace from Meteor started the series, with T1 taking EDG&#39;s map pick, Bind, 13-4. T1 stayed ahead after winning Haven 13-10, a comeback in the second half keeping momentum on their side. A much closer Fracture followed, with EDG forcing overtime to take the map 14-12. Split was the final map of the series, ending 13-5 in T1&#39;s favor and closing out the series 3-1.</p>

<p>The series is EDG&#39;s first best-of-five loss in VCT history, and, being a lower bracket match, means the defending Champions are sent home. T1 will next play against G2 Esports for the Bangkok title, crowning a new Masters winner to start 2025. </p>
