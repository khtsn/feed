In Western Canada, fire activity normally sees an uptick in May.

The smoke was generating a reading of red on the air quality index, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/air-quality-index.html" title="">standard measurement used by states</a> to track particulate pollution, meaning it is unhealthy for many members of the general public.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Air quality in the rest of the state was expected to be orange, or unhealthy especially for sensitive groups, Minnesota’s <a href="https://www.pca.state.mn.us/air-water-land-climate/current-air-quality-conditions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pollution Control Agency said.</a></p><p>“This will be a long-duration event with multiple rounds of smoke expected,” the agency said. The highest concentration of smoke is expected through Saturday afternoon, before a second round of smoke billows in on Sunday and a third wave arrives on Monday.</p><p>In Wisconsin, state officials said hazy skies and elevated levels of fine particle pollution from the wildfires were forecast to drift into the northwestern region of the state before thickening and moving south on Friday.</p><p>The advisory in Wisconsin is set to expire at 6 a.m. on Saturday, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WIDNR?__cft__[0]=AZXZxj-piKhg_9h3B1DCzD4f40zNtXrDVAgfc9tifQ_20DNNMXRx5gq_vfAem2pAkDrnTCt3GD22bRAbwJjRXWXJfXRP6FD77iU5SmwV7oFgQpZJpRhWGL7ya3581LjPYD5Bzge0ZZdiy4idcQQUkAntEwWb1HM4VJdgxQj0IGCgIJfza1jZdZFBZrKUFqNB-mZF5GqdhwSdAq8OURoWc-jT&amp;__tn__=-UC%2CP-R" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Natural Resources</a> said, but there was a chance that the impacts from the smoke could continue in other areas.
