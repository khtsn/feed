People develop MASH after fat builds up in the liver, which can lead to inflammation, cell damage and scarring. The condition, which affects nearly 15 million adults in the United States alone, is <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10749707/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the most common</a> reasons for liver transplants nationwide. It is closely linked with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, both of which are also on the rise.</p><p>Novo Nordisk, the company that makes Ozempic and Wegovy, sponsored the study, as is common with clinical trials. The Phase 3 trial included people with moderate or advanced levels of liver scarring.</p><p>After 72 weeks, nearly 63 percent of those who received semaglutide injections and around 34 percent of those on placebo shots saw the fat and inflammation in their livers clear up without any worsening of their liver scarring.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And nearly 37 percent of those who took semaglutide had less scar tissue than they started the trial with, with no worse inflammation or fat buildup. That was compared to around 22 percent in the placebo group.</p><p>Inflammation and fat in the liver are the major factors that cause liver scarring in people with MASH, which can then lead to liver failure, said Dr. Vandana Khungar, a hepatologist at Yale New Haven Hospital who was not involved with the study. Patients may need a liver transplant, or can die from the disease.</p><p>Novo Nordisk has asked the Food and Drug Administration to approve Wegovy as a treatment for MASH. Eli Lilly, which makes the competitor drugs Mounjaro and Zepboun<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa2401943" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">d</a>, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa2401943" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has also studied</a> whether the compound in those medications can treat MASH, with promising early results.</p><p>There is only one medication currently approved to treat the condition, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-patients-liver-scarring-due-fatty-liver-disease" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rezdiffra, which the F.D.A. cleared last March.</a> Recent research has also shown that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/well/liver-disease-bariatric-surgery.html" title="">bariatric surgery</a> could help treat MASH.</p><p>Beyond that, doctors often encourage patients to lose weight, in the hopes of improving liver inflammation and preventing additional scarring. Nearly three quarters of participants in the trial had obesity, and more than half had Type 2 diabetes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Participants in both the placebo group and the group that took semaglutide trial received nutrition and exercise counseling, which appeared to have an effect. Some people in the placebo group lost weight — 2 percent of their body weight, on average, compared to around 11 percent in the treatment group — and saw improvements in liver health.</p><p>Dr. Arun Sanyal, director of the Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease at Virginia Commonwealth University and the lead author on the study, said “there’s no question” that weight loss was a major driver of the improvements among patients on semaglutide. People who took the drug also had lower blood sugar and less <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/well/live/insulin-resistance-signs.html" title="">insulin resistance,</a> which likely contributed to better liver outcomes. It’s possible the drug has other effects, he said, including that it might reduce inflammation in the liver.</p><p>One limitation of the study is that the majority of participants were white, Dr. Khungar said. Only five patients in the entire trial were Black. And since most people in the trial had obesity, it isn’t clear whether the drug will be as effective in patients who do not have excess weight, she added.</p><p>Longer-term data will show whether semaglutide can prevent liver transplants or death from liver disease, Dr. Khungar said.</p><p>Novo Nordisk is continuing to monitor trial participants to see how their liver disease progresses. The company anticipates new data in 2029.</p><p>Nina Agrawal contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Dani Blum is a health reporter for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The World of Weight-Loss Drugs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>What to Know: </strong>How do Ozempic and other drugs used for weight loss work? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/well/live/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs.html">Here’s a primer</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>What Happens if You Stop?: </strong>Many patients are eager to discontinue the drugs when their weight loss plateaus. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs.html">But doctors say it’s difficult to go cold turkey</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>How to Choose: </strong>As patients consider drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro to treat obesity, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/health/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs.html">experts say the choices are not so simple</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Cost of Weight Loss:</strong> A study found that for medications like Wegovy and Zepbound to be cost effective for employers and government programs, they would need to cost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/health/wegovy-zepbound-cost-weight-loss-drugs.html">hundreds less per month</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Physicians and Ozempic</strong><strong>: </strong>There are no studies documenting the percentage of doctors taking the drugs, but at cardiology conferences and diabetes meetings, doctors can’t help noticing that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/health/doctors-ozempic-weight-loss.html">thin seems to be very in</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
