Some of the victims were minors, and many were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/asia/philippines-drug-war-duterte-justice.html" title="">not involved in the drug trade</a>, activists say.</p><p>Mr. Duterte had long benefited from a culture of impunity. Until Tuesday, he had seemed all but untouchable despite taking public credit for the widespread violence.</p><p>Mr. Duterte’s camp said his detention was illegal, arguing that the I.C.C. had no jurisdiction in the Philippines because the country had withdrawn from the court while he was president.</p><p>Judges ruled that the court has jurisdiction because it was investigating killings that happened while the Philippines was still a member of the I.C.C.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The prosecution has charged Mr. Duterte with crimes it says occurred between Nov. 1, 2011, and March 16, 2019, when the Philippines officially withdrew from the court.</p><p>The Philippines is still a member of Interpol, the international police organization that can seek arrests on behalf of the I.C.C. and which helped arrest Mr. Duterte this week.</p><p>But Mr. Duterte may have been more likely to remain out of the court’s reach had it not been for a time of political upheaval in the Philippines.</p><p>When Mr. Duterte’s six-year term ended in 2022, he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/30/world/asia/philippines-marcos-inauguration.html" title="">succeeded by Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.</a>, the son of a former dictator. Mr. Marcos ran together with Mr. Duterte’s daughter Sara Duterte, the country’s vice president.</p><p>That alliance has since fractured, and the two <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/world/asia/duterte-marcos-philippines-feud.html" title="">have had a spectacular falling out</a>. Early in his administration, Mr. Marcos had indicated that he would not cooperate with the I.C.C., but in late 2023, his government allowed the court’s investigators to enter the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The I.C.C. is facing a big challenge in trying to convict Mr. Duterte. The court has tried — and several times failed — to convict leaders. The former president of Ivory Coast, Laurent Gbagbo, was acquitted in 2019 for his role in the country’s post-election violence.</p><p>To meet the standard of crimes against humanity — the charge that Mr. Duterte is facing — the prosecution must prove that the violent “war on drugs” campaign was part of a criminal plan led by Mr. Duterte and comprised “a widespread and systematic attack” against civilians in the Philippines. </p><p>Sara Duterte has called the arrest of her father political oppression, while Mr. Marcos has said he is simply following international convention in complying with the Interpol warrant.</p><p>In approving Mr. Duterte’s arrest, Mr. Marcos may be trying to eliminate the Dutertes as a political force without any major backlash. (Ms. Duterte is leading polls for the presidential election in 2028.)</p><p>The issue is expected to play a large role in the Philippines’ midterm elections in May, which are seen as a proxy battle between the Marcoses and the Dutertes.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div><div><p>Marlise Simons is a correspondent in the Paris bureau, focusing on international justice and war-crimes tribunals.
