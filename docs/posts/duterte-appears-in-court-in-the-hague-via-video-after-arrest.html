Some of the victims were minors, and many were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/asia/philippines-drug-war-duterte-justice.html" title="">not involved in the drug trade</a>, activists say.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Salvador Medialdea, Mr. Duterte’s lawyer, said in court on Friday that Mr. Duterte’s arrest amounted to a “pure and simple kidnapping” and called it “political score settling.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A motorcade believed to be carrying Mr. Duterte arrived on Wednesday at the International Criminal Court detention center near The Hague.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Havana/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Medialdea added that Mr. Duterte — who could be seen over the video link in a blue suit jacket, a blue tie and sitting at times with his eyes closed — was in bad health and that he was “hard of hearing and poor of sight.” Speaking in English, Mr. Duterte told the court his birthday and place of birth.</p><p>The Filipino authorities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/world/asia/duterte-icc-arrest-explained.html" title="">arrested Mr. Duterte</a>, 79, on Tuesday at Manila’s main airport after he returned from a trip to Hong Kong, days after the I.C.C. issued an arrest warrant.</p><p>He was arrested with the help of Interpol, acting on behalf of the I.C.C. because the Philippines is no longer a member of the court. Mr. Duterte was then flown on Wednesday to the Netherlands and was transported to The Hague.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>When he ran for president before taking office in 2016, Mr. Duterte <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines.html" title="">vowed to order</a> the police and the military to find drug users and traffickers in order to kill them, promising immunity for those carrying out the orders.</p><p>Mr. Duterte had long benefited from a culture of impunity. Until Tuesday, he had seemed all but untouchable despite taking public credit for the widespread violence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Duterte’s camp said his detention was illegal, arguing that the I.C.C. had no jurisdiction in the Philippines because the country had withdrawn from the court while he was president.</p><p>Judges ruled that the court had jurisdiction because it was investigating crimes that took place while the Philippines was still a member of the I.C.C.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The prosecution has charged Mr. Duterte with large-scale killings, torture and rape that it says occurred between Nov. 1, 2011, and March 16, 2019, when the Philippines officially withdrew from the court.</p><p>But Mr. Duterte may have been more likely to remain out of the court’s reach had it not been for a time of political upheaval in the Philippines.</p><p>When Mr. Duterte’s six-year term ended in 2022, he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/30/world/asia/philippines-marcos-inauguration.html" title="">succeeded by Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.</a>, the son of a former dictator. Mr. Marcos ran together with Mr. Duterte’s daughter Sara Duterte, the country’s vice president.</p><p>That alliance has since fractured, and the two <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/world/asia/duterte-marcos-philippines-feud.html" title="">have had a spectacular falling out</a>. Early in his administration, Mr. Marcos had indicated that he would not cooperate with the I.C.C., but in late 2023, his government allowed the court’s investigators to enter the country.</p><p>The I.C.C. is facing a big challenge in trying to convict Mr. Duterte. The court has tried — and several times failed — to convict leaders. The former president of Ivory Coast, Laurent Gbagbo, was acquitted in 2019 for his role in the country’s post-election violence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>To meet the standard of crimes against humanity — the charge that Mr. Duterte is facing — the prosecution must prove that the violent “war on drugs” campaign was part of a criminal plan led by Mr. Duterte and comprised “a widespread and systematic attack” against civilians in the Philippines.</p><p>Ms. Duterte, who was in The Hague on Friday, has called the arrest of her father political oppression, while Mr. Marcos has said he is simply following international convention in complying with the Interpol warrant.</p><p>Speaking outside the court, she said that Mr. Duterte and his supporters expressed their expectations that “they will give us permission to visit the former president,” according to The Associated Press, and that “they will allow our request to move the initial appearance.”</p><p>In approving Mr. Duterte’s arrest, Mr. Marcos may be trying to eliminate the Dutertes as a political force without any major backlash. (Ms. Duterte is leading polls for the presidential election in 2028.)</p><p>The hearing set by the judge for Sept. 23 will be used to establish whether the evidence provided by the prosecution is sufficient to take the case to trial. If Mr. Duterte does go on trial, the case could take years.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div><div><p>Marlise Simons is a correspondent in the Paris bureau, focusing on international justice and war-crimes tribunals.
