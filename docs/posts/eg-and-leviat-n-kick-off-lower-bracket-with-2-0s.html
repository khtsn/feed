</span> made quick 2-0 sweeps to start their potential lower bracket runs.</p>



<p>The first elimination match of Americas pitted EG against LOUD, both fighting to not be the first team going home. In the end, EG was the one to come out on top with a relatively strong 2-0. <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/826/supamen">
		supamen	</a>
</span> turned up big today, after having a rough performance in their last two matches.</p>

<p>“I&#39;m the rock of this team, if I&#39;m making those kinds of mistakes, we&#39;re gonna suffer,” said supamen after the match.</p>


<p><em>A super retake led by supamen.</em></p>

<p>EG was firing on all cylinders today, making quick work of LOUD on map one. Haven ended with a 13-5 score, with a rare form coming out of EG&#39;s IGL <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/619/c0m">
		C0M	</a>
</span>, topping the scoreboard on the map.</p>


<p><em>Even in 2026, C0M is still flanking.</em></p>

<p>Abyss was less of a slam dunk for EG, with LOUD actually leading for the whole of the first half. However, LOUD suffered on the attack half, and EG quickly reached match point at a 12-8 scoreline. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/28716/lukxo">
		lukxo	</a>
</span> once again did his best to keep his team alive, and brought the map to overtime with four round wins in a row. However, EG quickly ended the match in the first round of overtime, winning the map 14-12.</p>



<p>The second match of the day saw the highly anticipated debut of the full Leviatán roster. For their past two matches, they have been without <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/29243/neon">
		Neon	</a>
</span>, one of their most exciting prospects from the off-season. In his absence, the team went 0-2, putting them straight into the lower bracket, staring down elimination.</p>

<p>Luckily for Leviatán, Neon&#39;s debut came at just the right time, as with their full roster now on stage, the team looks immediately improved. Neon came in and immediately put up a star performance in his first map of VCT, putting up a 1.81 rating. Leviatán won Bind in a 13-4, completely dismantling KRÜ, who unfortunately were still without their main roster.</p>


<p><em>It didn&#39;t take long for Neon to warm up to the VCT stage.</em></p>

<p>Split was a bit more competitive, with Leviatán&#39;s inexperience showing as they made several ill-advised plays that gave KRÜ chances in the map. However, the overall skill level of the team was enough to bring them a 13-10 win on the map, and finally get Leviatán rolling in the Kickoff bracket.</p>

<p>EG and Leviatán will move on in the bracket, but Santiago is a long ways away. Five more matches stand between them and qualification, with no room for error.</p>
