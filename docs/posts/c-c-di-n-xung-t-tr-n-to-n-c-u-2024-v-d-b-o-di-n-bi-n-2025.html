He was 73.</p><p>His death, at University of Utah Hospital, was caused by complications from a recent stroke, his daughter Amy Cook said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Wayne Osmond, second from left, performed with his brothers during a television special in 1971.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettmann</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>As an original member of the group, which began as a sibling quartet initially called the Osmond Brothers, Wayne and his brothers were child stars who later became ubiquitous pop stars in the 1970s. As practicing Mormons, the family built a brand around resisting the temptations of fame while capturing the spirit of the era with their flared jumpsuits and rollicking dance choreography.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Songs including “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfQxTYuXXjE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One Bad Apple</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlA-z0du1Pg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yo-Yo</a>” became Top 10 singles in the early 1970s, and drew comparisons to the Jackson Five — especially with the younger Donny hitting his raspy high notes — and propelled the family to a feverish level of fame.</p><p>When the siblings landed at Heathrow Airport on a trip to Britain in 1972, “where they were lucky to escape alive,” a reporter wrote in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/21/archives/london-a-season-for-opening-nights.html" title="">The New York Times</a> that year, the Osmonds “produced the kind of teary, lip‐trembling, shrieking scenes that recalled the early impact of the Beatles, post‐Liverpool.”</p><p>Though Wayne Osmond’s baritone might not have been the first notes to be noticed on an Osmond record, the deeper tones gave structure to the family band’s songs. He played several different instruments, including lead guitar and woodwinds, and wrote music that included the 1972 song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZpF-sQ8Yhw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">And You Love Me</a>,” a slow, melancholy ode to his wife, Kathryn White, who was a former Ms. Utah <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/27/archives/ceausescu-declines-offer-of-lifetime-post-notes-on-people.html?timespastHighlight=wayne,osmond" title="">whom he married</a> in 1974.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Osmond was “a serious and deep thinker, always reasoning and trying to solve life’s greatest questions,” his sister Marie said about his artistic leanings <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marieosmond/p/Ch02GX0jB7U/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> in 2022. “As a songwriter, he expressed his deepest thought-out solutions to life.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Melvin Wayne Osmond was born on Aug. 28, 1951, in Ogden, Utah, to George Osmond and Olive (Davis) Osmond. Mr. Osmond worked in real estate while Ms. Osmond looked after the nine children, raising them in traditional Mormon ways and instilling a love for music in the household.</p><p>The fourth of the nine children, Wayne Osmond started performing when he was 6 years old. He could play 18 different instruments, including the bagpipes, the banjo and the clarinet, but he was most proficient at guitar, Ms. Cook said.</p><p>In the late 1950s, Mr. Osmond and his siblings began performing in a barbershop quartet-style group at local venues to earn money to help sponsor mission trips. The siblings’ musical prowess gave them the chance to travel.</p><p>Good fortune struck for the Osmonds in the early 1960s. The father of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/arts/music/andy-williams-crooner-of-moon-river-dies-at-84.html" title="">Andy Williams</a>, a popular crooner and television host of the era, saw them while they were performing at Disneyland and was so impressed that he introduced them to Mr. Williams, Ms. Cook said. At the time, the younger Mr. Williams hosted “The Andy Williams Show,” an Emmy-winning music variety show.</p><p>The children, donning matching suits and red bow ties, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T79I4an7ZY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made their debut</a> on the show on Dec. 2, 1962, according to Donny Osmond’s official website.</p><p>“Do you know, ‘Yes Sir, That’s My Baby?’” Mr. Williams asked a young Donny perched on his lap.</p><p>“Yes sir,” Donny responded sheepishly. The crowd laughed at the adorable scene. And then the children started singing and finished to wild applause.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>With that, the Osmond Brothers were introduced to a broader audience and eventually became a recurring part of the show. In the early 1970s, they changed their name from the Osmond Brothers to just the Osmonds, Ms. Cook said. The radio hits and touring followed.</p><p>“The Osmonds present a kind of theater‐in‐rock ‘n’ roll,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/26/archives/pop-music-osmonds-at-the-garden-millers-bluesrock-guitar-heard-at.html?timespastHighlight=the,osmonds" title="">The Times</a> wrote in 1973. “With tight choreography, taken perhaps from Black soul groups, they wheel and strut around the stage, regimented and disciplined, programmed to draw that last squeal out of an ecstatic weeny bopper.”</p><p>As a child, Wayne Osmond had a brain tumor that he was told would be fatal and underwent <a href="https://copingmag.com/wayne-osmond/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rigorous cancer treatment</a>. In 2012, he suffered a stroke that prevented him from being able to play guitar, Ms. Cook said.</p><p>Mr. Osmond spent the last decade of his life with his hobbies, like fly fishing, and his family. He is survived by his wife, Kathlyn; Ms. Cook, and his four other children, Steven Osmond, Gregory Osmond, Sarah Hilton and Michelle Erickson; and 20 grandchildren. He is also survived by his eight siblings: Virl, Tom, Alan, Merrill, Jay, Donny, Marie and Jimmy.</p><p>As much as Mr. Osmond was defined by his musical career, his faith, he said, was always a driving force in his life.</p><p>“We’re Latter-day Saints, and we have a very high moral and ethical code that we live by,” Mr. Osmond told <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2004/1/16/19806719/after-47-years-osmonds-still-squeaky-clean/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deseret News</a> in 2004. “It’s not something that’s forced upon us. Anyone can do what they want to.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Jan. 2, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of Wayne Osmond’s wife. She is Kathlyn, not Kathryn (The error also occurred in a brief article in 1974 noting their approaching marriage). It also misstated the name of a newspaper that quoted Mr. Osmond. It is the Deseret News, not the Desert News. </p></div></div><div><div><p>Emmett Lindner writes about breaking and trending news.
