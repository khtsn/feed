The victims, two of whom remained hospitalized in critical condition, have not been publicly identified.</p><p>The attack at Abundant Life Christian School took place during the last week of classes before Christmas break, and it sent emergency responders scrambling to the small, close-knit school on Madison’s east side. Much about the shooting remained unclear as investigators looked for a motive and detectives searched a home that they believed was connected to the attack.</p><p>Here’s what we know:</p><h2 id="link-50796733">When did the attack happen?</h2><p>A second-grader called 911 at 10:57 a.m. to report a shooting inside the school, Chief Shon F. Barnes of the Madison police said, and law enforcement officers began arriving three minutes later. He said officers immediately went inside and began searching for the shooter, who was found wounded at 11:05 a.m.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/16/us/abundant-life-school-shooting-wi/emergency-workers-were-mobilized-quickly-dispatch-audio-indicates?smid=url-share" title="">Audio</a> that was archived online captured dispatchers scrambling to send emergency crews to the scene as the scope of the attack became clearer.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Law enforcement secured a perimeter around the school.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kaleb Autman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“OK, I’m hearing multiple things — possibly one deceased, maybe six people injured, at least two shot,” the dispatcher said. </p><p>Chris Carbon, the Madison fire chief, said that 15 ambulances and several fire engines ultimately responded, and that the injured were quickly taken to two local hospitals.</p><h2 id="link-6ab3d469">Who was killed and injured?</h2><p>A teacher and a teenage student died in the attack.
