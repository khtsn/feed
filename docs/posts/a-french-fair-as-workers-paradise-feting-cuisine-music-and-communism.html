She’s even angrier now that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/world/europe/france-prime-minister-barnier-macron.html" title="">he appointed a right-wing prime minister</a>, despite the fact that a leftist bloc won the most seats in Parliament.</p><p>But Ms. Marlier left that anger behind at home in the far northeast of France when she boarded a bus for a four-hour ride to a nearly 100-year-old festival on the outskirts of Paris that celebrates left-wing politics in general, and French Communism in particular.</p><p>The Fête de l’Humanité — festival of humanity — is an unlikely mixture of Burning Man, Woodstock and a political convention.</p><p>“We are never angry here,” said Ms. Marlier, 51, in between doing 1 euro shots of alcohol with her husband, both their faces decorated by sparkles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>They were standing in the middle of a dirt lane, between large white booths set up by Communist Party associations from around the country, offering the food specialties of their regions — including raw oysters and steamed lobsters, giant pans of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/dining/tartiflette-recipe.html" title="">tartiflette</a>, and axoa, a minced veal dish from the Basque region.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The book fair at the festival, which also has a film tent and stages for some 60 concerts. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A loudspeaker advertised the coming debate between the head of the French Communist Party, Fabien Roussel, and one of the country’s top union leaders, but Ms. Marlier and her husband were already tipsy. They were planning on seeing some bands play instead.</p><p>“Here, we’re in a suspended dream, outside our daily problems and worries,” said Ms. Marlier, who works with handicapped children in elementary schools in the département of Moselle, bordering Germany and Luxembourg.</p><p>Every year, usually during the second weekend of September as the country is shaking off its vacation slumber, the festival’s organizers build a huge village out of the mud and grass of an abandoned military airport, in the distant nether regions of Paris where suburban homes give way to corn fields. Up go the stages, and up go some 350 large booths in long lines to make streets, which are often named after dead French Communist heroes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Every year, dozens of musicians come to perform. In the past, they’ve included acts like Manu Chao, Pink Floyd, Ray Charles and Youssou N’Dour, and French stars like Aya Nakamura and Zaho de Sagazan.</p><p>And in all those booths, hundreds of political debates, lectures, and question and answer sessions are held throughout the festival’s three days. This year there were 360, running morning to evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/00france-festival-153-cover/00france-festival-153-cover-square640-v2.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/00france-festival-153-cover/00france-festival-153-cover-square640-v2.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/09/18/123824_1_00france-festival-153_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Each year, the organizers build a village out of the mud and grass of an abandoned military airport, with stages and some 350 booths forming streets, which are often named after dead French Communist heroes.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>That meant on Saturday afternoon, you could see a union leader square off against the head of an employers’ association; or settle into the large film tent to watch <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/movies/judith-godreche-metoo-abuse-france.html" title="">Judith Godrèche</a>’s latest short film, “Moi Aussi,” on the prevalence of rape; or see a children’s play; or dash over to the Angela Davis stage to listen to the French musician Santa belt out lyrical songs — all more or less at the same time.</p><p>Or you could try to squeeze into the crowd pouring into the “agora” — the central red booth where the big ticket speeches happen — to see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/19/t-magazine/angela-davis.html" title="">Ms. Davis herself</a>. The retired California philosophy professor, activist and Communist presidential candidate was back at the festival for the third time since 1973.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Hope is a discipline which you have to cultivate,” she said, her voice reverberating over loud speakers. “Because without it there is no possibility of moving forward.”</p><p>The Fête de l’Huma, as the faithful call it, began in 1930 to raise money for the official Communist Party newspaper, L’Humanité. Today, the left-wing daily is no longer the party’s official organ, but it continues to run the annual festival.</p><p>The budget has climbed to about €8 million, but the festival barely breaks even most years, said L’Humanité’s publisher, Fabien Gay, who also is an elected Communist senator.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fabien Roussel, center, the leader of the French Communist Party, at one of the festival’s many food stalls.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>That’s because the newspaper refuses to raise ticket prices, in keeping with the founding idea that the festival should offer culture to workers. The top price for three days of 60 music concerts is just €60 — the typical cost of a single concert in Paris, Mr. Gay pointed out.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“This is for us Communists, this is what we fight for — everything that is exceptional and grandiose must remain accessible to everyone,” said Mr. Roussel, the French Communist Party leader, who spent some of the fête in full-on campaign mode, shaking hands, slapping backs and visiting party booths from across the country, even though no election is near.</p><p>During an interview, he remembered fondly the year 1988, when the French designer Yves Saint Laurent <a href="https://mediaclip.ina.fr/fr/cab88035928-fete-de-l-humanite-defile-yves-saint-laurent.html#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put on a fashion show</a> — which he called a “work of art,” comparable to the “Mona Lisa” or “Guernica” by Picasso, who also, incidentally, had exhibitions of his work here.</p><p>“Bodies must be always nourished, but so must minds,” Mr. Roussel said.</p><p>When you arrive at the fête, 22 miles south of central Paris, it feels as if you’ve entered an alternative universe, where the Communist Party is joyfully running France and not continually losing seats in the National Assembly, including Mr. Roussel’s last summer. The party currently has just nine seats in the 577-seat legislature.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Angela Davis, a former Communist presidential candidate in the United States, was one of this year’s speakers. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Here, it’s not K.F.C. but C.F.K.: Communist Fried Kitchen, with Colonel Sanders transformed into Marx. Red flags with the hammer and sickle flap from the awnings of booths, and people wear Communist Party shirts and hats.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In 1945, with the memory of the prominent role played by French Communists in the Resistance still fresh, some one million people crammed into the festival. This year, the attendance was 450,000, according to Mr. Gay. While many come just for the music, organizers hope some will drift into a lecture or debate — particularly those camping in the 8,000 or so tents set up along the fête’s flank.</p><p>“Millions of French people were Communists at one moment of their life, and they come back each year, because they feel part of the family,” explained Frédérick Genevée, a high school history teacher who has written four books on French Communist history, <a href="https://www.editions-arcane17.net/index.php/fr/livres/histoire-de-lunef" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the most recent</a> of which he was signing at the festival’s book fair. “It’s confirmation in what we believe in.”</p><p>Most of the labor at the festival is done by 10,000 volunteers who arrive in convoys, towing stoves, refrigerators, mattresses and kegs of beer from as far as Biarritz, 475 miles away.</p><p>Over two weeks, they work to build their regional booths, set up kitchens and sleeping quarters, and stay up late to talk. In many families, it’s a tradition going back generations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“It gives us a taste of what the world could be,” said Catherine Lavauzelle, 64, a retired teacher who started coming with her father to volunteer at age 7. “If we all gave the best of ourselves, and weren’t always in competition with one another.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Communist heroes, like Che Guevara, are visible on flags, shirts and pins throughout the festival.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The cheap wine and beer helps with the bonding. Add music, and you have a surefire recipe for love, which Mr. Genevée said was another festival theme. He met two of his ex-wives here.</p><p>Gregory Moser not only met his wife, Noémie, here; he married her on-site 11 years ago.</p><p>“We were married in the Cuba booth, had our wine reception in the People’s Republic of China booth,” Mr. Moser said with a laugh outside the regional booth from Charente, where the couple continue to volunteer. After the wedding ceremony, friends drove the newlyweds around the festival in a golf cart trailing cooking pans.</p><p>People <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/16/world/paris-journal-if-the-old-party-s-dying-there-s-life-in-the-fair.html?timespastHighlight=fete,de,l%27humanit%C3%A9,and,France,and,communist" title="">often predict</a> the festival’s demise. They are always proved wrong.</p><p>Similarly, every year, once the revelers have cleared out, and Ms. Lavauzelle is bleary eyed and packing up the sinks and stoves, peeling the tents up off the muddy ground, and beginning the long drive back home, she swears it will be her last. But it never is.</p><p>“It’s the feeling that draws us back,” she said. “It helps me feel better for the rest of the year, when I return to real life.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The festival features some 60 musical acts, which are a main draw. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Ségolène Le Stradic<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Catherine Porter is an international reporter for The Times, covering France.
