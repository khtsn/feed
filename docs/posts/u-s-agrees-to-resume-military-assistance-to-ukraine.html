There was no immediate comment from Russia, which did not have officials at the talks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the statement, the United States and Ukraine acknowledged that the terms of any cease-fire would be subject to Russia’s approval.</p><p>“Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day cease-fire” if Russia did the same, the statement said. It added: “The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.”</p><p>At the conclusion of the meetings, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the agreement now puts the pressure on Russia to end the war.</p><p>“We’ll take this offer now to the Russians, and we hope that they’ll say yes, that they’ll say yes to peace,” Mr. Rubio said. “The ball is now in their court.”</p><p>The United States has been pursuing talks separately with Russia and with Ukraine. There has been no public indication that Russia would accept an unconditional, monthlong cease-fire. And President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has signaled that he will demand concessions — such as ruling out membership in NATO for Ukraine — before agreeing to any halt in the war, which began in 2022 with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has killed or wounded more than one million soldiers on both sides.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The joint statement on Tuesday said the United States and Ukraine also agreed to conclude “as soon as possible” a deal to develop Ukraine’s critical mineral resources — an agreement that was put on hold after the Oval Office clash. That joint venture is intended to “expand Ukraine’s economy and guarantee Ukraine’s long-term prosperity and security,” the statement said.</p><p>It added that the United States and Ukraine also discussed humanitarian relief efforts that would take place during a cease-fire and the exchange of prisoners of war.</p><p>“Representatives of both nations praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people in defense of their nation and agreed that now is the time to begin a process toward lasting peace,” the statement said.</p><p>The U.S. delegation in Jeddah was led by Mr. Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser. They met with a delegation from Kyiv led by Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov.</p><p>Before Tuesday’s talks, Ukraine had insisted that any cease-fire include security guarantees, but there was no indication from the statement issued on Tuesday that any such guarantees would be provided before any interim cease-fire would take effect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While the agreement did not delve into the security guarantees that Ukraine has been seeking, Mr. Waltz told reporters that those had been part of the conversations in Jeddah.</p><p>“We also got into substantive details on how this war is going to permanently end, what type of guarantees they’re going to have for their long term security and prosperity,” Mr. Waltz said.</p><p>The intelligence cutoff had already impaired soldiers in combat, particularly in the Kursk region of Russia, where Russian soldiers have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/europe/ukraine-russia-north-korea-kursk.html" title="">rapidly retaking territory seized by Ukraine last summer</a>, according to Ukrainian commanders in the field.</p><p>The confrontational White House meeting between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine unraveled into an argument and insults. “You’ve talked enough,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky at one point. “You won’t win.” He added at the end of the televised, confrontational meeting, “this is going to be great television.”</p><p>The fallout has reverberated ever since, prompting Ukraine’s European allies to pledge further support. On Tuesday, Mr. Rubio suggested that it was time to move on from concerns about such clashes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“What’s back on track here hopefully is peace,” ⁦Mr. Rubio said. “This is not Mean Girls. This is not some episode of some television show.”</p><p>Mr. Yermak, the lead Ukrainian negotiator, in turn thanked the United States for “constructive” talks.</p><p>“A just peace is the most important for us,” he wrote on social media. “We want a lasting peace.”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Marc Santora<!-- --> from Kyiv, Ukraine; <!-- -->Anton Troianovski<!-- --> from Berlin; <!-- -->Ivan Nechepurenko<!-- --> from Tbilisi, Georgia; <!-- -->Maggie Haberman<!-- --> from Washington; <!-- -->Aurelien Breeden<!-- --> from Paris; and <!-- -->Adam Rasgon<!-- --> from Jerusalem.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew E.
