The attacks came as both sides were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-prisoner-swap.html" title="">carrying out the war’s largest prisoner exchange</a> — a stark reminder that despite ongoing efforts to de-escalate the conflict, a resolution remains far off.</p><p>Russia’s attack on Ukraine was particularly significant, involving 250 long-range drones and 14 ballistic missiles, with Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, the main target. Ukraine’s air force <a href="https://t.me/kpszsu/34940" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it had intercepted six missiles and nearly all the drones, but at least 15 people in Kyiv were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UA.KyivPolice/posts/pfbid02R2KiFkf1sJw79VUN8XWPFonfzmFV2TvroY9YrJnibmKneTwKs2NfqfoB9cMLEtsQl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">injured</a> as drones and debris from intercepted weapons crashed into apartments, setting them ablaze.</p><p>Kyiv residents were jolted awake by the booms of the city’s antiaircraft batteries trying to down incoming missiles and drones. The night sky lit up with bright streaks from climbing air defense missiles and red tracer trails from heavy machine guns. Explosions set off car alarms, adding to the cacophony of gunfire and the buzz of attack drones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“It was a difficult night for all of Ukraine,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1926175364218278264" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> Saturday morning. “With each such attack, the world becomes more certain that the cause of prolonging the war lies in Moscow,” he added, noting that Russia had repeatedly ignored Ukraine’s offers to enforce a temporary cease-fire.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The overnight assault jolted Kyiv residents awake and left this street strewed with broken glass.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thomas Peter/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Still, Ukraine has also escalated its air assaults on Russia in recent weeks. This week, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drones.html" title="">fired hundreds of drones at Russian cities</a>, with Moscow a prime target, in one of the largest barrages of the war, forcing some airports to temporarily close.</p><p>On Saturday, Russia’s defense ministry <a href="https://t.me/mod_russia/53040" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it had intercepted 94 Ukrainian drones overnight. In the region of Lipetsk, near the Ukrainian border, <a href="https://t.me/igor_artamonov48/4435" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local officials</a> reported drone crashes in an industrial zone that, according to <a href="https://t.me/GeneralStaffZSU/24611" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukraine’s military</a>, houses a major plant producing weapon batteries.</p><p>Together, the attacks signal an escalating cycle of air assaults. Both sides have ramped up drone production and can now launch hundreds in a single night — a feat unimaginable in the war’s first year. They also are continuously enhancing drone capabilities, boosting their range and explosive payloads.</p><p>Attacks involving swarms of drones are often designed to overwhelm the enemy’s air defenses, clearing the way for successful strikes. As on Saturday night, Russia often combines drones and missiles, sending drones first to saturate Ukraine’s skies and keep its air defense teams busy, before firing missiles that are harder to intercept.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A drone exploding over Kyiv on Saturday.

Another swap followed on Saturday, involving 307 soldiers from each side. “We expect the process to continue tomorrow,” Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1926231387905970340" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>The swap — the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html" title="">only concrete outcome of last week’s cease-fire talks in Turkey</a> — has fueled cautious hope that it could build trust between the two warring sides and pave the way toward peace.</p><p>In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114556494480941887" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on social media</a> on Friday announcing the swap, President Trump asked, “This could lead to something big???”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But Saturday’s attacks underscored that for all the efforts toward de-escalation, the fighting remains as fierce as ever.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian prisoners of war part of an exchange with Russia on Friday in Chernihiv region, Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On Friday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, <a href="https://www.interfax.ru/russia/1027474" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that once the prisoner exchange was completed, Moscow would present Kyiv with a draft document outlining its conditions for a peace agreement.</p><p>But few in Kyiv believe Russia is serious about ending the war. Russian forces have resumed offensive operations in eastern Ukraine, pushing across a key highway linking Ukrainian-held cities that anchor the area’s defenses. And during last week’s talks in Turkey, Russia insisted that any cease-fire must begin with Ukraine withdrawing from territory it still holds — a nonstarter for Kyiv.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
