Well, we just elected a president who, if he follows through on two of his central campaign promises — across-the-board tariffs and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants — will probably cause soaring inflation.</p><p>How will voters react?</p><p>I’ve written about the likely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/opinion/trump-inflation.html" title="">inflationary impact</a> of Donald Trump’s policies. All of that still stands. But there’s an issue that I haven’t stressed as much as I probably should have: the specific effects of his proposed deportations on grocery and housing prices, both of which have been political flashpoints.</p><p>First, a word about deficits to set the stage: The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a> that Trump’s tax plans would add almost $8 trillion to the debt over the next decade.</p><p>Trump has claimed that he can make up for tax cuts with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-policy.html" title="">revenue from tariffs</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/06/trump-tax-cuts-deficit/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">huge cuts</a> in government spending, but those claims are wildly unrealistic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Deficits — contrary to what you sometimes hear — don’t always cause inflation. After the 2008 financial crisis, warnings about deficit-driven inflation proved wrong because (as basic economics predicted) deficits aren’t inflationary <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/paul-krugman-thinks-inflation-fears-baloney" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a depressed economy</a>. Even President Biden’s big spending in 2021 took place in an economy with <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1z3vg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">depressed employment</a>, and the inflationary impact was further mitigated by a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-immigration-estimates-help-make-sense-of-the-pace-of-employment/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surge in immigration</a>, which expanded the labor force and helped create the capacity to meet higher demand.</p><p>However, with the economy starting from, essentially, full employment in his second term, Trump, with mass deportations, would degrade productive capacity, balloon deficits and — yes — bring inflation roaring back, keeping a grim pledge on punitive immigration policy while breaking one on providing relief to American consumers.</p><p>Here’s what I mean: If you’re upset about grocery prices now, see what happens if Trump goes after a huge part of the agricultural work force; immigrants are around <a href="https://www.fwd.us/news/immigrant-farmworkers-and-americas-food-production-5-things-to-know/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three-quarters</a> of agricultural workers — and <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor/#legalstatus" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roughly half</a> of them are undocumented. (And do you really doubt that many workers legally here will be caught up in Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">threatened</a> dragnets?) Undocumented immigrants also play a large role in food processing. For example, they account for an estimated <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91181711/how-the-meatpacking-industry-exemplifies-the-challenges-of-american-workers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30 to 50 percent</a> of workers in meatpacking.</p><p>If these workers are deported, the food industry will probably have great difficulty replacing them. Even in the best case, the industry will have to offer much higher wages — and, of course, these higher wages will be passed on in higher prices.</p><p>(Oh, and while we produce most of what we eat, we also <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/u-s-food-imports/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">import a lot of food</a> — whose prices would be raised by tariffs.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And when it comes to the downstream economic effects of deportations, it’s not just about grocery prices; it’s also about the cost of housing. The answer to that problem is to build more housing units. But undocumented immigrants are <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/EW-Construction-factsheet.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than a fifth</a> of the construction work force, so deportations would severely hamper efforts to increase the housing supply. (And no, contrary to what JD Vance <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-debate-immigration-housing-prices-real-estate-federal-reserve/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, immigration <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/role-recent-immigrant-surge-housing-costs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hasn’t driven</a> the recent spike in housing costs.)</p><p>Could we easily make up for the loss of these workers by replacing them with native-born workers? No. Employment among native-born adults in their <a href="https://x.com/BBKogan/status/1852332167222755381" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prime working years</a> is higher than it was at any point during Trump’s first term. There just isn’t a large pool of idle but employable native-born Americans to put to work.</p><p>What will Trump do if inflation rises? Bear in mind that his campaign was replete with false claims — about immigration, jobs, inflation, crime and more. And one of his go-to tactics for dismissing data that shows his claims are false is to insist that the data is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/04/us/trump-crime-fact-check.html" title="">fake</a>.</p><p>So if he imposes high tariffs and follows through on his plans for an undocumented immigrant dragnet — and a crucial part of our work force is decimated and Americans start to feel the inflationary consequences — don’t expect Trump to acknowledge that he miscalculated. The far likelier scenario is that he’ll deny reality or blame bad actors and try to order prices back down again. But if you think the president can just wave his hands and bring down the cost of a dozen eggs, I have news for you. (It may be worth noting that Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, whom Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LxWg1n58CE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">admires</a>, has tried to suppress inflation by imposing <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-19/orban-s-food-price-caps-backfire-for-hungarian-holiday-shoppers?sref=qzusa8bC" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">price controls</a>, which backfired badly.)</p><p>And let’s not lose sight of the human component. The prospect of millions of people who’ve come to America to make a better life for themselves being rounded up and shipped out is ghastly. To borrow a phrase, the cruelty of Trump’s proposed deportations is part of the point. But to the extent that Trump has sold the idea that kicking out undocumented immigrants would buoy the economic prospects of working- and middle-class Americans, this is yet another case where his rhetoric and his math don’t add up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Inflation is by no means my biggest concern right now. It’s almost trivial compared with the threat that Trump poses — has posed — to our democracy. But it will matter a lot to many Americans, including many who voted for him, and the nation’s future will depend greatly on how they react if they come to find that they bought into a false belief in Trump’s ability to manage the economy.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
