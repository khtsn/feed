The police chief did not release the boy’s name, nor did he disclose the exact nature of his relationship to the victims, citing the boy’s age. But he did confirm that the boy was related to the victims.</p><p>The police believe that the boy acted alone and that he used two firearms that were recovered at the scene, Chief McIver said. He said that the investigation was continuing and that the police did not yet know the motive for the deadly attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Who knows why someone would do something this malicious — and at that age,” Chief McIver said. “We are putting everything together and hopefully very soon we will have all the answers — more answers — as to the ‘why.’”</p><p>A spokeswoman for the District Attorney’s Office that serves Webster Parish said it was not yet clear if the boy would be prosecuted as an adult. It is unclear if the boy is currently represented by a lawyer. The local Public Defender’s Office said it did not yet know whether the boy would be represented by that office.</p><p>News of the double homicide shocked residents in Minden, a city of about 11,500, many of whom knew Mr. Cornelius.</p><p>A longtime city councilman, Mr. Cornelius was appointed mayor of Minden for a time after the mayor died in office in 2013. He was also a former sheriff’s deputy and marshal. According to The Associated Press, Mr. Cornelius had also worked at a funeral home and run programs for youth and helped organize local Black history events.</p><p>On social media, Mr. Cornelius was remembered by his nicknames, “Mr. Joe” and “Ice Cream Joe.” Neighbors and friends said that they knew he was coming when they heard the music coming from his ice cream truck, and that he often handed out free ice cream to children who could not afford it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The police chief said on Tuesday that officers responded to a 911 call around 6:30 a.m. on Sunday and found Mr. Cornelius and Ms. Miles dead of multiple gunshot wounds.</p><p>The police found the 11-year-old boy on the scene. The police chief said “the juvenile gave us a story at first that just didn’t add up” but that later the same day, in an interview with detectives at which an adult family member was present, he confessed that he had killed both victims.</p><p>The police recovered two weapons on the property, and their calibers matched empty shell casings found at the scene, Chief McIver said.</p><p>The police chief declined to answer questions about who owned the guns or how the boy had been able to gain access to them.</p><p>At the news conference, Minden’s current mayor, Nick Cox, said “Joe Cornelius was more than just a public servant.” He added: “Joe’s efforts to improve Minden have left a lasting impact that will be remembered for years to come.<em>”</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It’s just a shock to the community” the police chief said of the suspect’s age. But the crime itself is also shocking, he said, as the older victim had been so dear to his community.</p><p>“Everybody knew Mr. Joe, and that’s what hurts the most,” Mr. Cox said. “When you know somebody who has been in the community for so long, who has reached so many people, there is a sorrow.”</p><p><em>Christine Hauser contributed reporting.</em></p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
