He has been requesting information about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/timeline-trump-deportation-flights-el-salvador.html" title="">two deportation flights</a> in particular, which officials say carried members of a Venezuelan street gang, Tren de Aragua, to El Salvador.</p><p>The judge, James E. Boasberg, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/trump-deportation-venezuela-tren-de-aragua.html" title="">scolded the department in a stern order on Thursday</a> for having “evaded its obligations” to provide him with data about the flights. He wants that information as he seeks to determine whether the Trump administration violated his initial instructions to turn the planes around after they left the United States on Saturday evening.</p><p>Most of the courtroom conversation, however, is likely to concern Judge Boasberg’s underlying decision to stop the White House for now from using the wartime law, known as the Alien Enemies Act, to pursue its immigration agenda. The statute, passed in 1798, gives the government expansive powers during an invasion or a declared war to round up and summarily remove any subjects of a “hostile nation” over the age of 14 as “alien enemies.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Almost from the moment Judge Boasberg entered his provisional decision barring President Trump from using the law, the White House and the Justice Department have accused him of overstepping his authority by improperly inserting himself into the president’s ability to conduct foreign affairs.</p><p>But Judge Boasberg imposed the order in the first place to give himself time to figure out whether Mr. Trump himself overstepped by stretching or even ignoring several of the statute’s provisions, which place checks on how and when it can be used.</p><p>The administration has repeatedly claimed, for instance, that members of Tren de Aragua should be considered subjects of a hostile nation because they are closely aligned with the Venezuelan government. The White House, echoing a position that Mr. Trump pushed during his campaign, has also insisted that the arrival to the United States of dozens of members of the gang constitutes an invasion.</p><p>But lawyers for some of the deported Venezuelans dispute those claims, saying that their clients are not gang members and should have the opportunity to prove it. The lawyers also say that while Tren de Aragua may be a dangerous criminal organization, which was recently designated as a terrorist organization, it is not a nation state.</p><p>Moreover, they have argued that even if the members of the group have come to the United States en masse, that does not fit the traditional definition of an invasion.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
