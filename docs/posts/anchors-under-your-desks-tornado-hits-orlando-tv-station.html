Anchors, under your desks!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He described debris flying across Interstate 4 just north of Orlando, into the neighborhood of Lake Mary and into Sanford, Fla.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This is a confirmed tornado,’’ Mr. Garner announced to viewers as power to the station flickered out. “This is a very serious situation. This is a real, live tornado. It just hit our station.”</p><p>The whole episode was brief, lasting about a minute or so, and staff members continued to work and assess damage to the area — and to their own studio.</p><p>One Fox employee shared a photo of damage to vehicles in the station’s parking lot from the severe weather.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A home collapsed during a storm in Seminole County on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Seminole County Fire Department</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Due to the weather impact, there is a collapsed home on the 2100 block of Blue Iris in Longwood and another damaged home,” the department said in an email. “Residents are currently safe from the collapsed home.” Two people inside the home were uninjured.</p><p>The Fire Department also shared photos of firefighters with saws working to remove toppled trees that blocked roadways. It said it was working with the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office and Emergency Management to assess any further damage to the area.</p><p>Preliminary estimates from the National Weather Service, <a href="https://x.com/NWSMelbourne" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which had been warning of tornadoes</a> throughout the morning,confirmed that a tornado had carved about a 1.8-mile path through the Longwood area of Seminole County on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>An assessment team with the Weather Service said the tornado may have reached an EF-2 (up to 115 m.p.h. winds) before it crossed Interstate 4 in Lake Mary where the Fox station is.</p><p>After warning his colleagues on the air, Mr. Garner turned to his local viewers with the same urgency as the storm moved across the area.</p><p>“Get to the ground level, an interior room away from the windows,” he said, adding, “I have been doing this a long time, and that’s the first time a tornado has hit me while I am doing the weather.”</p><p>Judson Jones<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
