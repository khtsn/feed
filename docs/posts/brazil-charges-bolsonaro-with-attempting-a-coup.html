The charges essentially adopted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/americas/bolsonaro-coup-brazil-election-charges.html" title="">recommendations from Brazil’s federal police</a> made in November.</p><p>The case will now go before Brazil’s Supreme Court, which will decide whether to order Mr. Bolsonaro’s arrest and have him face trial. If convicted, he could face 12 to 40 years in prison, according to the indictment, though political analysts expect any sentence to be shorter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a statement, Mr. Bolsonaro, 69, called the indictment “the weaponization of the justice system” and compared himself to President Trump, a political ally he often emulates.</p><p>The accusations are “nothing more than a desperate attempt to criminalize my political movement, silence millions of Brazilians and rig the next election before a single vote is cast,” Mr. Bolsonaro said, adding that he had handed over power peacefully. “This is the same failed strategy that was used against President Trump.”</p><p>The charges are the latest chapter in a yearslong saga for Brazil that has included Mr. Bolsonaro’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/25/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-misinformation.html" title="">discrediting of the nation’s voting systems</a>; a tense election in which Mr. Bolsonaro <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/world/americas/brazil-election-results-bolsonaro-lula.html" title="">never fully accepted defeat</a>; an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/world/americas/brazil-jan-6-riots.html" title="">invasion of the halls of power</a> by his supporters; and a high-profile investigation that has left his running mate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/americas/brazil-arrest-ally-bolsonaro.html" title="">in jail since December</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brazil’s presidential office building was vandalized by Bolsonaro supporters in January 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor Moriyama for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Now Brazilians may witness a televised Supreme Court trial that could end up making Mr. Bolsonaro their third president in the past eight years to be sent to prison.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>That would provide a striking contrast with the United States. Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Trump have both now been indicted on charges of pushing to overturn elections. But Mr. Trump’s case was dropped as he returned to power, while Mr. Bolsonaro is at perhaps his weakest political point yet.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Brazil’s electoral court has already ruled that Mr. Bolsonaro is ineligible to run in the presidential election next year. The attorney general is weighing two other criminal cases against him. And the Supreme Court justice set to oversee this case is arguably his political archrival.</p><p>While the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Trump was largely immune from prosecution for his actions as president, Brazil’s Supreme Court has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/americas/brazil-supreme-court-expanded-powers-democracy.html" title="">acted aggressively</a> against Mr. Bolsonaro and his right-wing movement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The court has overseen investigations, ordered arrests and censored many of Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters on social media, arguing that the anti-democratic actions of his movement required an extraordinary response.

First they tried to undermine the public’s faith in the 2022 election, and then, after Mr. Bolsonaro lost, they tried to overturn the results, the indictment said. It also detailed several plots that prosecutors say the group discussed and began to execute, but ultimately abandoned.</p><p>One of those plots, according to the indictment, involved declaring a “state of siege” — an emergency provision in the Constitution — which Mr. Bolsonaro would then have used to order the arrest of Supreme Court justices, grant new powers to the military and call for new elections overseen by his allies. Investigators said they even found the draft of a speech Mr. Bolsonaro would give once he announced the takeover.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/americas/brazil-soldiers-president-lula-assassination-plot.html" title="">even darker plot</a>, prosecutors say, involved poisoning Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who defeated Mr. Bolsonaro in the 2022 election, before he could be sworn in as president and fatally shooting Alexandre de Moraes, the Supreme Court justice who has overseen the investigations into Mr. Bolsonaro and would be the lead judge in his trial. The assassinations were to be carried out by a small group of elite military agents, according to the indictment, and the men had already begun tracking the movements of Justice Moraes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes has overseen the investigations into Mr. Bolsonaro.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dado Galdieri for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The indictment also says the assassination plan was presented to Mr. Bolsonaro. In a WhatsApp message on Dec. 12, 2022, one organizer of the plot told another that Mr. Bolsonaro had told him they could carry out the assassinations anytime before Dec. 31, according to the indictment. Mr. Lula was set to be inaugurated on Jan. 1.</p><p>“I said, ‘Come on, president. The sooner the better. We’ve already lost so many opportunities,’ ” the organizer, Mário Fernandes, was quoted as saying in the message.</p><p>Mr. Fernandes has denied the accusations.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-coup-charges.html" title="">an interview last month</a>, Mr. Bolsonaro said he had explored the idea of using a “state of siege” to keep Mr. Lula from taking office because he was concerned that the elections had been rigged. But he said that he quickly dropped the idea when it became clear Congress would have to approve the order.</p><p>He denied having any knowledge of an assassination plot, blaming it on Mr. Fernandes. “Even so, I think it was just another fantasy — bravado,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“Everyone is responsible for their actions,” Mr. Bolsonaro added. “Although, as far as I know, he did not take any action.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Bolsonaro has said that he explored the idea of using an emergency provision of the Constitution to keep his successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from taking office.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor Moriyama for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Brazil was ruled by a military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985.
