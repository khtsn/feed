Mr. Musk has already shown a desire to wield influence in U.K. politics, even calling for the jailing of Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer.</p><p>The prospect of a huge donation from the multibillionaire tech mogul has led some politicians to suggest new restrictions on foreign donations.</p><p>Mr. Farage called Mr. Musk a “heroic figure” and said that discussions around a donation were “just about him having an appropriate vehicle.” In Britain, foreign donations are permitted but must be made through a U.K.-registered company.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Nothing is closed off as far as I know,” Mr. Farage said one day after a fund-raiser that he said brought in more than 1 million pounds ($1.25 million), big money in British politics.</p><p>Mr. Musk did not respond on Wednesday to a message seeking comment sent by email.</p><p>Mr. Musk appeared poised to influence British politics on behalf of Reform, a party with a populist platform that closely mirrors Mr. Trump’s. But Mr. Musk seemed to sour on Mr. Farage abruptly early this month, declaring on social media, “The Reform Party needs a new leader.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk at the Trump inauguration last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The rift appeared to have been over Mr. Musk’s demand that a far-right agitator, Tommy Robinson, be released from prison, where he is being held for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/europe/tommy-robinson-sentenced-uk-far-right.html" title="">contempt of court</a>. Mr. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has multiple criminal convictions, including for assault and fraud, and a history of Islamophobic statements.</p><p>“I know a lot of Americans see him as a great champion of free speech, but I just don’t see him as suitable for our party,” Mr. Farage said. “And I’m not someone that budges very easily.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But he cast that as a mere disagreement. “We’ve got very similar goals on some areas, slightly different emphases in others,” he said, noting that in earlier conversations, Mr. Musk had shared lessons from Mr. Trump’s winning campaign in swing states.</p><p>“There’s a heck of a lot we’ve learned from that we will implement over the next few years,” Mr. Farage said.</p><p>Beyond Mr. Musk’s deep pockets, Mr. Farage said he was considering ways to tap other Americans who have given to Mr. Trump. During his visits to Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, Mr. Farage said he had been approached by a “number of people” exclaiming: “We want to give you money! We want to give you money!”</p><p>He was careful to say that Reform U.K. would not accept money from U.S. citizens directly — only from those who have “active U.K. trading companies.” That could include the sizable and wealthy British expatriate community in the United States, which he said Reform plans to target.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The anti-immigration activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, is shown on video screens at an anti-immigration protest in London, in October.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris J Ratcliffe/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The revelations are likely to trigger fresh concern among Britain’s Labour government and Conservative Party, which are already uneasy about Reform’s rapid rise from the fringe of national politics to a party snapping at the heels of those two dominant parties in the <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/51428-voting-intention-lab-26-ref-24-con-22-19-20-jan-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polls</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Reform has pledged to cut “wasteful” government spending, increase the military budget, abandon key climate targets and push Britain back toward oil and gas. And it wants to scrap diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Mr. Farage, like Mr. Trump, has taken a hard line on immigration and has rallied against “woke” ideology.” Reform has promised to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cv22qdq7znno" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">freeze</a> immigration.</p><p>Mr. Farage was ebullient over Reform’s million-dollar gala on Tuesday night. “That sounds like peanuts to an American audience, but to a fairly new British political party, that’s a pretty good evening,” he said.</p><p>“The dinner was about raising money, but it’s also about extending our influence,” he added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jane Bradley is an investigative reporter covering the United Kingdom for The Times.
