		<p>Valorant was announced as the newest addition to the <a href="https://x.com/ENC_EN/status/2024861622620004410" target="_blank">Esports Nations Cup</a>, a new multi-game, country-based esports tournament held by the Esports World Cup Foundation. The series, which will be biennial, is an expanded series from the Esports World Cup.</p>

<p>The four-week event will open on November 2 this year, held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with Valorant running during the event&#39;s second week, from November 8 to 15. Four groups of eight teams will make up the tournament, with best-of-one matches deciding the top four teams in each group after a round robin phase. The remaining 16 teams will then advance to a single-elimination playoff bracket, where every series is a best-of-three.</p>

<p>From the field of 32, invited teams will make up half the field, while 14 qualifier slots and two wildcard slots are also up for grabs. Direct invites will be determined via the new Valorant National Team Rankings, which take into account regional and international VCT competitions, with points shared equally across teammates who participate in those events. The national ranking will then accumulate the points of the top five players on the submitted national roster. The period for direct invites will end on June 21, which is right after <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/search/r/event/2765/ac" target="_blank">Masters London</a>.</p>

<p>There are deadlines in March and April for national teams to submit rosters and coaches. At the time, it is believed that teams must appoint coaches by March 29 and submit playing rosters by April 26. There is a limit of three players from the same team being on one roster.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2766/valorant-champions-2026" target="_blank">Champions Shanghai</a> wrapping up on October 18, players competing at both Champs and the ENC will have close to three weeks off before traveling to Riyadh.</p>
