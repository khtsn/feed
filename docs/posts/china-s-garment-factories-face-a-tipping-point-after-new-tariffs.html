That trade has come to an abrupt stop.</p><p>Mr. Liu owns a small factory in Guangzhou, long the center of China’s highly competitive garment industry. He and other factory managers, already dealing with tight profit margins, said last week that the combination of tariffs and President Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/china-tariffs-economy-de-minimis.html" title="">new tax on cheap imports</a> had cut deeply into their businesses. Costs along the supply chain are also higher.</p><p>The tariffs have made it impossible for Mr. Liu to continue selling on Amazon, where he previously made about $1 on every garment but now just 50 cents. And he felt he could not cut his employees’ pay, Mr. Liu said, as workers at a labor market crowded past his motorbike, which he had parked on the sidewalk with a dress sample draped over the handlebars.</p><p>“You can’t sell anything to the United States right now,” Mr. Liu said. “The tariffs are too high.”</p><p>Platforms like Amazon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000010138010/de-minimis-e-commerce-tax-exemption-explainer.html" title="">Shein and Temu</a> brought China’s vast manufacturing supply chain to the world’s doorstep. These online marketplaces made it possible for thousands of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/economy/guangzhou-china-exports-tariffs.html" title="">Guangzhou’s small factories</a> to reach shoppers in the United States. And since packages worth less than $800 could enter the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/02/world/asia/tariffs-orders-packages-china-us.html" title="">tax-free</a>, the factories and, in turn, the platforms were able to charge very low prices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Exports have been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/business/china-tariffs-robots-automation.html" title="">major driver</a> of China’s economic growth in the past few years. Business has been particularly good in e-commerce. In one Guangzhou neighborhood, foreign luxury cars — Mercedes-Benzes, BMWs and Cadillacs — were parked outside factories that pay workers about $60 a day to churn out clothing sold on apps like Shein and Amazon.</p><p>But now as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/us-china-tariffs-trade-war.html" title="">trade tensions</a> force the world’s two largest economies apart, many businesses in Guangzhou are facing a tipping point.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A garment wholesale and distribution area in Guangzhou.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Qilai Shen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shipments to the United States from Guangzhou’s garment makers are expected to decline after the end of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Qilai Shen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The tariffs compound multiple challenges facing the garment makers. It is getting harder to make a profit as the Chinese government has struggled to get consumers spending more after the collapse of the country’s property market. Without rising home values, many Chinese people are curbing their spending.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That hurt business for Zhang Chen, who used to own six clothing stores in the central province of Hubei. But when shoppers didn’t return after the Covid-19 pandemic and rent stayed high, he decided to close them all.</p><p>“In 2020, business wasn’t coming back, and in 2021, it still wasn’t coming back. By 2022 when it was still like that, it looked like it was never coming back,” Mr. Zhang said. Now he makes about $100 a day delivering freshly sewn garments to Shein collection points near the airport.</p><p>The factories in Guangzhou are not the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/business/china-tariffs-robots-automation.html" title="">automated ones</a> churning out electric vehicles or the manufacturing campuses making semiconductors that are key to China’s yearslong drive to secure geopolitical resilience through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/business/huawei-phone-chips-china.html" title="">advanced technology</a>.

A few owners said they could possibly move to countries like Vietnam, where many Chinese factories have set up to avoid potential new tariffs as high as those already set on China’s exports.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Many reported declining orders.

But in April, after the company ordered about half that much, he started moving his production line to the neighboring province of Jiangxi. He could no longer afford rent in Guangzhou.</p><p>Mr. Liu said that Shein was offering incentives to help cover the cost of moving operations to Vietnam, and he had considered it, “but then the tariffs on Vietnam got even higher, too.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>He said he had also tried to find buyers on TikTok and Temu, but orders were down on every platform. “They’re all falling, and we are only waiting and watching,” Mr. Liu said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Exports have powered China’s growth, with Shein buying 100,000 pieces a month from some suppliers. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Qilai Shen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>With China’s consumers being careful about spending, it will be hard for factories to sell as much domestically as they were exporting.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Qilai Shen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Shein did not respond to a request for comment.
