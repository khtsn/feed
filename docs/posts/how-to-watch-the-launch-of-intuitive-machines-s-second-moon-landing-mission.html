Can the Houston company do it again, but keep the spacecraft upright this time?</p><p>When the spacecraft, named Odysseus, set down on the moon last February, it managed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/science/intuitive-machines-lander-history.html" title="">communicate with Earth</a> even though it had toppled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/science/moon-lander-intuitive-nasa.html" title="">on its side</a>. It was the first commercially operated lander to reach the moon’s surface, and the first American vehicle to land softly on the moon since Apollo 17 in 1972.</p><p>The company’s second lander, named Athena, is now on the launchpad. Here’s what you need to know about Wednesday’s flight.</p><h2 id="link-176f61f">When is the launch, and how can I watch it?</h2><p>Athena and three other spacecraft will launch on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Launch is scheduled for 7:16 p.m. Eastern time on Feb. 26. There is a greater than 95 percent chance of favorable weather and SpaceX said about less than an hour before the flight that <a href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1894891036570177593" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fueling of the moon lander</a> had been completed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If weather or technical issues arise, backup opportunities will be available during a four-day launch window. After that, the mission would have to be delayed by a month.</p><p>NASA will provide coverage of the launch beginning about 45 minutes before liftoff. You can watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8qzcomV5A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the agency’s YouTube channel</a>, or in the video player embedded above.</p><h2 id="link-19ca9fa3">Where is Athena going?</h2><p>If the launch occurs Wednesday, the Intuitive Machines spacecraft will try to land on March 6 in Mons Mouton, a region about 100 miles from the moon’s south pole. That will be closer to the south pole than any previous lunar lander.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/science/26moon-lander-03/26moon-lander-03-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/science/26moon-lander-03/26moon-lander-03-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/science/26moon-lander-03/26moon-lander-03-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Deep craters form dark shadows on the moon’s bumpy surface." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/science/26moon-lander-03/26moon-lander-03-articleLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/science/26moon-lander-03/26moon-lander-03-articleLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/science/26moon-lander-03/26moon-lander-03-jumbo.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/science/26moon-lander-03/26moon-lander-03-superJumbo.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f0f57b0d-3475-599e-8e22-9dd01739c838" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A visualization of the moon’s Mons Mouton area, Athena’s intended destination, made using data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ernie Wright/NASA&#39;s Scientific Visualization Studio</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-247ec44f">What is Athena carrying?</h2><p>The main payload is a drill for NASA as part of its Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. Paying a commercial company like Intuitive Machines to take something to the moon is cheaper than having NASA design and build its own spacecraft.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The drill is designed to dig up soil up to about three feet below the surface. It will extract lunar soil about four inches at a time. An instrument known as a mass spectrometer will then sniff around the drilled material for compounds like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/science/moon-nasa-shadowcam-craters.html" title="">frozen water</a> that easily transform into gases.</p><p>The Athena lander is also carrying three robotic rovers and a small flying “hopper” that will be deployed after landing.</p><p>The largest rover, known as the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform, or MAPP, is part of a NASA-financed test of the first cellphone network on the moon. Nokia won financing from the space agency to test the technology but then needed a way to move at least one antenna some distance from the lander. So Nokia hired a company called Lunar Outpost to build the rover, which is about the size of a small dog.</p><p>Lunar Outpost sold space on MAPP to other customers. One, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, built a tiny rover called AstroAnt, which will crawl around on the top flat surface of MAPP.</p><p>Athena will also deploy a rover called Yaoki, built by a Japanese company, Dymon, that is a bit bigger than a Mac mini computer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Intuitive Machines built the hopper as part of another NASA contract. The small rocket-powered craft could offer new opportunities to explore long distances, similar to the way <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/science/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars.html" title="">NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter on Mars</a> provided a different way to explore areas not easily reached on the ground.</p><p>On the airless moon, helicopters cannot fly, but thrusters will allow the hopper to fly long distances. It will also be carrying one of the Nokia cellphone antennas. The plan is to fly into one of the moon’s permanently shadowed craters.</p><h2 id="link-30a9c619">An eclipse?!</h2><p>The mission on the surface is scheduled to last for less than one lunar day, or about 10 Earth days, until the sun sets. With no solar energy, the spacecraft’s batteries will run out of power.</p><p>But in the middle of the lunar day, on March 14 at about 2 a.m. Eastern time, darkness will fall for a few minutes — an eclipse when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The solar-powered lander will have to draw power from its batteries during the eclipse but should survive.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Odysseus lander on its way to the moon’s surface, where it toppled over after landing, in February 2024.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Intuitive Machines</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-40542e5b">Why did Intuitive Machines’ last lander topple over?</h2><p>The Odysseus lander was supposed to use a laser altimeter to help guide it to the moon’s surface. But because of an oversight during the launch preparations, a safety switch for the device was never disabled, rendering that tool useless. Engineers at Intuitive Machines hurriedly rewrote their landing software to use similar measurements from an experimental NASA instrument on the spacecraft. But they missed updating one key parameter in the computer code, and the landing software ignored the data.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/science/nasa-odysseus-moon-lander-photos.html" title="">The spacecraft thus landed oblivious to its exact altitude</a>, only guessing its distance above the surface based on horizontal speed calculated from camera images and measurements of accelerations in the spacecraft’s velocity. The guesses were close enough that it did not crash, although it was still moving horizontally. The landing gear broke, and the spacecraft tipped.</p><p>The Athena lander is almost identical to Odysseus — each is what the company calls its Nova-C design — and Intuitive Machines officials said they had tested the laser multiple times.</p><h2 id="link-115c12cc">What other spacecraft are traveling with Athena?</h2><p>Three more separate spacecraft are riding on the Falcon 9 rocket. They are essentially taking advantage of extra payload space in the rocket for a cheaper ride to space.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>One, Lunar Trailblazer, is a lost-cost NASA mission — about $100 million — designed to measure the distribution of water on the moon from orbit.</p><p>While Athena will make a quick one-week trip to the moon, Lunar Trailblazer will take a more leisurely, fuel-efficient path. If launch occurs on Wednesday, it will take just over four months to reach the moon. (If the launch occurs on a different day, the trajectory changes, and the journey could be as long as seven months.)</p><p>A second spacecraft, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/science/astroforge-launch-asteroid-mining.html" title="">Odin, is a microwave-size spacecraft built by the company AstroForge</a> of California. It will head to a near-Earth asteroid to examine whether it might be full of valuable metals that could be mined in the future.</p><p>A third vehicle, <a href="https://x.com/epicaerospace/status/1892758084117754263" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CHIMERA GEO 1</a>, is a spacecraft from <a href="https://epic-aerospace.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Epic Aerospace</a> of San Francisco designed to put <a href="https://epic-aerospace-web.netlify.app/spacecraft" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">small satellites in distant orbits</a>.</p><h2 id="link-4b8b82b5">What else is landing on the moon soon?</h2><p>Athena is the third commercial lander launched toward the moon this year, although it might be the second to arrive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>On Jan. 15, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/science/nasa-spacex-launch-lunar-landers.html" title="">a Falcon 9 rocket launched carrying the other two landers</a> — Blue Ghost from Firefly Aerospace of Austin, Texas, and Resilience by Ispace of Japan.</p><p>Blue Ghost, like Athena, is part of NASA’s CLPS program, and it is scheduled to land on March 2, ahead of Athena. It is headed toward Mare Crisium, a basin in the northeast quadrant of the near side of the moon.</p><p>Resilience, also known as the Hakuto-R Mission 2 lander, is taking an indirect route and is expected to arrive at the moon in May. Its landing site is near the center of Mare Frigoris, or the Sea of Cold, in the moon’s northern hemisphere. This will be Ispace’s second lunar landing attempt. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/science/moon-crash-japan-ispace.html" title="">Its first mission, in 2023, crashed</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
