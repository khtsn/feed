    <h1>Netanyahu Will Meet Trump in Washington</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is set to meet with President Trump at the White House on Monday, according to a White House official, in the second such visit by the Israeli leader since the new administration began in January.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu will arrive in Washington after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-attack-gaza-hamas.html" title="">renewing Israel’s military campaign</a> against Hamas in Gaza late last month, despite efforts by Mr. Trump’s aides to broker a new truce to stop the fighting there and free more hostages.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu did not respond to a request for comment. The Israeli prime minister has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/middleeast/netanyahu-hungary-orban.html" title="">in Hungary on a state visit</a>, where he met with the country’s leader, Viktor Orban.</p><p>During Mr. Netanyahu’s last visit, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-gaza-strip-netanyahu.html" title="">described a vision for Gaza</a> that involved a U.S. takeover and the mass exit of Palestinians from the enclave. Mr. Netanyahu has since issued a call for what he calls voluntary emigration by Gazans, which critics have denounced as effectively forced displacement.</p></div></div>
