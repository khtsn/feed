    <h1>Man Charged With Posing as Federal Agent After Promising Green Card Help</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><header><p id="article-summary">Prosecutors said a New York City man, who drove a red Hummer with “ICE” on its license plate, promised to help a Chinese citizen obtain a green card if she invested $500,000 with him.</p><p><time datetime="2025-03-21T18:32:59-04:00"><span>March 21, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>6:32 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>A New York City man posing as a law enforcement agent promised a woman that he could help her get a green card if she invested $500,000 with him, prosecutors said on Friday. Instead, the man kept the money and never submitted a visa application as he had promised.</p><p>According to a federal indictment unsealed on Friday, he lied to the woman, a Chinese citizen whom the indictment names only as Jane Doe, giving her various excuses for years for why the process had been delayed.</p><p>The man, Tommy Aijie Da Silva Weng, 49, was arrested on Friday and has been charged with wire fraud, mail fraud and impersonating a federal agent. He will be detained until a bail hearing on Monday, officials said.</p><p>Prosecutors had requested he be held in detention given his extensive ties and travel to China. His lawyer, Jullian Harris-Calvin, declined to comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>John J. Durham, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement on Friday that “the defendant preyed on the victim’s desire to become a United States citizen and pursue the American dream, then stole not only that dream, but also hundreds of thousands of dollars.”</p><p>According to the indictment, the scheme began when Mr. Weng met the victim in China in 2016 and told her he was a federal law enforcement officer who was seeking investors for a project building hotels in California on behalf of the U.S. government. At a later meeting, he showed her a business card from the “Federal Officers Police Association” that had his name on it.</p><p>Mr. Weng told the woman that if she invested at least $500,000, she could be eligible to apply for a green card under the EB-5 program and that he would use his “connections” to expedite the process.</p><p>The EB-5 program, otherwise known as the immigrant investor program, allows foreigners to become permanent American residents if they invest a substantial amount of money into a commercial enterprise that creates jobs.</p><p>The woman signed a contract with Mr. Weng that day and wrote out a check for $501,500 to his company, Ding Cheng Overseas Management Inc., the following month, court documents showed. That amount included $1,500 that he said she owed him in filing fees, according to the indictment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Weng later gave the woman a receipt with a number to track her supposed application on the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services website, prosecutors said.</p><p>After some time, the woman began to complain that her application — which did not show a name attached to it on the website — had not progressed in the system, to which Mr. Weng responded with excuses about “administrative delays,” the indictment said.</p><p>Then in 2018, Mr. Weng supplied her a new number, which, when she entered it into the website, showed that an application had been approved. The U.S.C.I.S. database, prosecutors said, has no record of any EB-5 paperwork ever being filed on the woman’s behalf.</p><p>For years after, Mr. Weng repeatedly told the woman that her application was being worked on and that it was “part of a government-backed program and everything had to be done secretively,” according to the indictment.</p><p>To keep up appearances, Mr. Weng habitually asked the woman for personal records, made up a lawsuit to excuse the delays and sent her fake photos of deposits. He also claimed he was an agent with the Department of Homeland Security who was being transferred to a new position with Interpol in Italy, according to court documents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Prosecutors said that when the woman threatened to withdraw her application and request a refund, Mr. Weng returned about $75,000 to her.</p><p>A detention memo for Mr. Weng noted that he drove a red Hummer with a vanity license plate that read: BWTICE. The memo added that the first three letters were believed to reference a Buddhist temple he was associated with in Flushing, Queens, while the final three letters stood for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.</p><p>Mr. Weng was previously arrested in 2015 for impersonating an F.B.I. agent in a scheme to recruit young men into believing they were acting as confidential informants and going undercover for him, according to the indictment. He displayed fake badges, an F.B.I. jacket, a New York Police Department vest and an ICE hat, among other items.</p><p>He pleaded guilty to illegally using official badges in 2016, shortly before meeting the woman in China, and was sentenced to time served.</p><p>Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>In the Ring, His Parents’ Money Doesn’t Matter:</strong> Sean O’Bradaigh grew up in a world of Manhattan privilege, but private schools and ski vacations have nothing on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/nyregion/in-the-ring-it-doesnt-matter-how-much-money-his-parents-have.html">dream of being a professional boxer</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Subway Ninja’:</strong> In the lowest moment of Selwyn Bernardez’s life, he attacked a stranger with a sword.
