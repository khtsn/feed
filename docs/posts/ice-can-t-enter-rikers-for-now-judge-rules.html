The restraining order may be “extended, modified or vacated” after the hearing, she said.</p><p>The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency was banned from city jails in 2014 because of sanctuary laws that sought to stop the transfer of jailed undocumented immigrants into ICE custody for deportation. But Mr. Adams, a Democrat, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/adams-ice-rikers-homan.html" title="">came out in support</a> of permitting ICE to reopen offices at Rikers after meeting several times with Mr. Trump’s border czar, Thomas Homan, who has said getting access to jails was a priority to enact the president’s immigration agenda.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On April 8, Randy Mastro, the first deputy mayor, issued an executive order permitting ICE and other federal agencies to open offices at Rikers, but only for the purpose of conducting criminal investigations — into gangs, for example — and not for the routine enforcement of federal immigration laws, which are primarily civil.</p><p>Despite its narrow scope, the executive order drew intense pushback from civil rights groups, immigration activists and fellow Democrats, who argued that it violated the spirit of the city’s sanctuary status and would pave the way for ICE to easily deport Rikers detainees.</p><p>The City Council, which is controlled by Democrats who lean to the left of Mr. Adams, sued the mayor on April 15, arguing that the executive order was “part of a corrupt quid pro quo bargain” between the mayor and Mr. Trump after the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/eric-adams-indictment-timeline.html" title="">ended the federal corruption case against the mayor</a>.</p><p>Mr. Adams has denied any quid pro quo and has promised to fight the lawsuit, saying that allowing ICE into Rikers was common-sense policy and a matter of public safety.</p><p>City Hall has told the court it is seeking outside counsel after the Law Department — whose lawyers typically represent the administration in legal matters — said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/nyregion/adams-legal-defense-fund.html" title="">it would stay out of the case</a>, an unusual move that led to the delay of a hearing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We are grateful that the court agreed with us to delay the hearing until April 25,” said Kayla Mamelak Altus, a spokeswoman for the mayor.</p><p>She said the administration would not enter into an agreement with the Trump administration over Rikers before the hearing.</p><p>In a statement, Julia Agos, a spokeswoman for Adrienne Adams, the City Council Speaker who is running for mayor, said that the Council viewed Mayor Adams’s executive order as “unlawful and bad for public safety in our city.”</p><p>“Allowing ICE to operate an office on Rikers Island and carry out Trump’s destabilizing and extremist mass deportation agenda would make everyone in our city less safe,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Luis Ferré-Sadurní is a Times reporter covering immigration, focused on the influx of migrants arriving in the New York
