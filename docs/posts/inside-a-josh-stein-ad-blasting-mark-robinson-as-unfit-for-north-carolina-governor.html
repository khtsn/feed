And that is largely because of Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee, who has long history of making incendiary remarks. His Democratic opponent, Attorney General Josh Stein, began running </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnyURFiANKI&amp;t=30s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>this 30-second ad</em></a><em> portraying Mr. Robinson as unfit for public office, even before </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/us/politics/mark-robinson-north-carolina-gubernatorial-race.html?searchResultPosition=38" title=""><em>reports that Mr. Robinson had once called himself a “black NAZI,” defended slavery and written a host of other scandalous posts on a pornographic website.</em></a><em> The Stein campaign has spent more than $2 million running the ad since Sept. 12.</em></p><p><em>Here’s a look at the ad, its accuracy and its main takeaway.</em></p><h2 id="link-2c6436f">On the Screen</h2><p>The ad opens with white capital letters quickly unfurling across a black screen: “Is this who you want as your governor?”</p><p>Video clips follow showing Mr. Robinson loudly delivering speeches — shouting, really — in different settings. In the first few, he is wearing a suit. In the last, he is in a polo shirt.</p><p>His name is shown, and his words are subtitled.</p><p>“Mark Robinson is extreme,” a headline says, again in white type on a black screen. The word “extreme” flips and is replaced by “dangerous,” and then by “unhinged.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As a close-up of Mr. Robinson again shouting, “Some folks need killing!” fills the screen, a final headline flashes across it in capital letters:</p><p>“Mark Robinson is unfit to be governor.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-3"><div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Josh Stein for North Carolina</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-23ca93f8">The Script</h2><p>Mr. Robinson</p><p>“I got them AR-15s in case the government gets too big for its britches. ’Cause I’m going to fill the backside of them britches with some lead.”</p><p>Mr. Robinson</p><p>“Go into battle and take the head of your enemy!”</p><p>Mr. Robinson</p><p>“’Cause it’s time to go to war, folks.”</p><p>Mr. Robinson</p><p>“Get mad at me if you want to: Some folks need killing! It’s time for somebody to say it.”</p><p>Mr. Robinson</p><p>“Some folks need killing!”</p><h2 id="link-249eb87a">Accuracy</h2><p>The ad almost entirely consists of remarks by Mr. Robinson. It makes no verifiable claims.</p><h2 id="link-6991c40e">The Takeaway</h2><p>This is a brutal takedown, effective especially because it uses Mr. Robinson’s own words against him. The disclosures of Mr. Robinson’s pornography-site postings that came after the ad began running have only reinforced its central message.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Robinson comes across as menacing, not only because of what he says but also because of how he says it — yelling about using assault weapons against the government, about beheading, and about killing, a bloodthirsty rhetoric that is unlikely to have broad appeal.</p><p>The ad seems intended to repel the kind of moderate voters likely to decide a close election — many of them women — while appealing to North Carolinians’ sense of pride, an old standby in political campaigns: Do we want this person to be the face of our state in the eyes of the world?</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
