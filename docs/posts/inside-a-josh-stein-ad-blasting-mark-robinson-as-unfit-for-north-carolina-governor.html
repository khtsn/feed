    <h1>Inside a Josh Stein Ad Blasting Mark Robinson as ‘Unfit’ for North Carolina Governor</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>It is one of the most explosive contests in the country: the race for North Carolina governor. And that is largely because of Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee, who has long history of making incendiary remarks. His Democratic opponent, Attorney General Josh Stein, began running </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnyURFiANKI&amp;t=30s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>this 30-second ad</em></a><em> portraying Mr. Robinson as unfit for public office, even before </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/us/politics/mark-robinson-north-carolina-gubernatorial-race.html?searchResultPosition=38" title=""><em>reports that Mr. Robinson had once called himself a “black NAZI,” defended slavery and written a host of other scandalous posts on a pornographic website.</em></a><em> The Stein campaign has spent more than $2 million running the ad since Sept. 12.</em></p><p><em>Here’s a look at the ad, its accuracy and its main takeaway.</em></p><h2 id="link-2c6436f">On the Screen</h2><p>The ad opens with white capital letters quickly unfurling across a black screen: “Is this who you want as your governor?”</p><p>Video clips follow showing Mr. Robinson loudly delivering speeches — shouting, really — in different settings. In the first few, he is wearing a suit. In the last, he is in a polo shirt.</p><p>His name is shown, and his words are subtitled.</p><p>“Mark Robinson is extreme,” a headline says, again in white type on a black screen. The word “extreme” flips and is replaced by “dangerous,” and then by “unhinged.”</p><p>As a close-up of Mr. Robinson again shouting, “Some folks need killing!” fills the screen, a final headline flashes across it in capital letters:</p><p>“Mark Robinson is unfit to be governor.”</p></div></div>
