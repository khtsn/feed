All three men are 18 and from Los Angeles County. They will face murder charges.</p><p>They were arrested Thursday and were being held on $2 million bond, jail records show. A fourth man, Frank Olano, 22, was arrested on an accessory charge for helping at least one of the suspects evade the authorities.</p><p>Mr. Wactor was gunned down at around 3:25 a.m. on May 25 when he returned to his parked vehicle after finishing a shift at a downtown Los Angeles bar where he worked. The 37-year-old came across three men who were in the middle of stealing his car’s catalytic converter.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“When Wactor arrived at his vehicle, he was confronted by three individuals who had Wactor’s vehicle raised up with a floor jack and were in the process of stealing the catalytic converter,” the police said. “Without provocation, the victim was shot by one of the individuals.”</p><p>The actor was walking with a co-worker and initially thought that his car was being towed, <a href="https://abc7.com/post/general-hospital-actor-johnny-wactor-killed-los-angeles-catalytic-converter-theft/14875210/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his mother, Scarlett Wactor</a>, told ABC7 news.</p><p>She added that one of the persons “looked up, he was wearing a mask, and opened fire.”</p><p>Mr. Wactor was transported to the hospital by emergency workers where he was pronounced dead.</p><p>The three men were able to get away in a stolen sedan, <a href="https://x.com/lapdcentral/status/1820488761559663034?s=46&amp;t=8H3FDbkvfJkXNtBv_SrGPg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the police said in August.</a></p><p>Mr. Wactor was known for appearing in more than 160 episodes of the soap opera “General Hospital” as the character Brando Corbin. He also appeared in other shows, including “Westworld” and in one episode of “Criminal Minds,” <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3619000/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to IMDb.</a></p><p>Catalytic converter thefts have become more common across America in recent years.</p><p>The emissions-control devices contain rare and expensive metals like palladium and rhodium, making them a hot target for thieves.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In a Thursday evening phone call, Ms. Wactor said she was glad to hear that the arrests had been made and said she hoped the men are convicted.</p><p>“It’s a great early birthday present for Johnny,” Ms. Wactor said.</p><p>Her son, she said, would have been 38 on Aug. 31.</p></div></div><div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Orlando Mayorquín is a breaking news reporter, based in New York, and a member of the 2023-24 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship class</a>, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/orlando-mayorquin">More about Orlando Mayorquín</a></span></p></div></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
