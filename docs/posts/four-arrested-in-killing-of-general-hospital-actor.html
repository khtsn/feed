All three men are 18 and from Los Angeles County. They will face murder charges.</p><p>They were arrested Thursday and were being held on $2 million bond, jail records show. A fourth man, Frank Olano, 22, was arrested on an accessory charge for helping at least one of the suspects evade the authorities.</p><p>Mr. Wactor was gunned down at around 3:25 a.m. on May 25 when he returned to his parked vehicle after finishing a shift at a downtown Los Angeles bar where he worked. The 37-year-old came across three men who were in the middle of stealing his car’s catalytic converter.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“When Wactor arrived at his vehicle, he was confronted by three individuals who had Wactor’s vehicle raised up with a floor jack and were in the process of stealing the catalytic converter,” the police said. “Without provocation, the victim was shot by one of the individuals.”</p><p>The actor was walking with a co-worker and initially thought that his car was being towed, <a href="https://abc7.com/post/general-hospital-actor-johnny-wactor-killed-los-angeles-catalytic-converter-theft/14875210/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his mother, Scarlett Wactor</a>, told ABC7 news.</p><p>She added that one of the persons “looked up, he was wearing a mask, and opened fire.”</p><p>Mr. Wactor was transported to the hospital by emergency workers where he was pronounced dead.</p><p>The three men were able to get away in a stolen sedan, <a href="https://x.com/lapdcentral/status/1820488761559663034?s=46&amp;t=8H3FDbkvfJkXNtBv_SrGPg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the police said in August.</a></p><p>Mr. Wactor was known for appearing in more than 160 episodes of the soap opera “General Hospital” as the character Brando Corbin.
