The clashes quickly escalated, with both countries hitting deeper into each other’s territory than at any time in the last 50 years.</p><p>On Saturday, President Trump announced that the two sides had agreed to a cease-fire with the help of American mediators and, as the first full day of the fragile truce appeared to hold on Sunday, congratulated them for halting the aggression. While the damage will take weeks and months to tally, especially in a space of media <a href="https://thewire.in/media/statement-by-the-wire-on-the-governments-blocking-and-unblocking-of-its-website" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blackouts</a> and extreme disinformation, here is what we know about how the clashes played out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-2a1b6b3a">The First Shots</h2><p>In its opening round of airstrikes, before dawn on Wednesday, India struck targets deeper inside the enemy territory than it had in decades, and by all accounts hit close enough to facilities associated with terrorist groups that it could claim victory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers examining the rubble of a mosque in Muridke, Pakistan, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">K.M. Chaudary/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It quickly became clear, though, that it had not been a clean strike but more of a protracted engagement between the two air forces — each side’s jets going at the other, with the boundary between them as a line that neither crossed. And India <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/asia/india-pakistan-attacks.html" title="">lost aircraft in the exchanges</a>, including at least two of its most advanced fighter jets. Indian officials have declined to comment on the details of their aircraft loss, but have not rejected reports that they lost jets.</p><p>The toll from the strikes was conflicting. India’s defense minister told a parliamentary briefing that they had killed “100 terrorists.” Pakistan put the death toll of India’s initial strikes around 30.</p><h2 id="link-198d4b61">The Escalations</h2><p>On the second day, as a diplomatic push for an off-ramp intensified, India said it had thwarted a Pakistani attempt overnight to hit military targets across a dozen border cities and towns. In response, it had taken the kind of action that analysts say almost always escalates a conflict: It struck sensitive military targets, particularly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/asia/india-pakistan-diplomacy-kashmir.html" title="">air defense systems in the Pakistani city of Lahore</a>.</p><p>“A move like that is quite strident and would have concerned Pakistani forces, because in other contexts, taking out air defenses is a prelude to more serious action,” said Kim Heriot-Darragh, a strategic and defense analyst at the <a href="https://aii.unimelb.edu.au/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Australia India Institute</a>. “You’d knock out defenses to open a corridor through which aircraft could fly and strike their actual target.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A house damaged by Pakistani artillery in Srinagar, in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mukhtar Khan/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Diplomats and analysts are uncertain about just how the events of early Thursday morning played out, but it is clear that something major had changed and was seen as an important shift in the pattern of escalation. Whether Pakistan was using a mass of drone incursions and missiles to actually try to hit India’s military sites or just to warn India and probe its air-defense systems for something bigger later is still unclear.</p><p>While attention was focused on the escalation in the skies, intense cross-border shelling inflicted heavy civilian casualties and forced tens of thousands of people to leave their homes in Kashmir.</p><p>Pakistan’s astonishing official response — a complete denial that it had done anything on the second night — left two explanations for the events: that it was just a probing mission that Pakistan did not want to distract from the actual retaliation that was coming, or that it was an initial retaliation that had not succeeded.</p><p>But India nonetheless took the opportunity to damage crucial Pakistani military sites, and with that all bets were off. Pakistan vowed it would retaliate. The only way the escalation could be arrested was the way it had always been: with an outside power stepping in to tell both sides to knock it off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-69542cf0">Alarm Over Strategic Sites</h2><p>On the nights of Friday and Saturday, the situation escalated rapidly to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-drones.html" title="">an air war with few holds barred</a>, but in which ground forces had not been moved.</p><p>Pakistan launched an immense campaign of drone and missile strikes, targeting military bases across several Indian cities — this time with acknowledgment from the Indian side that, although its air defenses had thwarted much of the barrage, there was damage to equipment and loss of security personnel.</p><p>Indian officials on Monday said they had lost five security forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke billowing after an explosion in Jammu in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anindito Mukherjee/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>There was evidence, including satellite images shown by the Indian military, that India had also managed to create damage on the Pakistani side, targeting air fields and more defense systems, and also striking near one of Pakistan’s crucial strategic headquarters. Pakistan, despite claims by India that it killed several Pakistani military personnel, has admitted only to damage of radars and military equipment.</p><p>While not commenting on the loss of military personnel, the office of Pakistan’s prime minister did announce monetary compensation packages for the “martyrs of the armed forces.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>What alarmed the United States, and intensified the diplomatic push for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/10/world/pakistan-india-kashmir" title="">the cease-fire that was announced late on Saturday</a>, was not only that the two sides were increasing strikes to sensitive sites but also just what the next step in a rapid escalation ladder for two alarmed nuclear powers could mean.</p><h2 id="link-6005424">What Is Ahead</h2><p>While the scores are still being tallied, and damage assessed, the four days may have fundamentally changed the reality of conflict in this part of the world toward <a href="https://x.com/bsdhanoa/status/1921424331264901609" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noncontact warfare</a>: barrages from a distance until the very last stages of battle, but still leading to escalation and the potential loss of restraint.</p><p>The abundance of new-generation technology, particularly cheap drones and loitering munitions, might initially suggest more precision targeting and less human cost. But in this latest India-Pakistan conflict, those technologies still prompted a rapid cycle of escalation that led to concerns that the use of nuclear weapons could be put on the table.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mujib Mashal is the South Asia bureau chief for The Times, helping to lead coverage of India and the diverse region around it, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
