At least 400 Palestinians, including children, were killed in the strikes, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry’s figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.</p><p>Hamas publicly announced the deaths of at least five senior officials among the group’s Gaza leadership. Two were officials in the group’s political bureau, and three others — including Bahjat Abu Sultan, the director of Hamas’s feared internal security agency — held senior security roles.</p><p>When Israel launched the strikes, some people were preparing a special meal before the daily Ramadan fast. Others were jolted out of their sleep. After two months of relative calm, the widespread explosions left Gazans with an unmistakable message: The war had returned, at least for now.</p><h2 id="link-31a65752">Why did Israel resume airstrikes on Gaza?</h2><p>The Israeli authorities explained the assault as a response to intransigence by Hamas in talks over extending the cease-fire.</p><p>The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel also said that Hamas had demonstrated a “repeated refusal” to release the rest of the hostages that it seized during its raid on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Around 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage in that attack, which began the war. “From now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” it said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That message was echoed by Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, who said that the cease-fire talks had reached a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/17/world/israel-gaza-airstrikes/927247df-d7cb-591e-b8c2-ef7f9abe0a14?smid=url-share" title="">dead end</a> and that Israel had “no alternative but to give the order to reopen fire.”</p><h2 id="link-4bde82df">How did cease-fire negotiations break down?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke rising west of Gaza City on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Al-Qattaa/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-cease-fire-assess.html" title="">talks stalled</a> because of disagreement over fundamental issues. Hamas, which has attempted to use the hostages as leverage throughout the conflict, has refused to release significant numbers of additional captives until Israel promised to permanently end the war.</p><p>Israel and Hamas had been negotiating the next steps in the truce. The next phase is supposed to end the war and free more hostages. But Mr. Netanyahu’s government has refused to agree to end the war unless Hamas gives up control of Gaza or dismantles its military wing.</p><p>Israel’s hand in the talks has been strengthened in recent weeks by backing from the Trump administration, which has delivered more weapons to the country. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Israel had consulted the White House before launching the strikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>To increase pressure on Hamas, Israel halted the delivery of aid and humanitarian supplies into Gaza earlier this month.
