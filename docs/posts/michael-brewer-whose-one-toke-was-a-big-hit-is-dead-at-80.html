He was 80.</p><p>His death was confirmed in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10101124803607563&amp;set=a.532442679653" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media post</a> by his longtime recording and performing partner, Tom Shipley. No cause was given.</p><p>While often categorized as a one-hit wonder, Brewer &amp; Shipley actually notched <a href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/brewer-and-shipley/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two other singles</a> on the Billboard Hot 100: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUbi4QeeN_c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Tarkio Road,”</a> which climbed to No. 55 in June 1970, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytt0FjpJPc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Shake Off the Demon,”</a> which sneaked in at No. 98 in February 1972.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Brewer, left, and Mr. Shipley met in a coffee house in Kent, Ohio.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The duo, who recorded many albums in the 1970s and a few more in the ’90s, were known for their songs’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_consciousness" title="Social consciousness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">socially conscious</a> lyrics on topics like the Vietnam War. But it was their sunny signature tune, with its indelible line “One toke over the line, sweet Jesus,” that etched them into pop-culture history.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At the outset, Mr. Brewer and Mr. Shipley considered the song anything but a potentially career-defining composition. “We wrote it literally entertaining ourselves and to make our <a href="https://abreathoffreshair.com.au/episodes/tony-orlando-michael-brewer-and-wars-lee-oskar/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">friends laugh</a>,” Mr. Brewer recalled in a 2022 interview on the music podcast “A Breath of Fresh Air.”</p><p>The two were between sets during a gig at a nightclub in Kansas City, Mo., when inspiration, fueled by some potent cannabis, hit.</p><p>“We were getting ready to go onstage for our fourth set,” Mr. Brewer said, “and a friend came by with some really good Lebanese hash. We stepped out back and took a couple of tokes and came back in to tune up for our last set, and Tom said, ‘Man, I’m one toke over the line.’ And I just cracked up.”</p><p>Mr. Brewer began improvising a melody around that line, and the next day the two banged out the song in about an hour.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the time, they were recording their third album, “Tarkio” (1970), and considered “One Toke” too trifling to commit to wax. They performed it live only out of necessity when they opened for the singer-songwriter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/arts/music/melania-brand-new-key-billboard-no-1.html" title="">Melanie</a> at Carnegie Hall not long afterward.</p><p>“We went over really well, had a couple of encores, and then we basically <a href="https://rockcellarmagazine.com/one-toke-over-the-line-more-than-a-one-hit-wonder/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ran out of songs</a>,” Mr. Brewer told Rockcellar magazine in 2012. “We said, ‘Let’s do that new song. Nothin’ to lose.’ So we did, and everybody loved it.”</p><p>To their surprise, their record label insisted that they include it on their forthcoming album. The next thing they knew, it was a single, which peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard singles chart in April 1971. But as Brewer &amp; Shipley would soon find out, that was a fraught era for drug songs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Charles Michael Brewer was born on April 14, 1944, in Oklahoma City, the eldest of four children. He played drums and sang in a rock band in high school before switching to guitar. After graduation in 1962, he began performing his own songs in coffee houses around the country and eventually met Mr. Shipley, who grew up near Cleveland, at one in Kent, Ohio.</p><p>Settling in San Francisco in 1965, Mr. Brewer formed the duo Mastin &amp; Brewer with the singer-songwriter Tom Mastin, whose song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWUa-rKT-oY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“How Do You Feel”</a> would be recorded by Jefferson Airplane. After moving to Los Angeles, the two signed with Columbia Records and formed a band that opened for top acts like the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Mastin, who suffered from depression, left the band before they could cut an album. Mr. Brewer then joined forces with Mr. Shipley, who by then was living near him in Los Angeles, and they signed on as staff songwriters for a publishing arm of A&amp;M Records.</p><p>“Michael and I were both Midwesterners, Midwestern values,” Mr. Shipley said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpPb6TSBQcg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“One Toke Over the Line … and Still Smokin’,”</a> a 2021 documentary about the duo. “Neither one of us were looking for stardom.”</p><p>Still, they started playing their own compositions around town and recorded their first album, “Down in L.A.,” released by A&amp;M in 1968.</p><p>The success of “One Toke Over the Line,” recorded after the duo returned to the Midwest, brought complications. In September 1970, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, in a speech in Las Vegas, warned that drug use was threatening “to sap our national strength” and called out a number of pop songs, including the Beatles’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPelLzokgMg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“With a Little Help From My Friends”</a> and the Byrds’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxyOhFBoxSY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Eight Miles High,”</a> as “latent drug culture propaganda.”</p><p>Within a year, under the Nixon administration, the Federal Communications Commission warned broadcasters about playing songs with lyrics that might promote drug use. As a result, “One Toke Over the Line” was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/11/archives/f-c-c-warning-on-drug-lyrics-brings-sharp-reaction-in-broadcast.html" title="">banned by radio stations</a> in Buffalo, Miami, Houston, Washington, Chicago, Dallas and New York. Brewer &amp; Shipley, Mr. Brewer said, came to embrace the crackdown as “a badge of honor.”</p><p>Information about his survivors was not immediately available.</p><p>The duo continued to perform for years, and Mr. Brewer also made a few albums as a solo artist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Their signature song lived on as a playful totem of the hippie era. It was featured in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/22/movies/film-review-a-devotedly-drug-addled-rampage-through-a-1971-vision-of-las-vegas.html" title="">“Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,”</a> the surrealistic 1998 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q-P9q1ASMM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drug odyssey</a> based on the classic stoner chronicle by Hunter S. Thompson, directed by Terry Gilliam and starring Johnny Depp.</p><p>Even more surreal was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRa_gC6y4CY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a performance of the song</a> on Lawrence Welk’s wholesome variety show in 1971. “One Toke Over the Line,” with its reference to “sweet Jesus,” had been mistaken for a religious song, and the perky singers Gail Farrell and Dick Dale smiled and bobbed their way through a bouncy rendition.</p><p>“And there you heard a modern spiritual,” Mr. Welk, the show’s baton-wielding host, said afterward.</p><p>Mr. Brewer and Mr. Shipley missed the broadcast, and Mr. Brewer said it took him decades to find a clip of the performance. When he finally viewed it, he told Rockcellar, “I sat there with my mouth open.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Brewer, left, and Mr. Shipley in later years.
