This year, weary and worried after a stretch of inflation and political uncertainty, they craved edible escapes they could afford.

They eat snacks when they should be eating meals. They embrace weird combinations like bao stuffed with Nashville hot chicken, and offbeat brand collaborations like <a href="https://www.katespade.com/products/heinz-x-kate-spade-new-york-3d-packet-crossbody/KH005.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kate Spade teaming up with Heinz ketchup</a>.
