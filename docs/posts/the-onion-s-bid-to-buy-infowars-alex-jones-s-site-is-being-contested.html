Since then, a flurry of court filings have put a spotlight on the final act of the bankruptcy proceedings, which have proved to be just as chaotic as those that preceded them.</p><p>The auction’s only other bidder, First United American Companies, which is associated with one of Mr. Jones’s online stores, is contesting the sale to The Onion’s parent company, Global Tetrahedron. The outcome of that effort will become clear after a hearing on Monday, set by Judge Christopher Lopez in a federal bankruptcy court in Houston, to review the bidding process.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Infowars auction is part of an effort to liquidate Mr. Jones’s business and personal assets to satisfy nearly $1.5 billion in damages awarded in 2022 to families of the victims of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Mr. Jones lied about the 2012 shooting for years, saying that the government staged it as a pretext for draconian gun control and that the families were complicit in the plot.</p><p>The families of 10 Sandy Hook victims sued Mr. Jones and his company, Free Speech Systems, in Texas and Connecticut. The Connecticut families and their lawyers are leading the effort to sell Infowars’ key assets to The Onion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A makeshift memorial near Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marcus Yam for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/business/media/the-onion-print-paper.html" title="">The Onion</a> plans to reintroduce Infowars early next year as a parody of itself, mocking “weird internet personalities” like Mr. Jones who traffic in misinformation and health supplements, Mr. Collins said in an interview last week.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Jones did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Mr. Collins said Global Tetrahedron had been selected as the winning bidder last week, adding that the sale was continuing as part of “standard processes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last Thursday, at an emergency hearing to contest The Onion’s bid, it emerged that First United had made a cash offer of $3.5 million. That is exactly twice the $1.75 million in cash offered by The Onion, a figure that was secret until the court battle dragged on. The Onion had sweetened the total value of its bid to $7 million with the backing of the Sandy Hook families, who essentially opted to put a portion of their potential earnings from the judgment against Mr. Jones toward The Onion’s bid.</p><p>After his website came back online last week, Mr. Jones staged a re-entry to his Infowars headquarters carrying a sink, echoing a video that Elon Musk posted online after he bought Twitter, now called X. Lawyers for X, which restored Mr. Jones’s once-banned account last year, made an appearance at the hearing last week to notify the court that the social network was reserving its rights with regard to the sale of Mr. Jones’s personal account.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alex Jones, the founder of Infowars, was sued by the families of 10 Sandy Hook shooting victims, leading to the effort to sell Infowars’ key assets.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nic Antaya for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Lawyers for the Connecticut families and Christopher R. Murray, the court-appointed trustee who ran the sale, argued that The Onion’s bid package created more value for the creditors, the goal of any bankruptcy. The Jones-affiliated bidder has said it was not given an opportunity to counter The Onion’s bid.</p><p>Lawyers for the two sides filed another deluge of legal filings this week. Mr. Murray sought to pre-empt the hearing entirely in a motion asking the judge to declare The Onion the winner. First United repeated its accusations that the families, their Connecticut lawyers and the trustee had improperly colluded and “rigged” the bidding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A rambling subsequent filing from First United traced Mr. Jones’s six-year court battle with the families, including claims that the lawsuits were part of a conspiracy by Democrats and the “deep state” to silence him and kill off his business.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, the Texas comptroller’s office requested copies of court records and notified the bankruptcy court that it intended to appear in the case.</p><p>Mr. Jones, a supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, has told his audience that Mr. Trump’s allies also oppose the sale. “Trump is pissed, and they’re all watching this,” he said on his first broadcast after the Infowars website was restored.</p><p>On Friday, Infowars featured remarks by Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department lawyer integral to Mr. Trump’s failed efforts to reverse the result of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>“I think people should be looking over their shoulder and thinking about whether they really want to be doing this, to shut down an important media operation,” said Mr. Clark, who is director of litigation at the Trump-allied Center for Renewing America.</p><p>Kitty Bennett<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elizabeth Williamson is a feature writer for The Times, based in Washington.
