			<p>Nah FR. Especially after how he went after him so passively post kick off.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t even think there&#39;s actual evidence that showed FNS was ever a good caller. 100% not in the last two years, and it seems like he&#39;s actually worsened as far as his mechanics go.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m just a hater, but I hope we have less entitled &#39;veterans&#39; of VCT, and more people who prove they deserve to be there week by week. Way too many irrelevant names from 2+ years ago that can&#39;t compete now.</p>
<p>Also, I started watching Ethan when that kid was like 16, first joining CLG in CS, and he just seems like a douchebag now.</p>
<p>Get these frauds out, keep Mada, build a roster without a superiority complex.</p>		</div></div>
