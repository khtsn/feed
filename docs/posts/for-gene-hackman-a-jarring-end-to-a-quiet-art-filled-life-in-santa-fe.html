Some had been expecting to get word of his death from Ms. Arakawa one of these days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>So it was shocking for them to learn this week that Mr. Hackman, 95, had been found dead in the mud room of his home in Santa Fe and that Ms. Arakawa, 65, had been found dead in a bathroom near an open prescription bottle and scattered pills. One of the couple’s dogs, a German shepherd, was found dead in a nearby closet.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/27xp-hackman-death-gphw/27xp-hackman-death-gphw-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The caller described seeing a body on the floor and urged emergency services to quickly send help.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Mark J.

The couple’s two-story home is ensconced in trees, providing privacy from nearby homes and the winding neighborhood roads.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Hackman served on the board of the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and spoke at its opening in 1997.  </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via The Georgia O&#39;Keeffe Museum</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Today, some of his paintings — including landscapes and portraits and a brightly colored scene of women lounging by blue and green waves — can be seen in a Santa Fe restaurant called Jinja, which he and Ms. Arakawa had invested in.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He served on the board of the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum, one of Santa Fe’s main cultural destinations, for about seven years, and <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/558233572/?match=1&amp;terms=%22gene%20hackman%22%20AND%20georgia%20o%27keefe%20museum%20santa%20fe" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called the museum</a> a reminder “of the striking beauty of this land and the way she saw it” when he spoke at the museum’s opening in 1997.</p><p>“In the 10 years I’ve lived here, I’ve been taken with the excitement and indomitable spirit of this place,” Mr. Hackman said at the opening, according to <a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/opinion/editorials/25-years-on-okeeffe-legacy-thrives/article_3327e9e0-03ac-11ed-af39-1f9d39006420.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an account in the Santa Fe New Mexican</a>.</p><p>Mr. Hackman’s life in Santa Fe began in the late 1980s, shortly after his first marriage ended in divorce. He was drawn to the area after filming there, and he eventually became a part of the city’s vibrant artistic circles.</p><p>“It was wonderful camaraderie,” said Susan Contreras, a local painter whose husband, Elias Rivera, would host artists, including Mr. Hackman, for painting and drawing sessions in his studio.</p><p>He had distinct views about how things should look. An <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/gene-hackman-santa-fe-home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Architectural Digest article</a> from 1990 about a property he bought near Santa Fe described how he worked to demolish the existing home and commissioned architects to design a new one for him and Ms. Arakawa. “He occasionally mixed colors on his own palette to show the workmen precisely what he wanted,” the article said</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The couple married in 1991, the same year she graduated with a master’s degree in liberal arts from St. John’s College in New Mexico.</p><p>Locals grew used to seeing Mr. Hackman around town, Mr. Lanham said, though there would sometimes be paparazzi or the odd person following him around a grocery store.</p><p>With his friends, he tended to be self-effacing and open to any questions about his past, they said. One longtime friend, Tom Allin, said Mr. Hackman would tell a story about a time before movie stardom, when he got a job that required him to dress up as a toy soldier outside F.A.O. Schwarz in New York around Christmastime.</p><p>He was standing on the sidewalk in costume — red-circled cheeks and all — when his old drill sergeant from the Marine Corps passed by. Mr. Hackman tried to dodge the sergeant, as the story goes, but he was recognized and his old drill sergeant barked, “Hackman! I knew you’d never amount” to anything.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Hackman, right, and his longtime friend, Daniel Lenihan, in a Santa Fe cafe discussing one of the books they wrote together. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sarah Martone/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>He undoubtedly did amount to something.

The pair wrote several books together, including a <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Escape_from_Andersonville/STI62hb9FVkC?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Civil War novel</a> about a Union officer’s escape from a Confederate prison camp and a 19th-century <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Wake_of_the_Perdido_Star/ZDvUiLxioWwC?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sea adventure novel</a>.</p><p><strong>“</strong>He was pretty intense about everything he did, and he liked to do it right,” Mr. Lenihan said.</p><p>Mr. Lenihan’s wife, Barbara Lenihan, started a home décor business in Santa Fe with Ms. Arakawa, offering designer bedding and other kinds of textiles.</p><p>Friends described Ms. Arakawa as Mr. Hackman’s fierce protector, especially as he grew older. In 2012, after Mr. Hackman was struck by a car while biking, Ms. Arakawa dressed up as a nurse to get in and out of a hospital without attracting the attention of photographers, Mr. Allin recalled.</p><p>He said the couple had a hand signal that Mr. Hackman would use if he needed to get out of an uncomfortable conversation with a fan. Ms. Arakawa was intent on keeping him eating healthy, and his friends recalled him sneaking the occasional muffin or cinnamon bun when she was not there.</p><p>“He said many times that he would have been dead without Betsy,” Mr. Allin said, who noted that in recent years he typically communicated with Mr. Hackman through his wife because he did not think Mr. Hackman had a cellphone or email address.</p><p>After Mr. Allin and his wife moved out of New Mexico, Mr. Hackman gave them a painting he made of a pinyon pine among some shrubs in front of a pastel purple mountain range. “Tesuque’s calling,” Mr. Hackman wrote, referring to his old neighborhood north of Santa Fe.</p><p>He was urging his friends to return.</p><p>Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julia-jacobs">More about Julia Jacobs</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-death-new-mexico.html">15</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-death-new-mexico.html">15</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
