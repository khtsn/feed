In its rank mendacity, political hypocrisy, naked self-dealing and wretched example, it typifies so much of what so many Americans have come to detest about what the MAGA world calls “the swamp.”</p><p>Start with the mendacity. Last December, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, insisted, “I’ve been very clear: The president is not going to pardon his son.” The president reiterated the point in early June, when <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-tells-muir-wont-pardon-son-hunter/story?id=110904482&amp;cid=social_twitter_wnt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he told ABC’s David Muir that he would not pardon Hunter</a> if his son was convicted, as he later was, of three felony charges related to his purchase of a gun while he was addicted to drugs. The younger Biden also faced separate criminal tax charges.</p><p>It was always a good bet that the president would break his word as soon as it was politically safe to do so. But he doubled down on dishonesty in his statement about the pardon, claiming Hunter’s prosecution was a result of “political pressure” on the judicial process. Nonsense. The charges stem from Hunter’s reckless lifestyle, abetted and financed by his willingness to trade shamelessly on the family name. A previous plea agreement between Hunter and federal prosecutors fell apart last year under scrutiny from a federal judge.</p><p>More obnoxious is the hypocrisy. Every year, federal prosecutors file hundreds of cases against persons charged with lying on the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/4473-part-1-firearms-transaction-record-over-counter-atf-form-53009/download" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Firearms Transaction Record</a>, or Form 4473, which is required from anyone buying a firearm from a licensed gun dealer. In 1993, then-Senator Biden made that form a key part of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. How is it that the same president who made both<em> </em>gun control and <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/irs-wealthy-tax-cheats/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stricter tax enforcement</a> key parts of his political message suddenly sees his own son’s transgressions as nuisance offenses?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As for the self-dealing, it’s touching that the president invoked his feelings as “a father” in letting his son off the legal hook. Too bad that luxury isn’t available to so many other parents who watch helplessly as their children run afoul of the law — and pay the legal consequence.</p><p>After the news of the pardon broke, a liberal friend wrote to say that perhaps it wasn’t such a big deal, at least when considering Donald Trump’s choices for attorney general and F.B.I. director. OK. But when a Democratic president behaves as Biden just did, it fuels the corrosive public cynicism that helped elect Trump yet again while licensing and excusing whatever plans the president-elect may have for politicizing justice and using it for the benefit of friends, family, and self.</p><p>What a degrading finale for Biden’s feeble, forgettable, frequently foolish presidency.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Bret Stephens is an Opinion columnist for The Times, writing about foreign policy, domestic politics and cultural issues. <span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bret-Stephens-1897344563844527" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
