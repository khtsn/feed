He approached a group of four people, produced a handgun, and opened fire, striking both of our decedents. After the shooting, the suspect then entered the museum and was detained by event security. Free, free Palestine. Free, free Palestine. The couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of “free Palestine,” is a young couple about to be engaged. The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. I have been worried for the past few months that something like this would happen. There is a direct line connecting antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement to this murder. This incitement is also done by leaders and officials of many countries and international organizations, especially from Europe.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21dc-shooting-03-qlwt/21dc-shooting-03-qlwt-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The shooting occurred on a street outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Allison Robbert for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3fee16dc">What happened?</h2><p>The shooting happened just after 9 p.m. on a street outside the Capital Jewish Museum, where the American Jewish Committee was hosting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/22/us/israel-embassy-shooting-dc/before-they-were-killed-the-two-diplomats-had-attended-a-reception-on-humanitarian-diplomacy?smid=url-share" title="">a reception for young diplomats</a>.

Smith, the chief of the Metropolitan Police Department. Mr. Rodriguez told the police where he had discarded the gun, she added.</p><p>Mr. Rodriguez <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/israeli-embassy-shooting-suspect.html?smid=url-share" title="">worked</a> for a health care nonprofit organization and previously held jobs in production, research and writing, according to his online profile. An online job biography said he was born and raised in Chicago and had graduated from the University of Illinois, Chicago, with a degree in English.</p><p>He posted video from a pro-Palestinian march in Chicago on X in 2023.</p><p>F.B.I. agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/22/us/israel-embassy-shooting-dc/federal-agents-descend-on-the-suspects-apartment-building-in-chicago?smid=url-share" title="">arrived</a> on Thursday morning at the Chicago apartment that records indicated was Mr. Rodriguez’s home.<span>  </span>Agents blocked the sidewalk in front of the brick apartment building, and some were seen going in and out of the apartment, including two F.B.I. agents in full tactical gear. Bomb technicians were also present.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the window of the unit that appeared to be Mr. Rodriguez’s were two signs related to Palestine, including one that read, “Justice for Wadea,” a reference to the 6-year-old Palestinian American boy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/illinois-hate-crime-sentencing.html" title="">killed in Chicago in 2023</a>. Another sign read, “Tikkun Olam means free Palestine.” (Tikkun Olam is a Hebrew phrase that means “repairing the world.”)</p><p>At his arraignment on Thursday in federal court in Washington, Mr. Rodriguez was represented by a public defender. He calmly told Magistrate Judge Matthew J. Sharbaugh his background and listened solemnly as the judge told him he faced the possibility of the death penalty in connection with a list of crimes.</p><p>Mr. Rodriguez entered no plea.</p><h2 id="link-1f99b59e">Who were the victims?</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/world/middleeast/israel-embassy-dc-shooting-victims-sarah-milgrim-yaron-lischinsky.html?smid=url-share" title="">Mr. Lischinsky, 30, and Ms. Milgrim, 26</a>, were two employees of the Israeli Embassy.

They had been scheduled to travel this weekend to Jerusalem, where Ms. Milgrim was planning to meet Mr. Lischinsky’s parents for the first time, Mr. Leiter said.</p><p>Mr. Lischinsky was buried on Sunday near his family home west of Jerusalem.

Since the attacks, Israel has waged a 19-month bombing campaign and aid blockade that the Gazan health ministry says has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians. The tolls from Gazan officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>Across the world, offenses against Jewish people and property have increased since the 2023 attack on Israel and subsequent war. Groups that monitor hate crimes have logged tens of thousands of episodes, including cases of verbal abuse, a torrent of online attacks on social media, Nazi-themed vandalism, personal threats and violent attacks resulting in injury and death.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-7e4764e6">What is the reaction in Israel?</h2><p>Israeli officials expressed shock and described the shooting as an antisemitic act of terrorism.</p><p>“I’ve been worried for the past few months that something like this would happen, and it did,” said Gideon Saar, Israel’s foreign minister.</p><p>At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Saar drew a connection between the killings on Wednesday and pro-Palestinian protests that have taken place in the United States and other countries since Israel went to war against Hamas.</p><p>“This is the direct result of toxic antisemitism against Israel and Jews around the world that has been going on since the Oct. 7 massacre,” he said.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel ordered stronger security for Israeli diplomatic missions around the world, <a href="https://x.com/IsraeliPM_heb/status/1925428905231401069" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his office said</a>.</p><p>Many Israelis have become more wary about traveling overseas, fearing that their nationality could put them in danger.
