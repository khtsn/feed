Looking grim and murmuring “incredible,” she walked briskly out of the courtroom before the judges had completed reading her sentence.</p><p>She did not address the dozens of camera crews outside the courtroom, but she was expected to speak on French television on Monday evening. She had spoken of her “serenity” before the hearing but there was little evidence of that.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.ifop.com/publication/les-intentions-de-vote-a-lelection-presidentielle-5/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion poll</a> on the presidential election published on Sunday gave Ms. Le Pen 34 to 37 percent of the vote, more than 10 points ahead of her nearest rival. President Emmanuel Macron is term-limited and cannot run again.</p><p>Ms. Le Pen has denied any wrongdoing in the case, which involved accusations that her party, the National Rally, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/europe/le-pen-eu-france-embezzlement-trial.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">misused several million euros</a> in European Parliament funds between 2004 and 2016. Ms. Le Pen was not found guilty of personally enriching herself but of overseeing a complex scheme to pay party staffers with money intended for aides to European lawmakers.</p><p>The court also sentenced Ms. Le Pen, 56, to four years in prison, with two of those years suspended. The court said the other two could be served under a form of house arrest. She was fined 100,000 euros, or about $108,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Le Pen’s electoral ineligibility is effective immediately. As a result, she will only be able to run in 2027 if she secures a more lenient ruling on appeal — which is difficult but not impossible. The appeals process is slow in France, and even if a new trial took place before the election, it is unclear whether the prosecution’s case would be overturned.</p><p>The presiding judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, acknowledged that a politician prevented from running for office might later win on appeal, and she said the tribunal could not be indifferent to “the need to seek social consensus.”</p><p>But the gravity of the case, and the apparent refusal of those accused to acknowledge the facts, made political disqualification necessary, the judge said. The court has to “insure that elected officials, like any citizen, do not benefit from any favorable treatment,” she noted.</p><p>The verdict could usher in a period of renewed political turmoil if Ms. Le Pen decides to lash out against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/europe/france-government-no-confidence-vote.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">France’s fragile government</a> or if anger spills over into the streets. The government struggled to pass a budget this year and could still be toppled at any time by lawmakers in the lower house, the National Assembly, where Ms. Le Pen’s party is the single largest.</p><p>The verdict does not affect her current mandate as a lawmaker in the lower house. But if Mr. Macron calls snap parliamentary elections, as he did last year, she will not be eligible to run again. Given the current impasse in a divided assembly, such a dissolution this year is plausible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Le Pen and her party stood accused of embezzling a sum close to $5 million in European Parliament funds over more than a decade. But the accusations did little to hinder the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/world/europe/rural-france-national-rally-appeal.html?searchResultPosition=7" title="">National Rally’s rise</a> from the fringes of French politics to its heart.</p><p>Ms. Le Pen has endeavored to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/world/europe/france-national-rally-rebranding.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">rebrand the party</a>, founded in 1972 by her father, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/world/europe/jean-marie-le-pen-dead.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>, steering it away from its antisemitic and racist roots. Its platform, however, has remained resolutely hard right, calling for extreme toughness on crime and drastic measures against immigration.</p><p>The court ruled that Ms. Le Pen had played a “central role” in the scheme to siphon funds from the European Parliament and to fill up its coffers at a time when they were precariously empty. Ms. Le Pen was a European lawmaker from 2004 to 2017.</p><p>The party used lawmaker assistants who were paid with European Parliament funds to perform tasks for the party that were unrelated to E.U. business, the court ruled.</p><p>It also rejected Ms. Le Pen’s argument that the case was a political witch hunt.</p><p>“No one is on trial for engaging in politics,” Judge de Perthuis said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Roger Cohen is the Paris Bureau chief for The Times, covering France and beyond.
