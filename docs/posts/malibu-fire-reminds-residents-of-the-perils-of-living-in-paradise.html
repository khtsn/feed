A tree shredder still stood there on Wednesday next to a pile of mulch that firefighters had doused with water.</p><p>“The irony is that we were cutting back in case of a fire,” Mr. Woodward said in a telephone interview from Florida. “We were about two days from being done. We were hauling everything away.”</p><p>The 6,000-square-foot home in Malibu, he said, served as a refuge for his family to unwind.</p><p>“The home was like a relaxed place to bring your blood pressure down and a chill place to be,” Mr. Woodward said. A Franciscan retreat up the hill has spectacular views, and the neighborhood itself is a great place for walks, he said.</p><p>Winds remained mostly calm on Wednesday morning in Malibu, where a long stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway remained closed, as the sun tried to peek through scattered layers of smoke and clouds.</p><p>In the hills above, a home on Mariposa De Oro Street was among the buildings that were destroyed in the Franklin fire. Firefighters on Wednesday were dousing hot spots on the property.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A neighbor, Alec Gellis, 31, said on Wednesday that he was trying to help remove a Lamborghini from the property for safekeeping at the owner’s request. He said he and other neighbors were trying to get a key delivered for the sports car or to put it in neutral to push it.</p><p>“Just running on adrenaline,” said Mr. Gellis, who said he had slept only four hours in the last 48 hours after he stayed behind to spray homes with water from his pool. “I don’t even feel that tired.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Malibu residents were surveying damage and living under a cloud of smoke on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Crews of inmates helped to prevent further damage in an area that had burned on the Pepperdine University campus.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>No injuries or deaths have been reported in connection with the Franklin fire, officials said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>About 18,000 residents were in the mandatory or voluntary evacuation zones.

Luna of Los Angeles County urged residents in the area to continue to monitor evacuation orders. The partial containment of the fire, Sheriff Luna said, was “a step in the right direction.”</p><p>“But this is still an ongoing situation,” he said. “Stay alert.”</p><p>Chief Marrone said that officials would closely monitor strong winds and low humidity throughout Wednesday, adding that the fire could spread to new areas if the winds shifted. Crews have also had to battle steep terrain in the Santa Monica Mountains above Malibu.</p><p>Some of the strongest winds appeared to have passed on Tuesday, according to weather reports, but the dry conditions could continue to fuel the Franklin fire before a chance of rain on Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Woodward said that he planned to return home this weekend and sift through the rubble of his five-bedroom, five-bath house. He hopes to find the important things: family memorabilia.</p><p>Two of his four children returned Wednesday to the site and found an album in the debris.</p><p>“So that’s a start,” Mr. Woodward said with a laugh. “Life is short. Material things only matter so much, and I am looking optimistically to finding five to 10 pictures.”</p><p>Judson Jones<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jesus Jiménez covers breaking news, online trends and other subjects.
