    <h1>Democrats Choose a Political Operator From Minnesota as Their New Leader</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Democratic National Committee on Saturday elected Ken Martin as its chairman, tapping a low-profile political insider from Minnesota to guide the party forward after its crushing defeats last fall.</p><p>Mr. Martin, 51, triumphed in a 75-day contest that turned less on why Democrats lost to President Trump for a second time than on internal relationships and mechanics in the 448-member Democratic National Committee.</p><p>The committee raises tens of millions of dollars every year and can help set the tone of the party. It provides infrastructure and financial support for down-ballot candidates in off years before building an operation for a presidential nominee.</p><p>Mr. Martin captured the chairmanship on the strength of his yearslong relationships with party members, whose affection he won by promising to focus more on their concerns than past leaders have.</p></div></div>
