    <h1>When to Report, and When to Help Out</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So far, I’ve been able to check on about six places. At one point, I drove up a winding street into the hills to check on a property. A few blocks in, a power line blocked the road. It felt like a waste to turn back. So I got out of my car, and walked the rest of the way.</p><p>A few homes on the street were still standing, so I thought there was a chance of good news for the person who had reached out to me on social media. But as I rounded a corner, I saw the remains of a home actively on fire, burning quietly. I couldn’t see a street address, so I wasn’t positive it was the right one. I sent a video to the woman who had asked me to check on it — her grandmother had lived there for 60 years.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I think it’s gone,” I wrote. “It might be this one burning.”</p><p>She confirmed that it was. She was surprised I actually showed up in person — she thought I’d send a drone. She was grateful, and she asked me to be careful. </p></div></div>
