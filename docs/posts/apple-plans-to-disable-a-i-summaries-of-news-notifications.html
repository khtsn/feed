The call came after the BBC sent readers a notification about Luigi Mangione, the man arrested in the killing of Brian Thompson, the health insurance executive, in New York City.

Last year, Google unveiled a chatbot that recommended people eat rocks and use glue to make pizza. Microsoft postponed features in an A.I. computer because of security vulnerabilities. And Humane, a start-up that raised $240 million for a device called the Ai Pin, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/technology/humane-ai-pin.html" title="">panned by tech reviewers</a> because its system sometimes fielded requests inaccurately.</p><p>The early struggles with A.I. products have fueled questions about the technology’s near-term potential. The technology, which can answer questions, create images and write code, has been heralded for its potential to disrupt businesses and create trillions of dollars in economic value. But some on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/technology/ai-jim-covello-goldman-sachs.html" title="">Wall Street and in Silicon Valley</a> have expressed doubts about whether A.I. will quickly produce enough benefits to justify its staggering costs.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
