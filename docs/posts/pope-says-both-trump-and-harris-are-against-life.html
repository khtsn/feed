And we must speak clearly about these things.”</p><p>The remarks came as Francis, 87, concluded a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/asia/francis-pope-asia-trip.html" title="">grueling 11-day tour of the Asia</a>-Pacific region that included stops in Jakarta, East Timor and Singapore, showcasing his commitment to reach out to the faithful in what he calls “the peripheries” and to build a less Eurocentric church that looks to Asia.</p><p>His stance on the American presidential race reflects the divide among Catholic voters in the United States, who in previous elections have been just as split between the parties as the larger electorate. The American bishops’ conference similarly advises Catholics to take the array of church teaching into account in the voting booth and does not endorse candidates — although some bishops weigh in more explicitly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Francis described the rejection of migrants as a “grave sin” and “cruelty,” and abortion as “murder.” He said that both “are against life” and clearly wrong.</p><p>But when asked whether it would be morally admissible to vote for someone who favored the right to abortion, he responded: “One must vote. And one must choose the lesser evil. Which is the lesser evil? That lady or that gentleman? I don’t know. Each person must think and decide according to his or her own conscience.”</p><p>Francis did not mention either candidate by name.</p><p>Francis was also asked about the situation in Gaza, where more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in 11 months of the war that began after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7 last year.</p><p>“When you see the bodies of children killed, when you hear that schools are bombed because guerrillas might be inside, it’s horrifying. It’s horrible, it’s horrible,” Francis said.</p><p>“It’s sometimes said that this is a defensive war, but sometimes I believe that it’s a war, too much, too much,” the pope said, his words faltering. “I apologize for saying this, but I don’t see steps being taken toward peace.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Francis added that he spoke every day to a parish in Gaza where both Christians and Muslims attend its schools. “They tell me horrible stories, difficult things,” he said, adding that the Holy See had been working to help mediate a cease-fire.</p><p>Francis’s views on abortion and migration were nothing new. But they became particularly relevant in the context of the coming elections in the United States, in which both are central issues.</p><p>“Both are against life: the one that throws out migrants and the one that kills children,” Francis said.</p><p>The Roman Catholic Church considers abortion a grave sin, and Francis has often referred to abortion as murder, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/world/europe/pope-abortion-sick-fetus.html" title="">even in the case of a fetus that is ill or has pathological disorders</a>. In 2018, he <a href="https://www.ncregister.com/news/pope-francis-abortion-is-like-hiring-a-hitman" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">compared abortion</a> to contracting “a hit man to solve a problem,” and in his most recent papal document, issued this year, he firmly restated the church’s rejection of abortion, the death penalty and euthanasia.</p><p>At the same time, he has made the plight of migrants a centerpiece of his papacy, urging compassion and charity for the millions who have been forced to leave their homelands because of war, poverty or famine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>His first trip as pope, in 2013, was to Lampedusa, the island off Italy that in recent decades has become the entry point to Europe for countless migrants crossing the Mediterranean. There, he denounced the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/world/europe/pope-offers-mass-on-island-beacon-for-refugees.html" title="">globalization of indifference</a>” to their plight.</p><p>He has since relentlessly denounced human trafficking and called for safe migration routes, and has said repeatedly that rejecting migrants is a grave sin. Last month, speaking to his last general audience before the trip to Asia and the Pacific, Francis told those present in St. Peter’s Square, “It needs to be said clearly: There are those who systematically work by all means to drive away migrants, and this, when done knowingly and deliberately, is a grave sin.”</p><p>Francis has put caring for migrants and opposing abortion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/world/europe/pope-francis-migrants-abortion.html" title="">on equal footing,</a> saying in a 2018 document that both were holy pursuits.</p><p>It is also not the first time Francis inserted himself into a United States presidential race. In 2016, during the Republican primary, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/world/americas/pope-francis-donald-trump-christian.html" title="">Pope Francis suggested</a> that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-fires-back-at-sharp-rebuke-by-pope-francis.html" title="">Mr. Trump</a> was “not Christian” because of his campaign promises to deport more immigrants and to force Mexico to pay for a wall along the border.</p><p>“A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” Francis said at the time, returning to Rome from Mexico on the papal plane.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/world/europe/pope-francis-biden-abortion.html" title="">in-flight news conference,</a> he weighed in on whether communion should be given to politicians like President Biden who support abortion rights, saying that he had never denied communion to anyone.</p><p>On Friday’s flight, Francis also talked about the Vatican’s relationship to China. He has sought to improve relations with the country but still has not visited it, despite reaching a groundbreaking and sharply criticized deal on the appointment of bishops that is set to be renewed in October. Francis has continued his outreach to Asia, completing on Friday his tour of about a dozen countries in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>“China is a promise and a hope for the church,” he said on Friday, adding that he was happy about the discussions they were having with the country. “I would love to visit China.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emma-bubola">More about Emma Bubola</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
