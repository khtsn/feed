Mr. Rudakubana was 17 at the time of the attack. Another law, designed to protect the right to a fair trial, bans the publication of information that could influence a jury. That rule, part of the 1981 Contempt of Court Act, is lifted once a defendant is found guilty or innocent.</p><p>Serena Kennedy, Merseyside’s chief constable, told the committee that the police disclosed on the evening of July 29 that the attacker had been born in Wales, but misinformation had already proliferated.</p><p>Ms. Kennedy said she had planned to make an announcement two days later clarifying that Mr. Rudakubana was not Muslim and that his parents were Christian. After notifying the Crown Prosecution Service, the body that brings criminal charges in England, an official told her the information should not be made public, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“This case highlights why we need to look at how we handle releases of information to the public, while also making sure that we do not impact on the criminal justice trial,” Ms. Kennedy said, adding that contempt laws did not “take account of where we are in terms of the impact of social media.”</p><p>In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service said that although an official expressed “different views” on the disclosure of Mr. Rudakubana’s religion, they did not tell the police it would bias a jury.</p><p>The statement added, “We support proposals for law reform which will make the application of contempt law clearer and simpler — especially when linked to heightened matters of general public interest such as public safety or national security.”</p><p>Since the Southport attack, the Law Commission of England and Wales has been conducting a review of the Contempt of Court Act.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>6</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>U.K. Laws Unfit for Social Media Age, Report Says<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
