during which many who have needed medical care were trapped.</p><p>Reopening the crossing at Rafah, which has long been Gaza’s <a

href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-what-we-know.html" title="">the cease-fire deal</a> between Israel and Hamas. Mediators hope that the agreement, which has begun with a 42-day cease-fire and hostage-for-prisoner swaps, will ultimately end the devastating 15-month-long war in Gaza.</p><p>As part of the truce, Israel agreed to reopen the Rafah crossing after the release of the remaining living female hostages held by Hamas, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/30/world/israel-hamas-hostage-release-gaza" title="">took place on Thursday</a>. Israel committed to allowing up to 50 sick and wounded Palestinian fighters to leave through Rafah per day, in addition to Palestinian women and children who need medical care.</p><p>The first group of Gazans was expected to leave on Saturday, now that European and Palestinian officials have conducted a trial run of the new arrangements at the crossing, according to two European diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the delicate preparations.</p><p>The World Health Organization said it hoped to bring around 50 critically injured and sick patients through the Rafah crossing on Saturday, but it did not identify them. Over 12,000 Gazans still need medical evacuation, the organization said.</p><p>“If we continue like this, at the pace we have, we will be busy for the next 15 years,” Rik Peeperkorn, the top W.H.O. official for the West Bank and Gaza, told reporters by videoconference.</p><p>Hamas had overseen the border between Gaza and Egypt since the group took full control of the enclave in 2007, after winning elections in 2006.

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel has resisted the notion that the Palestinian Authority would control postwar Gaza, despite the urging of the Biden administration. President Trump’s vision for who might rule the enclave after the conflict remains unclear.</p><p>The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said that the “practical involvement of the Palestinian Authority” would be only “its stamp on the passports.” Israeli forces would remain “positioned around the crossing” and no one would be allowed through without the approval of Israel’s security services, Mr. Netanyahu’s office said.</p><p>Omer Dostri, spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, confirmed that the crossing had been reopened to allow some people to leave. No people or commercial goods would be allowed into Gaza through Rafah for the time being, he wrote in a text message.</p><p>Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s top diplomat, <a href="https://x.com/kajakallas/status/1885267854355763235" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that the European border monitoring mission had deployed at the Rafah crossing on Friday to “support Palestinian border personnel.” The mission, known as EUBAM Rafah, has had practically no role at the border since the Hamas takeover in 2007.</p><p>In recent days, Mr. Trump has suggested on multiple occasions that Gazans should be evacuated from the enclave en masse and taken in by Jordan and Egypt.</p><p>“You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-jordan-egypt.html" title="">Mr. Trump said of Gaza</a> last weekend. “I don’t know. Something has to happen, but it’s literally a demolition site right now.”</p><p>On Friday, a small group of Egyptians demonstrated on their side of the Rafah border crossing as part of a protest against Palestinian displacement from Gaza. Rallies in autocratic Egypt are almost always staged or sponsored by the authorities.</p><p>Israeli forces swept into Rafah last May and captured the entire border corridor with Egypt, including the crossing. Israel accused Hamas of using its control of the border to smuggle in weapons to arm its forces and vowed not to allow the group to take over there again.</p><p>With the crossing shuttered, Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian officials held repeated rounds of talks but could not agree on terms to reopen the border. Gazans who had hoped to flee the devastated enclave were mostly trapped inside, although some sick and wounded people were allowed to leave through Israeli territory.</p><p>Others did not make it out in time. Fida Ghanem, a Palestinian woman suffering from cancer, was supposed to leave in May before the border crossing closed. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/rafah-palestinians-gaza-trapped.html" title="">died</a> in early June without access to treatment in Gaza.</p><p>Samah Saad, whose husband, Sameh, was struck in the leg by an artillery shell last year, has been waiting for months in the hope that the Rafah crossing might open and allow them to seek medical treatment abroad.</p><p>“We’ve been waiting for over a year without the right treatment. We’re exhausted,” said Ms. Saad, 37. “Let them open the crossing, by God, we’ve lived through enough.”</p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lebanon strikes</strong>: Amid the extension of a fragile cease-fire, Israel carried out a series of airstrikes overnight targeting the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, a bastion of support for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah that was hit hard during the war. Lebanon’s health ministry said that at least two people were killed and 10 others wounded in the attacks, which followed airstrikes in southern Lebanon earlier this week that injured two dozen people. The Israeli military said the overnight strikes had targeted an underground weapon-manufacturing facility used by Hezbollah, along with areas along the Syrian border used to smuggle weapons into Lebanon. The attacks came after Israel said it had intercepted a Hezbollah surveillance drone on Thursday that was approaching Israel’s northern border. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah.</p></li></ul><p>Nick Cumming-Bruce<!-- --> and <!-- -->Euan Ward<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
