They were advanced by the Biden administration, which also filed monopoly lawsuits against Amazon, Apple and Google’s ad technology business.</p><p>Investors in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/technology/tech-ceos-lobbying-trump.html" title="">hoped that Mr. Trump might show technology companies</a> more deference during his second term, as he promised to deregulate industries.

Mr. Ferguson, a lawyer who spent much of his career working for powerful Republican senators, has said he wants to increase scrutiny of the ways that social media companies decide to take posts down. Conservatives have complained for years that platforms like Facebook and YouTube disproportionately censor right-leaning viewpoints.</p><p>“I will throw every resource the agency has at prosecuting the cases against Big Tech that we’ve got going,” Mr. Ferguson said in an appearance on the Bloomberg podcast “Odd Lots” this year.</p><p>The new leader of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/senate-confirms-gail-slater-as-justice-depts-antitrust-lead.html" title="">Justice Department’s antitrust division, Gail Slater</a>, a veteran tech and media lawyer, worked in the White House during Mr. Trump’s first term.

The trial is expected to last into July and feature testimony from high-profile figures including Meta’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html" title="">sued Google in 2020</a> over claims that it had a monopoly in online search. A federal judge ruled for the government last year and will convene a roughly three-week hearing on how to address Google’s monopoly. The government has suggested that the company sell Chrome, among other measures. Google has proposed fewer restrictions and has said it plans to appeal.</p></li><li><p>The Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/24/technology/google-ads-lawsuit.html" title="">accused Google in 2023</a> of illegally dominating the advertising technology business.
