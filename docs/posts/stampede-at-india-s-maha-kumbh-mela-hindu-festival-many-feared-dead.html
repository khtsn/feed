In a brief speech on Wednesday, Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, said that some devotees had been “seriously injured,” but local news reports suggested that dozens had died.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“They were inviting us here to die,” said Ajay Singh, a farmer from the district of Gonda in Uttar Pradesh. “They invited devotees through media, channels, phones, newspapers,” but mismanaged the event, Mr. Singh said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He had been sleeping on the river banks with his family when the police began pushing people out. Mr. Singh’s mother, aunt and uncle fell down, and they all suffered injuries on their backs and ribs. He said he saw around five dead bodies when he was trapped.</p><p>The Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj, one of the world’s biggest religious gatherings, occurs every 12 years. Hindus believe that bathing at the spot where the two holy rivers meet, along with a third mythical river called Sarasvati, will purge them of all sins and help them attain salvation. Because of certain favorable celestial alignments, millions more were expected this year at the event, named the “Maha” or Great Kumbh.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Searching for personal belongings after the stampede.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atul Loke for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Although there are a number of days considered auspicious for bathing during the event, the period starting late Jan. 28 and heading into the morning of Jan. 29 was seen as especially favorable. Government officials had said they expected around 100 million people to come to the rivers then.</p><p>The government of the state of Uttar Pradesh, where Prayagraj is, estimated that around 400 million people in total would attend the six-week festival from all corners of India. To house them all, the government built a temporary city on the banks of the Ganges, with tents, toilets, streets, pontoon bridges and waste management facilities. The government also built temporary bathing platforms using sandbags to make it easier for people to step into the water.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Mr. Adityanath said the injured had been rushed to hospitals, but did not say if any had died. He appealed to pilgrims to perform their rituals at the nearest platform rather than pushing to get to the confluence, saying that the day’s significance lay in bathing anywhere along the Ganges. Mr. Adityanath said that Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the minister of home affairs, had called him several times for updates and offered assistance.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The danger posed by huge crowds has been a frequent problem at the Kumbh Mela and other religious events. In 2013, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/world/asia/deadly-stampede-at-the-hindu-festival-kumbh-mela.html" title="">42 people were killed</a> and 45 injured in a crowd crush on a train platform. And in July, more than 100 people were killed and many injured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/world/asia/deadly-stampede-at-the-hindu-festival-kumbh-mela.html" title="">during a prayer meeting</a> organized by a local guru that officials said owed to high temperatures and overcrowding.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Indian government officials said they had expected around 100 million people to visit two holy rivers on Tuesday and Wednesday for the festival.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atul Loke for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Government officials became much more organized and focused on the safety and security of pilgrims after the 2013 deaths. This year, the Uttar Pradesh government has employed more sophisticated technology to monitor the inflow and outflow of people so that police personnel on the ground can redirect crowds.</p><p>The pilgrims “come gradually and exit simultaneously,” said Vijay Vishwas Pant, a senior government official, on Tuesday. Millions of pilgrims had begun trickling in during the day, but there was no set formula for how the crowds would exit, Mr. Pant said. The goal was to keep pilgrims moving safely, he added. “It is all dynamic.”</p><p>Despite the precautions, festival employees and others were encouraging people to go toward the confluence of the rivers, with some even using the public address system to do so. Police officials were unable to clear the bathing areas before more pilgrims rushed in, officials said. As pilgrims tried to escape, they created stampede-like situations elsewhere, according to witness accounts.</p><p>The Kumbh Mela festival, which is rotated among four cities every three years, is known for the massive number of Hindu devotees who attend, including monks and ascetics from various orders of Hinduism and ordinary pilgrims.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hari Kumar covers India, based out of New Delhi.
