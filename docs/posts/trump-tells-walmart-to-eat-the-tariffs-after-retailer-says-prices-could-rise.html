But he cautioned that the company would not be able to “absorb all the pressure” imposed by the tariffs.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Walmart, which is based in Arkansas and has more than 4,000 stores in the United States, repeated on Saturday that the company would do its best to keep its prices from rising.</p><p>“We have always worked to keep our prices as low as possible and we won’t stop,” the spokeswoman, Molly Blakeman, said in a statement after Mr. Trump’s post. “We’ll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins.”</p><p>The company, which says it counts 90 percent of Americans as its customers, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/walmart-earnings-tariffs-consumer.html" title="">refrained</a> from projecting profits for its current quarter because of the tariffs. It has said its sales climbed by more than 3 percent, to $112 billion, in the most recent quarter, which ended last month, and it has projected that its revenue would grow by 3 to 4 percent this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>About a third of Walmart’s products come from abroad, John David Rainey, the company’s chief financial officer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/economy/walmart-trump-tariffs.html" title="">has said</a>. A large share of the imported products come from China and Mexico.</p><p>Many retailers have held off raising prices by stockpiling goods. Walmart is considered to be more insulated from the tariffs than some retailers because many of its groceries are sourced in the United States.</p><p>It is just one of several companies that have said they will be forced to pass on the costs of tariffs to consumers.</p><p>Ryan Sweet, the chief U.S. economist at the advisory firm Oxford Economics, said on Saturday that it was no surprise that the tariffs would begin to drive prices up, adding that businesses were never “going to eat all” the costs. They must choose between lifting prices and laying off workers, he said.</p><p>“It was the iceberg that we knew we were going to hit at some point,” Mr. Sweet said, adding, “This is just the beginning.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Grocery stores, in particular, will struggle to hold their prices given their “razor-thin” margins, he added.</p><p>After threatening an all-out trade war with China earlier this year, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/china-us-tariffs.html" title="">backed away last Monday</a>, at least temporarily, from imposing the most crushing tariffs on China.</p><p>But much of the trade between China and the United States, the world’s two largest economies, had been brought to a halt because of the tariffs.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Trump imposed a 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with a 125 percent tariff on American goods. On Monday, the countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/business/trump-china-tariff-deal-uncertainty.html" title="">reached a 90-day agreement</a> that lowered America’s tariff on Chinese products to 30 percent and China’s on American goods to 10 percent.</p><p>In recent days, Mr. Trump has sought a dialogue with President Xi Jinping of China to reach a trade deal. The president <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTupX3809s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in an interview</a> with Fox News aired on Friday that he was open to visiting China to meet with the Chinese leader.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/trump-tariffs-10-percent.html" title="">imposed</a> a minimum 10 percent tariff on many countries around the globe. In April, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-tariffs-stocks-china.html" title="">postponed for three months a suite</a> of tariffs on dozens of countries that had rattled investors and driven fears of an impending recession. But he did not back off on the tariffs on China until last Monday.</p><p>Mr. Trump has complained for decades that other countries have ripped off the United States in trade, and he has offered various justifications for his tariffs, which he imposed on adversaries and allies alike.</p><p>By placing tariffs on Canada and Mexico, he said, he was trying to force the countries to prevent unauthorized immigrants and drugs from entering the United States.</p><p>In the Fox News interview, Mr. Trump, who fashions himself a master deal-maker, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JOULysjmlM&amp;t=492s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said he had far-reaching ambitions</a> for his global trade policy.</p><p>“I’m using trade to settle scores and to make peace,” Mr. Trump said.</p><p>Danielle Kaye<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Ammo Makers in Balkan Valley: </strong>Companies that make ammunition in the Bosnian city of Gorazde <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/world/europe/bosnia-trump-tariffs-ammunition.html">fear they may not survive the tariffs</a> imposed on the goods that they send to their biggest market — the United States.</p></li><li><p><strong>Movie Tariffs</strong>: Hollywood offers a service, and services are what really drive the U.S. economy. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/business/trump-movie-tariffs-services-economy.html">President Trump’s proposed tax</a> could set off a second, and more damaging, trade war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trade in Asia:</strong> Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation nations, staring down U.S. tariffs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/business/trump-tariffs-apec-trade.html">jockeyed for time with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer</a> at a gathering in South Korea.</p></li><li><p><strong>How Business Owners Are Pivoting: </strong>An easing in President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods gave businesses some breathing room. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/tariffs-small-business.html">Long-term planning, though, is still on pause</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Warnings From Walmart</strong><strong>:</strong> The retail giant, known for its low prices, reported another quarter of solid sales, but cautioned that Trump’s tariffs will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/walmart-earnings-tariffs-consumer.html">push the company to start raising prices</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Booming Business of Returned Products:</strong> As retailers slow down orders for foreign goods because of tariffs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/tariffs-returns-reverse-logistics.html">companies that recirculate overstocked or returned items</a> may help fill the gap.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skepticism of American Meat:</strong> Despite a provisional agreement, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/us-uk-trade-deal-agriculture.html">differences in food production</a> could make it difficult for Britain and the United States to reach a more comprehensive trade agreement, and for American farmers to materially increase their exports to Britain.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
