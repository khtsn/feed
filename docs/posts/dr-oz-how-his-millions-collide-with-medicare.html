The for-profit company operating the call center, TZ Insurance Solutions, paid to be featured.</p><p>Dr. Oz even became a licensed broker for TZ Insurance in almost every state, according to regulatory filings newly unearthed by The New York Times, with the idea that he could sell plans directly to viewers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He may be one of America’s best-known daytime TV personalities, or “America’s doctor,” as Oprah Winfrey called him. But little is known about exactly how he monetized his fame over the years. All told, his business and family ventures are valued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/health/mehmet-oz-medicare-medicaid-stocks.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">in the neighborhood of roughly $90 million to $335 million.</a></p><p>An examination by The Times of his myriad financial interests revealed not only opaque ties with the industries he may soon regulate but also a coziness with health care companies that lawmakers have already highlighted in questioning his independence.</p><p>He has made tens of millions of dollars hawking dietary supplements on his show and on social media, often without any mention of his financial interest. He has been paid by medical device firms and health-related ventures, and his money was invested in a dizzying array of businesses. Many of those companies would be affected by any decisions he would make in the government post and many already benefit from agency funding.</p><p>In an attempt to avoid conflicts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/health/mehmet-oz-medicare-medicaid-stocks.html" title="">Dr. Oz disclosed on Wednesday</a> in ethics filings that he would sell his interests in more than 70 companies and investment funds. Those include as much as $600,000 in stock in UnitedHealth Group, the giant conglomerate that is the nation’s largest provider of private Medicare plans; as much as $5 million in Inception Fertility Holdings, a privately held company that operates a chain of clinics; and as much as $100,000 in HCA Healthcare, the sprawling for-profit hospital chain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/31/multimedia/00DROZ-02-bwjt/00DROZ-02-bwjt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/31/multimedia/00DROZ-02-bwjt/00DROZ-02-bwjt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/31/multimedia/00DROZ-02-bwjt/00DROZ-02-bwjt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Dr. Oz in an unbuttoned blazer gestures toward a piggy bank and pennies.

(The exact value of Dr. Oz’s various holdings is not known because the disclosure forms allow asset values to be listed under a wide range.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Dr. Oz also pledged in the filings to resign from paid advisory positions and to sell holdings in a digital stethoscope company, a pharmaceutical research and technology firm and a cardiology practice.</p><p>Still, he has several limited liability companies — Oz Works and Oz Property Holdings among them — and the nature of their operations is not known. He has no plans to close them and the filings state that he would remain an official at some. In the ethics agreement, he pledged not to “participate personally and substantially in any particular matter in which I know that I have a financial interest” or seek a waiver.</p><p>Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in government ethics, said Dr. Oz’s financial filings struck her as “the appearance of disclosure without disclosure.”</p><p>“You can sell assets, and if you have a specific contractual agreement you can end it,” she said. “But I can’t even tell from his disclosures what direct or indirect arrangements he has.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The sheer breadth of his financial entanglements has prompted some ethics experts and lawmakers to express doubts about his independence, particularly over companies from which he received millions of dollars for endorsing their products and services.</p><p>Christopher Krepich, a spokesman for Dr. Oz, declined to respond to a detailed list of questions from The Times about Dr. Oz’s business ventures. He would only say that Dr. Oz was cooperating with the Office of Government Ethics, which reviews the finances and interests of presidential nominees, and would comply with the agency’s rules.</p><p>If the Senate confirms Dr. Oz, 64, to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, he would wield immense power, overseeing health insurance coverage for nearly half of all Americans and a budget of about $1.5 trillion in annual spending. Given his advocacy of Medicare Advantage, Dr. Oz would have the authority to expand the privatization of the government program as he and many Republicans have urged.</p><p>The Senate Finance Committee is expected to soon schedule Dr. Oz’s confirmation hearing.</p><p>Government spending toward the private Medicare plans amounts to about $500 billion a year. The plans have been heavily scrutinized, faulted by lawmakers and regulators for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/upshot/medicare-advantage-fraud-allegations.html" title="">systemic overbilling</a> and <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2022/some-medicare-advantage-organization-denials-of-prior-authorization-requests-raise-concerns-about-beneficiary-access-to-medically-necessary-care/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unjustified</a> denials of payment for patient care. The very agency Dr. Oz would run recently cracked down on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/health/medicare-overbilling-insurance.html" title="">overpayments</a> and forced insurers to be more transparent when they refuse to pay for patients’ care.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Oz and Oprah Winfrey in 2010.

Insurers have already begun pressing the Trump administration to expand funding for Medicare Advantage.</p><p>In recent years, supplement companies have captured much of Dr. Oz’s attention. In 2023, he joined iHerb, an online seller of vitamins and supplements, as an adviser and spokesman. In the new financial filing, his investments in iHerb represent one of his largest financial holdings, worth anywhere from $5 million to $25 million.</p><p>In the ethics agreement, whether Dr. Oz would extricate his interests from iHerb remains murky: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/health/mehmet-oz-medicare-medicaid-stocks.html" title="">Experts who reviewed it for The Times</a> said the wording held open the possibility that even once he is at the helm of the agency, Dr. Oz might retain some iHerb stock until the company goes public or is bought. Either way, he stands to make significant money from his stake in iHerb.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s new health secretary, Dr. Oz is critical of the nation’s overreliance on drugs and surgery as treatments for chronic illness over diet and fitness. (Mr. Kennedy, 71, disclosed recently that his health insurance was provided by a Medicare Advantage plan.)</p><p>“He’s got big ambitions for the health of the country, honestly,” said Andy Slavitt, who served as the acting agency administrator under President Barack Obama. Mr. Slavitt, a former UnitedHealth executive, said that Dr. Oz “very much wants to do the job as a physician and focus on quality.”</p><h2 id="link-1276f0bd">A Family’s Financial Ties</h2><p>Dr. Oz was born in Cleveland to a wealthy Turkish American family. His father, Mustafa, was a thoracic surgeon who died in 2019. He has familial links to one of Turkey’s largest pharmaceutical companies, Atabay, that was founded by his maternal grandfather. It makes ingredients for medications, including opioids, that are currently sold in the United States.</p><p>It does not appear that he had an ownership stake in the company, although he has <a href="https://x.com/atabaykimya/status/1054424995336740864" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had contact</a> with top health officials in Turkey along with his uncle, who was once Atabay’s chairman.</p><p>In 2018, the uncle, Bülent Atabay, owned the lion’s share of the company, while his mother, Suna, owned a much smaller piece, according to a Turkish commercial registry notice, the latest available.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Oz with his mother, Suna, who has Alzheimer’s.

He was famously part of a team that performed a heart transplant in 1996 on the brother of Joe Torre, the former Yankees manager.</p><p>He and his wife Lisa of nearly 40 years are fabulously wealthy by almost any measure.</p><p>She is among numerous heirs to one of the nation’s largest private companies, Asplundh Tree Expert, which provides tree removal and related services for utilities and municipalities. The couple’s stakes in Asplundh <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/health/mehmet-oz-medicare-medicaid-stocks.html" title="">were worth between roughly $11 million to $52 million,</a> according to the latest financial filings.</p><p>Dr. Oz parlayed his career as a surgeon into a multi-million-dollar business that catapulted him into Americans’ living rooms and enriched him and his family.</p><p>He developed a TV persona, appearing in 2004 on “Oprah.” That morphed into the long-running “Dr. Oz” show, which aired from 2009 until early 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He touted the benefits of healthy living, but also drew sharp criticism for his public support of unfounded claims on a wide range of health and medical topics. In 2014, The BMJ, formerly <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7346" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The British Medical Journal</a>, analyzed 40 episodes of Dr. Oz’s show and concluded that fewer than half the health recommendations were supported by evidence.</p><p>That year, a Senate consumer protection panel grilled him about endorsements of certain “magic” weight-loss products. Former Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, scolded him, saying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/well/dr-oz-health-medicare-record.html" title="">“the scientific community is almost monolithic against you in terms of the efficacy of a few products that you have called miracles.”</a></p><p>Dr. Oz conceded that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/26/us/politics/dr-oz-medical-advice.html" title="">his claims often “don’t have the scientific muster to present as fact.”</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>With his wife, Lisa Oz, at a benefit in New York City in 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca Smeyne for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>During the Covid pandemic, Dr. Oz used his high-profile medical persona to espouse a highly questionable treatment. He appeared on Fox News more than two dozen times talking about the benefits of the malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as treatments for Covid and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/26/us/politics/dr-oz-medical-advice.html" title="">influential</a> in persuading Mr. Trump of their value despite sparse evidence.</p><p>He backtracked only after <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v1.full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a study</a> showed more patients were dying when treated with the hydroxychloroquine than those who were not taking it. Further studies proved the drug to be ineffective against Covid. Dr. Oz defended his position, saying he put patients first and argued the politics around Covid left many treatments to be “regularly discounted by the medical establishment.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Over the years, his peers have publicly denounced him for some of his dubious medical claims. “He has made clear that he will put enriching himself above all else, even in instances where people’s health is endangered,” a group of about 150 physicians, <a href="https://john-fetterman.medium.com/real-doctors-against-oz-letter-from-151-pa-doctors-ecbf46b7ba12" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Real Doctors Against Oz,”</a> wrote in opposing his Senate candidacy in 2022.</p><p>And at Columbia, where he spent much of his medical career performing heart surgery and teaching, he remains a complicated figure. The university refused to fire him in 2015 after a group of doctors urged it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/21/business/media/dr-oz-to-respond-on-show-to-criticism-by-physicians.html" title="">to sever ties</a>, describing Dr. Oz as “guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both.”</p><p>Dr. Oz responded at the time that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/business/media/dr-mehmet-oz-responds-to-critics-on-his-television-show.html" title="">never</a> promoted products for financial gain and argued that those seeking his ouster “have big ties to big industry.”</p><h2 id="link-2335d22a">The Hidden Hand</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In one TV episode, Dr. Oz donned scrubs and promoted personal use of Omron’s blood pressure monitor. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via YouTube</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>On his daytime show, Dr. Oz frequently and vaguely referred to companies he promoted as trusted sponsorship partners.
