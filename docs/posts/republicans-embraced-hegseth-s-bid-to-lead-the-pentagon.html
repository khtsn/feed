    <h1>Republicans Embraced Hegseth’s Bid to Lead the Pentagon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s pick for defense secretary, appeared at the Capitol today for a contentious four-hour confirmation hearing. Democratic senators repeatedly called him unfit to lead the Pentagon, but Republicans — who alone can confirm Hegseth — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/14/us/hegseth-confirmation-trump" title="">offered almost nothing but support</a>.</p><p>Hegseth appears likely to have enough votes to advance through the Senate Armed Services Committee. A vote of the full Senate could come as soon as next week, where he can likely afford to lose the support of just three Republicans. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, a Republican whose support is seen as crucial for Hegseth’s confirmation, appeared satisfied with his responses.</p><p>At today’s hearing, Democrats pressed Hegseth on numerous allegations of misconduct, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/14/us/hegseth-confirmation-trump#pete-hegseth-drinking-alcohol" title="">excessive drinking</a>, his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/politics/hegseth-women-senators.html" title="">views about women in combat</a> and his ability to lead the U.S. military’s three million employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/politics/trump-defense-secretary-ukraine-middle-east.html" title="">through a challenging moment</a>. Hegseth claimed to have been the victim of a “smear campaign.”</p><p>Before the hearing, Democrats argued that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/fbi-pete-hegseth-background-check.html" title="">F.B.I. had omitted key details</a> about Hegseth when compiling his background check, in part because it did not include interviews with critical witnesses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Firefighters in Los Angeles today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Loren Elliott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-4ed04857">L.A. firefighters battled to contain wind-driven blazes</h2><p>Officials in Los Angeles urged residents to stay alert and make evacuation plans as intense winds threatened to ignite more blazes across a region already scarred from a week of devastating fires.

It is far from the first time that American officials have suggested that a truce is near. But over the past two days, both Israeli and Hamas officials have said that a deal appears within reach.</p><p>“It’s closer than it’s ever been before,” Blinken said. “But right now as we sit here we await final word from Hamas on its acceptance.
