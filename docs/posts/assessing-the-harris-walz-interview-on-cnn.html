She repeated President Biden’s goals of defending Israel’s sovereignty, getting the hostages home and ending the suffering of Palestinians while offering them a two-state solution, without once suggesting what policy change would help achieve these noble goals (since Mr. Biden’s current policies to do all this have clearly failed).</p><p>Focusing only on “my values” and noble goals is <em>meaningless</em> without more substantive discussion of what <em>means</em> as president she would use to apply her values and achieve those goals. She therefore disappointed me, even though I very much want her to succeed!</p><p>James Berkman</p><p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p><p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/us/politics/harris-walz-interview-cnn-takeaways.html" title="">7 Takeaways From Harris’s First Major Interview</a>” (nytimes.com, Aug. 29):</p><p>The political writers won’t like it, but the presidential race really comes down to personalities. On the one hand, there is the man who, with his entourage, violated law and rules and desecrated Arlington National Cemetery for political gain, then savaged the government worker who did her job by attempting to enforce the rules (“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/us/politics/trump-arlington-cemetery-army.html" title="">Member of Trump’s Team ‘Abruptly Pushed’ Official at Arlington, Army Say</a>s,” news article, Aug. 30).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On the other hand, there is Kamala Harris, who was frank, informal, patient and even corrected herself when she mispronounced her CNN interviewer’s first name.</p><p>Beside those realities, differences in policy are next to nothing.</p><p>Jonathan J. Margolis</p><p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p><p>Asked in her CNN interview why her policy positions have changed, Kamala Harris said the important thing to remember is that her values haven’t changed.</p><p>Exactly. She’s still the far-left liberal that she’s been throughout her career. Her tacking toward the center is both temporary and fake, done simply to get elected, not because her views have matured.</p><p>Throughout her administration with President Biden, she has embraced the liberal agenda. None of that will change if she wins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>She’s not a pragmatic centrist. Neither is Tim Walz, her supposedly aw-shucks, down-home wingman. He’s as deeply liberal as she is.</p><p>Mark Godburn</p><p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p><p>In her CNN interview, Vice President Kamala Harris expressed openness to appointing a Republican to her cabinet. I applaud her position. American presidents represent all the people, not just the members of their own party. Appointing a Republican to a cabinet post would send a clear message that reaching out to everyone is an important element of her presidential agenda.</p><p>As she considers the various possibilities, I hope that Liz Cheney will be at the top of her list. Ms. Cheney, a hard-core conservative, was a highly effective member of Congress, rising to the third highest Republican leadership position in the House. Had she chosen to toe the party line, her future prospects were very bright. Yet, because she held Donald Trump responsible for the events surrounding the Jan. 6 insurrection, in an act of true patriotism she broke from her party, effectively destroying her career in elective politics.</p><p>From a policy perspective, Liz Cheney differs markedly from Kamala Harris, but Ms. Cheney is a highly competent individual, certainly capable of undertaking cabinet-level responsibilities. Ms. Harris has stated that saving democracy from a second Donald Trump term is on the ballot in 2024. No one has worked harder toward this goal than Liz Cheney.</p><p>Henry Von Kohorn</p><h2 id="link-31ea1291">Pardon Trump to Help Heal the Country</h2><p><strong>To the Editor: </strong></p><p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000009638553/dnc-attendees-kamala.html" title="">Democrats Share Their Wish List for Harris</a>” (video, Aug. 20): </p><p>Regarding your video asking people what is the first thing they would like Kamala Harris to do if she is elected president, most of the things mentioned, like protecting abortion or reforming health care, would have to be done by Congress, not the president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>One thing Ms. Harris could do, and I think she should seriously consider, is pardon Donald Trump for all the federal charges against him. It would deprive him of the stage of a trial, would avoid giving his supporters a martyr to rally around and might also begin the process of healing this country.</p><p>Such a pardon would have no effect on charges pending against Mr. Trump in the states, but it would be a step toward removing him from our political life by making him simply irrelevant. I can’t think of any better punishment for a narcissist.</p><p>Sarah Reynolds</p><h2 id="link-2c179038">Prosecute These War Crimes</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hatem Khaled/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>To the Editor: </strong></p><p>In “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/opinion/humanitarian-deaths-red-cross.html" title="">Humanitarians Are Dying. Why Doesn’t the World Care?</a>” (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Aug. 26), Kate Forbes eloquently conveys the horror of the killing of health and humanitarian aid workers in contemporary conflicts, the erosion of norms that once protected them and the terrible consequences for people in war zones.</p><p>The author rightly condemns the tepid response of the international community. But simply calling on parties to the conflicts to prioritize aid worker safety and allow unrestricted access to people in need — and on society to invest in preventing conflicts in the first place — are far from sufficient.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>There must be consequences for those who engage is such vile conduct. Attacks on health and humanitarian workers are <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/2024-05/Rome-Statute-eng.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">war crimes</a>, but no cases have ever been brought in international tribunals against individuals who commit or authorize them. The International Criminal Court has jurisdiction to prosecute these crimes in many locations, including Gaza and Ukraine. It should end impunity by bringing perpetrators to justice.</p><p>Leonard Rubenstein</p><h2 id="link-7c6c48f2">Why the Loser Shouldn’t Pay</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia has spent $500,000 defending himself in a defamation lawsuit.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alyssa Pointer/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>To the Editor: </strong></p><p>I was alarmed to read that a former law professor is endorsing the approach used in some parts of the world where the losing party in a lawsuit pays the legal fees of both parties (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/opinion/letters/trump-vs-harris-dowd.html?" title="">“A ‘Loser Pays’ System,”</a> Letters, Aug. 28).</p><p>That is not the approach used in the United States for good reason.
