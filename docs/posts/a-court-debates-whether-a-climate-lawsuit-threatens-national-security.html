The hearings in Charleston were the first time lawyers had to grapple in a courtroom with the president’s assertions.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s executive order was the opening salvo in a broad new attack by his administration against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/climate/state-climate-lawsuits.html" title="">climate lawsuits targeting oil companies</a>. Citing the executive order, the Justice Department this month filed unusual lawsuits <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/climate/michigan-hawaii-climate-lawsuits.html" title="">against Hawaii and Michigan</a> seeking to prevent them from filing their own climate-change suits. (Hawaii filed its suit anyway, and Michigan’s attorney general has signaled that she will also be proceeding.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In court hearings in Charleston on Thursday and Friday, Judge Roger M. Young Sr. asked each side to weigh in on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/protecting-american-energy-from-state-overreach/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">order</a> as they sparred over the companies’ motions to dismiss the case, which was <a href="https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/case-documents/2020/20200909_docket-2020CP1003975_complaint.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed</a> in 2020.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. of Gibson Dunn, who represents Chevron but was arguing on behalf of all the defendants, said the executive order was consistent with their position that federal law governs emissions and their impact, and that the climate-change lawsuits do not belong in state courtrooms.</p><p>Mr. Boutrous also said to the court that both Democrats and Republicans have promoted fossil fuel production in the interest of national security. Grappling with climate change is “not a partisan issue,” he said. “This is a difficult policy issue.”</p><p>Victor Sher, a lawyer for Charleston, said Congress is responsible for writing laws, not the president through the use of executive orders. But, setting that aside, he argued that the order was not relevant to Charleston’s case, because the lawsuit would not interfere with energy production. Rather, he said, the case revolved around the companies’ past acts of deception and failure to warn consumers about the risks of its products.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Judge Young and Mr. Sher sparred briefly over whether the executive order would apply to Charleston’s case, leading the judge to read part of the executive order out loud in court.</p><p>“I think it’s a stretch to read that as reaching this case,” Mr. Sher said.</p><p>“I don’t see why it’s such a stretch,” the judge replied.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judge Roger M.

By downplaying the risks of climate change, the lawsuit asserts, the energy companies worsened the effects on Charleston, a low-lying coastal city that faces immediate threats from rising sea levels and from storms that are being intensified by global warming.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Judge Young appeared skeptical of the city’s claims. “It’s the weather we’re talking about,” he said.</p><p>The judge also asked whether cases like this meant that individuals could also sue over climate-change claims. He said he was concerned about “perpetual” lawsuits of this kind. “I’m trying to figure out how this ends,” Judge Young said.</p><p>Mr. Sher likened the litigation to lawsuits against industries like tobacco, opioids and asbestos. “There are innumerable instances where all levels of government have sued over corporate misconduct,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Boutrous cited <a href="https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/case-documents/2011/20110620_docket-10%E2%80%93174_opinion.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Supreme Court decision</a>, written in 2011 by the liberal jurist Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in which she wrote that disputes over greenhouse-gas emissions by power companies fall under the purview of federal agencies and federal judges. Energy-company lawyers often cite that decision as a key precedent in their arguments in other lawsuits against oil companies across the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The county judicial center in Charleston.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Madeline Gray for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Sher countered that the 2011 case differed greatly from the Charleston suit. In that case, states were suing power companies to reduce their emissions. In Charleston’s case, he said, the city is suing for damages to cover the costs it is incurring as the world warms.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Global warming is mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, where they act like a heat-trapping blanket.</p><p>Much of the debate centered on whether the city’s case sought to restrict emissions. Mr. Sher said Charleston’s goal was not to limit emissions, but rather to generate money to help cover the costs of climate change — costs such as fortifying Charleston’s sea walls, improving drainage and protecting against hurricane damage. Taxpayers “would otherwise have to bear that burden,” he said.</p><p>The judge pressed Mr. Sher to describe whether gasoline ads should include a message about climate change, like the warnings about side effects in drug commercials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-17"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Minor flooding after a rain in Charleston this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Madeline Gray for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Historic Rainbow Row houses near the waterfront.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Madeline Gray for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Cooper River near downtown Charleston on a rainy Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Madeline Gray for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The oil companies first tried, without success, to get cases like these moved out of state courts and into federal courts, where they felt they would have better chances of winning. None of the state court cases have yet gone to trial, but judges in numerous places have ruled against the companies’ motions to dismiss, including in Hawaii and Colorado, where state appellate courts upheld the decisions.</p><p>However, in other jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey, energy companies have succeeded in getting cases tossed. And in Puerto Rico, the governor moved to dismiss a lawsuit filed by her predecessor.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/climate/charleston-flooding-climate-lawsuit.html" title="">The Charleston case</a> has been the subject of debate locally. It was filed under a previous mayor, John Tecklenburg, and critics have called for his successor, William Cogswell, to drop the case. His office said it would be watching the proceedings closely. The state’s attorney general, Alan Wilson, has been a vocal opponent of climate-change lawsuits and filed an amicus brief in favor of the companies in the Charleston case.</p><p>As the hearings concluded on Friday, Judge Young asked whether it made sense for a global problem to be addressed in a South Carolina court. Matt Edling, speaking on behalf of the city, said, “This lawsuit is not seeking to solve climate change, but quite candidly, it’s so the city has the money to survive it.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karen Zraick covers legal affairs for the Climate desk and the courtroom clashes playing out over climate and environmental policy.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
