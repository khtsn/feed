Trump, if any world leader could claim to have had the now president-elect’s number, it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/world/asia/shinzo-abe-dead.html" title="">Shinzo Abe</a>, Japan’s prime minister at the time.</p><p>Mr. Abe, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/world/asia/shinzo-abe-assassin-handmade-gun.html" title="">assassinated by a gunman in 2022</a>, was considered a Trump whisperer par excellence, tapping into the president’s love of golf, hamburgers and adulation in a way that helped shelter Japan from Mr. Trump’s punishing instincts.</p><p>Mr. Abe was the first foreign leader to visit Mr. Trump after he was elected in 2016, bringing a gift of golf clubs to Trump Tower in Manhattan. After the president’s inauguration, Mr. Abe quickly assumed the role of elder statesman guiding the new man on the world stage. On <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/world/asia/japan-trump-north-korea-abe.html" title="">multiple phone calls</a>, he was a reliable friendly ear. The first time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/us/politics/donald-trump-shinzo-abe-golf-mar-a-lago.html?mcubz=1" title="">Mr. Abe visited</a> the new president at his plush resort residence, Mar-a-Lago, just weeks after Mr. Trump took office, the pair played golf together and dined with their wives.</p><p>When Mr. Trump came to Japan on a state visit, Mr. Abe piled on the pomp and circumstance, naming a trophy after the president to award at a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/world/asia/trump-sumo-japan.html" title="">sumo wrestling tournament</a> and granting the American president the honor of being the first international leader to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/world/asia/japan-empress-masako.html" title="">meet</a> the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/asia/japan-emperor-abdicates-akihito-naruhito.html" title="">newly enthroned emperor</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Abe “moved quickly enough, he got the tone right, he knew how to talk to” President Trump, said Tobias Harris, founder and principal of Japan Foresight, a risk consultancy in Washington. “It’s hard to think of a leader who did quite as well.”</p><p>Now, as Japan and the rest of the world brace for the next Trump administration, the question of how to manage the most mercurial of American presidents has officials frantically reviewing their playbooks from those first four years.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/world/asia/japan-new-prime-minister-shigeru-ishiba.html" title="">Shigeru Ishiba</a>, Japan’s prime minister, picked up the phone Thursday morning in Tokyo to call the president-elect, congratulating him on his “campaign to make America great again” and for “receiving approval from many people.” Mr. Ishiba told reporters that he planned to meet with Mr. Trump as soon as possible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan is planning to meet with Mr. Trump as soon as possible.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Abe’s strategy offers potential guidance on forestalling some of the most aggressive impulses of Mr. Trump’s “America First” agenda. When running for president the first time, Mr. Trump warned that he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/business/trump-toyota-mexico-twitter-threat.html" title="">impose border taxes on Japanese automakers</a> and assailed Japan for not paying enough for its own defense.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In part because Mr. Abe shared some political values with Mr. Trump — they were both defense hawks and nationalists — and because Mr. Abe knew how to flatter the American president, the Japanese prime minister was able to beat back most of Mr. Trump’s initial threats. Mr. Abe “avoided unnecessary conflicts between the Trump administration and the Japanese government,” said Jiro Yamaguchi, a political scientist at Hosei University in Tokyo.</p><p>When Mr. Trump first took office, Mr. Abe had the advantage of having been prime minister for nearly five years already, and Mr. Trump deferred to his more experienced counterpart. When North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/mar-a-lago-north-korea-trump.html" title="">during one of their dinners</a> at Mar-a-Lago in February 2017, Mr. Trump ceded to Mr. Abe during a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-trump.html" title="">news conference</a> that followed. Afterward, the president said that he wanted “everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent.”</p><p>As time wore on, observers questioned whether Japan was getting as much as it should from Mr. Abe’s efforts. He had even endured the ignominy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaAHT83XC2s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tumbling into a golf bunker</a> while hitting the links with Mr. Trump near Tokyo, yet Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/business/us-eu-tariffs-steel-aluminum.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Politics&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article" title="">left Japan off a list of countries</a> temporarily exempted from tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/world/asia/japan-shinzo-abe-trump-north-korea.html" title="">failed to keep Mr. Abe in the loop</a> when the U.S. leader decided to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/us/politics/north-korea-kim-jong-un-trump.html" title="">accept an invitation to meet Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader</a>, for nuclear negotiations.</p><p>“The returns were diminishing,” Mr. Harris said.</p><p>In the time since Mr. Trump left office in 2020, Japan has taken considerable steps to bolster its defense position. That had been a point of tension with Japan in his first term, when Mr. Trump accused Japan, where about 50,000 U.S. troops are based, of being a free rider on the United States military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force during a joint exercise in Hawaii last month.

Given Mr. Trump’s appetite for entertainment, a “bro” style of communication and open admiration, it is not clear if Mr. Ishiba can manage a second Trump administration as well as Mr. Abe did.</p><p>“Ishiba is a serious person who speaks like a university professor,” said Narushige Michishita, a professor of international relations at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. “Ishiba can golf, but I doubt that he can build a similar personal relationship with Trump.”</p><p>Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
