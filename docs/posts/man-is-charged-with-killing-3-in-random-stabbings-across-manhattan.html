The victim was soon declared dead.</p><p>A violent spree was just starting, the police said.</p><p>By 11 a.m., the assailant had fatally stabbed a man who was fishing by the side of the East River, and a 36-year-old woman was fighting for her life after being stabbed repeatedly by the same man near the United Nations.</p><p>The rampage ended when a cabdriver who had seen the third stabbing followed the attacker from the crime scene and then alerted a police officer, who took the man into custody. The man’s clothes were spattered with blood, and he had two bloody knives, the police said.</p><p>As of Monday evening, the police had not formally charged the man, who they said was the lone suspect in the attacks, or identified him except to say that he was 51 and appeared to be homeless. They also had not identified the victims pending notification of their families.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Although major crime overall is down slightly in New York City so far this year compared with last year and the year before, the random, deadly attacks in broad daylight were likely to have an unsettling effect on public perception of how safe the city is.</p><p>Mayor Eric Adams, speaking at a news conference where he was joined by police leaders, said that officials were still reviewing the suspect’s criminal record but that there were “serious questions on why he was on the street.” The mayor also said the man had “serious mental health issues.”</p><p>“Today, we have three innocent New Yorkers who were victims of a terrible, terrible assault,” Mr. Adams said. The stabbings, he added, were “a clear example of a criminal justice system and a mental health system that continues to fail New Yorkers.”</p><p>The man had been arrested at least eight times in the past, most recently on a larceny charge in Manhattan in October, according to officials. That case remained active as of Monday, and the Legal Aid Society lawyer representing the man in the case declined to comment.</p><p>The first attack occurred on West 19th Street near 10th Avenue, when the knife-wielding assailant stabbed the construction worker in the abdomen outside the job site where the worker was employed, Joseph Kenny, the Police Department’s chief of detectives, said at the news conference. The victim, 36, was pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital, Chief Kenny said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Security-camera footage taken from a co-op building across the street shows a man in a gray hooded sweatshirt with a bag in one hand walking down a mostly empty block. After walking a short distance, he disappears behind a tree in the foreground of the frame.</p><p>Seconds later, a man wearing a hard hat and bright-colored safety vest comes running into the frame. He clutches his stomach and stands on the sidewalk as a woman with a stroller hurries into the building behind him just before the man topples to the ground.</p><p>Elton Wells, the president of the co-op’s board, said many of the building’s residents had been calling him since the morning in a panic.</p><p>“People were pretty stunned by the whole thing,” Mr. Wells, 52, said. “My phone’s been going off the hook all morning.”</p><p>About two hours later, the attacker struck again, this time on East 30th Street near Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, where he repeatedly stabbed the fisherman, Chief Kenny said. That victim, 68, was also pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Late Monday afternoon, a white sheet covered a bloodstained section of sidewalk near where the killing occurred. Latex gloves littered the idyllic stretch, which connects the United Nations and a commuter ferry terminal. Commuters and joggers sidestepped the crime scene until firefighters used their hoses to wash off the blood stains around 5 p.m.</p><p>Kevin O’Keefe, a father of three teenagers and a member of the local community board, said the attack was unnerving, especially since the area is often filled with children going to and from five nearby schools in the morning.</p><p>“This is a community, this is not the big fearful city,” Mr. O’Keefe said. “And that’s why I feel like incidents like this pierce the heart of the city.”</p><p>The third attack occurred about a half-hour later, when the 36-year-old woman was stabbed several times at 42nd Street and First Avenue, Chief Kenny said. She was taken to NewYork Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center in critical condition.</p><p>As horrific as the crimes were, there was potential for even greater carnage. The police said they believed the attacker had traveled by foot, roaming three miles across Manhattan for two and a half hours armed with two knives and a murderous impulse to use them.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- -->, <!-- -->Andy Newman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Connor Michael Greene<!-- --> and <!-- -->Wesley Parnell<!-- -->. <!-- -->Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Nov. 18, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article described incorrectly a suspect’s record.
