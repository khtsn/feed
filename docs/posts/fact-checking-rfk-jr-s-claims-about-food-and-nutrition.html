Kennedy Jr. — who was recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/rfk-jr-trump-hhs.html" title="">tapped by President-elect Donald J. Trump</a> to lead the Department of Health and Human Services — has said that he would “fix our broken food system.”</p><p>In interviews and on social media, Mr. Kennedy has made a number of claims about the country’s food supply and eating habits. We fact-checked five of his most repeated refrains.</p><h2 id="link-209f22be">Ultraprocessed Foods</h2><p><strong>His claim:</strong> Ultraprocessed foods are driving the obesity epidemic, and they should be removed from school lunches.</p><p><strong>What the research suggests:</strong> Many public health and nutrition experts agree that ultraprocessed foods — which make up an estimated <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37457-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">73 percent of the U.S. food supply</a> — are probably contributing to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/well/obesity-epidemic-america.html" title="">obesity crisis</a> in the United States, and it would be beneficial to cut back on them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the category is wide-ranging, and it’s not clear if <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/well/eat/ultraprocessed-foods-types-unhealthy-study.html" title="">all ultraprocessed foods are harmful</a>, experts say. There may be downsides to avoiding some ultraprocessed foods, like flavored yogurts and whole wheat breads and cereals, they add, because they can provide valuable nutrients.</p><p>Lindsey Smith Taillie, an associate professor of nutrition at the U.N.C. Gillings School of Global Public Health, said that it would be “transformative” to remove ultraprocessed foods from school lunches. But, she added, schools would need more resources to prepare meals from scratch.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-4d11eb79">Food Dyes</h2><p><strong>His claim:</strong> Food dyes cause cancer, and A.D.H.D. in children.</p><p><strong>What the research suggests:</strong> While some small clinical trials have suggested that certain synthetic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/well/eat/food-dye-california-ban.html" title="">food dyes may increase hyperactivity in children</a>, there is no solid evidence that they directly cause A.D.H.D. However, many experts agree that because food dyes aren’t nutritionally necessary, it wouldn’t hurt to avoid them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 1990, the Food and Drug Administration banned the use of Red Dye No. 3 in cosmetics after research in animals linked it to cancer. At the time, the agency said that it would also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/30/science/fda-limits-red-dye-no-3.html" title="">work to extend the ban to foods and drugs</a>, but it has not yet done so. The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/industry/color-additives/fdc-red-no-3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">F.D.A. is currently reviewing the safety of Red Dye No. 3</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-53b9daaf">Raw Milk</h2><p><strong>His claim:</strong> Mr. Kennedy has said that he only drinks raw milk and has suggested that the restrictions on small farmers <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1816535637736227252" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from selling raw milk should be re-examined</a>.</p><p><strong>What the research suggests:</strong> Food safety experts say that because raw (or unpasteurized) milk can contain harmful pathogens like E. coli, listeria and salmonella, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/well/raw-milk-health-salmonella.html" title="">drinking it can cause serious food-borne illness</a>, so it should be avoided.

Decades of research have shown that seed oils are not only safe, but the heart-healthy unsaturated fats they contain have been linked with reduced risks for <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038908" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cardiovascular disease</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29032079/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Type 2 diabetes</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.35226" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancer</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000291652200778X?via%3Dihub" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier death</a>. Seed oils are a far better choice for health than solid fat alternatives, like beef tallow, butter or lard, which are high in saturated fats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-15"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alice Callahan is a Times reporter covering nutrition and health.
