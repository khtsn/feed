The boarded-up buildings and vacant lots in the area have long been familiar to Mr. Gainey, who was elected to be Pittsburgh’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/us/ed-gainey-pittsburgh-mayor.html" title="">first Black mayor</a> nearly four years ago.</p><p>“One of the greatest feelings is when you can develop where you came up at — where you play, where you pray, where you work,” Mr. Gainey said in remarks at the site of the project, which is named for a long-shuttered record store that will be torn down to make way for the new building.</p><p>“We need affordable housing, we need an affordable city,” the mayor said to a few dozen people at the groundbreaking. “Help us stabilize and engage where we live, and we’ll build a city for all.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This was Mr. Gainey at his evocative best, making good on the type of promise that swept him into office on a progressive wave, whose message carried a particular resonance in Pittsburgh during the pandemic.</p><p>That grand vision, though, remains far enough off from completion that Mr. Gainey may not be in office long enough to preside over it.</p><p>The mayor is in a contentious Democratic primary battle with Corey O’Connor, the Alleghany County Controller and well-funded son of a beloved mayor who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/02/obituaries/02oconnor.html" title="">died shortly after taking office in 2006</a>. Voters will choose between them on Tuesday.</p><p>Mr. Gainey faces an uphill climb. His administration’s missteps — a police-chief fiasco, problems with broken-down snowplows and fire trucks, accusations of budget-fudging — have tended to obscure promising turns in the city on crime, population growth and the local economy, leading to questions about Mr. Gainey’s ability to run the city.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Corey O’Connor, a mayoral candidate in Pittsburgh, spoke to voters at a senior center in the Lawrenceville neighborhood.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The primary will probably decide the general election as well, since Pittsburgh has not elected a Republican mayor in nearly a century. And it has become something of a proxy fight between the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and its more centrist old guard, as the party searches for a way forward after losing the White House and both houses of Congress in November.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The race has drawn attention from outside political action groups, who can spend unlimited amounts of money road-testing messages but are prohibited from coordinating their activities with the candidates’ campaigns. Their involvement has raised the temperature in the primary race, which began with two well-liked candidates with compelling backgrounds and few policy differences.</p><p>One anti-Gainey mailer from an outside group with a photo of a dilapidated building and the headline “The Ed Gainey Legacy” was condemned by the mayor as a racist dog whistle. An email blast from a national progressive group on Friday called Mr. O’Connor a fake Democrat.</p><p>“This is an election about Pittsburgh, about how we get our city back on the right track,” Mr. O’Connor said over lunch last week at Nicky’s Grant Street, a downtown diner, with two aides at his side. “It’s laughable to make arguments about progressive, not progressive. The outside groups that are meddling, I guarantee you they haven’t looked at the records of either one of us.”</p><p>Mr. O’Connor served on the City Council before becoming the county controller in 2022, and has raised three times as much campaign money as Mr. Gainey has. In the interview, he echoed a recent warning from the city controller, who said a fiscal crisis was looming in the city. Police, fire and other services are on track to blow past their overtime pay budgets for the year, while pandemic funding is running out and tax revenue from downtown businesses shows little sign of rebounding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Their constant thing is, ‘well, we have a Double-A bond rating,’ but that doesn’t fill potholes,” Mr. O’Connor said. “We have to show the Democratic Party that we have a growing economy, that we can run the day-to-day operations.”</p><p>The sharpest policy difference between the candidates is on housing, which both men agree the city sorely needs. Mr. Gainey says that 10 percent of all new housing should be set aside for low-income residents throughout the city. Mr. O’Connor, who has courted support from developers, says that such a policy, known as inclusionary housing, should be mandated on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis.</p><p>“My developers are upset because I’m saying that I want 10 percent affordable housing at 50 percent of the area median income,” Mr. Gainey said, sitting last week on the stoop of a home in Elliott, a hilly, rough-around-the-edges neighborhood in the city’s West End. “Well, what does that mean? As a mom that makes $45,000 a year that’s got two kids, I can live in any new unit that we have. To me, that’s fair.”</p><p>Mr. Gainey has framed his fight with the city’s powerful nonprofit institutions — including Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, the medical group UPMC and Highmark, a major health insurer — in a similar light. The mayor has gone to court to challenge their tax-exempt status. Mr. O’Connor has said he would take a more conciliatory approach to compel them to be better corporate citizens.</p><p>“The No. 1 thing this election is about is someone wanting to serve the people, versus someone that serves the power,” Mr. Gainey said. “And we’ve always been about the people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Mr. Gainey has received some good news recently. Census estimates show that the city’s population ticked upward by 1 percent last year — the first increase in decades — in a city whose economy was resuscitated by education, health care and technology employment after its steel and coal industries collapsed. Crime has also declined in Pittsburgh, following a national trend, even though the police department has shrunk by 20 percent over the last two years.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Gaines spoke at a rally in downtown Pittsburgh Thursday in favor of raising the state’s minimum wage.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Baffling some of his supporters, Mr. Gainey chose early in his campaign not to run on his record, and instead went on the attack against Mr. O’Connor.</p><p>“You expect that from a challenger,” said Bethany Hallam, an Alleghany Councilwoman who is backing the mayor. “So many of the things that Mayor Gainey has been able to accomplish don’t seem sexy.”</p><p>This highlights a conundrum of Pittsburgh politics, according to Marc Stier, executive director of the Pennsylvania Policy Center, a nonpartisan policy research and advocacy organization. Since the 1990s, the city has leaned on progressive policies to restore its economy, far more than other cities have that were beholden to Democratic political machines, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“In general, in cities that have gone through crises that Northeast and Midwest cities have gone through, it’s really hard to keep everyone happy,” Mr. Stier said. “Progressives can get elected in Pittsburgh, but they don’t have the support of the machine.”</p><p>Lara Putnam, a University of Pittsburgh history professor, said the primary on Tuesday will test an unusual coalition that lifted Mr. Gainey into office four years ago: the Service Employees International Union; a grass-roots coalition of anti-Trump women; disaffected young people spurred to vote by the murder of George Floyd; and Black voters.</p><p>Yard signs for Mr. O’Connor seem to be present in every precinct of the city. And there are two more factors that could spell trouble for Mr. Gainey: Kamala Harris fared worse in Pittsburgh’s Black neighborhoods last fall than Joe Biden did in 2020, and the conflict in Gaza has replaced the murder of George Floyd as a vote driver for young people.</p><p>“There’s no question there’s been a fracture there,” Ms. Putnam said. “Will folks who were angry with the national Democratic Party over Israel and Gaza show up and vote for Ed Gainey, or are they done with Democratic primaries? And what will the African-American vote look like?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Frozen E.P.A.
