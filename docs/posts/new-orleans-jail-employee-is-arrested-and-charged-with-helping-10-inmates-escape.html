Mr. Williams told investigators that an inmate had threatened to “shank him” if he did not shut off the water, according to an affidavit supporting his arrest.</p><p>The inmates then used an unidentified tool to cut steel bars behind the cell room sink, leaving behind a hole in the wall just big enough to crawl through and a taunting misspelled message: “to easy LOL.”</p><p>The inmates left the jail through a loading dock, scaled a wall, using blankets to protect themselves from barbed wire, and ran across Interstate 10. A civilian employee of the sheriff’s office, who was the only person monitoring security systems in the part of the jail where the escape occurred, had left his station at the time to get food, officials said last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>According to the affidavit, Mr. Williams told agents from the Louisiana Bureau of Investigation that an inmate with tattoos on his face, whom he called “Massey,” but whose full name is Antoine Massey, “threatened to shank him if he did not turn the water off.”</p><p>Instead of reporting the threat, Mr. Williams told agents that he went into a pipe chase — an area where plumbing is concealed behind a wall — and turned off the water by closing a valve, the affidavit states.</p><p>With no water running, the inmates were able to remove the sink and toilet fixture from the wall, investigators said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/19/arts/prison-break-cover/prison-break-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Security camera footage shows 10 prisoners escaping from the Orleans Parish Correctional Facility in Louisiana on Friday.

She said the office then activated “emergency protocols” and began a search for the inmates.</p><p>Four have since been captured, and a manhunt is continuing for the remaining six, including Mr. Massey. The inmates, who ranged from 19 to 42, were being held on charges including murder, attempted murder, armed robbery and carrying illegal weapons.</p><p>The affidavit says that Mr. Williams did not come forward after the escape and that when confronted by agents, he was “initially very evasive and untruthful, but eventually became forthcoming and provided evidentiary information.”</p><p>Mr. Williams has been charged with one count of malfeasance in office and 10 counts of principal to simple escape. It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer. He was scheduled to make his first appearance in court on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>Sheriff Hutson told the New Orleans City Council on Tuesday that the escape involved “procedural failures and missed notifications.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“But there were also intentional wrongdoings,” she said. “This was a coordinated effort aided by individuals insider our own agency who made the choice to break the law.”</p><p>The sheriff’s office has said that about a third of the cameras in the jail don’t work, and that it has “defective locks and doors.” It has asked city officials for millions of dollars in upgrades to improve security.</p><p>Liz Murrill, the Louisiana attorney general, said in a statement on Tuesday that the investigation into the escape was continuing.</p><p>“We will uncover all the facts eventually and anyone who aided and abetted will be prosecuted to the full extent the law allows,” she said. “I encourage anyone who knows anything and even those who may have provided assistance to come forward now to obtain the best possible outcome in their particular case.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Levenson covers breaking news for The Times from New York.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
