He ran into a backyard and climbed a tree, where he remained for hours, the authorities said.</p><p>It was unclear Tuesday afternoon whether Mr. Ical had a prior criminal record or if he had legal representation.</p><p>News of the standoff spread around the west San Antonio neighborhood as agents tried to persuade Mr. Ical to climb down. Gabriel Rosales, the director of the Texas chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said the treatment of the migrant appalled him when he arrived at the scene.</p><p>“This is something that concerns me,” Mr. Rosales said. “They are coming into our communities and coming after people that look like us.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A man who lives nearby, Joel de la Roja, 61, said that the large police presence worried him.</p><p>“A lot of people in this neighborhood are from Mexico, and they are probably scared, too,” Mr. Roja said. “It seems a bit too much. One man does not need all of these officers after him.”</p><p>Chris Rodriguez, 38, said he had heard a helicopter roaring in his neighborhood at around 11 a.m. He followed its path on his bicycle.</p><p>“It’s a sad situation,” he said. “This is the first time I see something like this. If it’s something where he’s a danger to the community, then you understand it. But I think that if he’s just undocumented, that’s overkill.”</p><p>After more than eight hours on top of the tree, a woman who described herself as a relative of Mr. Ical stood next to Mr. Montoya and called Mr. Ical. He was seen answering it; Mr. Ical told her he had decided to give up.</p><p>He was loaded into a white truck and taken away as the crowd of local news media and residents recorded the scene on their phones.</p><p>“Treat him well,” one woman yelled. “Don’t sign anything. Don’t say anything.”</p><p>Hank Sanders<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Edgar Sandoval covers Texas for The Times, with a focus on the Latino community and the border with Mexico.
