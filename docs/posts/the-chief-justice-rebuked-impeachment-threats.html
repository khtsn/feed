The president called the judge, James Boasberg, a “Radical Left Lunatic” and insisted on his removal. Soon after, a Trump ally in Congress filed articles of impeachment against the judge.</p><p>The attacks against Boasberg — a centrist Democrat who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/judge-boasberg-trump-deportation-flights.html" title="">lived with Justice Brett Kavanaugh</a> while they were at Yale Law School — prompted John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/chief-justice-roberts-impeachment-trump.html" title="">to issue a rare public rebuke</a>.</p><p>“For more than two centuries,” Roberts said, “it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”</p><p>Around the same time, lawyers for the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-venezuela-deportations-doj-court-order.html" title="">continued their aggressive pushback against Boasberg’s ruling</a>, which barred the U.S. from deporting people suspected of belonging to a Venezuelan street gang under a statute called the Alien Enemies Act. They complied only in part with Boasberg’s instructions to provide data on the deportation flights, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/timeline-trump-deportation-flights-el-salvador.html" title="">which had not yet landed</a> when the judge ordered them to turn around.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A thermal power plant damaged by Russian missile strikes in Ukraine last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mauricio Lima for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3c64d6e1">Putin agreed to pause strikes on Ukraine’s energy targets</h2><p>Vladimir Putin agreed during a call today with Trump to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-putin-call-ukraine-russia-ceasefire.html" title="">halt strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure for 30 days</a>, as long as Ukraine does the same, according to a statement from the Kremlin. The Russian leader declined during the two-and-a-half-hour conversation to agree to the kind of broader monthlong cease-fire that both the U.S. and Ukraine have endorsed.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said he was also open to such a truce on attacks on energy infrastructure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The result seemed to fall short of what Trump had been hoping for. Still, if strikes on energy infrastructure by both sides indeed stop, it would be the first mutually agreed suspension of attacks in the three-year war, which the White House characterized as a first step toward a broader peace.</p><p>The Kremlin said that Putin told Trump that his “key condition” to end the conflict altogether was a “complete cessation” of foreign military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine. My colleague Paul Sonne, who covers Russia, said that “would essentially make Ukraine perpetually vulnerable to Russia.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bodies of Palestinians killed in airstrikes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-c6bb1e0">Israel resumed strikes on Gaza as the cease-fire broke down</h2><p>Israeli forces launched an aerial bombardment in Gaza today, ending a temporary cease-fire with Hamas.
