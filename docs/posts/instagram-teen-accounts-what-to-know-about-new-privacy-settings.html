But teenagers under 16 will need a parent’s permission to alter the privacy default, sleep mode and other restrictions.</p><h2 id="link-4372d396">When will teens see the changes to their accounts?</h2><p>Instagram said it would begin imposing the changes to all newly created accounts, starting this week.
