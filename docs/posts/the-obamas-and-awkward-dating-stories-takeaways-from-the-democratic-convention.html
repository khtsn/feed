We worked through the issue, and by the end of the meeting, the now happy client offered to set me up on a blind date — [laughter] which is how I ended up with Kamala Harris’s phone number. Now, for generations, people have debated when to call the person you’re being set up with. And never in history has anyone suggested 8:30 a.m. And yet, that’s when I dialed. I got Kamala’s voicemail, and I just started rambling. “Hey, it’s Doug. I’m on my way to an early meeting. Again, it’s Doug.” I remember I was trying to grab the words out of the air and just put them back in my mouth. And for what seemed like far too many minutes, I hung up. By the way, Kamala saved that voicemail, and she makes me listen to it on every anniversary.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/20/us/politics/20vid-dnc-42057-emhoff/20vid-dnc-42057-emhoff-square640-v2.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Doug Emhoff told the story of how he met Kamala Harris and left her a voice mail message that she saved — and makes him listen to every year on their anniversary.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Todd Heisler/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><div><h2 id="link-1450945d">In a first, the traditional first lady’s speech was given by a would-be first gentleman.</h2><p>Mr. Emhoff gave a first glimpse at what would be another historic first that a Harris presidency would bring — the arrival to the East Wing of the first first gentleman. For centuries, wives of candidates have testified to their spouses’ personal qualities, offering the requisite humanizing anecdotes to soften their image.</p><p>This time it was Mr. Emhoff who did the sharing, which included the gushing story of his perhaps over-excited pursuit of Ms. Harris, with whom he was set up a decade ago.</p><p>“Now, for generations, people have debated when to call the person you are being set up with,” Mr. Emhoff said, smiling. “And never in history has anyone suggested 8:30 a.m. And yet, that is when I dialed.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>He told of a rambling message he left on Ms. Harris’s voice mail, in which he repeated his own name several times.</p><p>“I was trying to grab the words out of the air and just put them back in my mouth,” he said. “For what seemed like far too many minutes, I hung up.”</p><p>Mr. Emhoff expressed his love for his wife, but also used his speech to beat back Republican efforts to tar Democrats with the antisemitism that has crept into anti-Israel demonstrations by sharing his own Jewish heritage, and Ms. Harris’s encouragement for him to use his national perch to fight antisemitism.</p><h2 id="link-32b1b162">It’s no longer Joe Biden’s party.</h2><p>A day after President Biden gave his farewell address, and the crowd shouted “We Love Joe,’’ it was clear that the party was finally moving on without him.</p><p>Mr. Obama was certain to shower his former vice president with praise. “I am proud to call him my president, but even prouder to call him my friend,” he said. But in the next breath, he said, “Now the torch has been passed.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>And when Mr. Obama highlighted “all the incredible energy we’ve been able to generate over the last few weeks,” there was no mistaking what unleashed that energy in the first place: Mr. Biden’s decision to leave the race.</p><p>A decade of bruising combat with Mr. Trump appears to have rid the party of sentimentality, and sharpened its determination to win, despite the sometimes brutal fallout.</p></div></div><div></div><div><p>Jonathan Weisman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Neil Vigdor<!-- --> and <!-- -->Tim Balk<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jim Rutenberg is a writer at large for The Times and The New York Times Magazine and writes most often about media and politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jim-rutenberg">More about Jim Rutenberg</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
