He is the prime minister of Spain, not its president. ​It also misidentified Salvador Illa’s jurisdiction. He is the governor of the Catalonia region, not Barcelona. Finally, it misstated Agustín Escobar’s employment history with Siemens. He previously worked for the technology giant in Colombia, not Brazil.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
