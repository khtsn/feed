Reeling from more than a year of hunger and fighting, many are still displaced or living amid the rubble of what was once their homes.</p><p>Israel’s security cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was set to meet on Sunday to formally sign off on broadening the campaign in Gaza, said an Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>Since Israel ended a two-month cease-fire with Hamas in mid-March, Israeli forces have resumed attacking across the enclave. But while Israel jets and drones have regularly bombarded Gaza from the air, Israeli ground forces slowed their advance after seizing some territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The call-up of the reservists over the next few days could indicate that the Israeli government is preparing to shift tactics in an attempt to force Hamas to agree to its terms to end the war. Earlier in the war, Israeli troops swept through the enclave, leveling swathes of Gaza’s cities and displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.</p><p>More than 50,000 people have been killed in Israel’s military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials. They do not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but their tallies include thousands of children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians carrying children injured in a deadly Israeli strike at the Dar al-Arqam School, east of Gaza City, in March. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The war began after Hamas led a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and saw 250 taken back to Gaza as hostages. In the aftermath, Israeli leaders vowed to destroy Hamas in Gaza and free all of the captives held there.</p><p>Despite more than a year of devastating war, Israel has yet to fully achieve either of those aims. Hamas has fought a determined war of attrition amid the rubble left by Israeli airstrikes, recruited new fighters to its cause and is believed to still hold up to 24 living hostages and the bodies of dozens of others.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>International mediators, including the Trump administration, have sought to broker a new cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to free hostages in exchange for Palestinians jailed by Israel. But the two sides have stipulated seemingly contradictory conditions for a deal.<span>  </span></p><p>Israel has demanded that Hamas lay down its arms, which the group has refused to do. Hamas, for its part, has said it will not free any more of the hostages until Israel commits to an agreement that includes a complete end to the war and a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.</p><p>The mobilization announcement sparked even deeper anxiety among the hostages’ families, who fear that the fighting could kill their loved ones. They have sought to rally Israelis to pressure the government into reaching a new truce with Hamas.</p><p>Yotam Cohen, whose brother was abducted during the Hamas-led assault, accused Mr. Netanyahu of breaking the previous cease-fire before leading the country into a renewed, avoidable war with Hamas. He called for an immediate deal with Hamas to free his brother, who is still believed to be alive.</p><p>“Instead of bringing him home in an agreement, Netanyahu is sending soldiers into a war that will kill him,” Mr. Cohen <a href="https://x.com/klaiman14/status/1918682800309309933" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> at a rally on Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu has suggested that bringing home the remaining hostages is less important than decisively defeating Hamas. In interviews and speeches, Mr. Netanyahu has promised the Israeli public “absolute victory” over the group.</p><p>Freeing the captives was “an important goal,” Mr. Netanyahu said in an address on Thursday. “But in war there’s a supreme goal, and that is defeating our enemies,” he added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
