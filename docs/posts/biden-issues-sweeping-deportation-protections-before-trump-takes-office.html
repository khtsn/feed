Trump to swiftly strip the benefit when he takes office.</p><p>The extension of Temporary Protected Status, as the program is called, allows the immigrants to remain in the country with work permits and a shield from deportation for another 18 months from the expiration of their current protection in the spring. Late last year, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken recommended the protections be extended in a series of letters.</p><p>For decades, Democratic and Republican administrations have designated the protection for citizens of countries that are in upheaval and deemed unsafe to return to. President Biden has expanded who could receive the status, as war erupted in Ukraine and instability gripped countries like Venezuela and Haiti.</p><p>“These designations are rooted in careful review and interagency collaboration to ensure those affected by environmental disasters and instability are given the protections they need while continuing to contribute meaningfully to our communities,” Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security, said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump has derided the program and vowed to end it, at least for certain countries. Immigrant advocates had been urging the Biden administration to extend it for many of those countries before he takes office.</p><p>In his first term, Mr. Trump terminated the status for about 400,000 people from El Salvador and other countries, and then faced legal challenges.</p><p>According to the Congressional Research Service, more than a million migrants from countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East had Temporary Protected Status as of 2024.</p><p>The move makes it legally difficult for Mr. Trump to roll back the protections for citizens of the four countries, at least until they expire some time in 2026.</p><p>“Because President Biden has extended protection for the nationals of all these countries, President Trump will be unable to deport these individuals any time soon, “ said Steve Yale-Loehr, an immigration scholar at Cornell Law School.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>”Trump can’t ignore what Congress wrote into law in 1990,” he said.</p><p>About 600,000 Venezuelans who currently have the protection will be allowed to renew and remain in the United States until October 2026, and approximately 232,000 immigrants from El Salvador will be able to do so. More than 100,000 Ukrainians will be able to remain in the United States until August 2026. Some 1,900 people from Sudan will also be allowed to renew their status.</p><p>The program was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush to ensure that foreign citizens already in the United States can remain in the country if it is not safe for them to return to their home country because of a natural disaster, armed conflict or other upheaval.</p><p>On the campaign trail, JD Vance, the vice president-elect, called the program illegal when he criticized Haitians who had settled in his home state of Ohio and benefited from it. Haiti has been experiencing political turmoil and gang violence, and some 200,000 of its citizens are protected from removal under T.P.S. until early 2026.</p><p>“We’re going to stop doing mass grants of Temporary Protected Status,” Mr. Vance said in October.</p><p>Critics have argued that the temporary protections are extended repeatedly and serve as a de facto means to enable people to stay in the country indefinitely, contrary to its intention of being a short-term solution.</p><p>While the program has become all but permanent for many immigrants, it also highlights how troubled many corners of the world are and the failure of Congress to pass legislation to update the U.S. immigration system to the realities of contemporary global migration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Immigrants from several countries, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/us/trump-immigrants-temporary-protected-status.html" title="">El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua,</a> have been eligible for the protection for more than two decades. Other countries, such as Ethiopia, Lebanon and Syria were added more recently.</p><p>Gonzalo Roa, 43, a Venezuelan who is a beneficiary, said that he was anxious about the fate of the program.</p><p>“It is great news that it’s being renewed,” said Mr. Roa, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. He works at a car dealership and runs a small restaurant with his wife.</p><p>Without the temporary status, Mr. Roa said, he would lose his job at the dealership and his two Venezuelan-born children would not be eligible for college scholarships and other benefits that require legal status.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy.<span> </span></p></div><div><p>Miriam Jordan reports from a grass roots perspective on immigrants and their impact on the demographics, society and economy of the United States.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/miriam-jordan">More about Miriam Jordan</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/01/10/us/politics/biden-temporary-protected-status-immigration.html">0</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>ICE in Schools</strong>: New York City’s school district <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/immigration-deportations-ice-schools.html">has shared a protocol with staff to try to shield students</a> who have a tenuous legal status in case immigration agents show up.</p></li><li><p><strong>The State of Mexico-U.S. Migration</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/migration-mexico-honduras-panama-trump.html">Crossings into the U.S. from Mexico have dropped sharply</a>.
