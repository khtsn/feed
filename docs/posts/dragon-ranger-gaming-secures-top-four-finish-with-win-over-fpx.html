</span> in three maps to secure a top-four finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2275/champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">China Kickoff</a>, getting not just one step closer to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>, but securing points towards Champions 2025 qualification.</p>

<p>The series was played out in three maps, with Dragon Ranger Gaming choosing Abyss, FunPlus Phoenix choosing Pearl, and Haven the decider map. </p>

<p>Abyss saw a classic FunPlus Phoenix triple Controller composition take the stage, while Dragon Ranger Gaming&#39;s double Controller, double Initiator comp yielded good results, too. The second half was tight. DRG responded to a 3-0 FPX run with a 5-0 run of their own, setting up for a tight finish that saw an overtime-or-bust round from FPX. Leading 12-11, DRG won a nail-biter of a final round to prevent the map from going to extras and took a 1-0 series lead.</p>

<p><em>Blink and you might miss a kill this round.</em></p>

<p>After coming close but not close enough on Abyss, FPX bounced back in a big way. They dominated the defense side of Pearl, snatching 11 rounds away from a DRG team that never quite settled in. From there, a strong pistol round to reach match point was just a formality before the map was sealed 13-1.</p>


<p><em>Three of <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/7857/berlin">
		BerLIN	</a>
</span>&#39;s 17 kills on Pearl.</em></p>

<p>On an attack-sided Haven, where rounds on the defender side can be hard to come by, DRG got out to a 5-0 lead, getting the Operator into the hands of Jett player <span data-ref-id="3">

</span> early. FPX grabbed two rounds in the first half, largely in part thanks to <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/3028/life">

</span>&#39;s Blade Storm, but the DRG lead ballooned to 9-3 by halftime. With FPX opting for a double Controller, double Initiator, and zero Sentinel team composition, a lack of map control on their attack side would bleed over onto their defense side. Despite losing four of the second half&#39;s first five rounds, DRG won the map 13-7 to advance to the lower semifinal.</p>

<p>With the win, Dragon Ranger Gaming gets one step closer to qualifying for Masters Bangkok. Bangkok would be the organization&#39;s first international event since qualifying for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai/swiss-stage" target="_blank">Masters Shanghai</a> in 2024.</p>

<p>Faced with the risk of relegation, China&#39;s two Ascension teams have placed themselves in a strong position to qualify for the Champions League and secure survival. A top-four finish secures one championship point, while first and second place give three and two points, respectively. </p>

<p>With the loss, FPX will be sidelined from VCT action until late March, when China Stage 1 begins. After qualifying for all three international events in 2024, they begin their 2025 watching the first international from home.</p>
