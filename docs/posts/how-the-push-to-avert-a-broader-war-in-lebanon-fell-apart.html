The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, also sent word through an intermediary that his powerful militia supported the call for a cease-fire, the officials said.</p><p>So on Sept. 25, as world leaders gathered in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, President Biden and President Emmanuel Macron of France <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/us-cease-fire-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">announced the plan</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/25/joint-statement-by-the-united-states-australia-canada-european-union-france-germany-italy-japan-saudi-arabia-united-arab-emirates-qatar/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released the statement</a>, expecting the warring parties to publicly embrace it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But two days later, before diplomats could draw up a detailed cease-fire proposal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel declared at the United Nations that Israel must “defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon.” Soon after, huge bombs fell on Beirut’s southern outskirts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">killing Mr. Nasrallah</a> and extinguishing any immediate prospect of a cease-fire.</p><p>Now the expanded war in Lebanon that officials had been working to prevent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">is raging</a> — and threatening to ignite a larger regional conflagration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaving the floor of the United Nations after his speech on Sept. 27.

The killing of Mr. Nasrallah was the second time in 10 weeks that Israel had quashed progress toward a cease-fire by striking a militia leader; Israel’s assassination in July of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-dead.html" title="">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, the political leader of Hamas, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/sinwar-hamas-israel-hezbollah-iran.html" title="">led to the hardening of that group</a> against any Gaza cease-fire proposal.</p><p>Hezbollah began firing on Israeli positions in support of Hamas after Hamas carried out its deadly assault on Israel last October. Israel struck back at Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, leading to frequent exchanges of fire that caused more than 150,000 people to flee both sides of the border.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Last month, Israel swiftly escalated its attacks on Hezbollah, remotely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html" title="">detonating the group’s pagers and walkie-talkies</a>, launching extensive airstrikes that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-deaths.html" title="">killed hundreds of people</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/20/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah" title="">assassinating Hezbollah leaders</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Frequent exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel have caused more than 150,000 people to flee both sides of the border.

Then Mr. Hochstein, a senior White House official who had helped broker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/world/middleeast/israel-and-lebanon-maritime-deal.html" title="">a maritime border agreement</a> between Lebanon and Israel in 2022, took the lead, telling Lebanese officials that if they could secure Hezbollah’s buy-in, he would do the same with Israel, according to a Lebanese official, a Beirut-based diplomat and a senior American official.</p><p>The proposal called for a 21-day pause in fighting to allow for diplomacy aimed at reaching a longer-term truce. Under the plan, Hezbollah would move its fighters and weapons out of the border zone, a major Israeli demand.</p><p>Mr. Nasrallah had said repeatedly that Hezbollah would stop firing on Israel only when Israel stopped attacking Gaza. So the proposal also called for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. That was included, officials involved in the talks said, to make it easier for Mr. Nasrallah to accept it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Most of the diplomacy was indirect, since Lebanon and Israel have no diplomatic relations and the United States considers Hezbollah a terrorist organization, barring U.S. officials from interacting with its members.</p><p>Mr. Hochstein dealt with Mr. Netanyahu’s office in Israel. On the Lebanese side, he worked through Nabih Berri, the 86-year-old speaker of Parliament and a political ally of Hezbollah.</p><p>By Sept. 25, the diplomatic efforts seemed as if they were beginning to bear fruit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, right, spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the U.N.

But even as Israel gave these signals, it was already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/why-israel-assassinate-nasrallah.html" title="">making plans to kill Mr. Nasrallah</a>.</p><p>In New York, on that same day, the Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, and Mr. Bou Habib, the foreign minister, met in a hotel with Mr. Hochstein and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. Mr. Bou Habib said in an interview with The New York Times that the discussion focused on next steps, since the warring parties had indicated a willingness to go ahead.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I went to a meeting with the Americans with the understanding that everyone was on board, Israel and Hezbollah,” he said. “We were all optimistic, as Hezbollah and Israel were on board.”</p><p>That afternoon, Mr. Berri told Mr. Mikati by phone from Beirut that Hezbollah had agreed to language in the cease-fire proposal. Mr. Berri also informed Mr. Hochstein, two Lebanese officials and two Western diplomats said.</p><p>That night, Mr. Biden and Mr. Macron <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/us-cease-fire-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">announced the proposal</a>, which had been endorsed by other Western and Arab nations.</p><p>“It is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes,” Mr. Biden said. “The exchange of fire since Oct. 7, and in particular over the past two weeks, threatens a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron announce a cease-fire proposal in a joint statement at the U.N. on the evening of Sept. 25.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ludovic Marin/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In a speech at the United Nations the next day, Sept. 26, Mr. Mikati affirmed Lebanon’s support for the initiative, since he had been told that Hezbollah had signed on.</p><p>Some Israeli officials made comments that morning opposing any idea of a cease-fire, and U.S. officials said they waited anxiously for Mr. Netanyahu to issue a public endorsement of the proposal. American and French officials kept reassuring their Lebanese counterparts that the endorsement would come.</p><p>It was not until that night that the Americans saw a <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-israel-shares-the-aims-of-us-truce-proposal-after-rejecting-it/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement from Mr. Netanyahu</a> saying, “Israel shares the aims of the U.S.-led initiative.”</p><p>One U.S. official said those involved in the talks hoped they could scramble to get a cease-fire finalized the next day, Sept. 27. Some U.S. officials expected further signals of support for a cease-fire from Mr. Netanyahu in his speech that day at the United Nations.</p><p>But in his address, Mr. Netanyahu struck a hard tone, not mentioning the proposed cease-fire and vowing that Israel would keep fighting. American and French officials who had expected him to voice support for the diplomatic initiative said they were shocked.</p><p>Shortly after, Israeli fighter jets carried out a bombing south of Beirut, killing Mr. Nasrallah.</p><p>Many of the officials involved in the talks said they did not know why Israel had suddenly killed the prospect of a cease-fire. They guessed that Mr. Netanyahu faced pressure from hard-line members of his cabinet, or that Israel had a rare opportunity to assassinate Mr. Nasrallah and deemed it too good to pass up. Or that Israel had not been sincere in private talks with their proxies, the Americans.</p><p>Lara Jakes<!-- -->, Patrick Kingsley and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Hubbard is the Istanbul bureau chief, covering Turkey and the surrounding region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-hubbard">More about Ben Hubbard</a></span></p></div><div><p>Maria Abi-Habib is an investigative correspondent reporting on Latin America and is based in Mexico City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-abi-habib">More about Maria Abi-Habib</a></span></p></div><div><p>Michael D.
