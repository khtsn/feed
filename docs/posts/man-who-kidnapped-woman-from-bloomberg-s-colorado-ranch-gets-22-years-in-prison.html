Bloomberg in 2022 and kidnapping a housekeeper in what prosecutors described as a failed plan to kill the media executive and former New York City mayor, the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wy/pr/colorado-man-sentenced-22-years-kidnapping-employee-michael-bloombergs-ranch" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">authorities said</a>.</p><p>In sentencing the man, Joseph L. Beecher, 51, of Craig, Colo., who was convicted in August of several crimes, including kidnapping and using or carrying a firearm during a violent crime, Judge Alan B. Johnson of the United States District Court in Cheyenne, Wyo., also ordered that he be on supervised release for five years after his prison term.</p><p>On Feb. 2, 2022, Mr. Beecher, who had just been fired from his job at an apartment complex where he lived, drove to Mr. Bloomberg’s ranch, about 70 miles away, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/us/bloomberg-housekeeper-kidnapped-colorado.html" title="">rammed his truck</a> through the main gate, prosecutors said.</p><p>Mr. Beecher then kidnapped a housekeeper at gunpoint and forced her to drive hundreds of miles before he checked them into a motel at Cheyenne, Wyo., more than 230 miles away, prosecutors said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There, they said, a SWAT team arrested Mr. Beecher and rescued the housekeeper the following morning after he repeatedly threatened her and forced her to sleep in the same bed as him.</p><p>Before going to Mr. Bloomberg’s ranch on Feb. 2, officials said, Mr. Beecher stole two firearms and ammunition from the home of his boss and landlord, the authorities believe.</p><p>It is unclear what compelled Mr. Beecher to drive to Mr. Bloomberg’s ranch in Rio Blanco County and break in. The county sheriff’s office said at the time that Mr. Beecher had no apparent connection to the Bloombergs.</p><p>After he found a housekeeper at the ranch, Mr. Beecher asked about the whereabouts of Mr. Bloomberg’s daughters, Emma and Georgina, and learned that the Bloombergs were not at the ranch at the time, according to prosecutors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He then forced the housekeeper to drive them to various locations to find and kill another media mogul in Colorado, prosecutors said. The authorities did not identify that person.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joseph Beecher was sentenced to 22 years for kidnapping a housekeeper who worked for  Michael R. Bloomberg.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Laramie County Sheriff&#39;s Office, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>During the kidnapping, Mr. Beecher repeatedly told the housekeeper that he would shoot her face off, forced her to withdraw hundreds of dollars from an A.T.M. and made “threatening statements,” including warning her that he would shoot passers-by at a gas station if she tried to get help, she told detectives.</p><p>At the hotel, Mr. Beecher told the woman to sleep in the same bed as him with her head on his chest and her arms around him — an order that she said she followed out of fear that he might harm her, prosecutors said.</p><p>In the early hours of Feb. 3, a SWAT team descended on the motel where the two were staying, rescued the woman and took Mr. Beecher into custody. Investigators found their location by using an app on the woman’s phone and by analyzing surveillance videos.</p><p>Thomas A. Fleener, a lawyer for Mr. Beecher, declined on Friday to comment on the sentence.</p><p>Mr. Beecher is also listed in court records as a representative for himself, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/michael-bloomberg-ranch-woman-kidnapped-sentencing-0dc7619cb0cbf7877ce13910ff71ec42" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a> reported that he had represented himself at trial. Court records show Mr. Beecher himself filed a notice of appeal on Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Beecher was sentenced to 15 years in prison for kidnapping and carjacking charges and an additional seven years for using or carrying a firearm during a violent crime. A 10-year prison sentence for transporting a stolen firearm will run concurrently.</p><p>Ty Trippet, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/us/bloomberg-housekeeper-kidnapped-colorado.html" title="">said</a> in a statement after Mr. Beecher’s arrest in 2022 that the former mayor was “deeply grateful” to the authorities for “ensuring that no lives were lost” and that the victim was “rescued and safely returned to her family.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
