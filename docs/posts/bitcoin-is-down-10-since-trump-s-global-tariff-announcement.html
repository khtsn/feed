    <h1>Bitcoin Is Down 10% Since Trump’s Global Tariff Announcement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Virtually everyone in the cryptocurrency world celebrated the second election of President Trump, an enthusiastic booster of the industry who promised to turn the United States into the “crypto capital of the planet.”</p><p>But now the man nicknamed <a href="https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1881383633388491171" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“the first Bitcoin president”</a> is presiding over a Bitcoin crash.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump announced his global tariffs last week, the price of Bitcoin has plunged 10 percent, dropping below $78,000 on Sunday night. In January, Bitcoin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/business/trump-memecoins-crypto.html" title="">reached a record price of nearly $110,000</a> on the day that Mr. Trump was inaugurated.</p><p>The rapid drop shows that Bitcoin, often pitched as a stable long-term source of value, is still subject to the gyrations of the broader market that has cratered since Mr. Trump announced broad import taxes last week. Many investors treat Bitcoin just like any other tech stock, a risky investment that it makes sense to sell in difficult times.</p><p>Ever since he won a second term, Mr. Trump has largely made good on his promises to help the crypto industry. He has appointed regulators who support crypto and signed an executive order directing the creation of a government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/technology/trump-crypto-reserve-executive-order.html" title="">stockpile</a> of Bitcoin.</p></div></div>
