</span> yesterday.</p>

<p>The series opened on KRÜ&#39;s pick, Haven, with both teams opting to run Neon Breach comps. After narrowly winning KRÜ&#39;s bonus G2 picked up five of the next six rounds before back-to-back KRÜ rounds forced a timeout from G2 coach <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/20945/leader">
		Leader	</a>
</span>. Strong entrying from <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/25663/dods">
		dods	</a>
</span> provided seemingly infinite space for KRÜ to work with as they edged out the lead 7-5 going into halftime.</p>

<p>An excellent retake from KRÜ secured their second pistol to take a 9-5 lead. G2 managed to come back slightly by winning two straight gun grounds before KRÜ took a low buy win thanks to high impact from <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11235/biazik">
		biazik	</a>
</span>&#39;s Sova and dods&#39; Bucky. KRÜ looked dominant for the rest of the map as they cruised to a 13-7 map win to take a 1-0 lead in the series.</p>

<p>dods&#39; Neon took control of the first map with 360 ACS and 214 ADR. 82 ACS ahead of the runner-up, biazik.</p>


<p><em>dods destroyed G2 on Neon.</em></p>

<p>KRÜ picked up their third pistol to kick off Sunset, G2&#39;s pick. KRÜ looked much more contained compared to Haven as dods was unable to run freely throughout the map. G2 went up 7-2 before KRÜ could respond with strong early-round gameplans to keep the game close at 7-5.</p>

<p>G2 picked up their first pistol of the series thanks to a 1v3 from IGL mimi that put the Europeans in prime position to take the map at 9-5 up. Although the set plays from KRÜ continued to find value a 1v3 from <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/20064/vania">
		Vania	</a>
</span> to secure a thrifty locked in the map for G2 at 13-9.</p>

<p>Petra dominated on the second map with 26 kills, 204 ADR, and an ace in the ninth round. G2 succeeded in neutralizing dods&#39; Neon with the Brazilian receiving the lowest rating for their team with a 0.62 on Sunset.</p>


<p><em>G2 were much more composed on Sunset.</em></p>

<p>The third map, Abyss, had yet to be played by KRÜ Blaze in 2024 while G2 had a 75% win rate on the new map. Both teams were off the Neon and chose to play a mirror matchup of the standard double initiator “Ascent comp”.</p>

<p>KRÜ sped to a 5-1 lead off the back of repeated B executes before a timeout was called by G2. The constant B pressure created by KRÜ was near unbeatable for G2 as the LATAM team picked up an 8-4 first half. KRÜ went B in 90% of rounds following the pistol and G2 were unable to find any answers for it.</p>

<p>Another pistol round for KRÜ ended the series pistol record at 5-1 although this time around G2 managed to pick up the following eco after a 1v2 ace from Vania. Back-and-forth rounds followed before a heroic 4K from <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/36175/rezq">
		rezq	</a>
</span> gave G2 the opportunity to start a streak. Six rounds in a row secured the series win for G2 2-1 with a 13-11 on Abyss.</p>

<p>rezq&#39;s attack Operator was pivotal for G2&#39;s comeback as the slower pace caught off the aggressive positions KRÜ tried to force. The Turkish duelist topped the server with 24 kills and 285 ACS.</p>


<p><em>Heroics saved G2 on Abyss.</em></p>

<p>G2 Gozen will play MIBR GC on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/417795/g2-gozen-vs-mibr-gc-game-changers-2024-championship-berlin-ubsf" target="_blank">Wednesday, November 13</a> for a spot in the upper bracket final.</p>
