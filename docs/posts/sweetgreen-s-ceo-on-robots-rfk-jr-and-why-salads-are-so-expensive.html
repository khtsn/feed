A fast-food restaurant, but it would be healthy. And cool.</p><p>The documentary “Super Size Me” had made waves, and “we were going to be rejecting the fast food of the previous generation,” Mr. Neman said.</p><p>He and his business partners, Nicolas Jammet and Nathaniel Ru, opened the first Sweetgreen in 2007, on the edge of campus on M Street in Washington. As they expanded, they decided against franchising the brand, keeping control of every new location. Soon it became a buzzy millennial lifestyle brand. It sponsored an annual music festival. It went public in late 2021.</p><p>Sweetgreen now has more than 250 restaurants across the United States. The chain is known for its endlessly customizable salads — and for how quickly the cost of all those extra toppings and dressings can add up. (A recent lunch there cost me $16.28.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>With great fanfare, Sweetgreen recently put fries on its menu — air-fried in avocado oil, to make customers feel better about adding a side of carbs to a salad. Much of its food is sourced locally, including avocados from California, which will limit the hit the company takes on tariffs, executives have told investors.</p><p>And Sweetgreen doesn’t cater just to office workers eating salads at their desks. Mr. Neman, 40, said he had heard that teenagers were “obsessed” with the salads, which wasn’t the case when Sweetgreen started. “The fact that they think that eating healthy is cool is something that we envisioned,” he said at his office in Los Angeles, where the company is now based.</p><p>Back in Washington, the Trump administration is also thinking about what goes into food. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the standard-bearer of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/rfk-jr-food-dye-ban-sugar.html" title="">recently declared</a> that “sugar is poison” and pushed to ban artificial dyes in foods.</p><p>Some of those aims resonate with Mr. Neman, whose company worked with the former first lady Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” campaign. But he — like many other company leaders — is trying to talk about the company’s priorities (like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonathan-neman-9a28aa8_at-sweetgreen-we-believe-the-food-we-eat-activity-7282410695848075264-S5SH/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eliminating seed oils</a>) without being pulled into the polarized politics of the moment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We say we’re not red or blue, but we’re green,” he said.</p><p>This interview was condensed and edited for clarity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Jonathan Neman sits on a desk in an office with his hand underneath his chin." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 768w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm/00biz-corneroffice-sweetgreen-qgfm-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1536w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/2f9e4f68-cc11-5bd2-922a-092b63969e26" decoding="async" width="600" height="800"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jonathan Neman, the chief executive of Sweetgreen, said the idea that “eating healthy is cool” wasn’t the case in the salad chain’s early days.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Sweetgreen is all about healthy ingredients. Now, there is the “Make America Healthy Again” movement and R.F.K. Jr. pushing to ban artificial dyes in food. What are your thoughts on that?</strong></p><p>As it relates to “Make America Healthy,” funny story: In 2016, during a festival, we had a campaign that was a joke, a play on “Make America Great Again.” We made “Make America Healthy Again” <a href="https://x.com/JonnyNemo/status/1876688265350443113" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hats</a>.</p><p><strong>Wow.</strong></p><p>We are on the team of anyone who wants to help make America healthier. Back in the days of the Obama administration, we partnered very closely with Michelle Obama.</p><p>With R.F.K. Jr., I’ll speak to the parts related to our world. I think bringing more transparency to our food system is great. I think some of those dyes are bad. Sweetgreen has never sold soda very intentionally. We’d make a lot more money if we did. A lot of people wish we did. We never have and I don’t think ever will.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>We don’t like to get involved in the rest of it. So we’re not trying to insert ourselves politically, either me personally or as a brand.</p><p><strong>Have you communicated with the White House about healthy foods?</strong></p><p>We haven’t been directly involved at this point. But if there’s a place for us to help, we’re totally up for it.</p><p><strong>There have been </strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/health/food-safety-trump-fda-cutbacks-deadly-outbreaks.html" title="">cuts at the Food and Drug Administration</a></strong><strong>, which oversees food safety. Do you have any concerns around food safety in the U.S. right now?</strong></p><p>I think some of the things I’ve seen could be a little bit alarming. Others seem great.</p><p><strong>What are the things that concern you?</strong></p><p>I’d want to be careful to have certain guardrails around food safety, for example. And to be careful that there are not any adverse impacts to moving too fast. But overall, I think more transparency around the food system, promoting more real food, getting rid of these artificial chemicals that are allowed in our food and removing any conflicts of interest in people that are regulating our food are all good things.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Let’s talk about the robots. Will they help with profitability?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. So what we’ve seen is at the store level, the Infinite Kitchen adds at least seven points of margin. So if you look at our store, right now we’re about a 20 percent margin business. An Infinite Kitchen store should be at least seven points better.</p><p><strong>So as more robots make more salads, can people expect prices to come down?</strong></p><p>We are very conscious of making sure that Sweetgreen can be something for everyone. I think automation does give us a hedge as labor costs continue to go up, to be able to drive more value and offer that to our customer.</p><p><strong>How much is too much to pay for a salad?</strong></p><p>It really depends what you put in it. When you think about the cost of something, you have to sometimes think about the total cost. There’s the cost to you, but when you eat certain things, what’s the cost to your health? What’s the cost to the environment? People are paying not only for the quality of the taste in the food, but the fact that it’s made by hand, the fact that we pay our farmers and our team members fairly.</p><p><strong>What’s your back story? Tell me about your parents and growing up in Los Angeles.</strong></p><p>My parents immigrated here in 1979. They were Iranian Jews who came during the revolution. And that was a big part of my story growing up because I think about how fragile your life and reality can be.</p><p>I’m the oldest of four boys. Being Jewish is a big part of my identity. I’ve always been very connected to Israel and my Jewish faith and big family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>My dad has four siblings. They each have four kids, so 20 cousins. Shabbat every Friday. A lot of us Persian Jews came to Los Angeles during that time.</p><p>Entrepreneurship is really a part of the culture. Growing up, I knew very few people who worked for big companies. Everybody was a small-business owner in some way. My dad and his brothers worked together. They started a textile business.</p><p>I always knew I wanted to be in business. From a very early age my dad would take me to work with him. One of my earliest memories was that I’d want to put on a suit — because he put on a suit — and go to his factory and walk around.</p><p><strong>You had this great network of entrepreneurs during the start-up process. Were you calling your dad?</strong></p><p>I had a lot of mentors in the community, including my dad. Always was and still is. I always give my dad a lot of credit because I don’t think he expected me to go to Georgetown and then to, like, start a little salad shack.</p><p><strong>What was it like to be an entrepreneur in Washington at that time?</strong></p><p>Entrepreneurship has become a lot sexier over the past 20 years. At the time, especially at Georgetown, that wasn’t the culture. The cool thing was going to get a job in government or consulting or banking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>I got accepted to what I thought was my dream job, at Bain &amp; Company, the consulting firm.</p><p>I would have had to leave D.C. The restaurant was up and running. I spoke to my partners, like what should I do? Should I stay? Should I go? They’re like, “It’s one restaurant now. Why don’t you go and get these skills and then see what happens?” I went and realized consulting wasn’t really for me, especially after being an entrepreneur.</p><p>Finally, it was actually a conversation with someone at Bain. I always remember this conversation because he’s like: “Listen, you have two big opportunities to take huge risks in your life. One is now. The other is after your kids are out of school.<em> </em>You don’t have anything to worry about right now.”</p><p>I remembered this phrase: “You can’t fall from the floor.”</p><p><strong>Time for the lightning round. Do you have any secret Sweetgreen menu tips?</strong></p><p>The big unlock to the secret menu is the mixing of dressings. Putting two together, like spicy cashew with a green goddess. You have this whole different experience.</p><p><strong>Do you use A.I.? If so, what was the last question you asked a bot?</strong></p><p>I do use A.I. a lot. The last thing I did was not a work thing. It was personal. I have two kids, a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old. I put a picture of them in and asked what they’re going to look like when they grow up. It has blown my mind because I can’t unsee it now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>What other C.E.O. do you admire?</strong></p><p>I’d always looked up to Howard Schultz. I think what he did at Starbucks was amazing.</p><p><strong>Do you work on a plane, or do you zone out?</strong></p><p>I work a lot on the plane. It’s this amazing quiet time where I can do a lot of the work that I can’t do day to day.</p><p><strong>How do you sign off your emails?</strong></p><p>Usually just “JN.” If it’s a more inspirational message, I’ll write, “Onward.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jordyn Holman is a business reporter for The Times, covering the retail industry and consumer behavior.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/sweetgreen">Sweetgreen</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Cost of Criticising Musk:</strong> Three users who disagreed with the site’s owner saw <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/23/business/elon-musk-x-suppression-laura-loomer.html">views for their posts plummet</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Trade-Adverse Trade Adviser:</strong> Once sidelined, President Trump’s counselor Peter Navarro has returned to Washington and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/business/economy/peter-navarro-trump-tariffs.html">quickly upended the global trading system</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rewiring Britain:</strong> National Grid, which owns the high-voltage electricity grid in England and Wales, is rebuilding it in a government-backed drive to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/business/energy-environment/britain-clean-energy-national-grid.html">attract investment and tackle climate change</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Crypto Industry’s Political Spending:</strong> Federal lawmakers who benefited from crypto largess in the 2024 election are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/technology/crypto-congress-financing-lobbying.html">speedily advancing the industry’s agenda</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disappearing Bees:</strong> For beekeepers, the problem isn’t just climate change and extreme weather: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/business/honeybees-colony-collapse.html">It’s also DOGE, the trade war and the immigration crackdown</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
