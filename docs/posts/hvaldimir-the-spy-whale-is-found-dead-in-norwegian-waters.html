There were markings around the whale that could have been made by birds or other marine animals.</p><p>“It’s heartbreaking,” Mr. Strand said. “He’s touched thousands of people’s hearts just here in Norway.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Strand added that he was working to send Hvaldimir to a facility where the carcass could be preserved long enough to try to determine a cause of death.</p><p>By some estimates, the whale was close to 14 feet long and about 2,700 pounds.</p><p>Hvaldimir, whose name is a combination of “hval,” the Norwegian word for whale, and the name Vladimir, was spotted in northern Norway in 2019, at first alarming fishermen.</p><p>Belugas tend to move in groups and typically inhabit remote Arctic areas. Adding to the intrigue around Hvaldimir, he was wearing a harness that identified it as “equipment” from St. Petersburg. There also appeared to be a camera mount.</p><p>Some wondered if the whale was on a Russian reconnaissance mission. Russia has never claimed ownership of the whale.</p><p>If Hvaldimir was a spy, he was an exceptionally friendly one.</p><p>The whale showed signs of domestication, and was comfortable around people. He remained in busier waters than are typical for belugas, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/world/europe/russia-spy-whale.html" title="">prompting concerns</a> from scientists, activists and experts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“He was completely acclimatized to human culture,” Mr. Strand said, adding that it appeared Hvaldimir had “been in captivity for a lot of his life.”</p><p>Mr. Strand and his team worked to educate curious residents and tourists about the whale, to protect it as much as possible as it remained outside of its usual habitat.</p><p>Last year, Hvaldimir was seen off the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/14/magazine/hvaldimir-whale.html" title="">coast of Sweden</a>, a southward journey that took him farther away from food sources and on a path toward more industrial and dangerous harbors.</p><p>Mr. Strand said that he had been promoting safety measures for Hvaldimir, who had so far enjoyed a calm year, and had seemed to be in good health on Friday based on reports.</p><p>“I’m not sure what’s happened,” Mr. Strand said. “But we’ll find out.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emmett Lindner writes about breaking and trending news.
