    <h1>Appeals Court Lets Trump Administration Halt New Refugee Admissions Amid Lawsuit</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An appeals court ruled on Tuesday that the Trump administration must admit thousands of people granted refugee status before Jan. 20, but declined to stop President Trump from halting the admission of new refugees.</p><p><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.2108cafc-0bde-4bba-9db6-a3c8ba717130/gov.uscourts.ca9.2108cafc-0bde-4bba-9db6-a3c8ba717130.28.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The ruling</a>, issued by a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, often a reliably liberal court, did not directly address the question of whether the government must restore billions of dollars in funding to nonprofit groups that help resettle refugees after they have reached the United States.</p><p>But the decision was framed as a victory by Melissa Keaney, an attorney for the International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the groups representing the plaintiffs. She said that “tens of thousands” of people who were overseas would be processed and admitted to the United States as refugees.</p><p>“The Ninth Circuit’s ruling insures that U.S. refugee admission remains open in part,” she said.</p><p>But it was a rare victory as well for the Trump administration and its efforts to clamp down on immigration. Appellate judges have largely upheld rulings by the district courts blocking the president’s agenda. In contrast, Tuesday’s decision reversed in part an earlier ruling by Judge Jamal N. Whitehead of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, who was nominated to the bench by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p></div></div>
