He was 79.</p><p>His death was confirmed by his son Jase Robertson in a <a href="https://x.com/JaseDuckman/status/1926795616023195654" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media post</a> late Sunday that did not specify a cause.</p><p>Jase said on the family’s podcast last year that his father had early-stage Alzheimer’s and other health problems.</p><p>Mr. Robertson was one of the stars of “Duck Dynasty,” an A&amp;E series that stars his family — Mr. Robertson and his wife, Kay; their sons; the sons’ wives; an uncle and some grandchildren — and revolves loosely around their duck hunting gear business.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Robertson was born on April 24, 1946, in Vivian, La.</p><p>He founded Duck Commander, a company that makes duck-call instruments used in hunting, in 1973 in Louisiana.</p><p>“Duck Dynasty,” which ran over 11 seasons from 2012 to 2017, once <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/business/media/duck-dynasty-familys-fortunes-lifted-by-calculated-push-into-reality-tv.html" title="">ranked among the most popular shows on cable</a> and had as many as 12 million viewers. But it occasionally courted controversy.</p><p>In 2013, Mr. Robertson was briefly suspended from the show after an interview surfaced in which he had made statements that were widely seen as offensive to gay people. But the network <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/business/media/bowing-to-pressure-ae-revokes-suspension-of-duck-dynasty-star.html" title="">quickly reinstated him</a> under pressure from fans and after the family issued a statement saying in effect that there would be no show without their patriarch.</p><p>Last year, Jase Robertson said on the family’s podcast, “Unashamed with the Robertson Family,” that his father had early-stage Alzheimer&#39;s. “Phil’s not doing well,” Jase said, adding that Mr. Robertson also had a “blood disease causing all kinds of problems.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Robertson’s survivors include his wife, his sons Alan, Jase, Jep and Willie, and several grandchildren.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Yan Zhuang is a Times reporter in Seoul who covers breaking news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
