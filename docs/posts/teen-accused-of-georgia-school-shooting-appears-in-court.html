He faces four charges of felony murder.</p><p>His father is expected to appear this morning, as well. Colin Gray, the father, is accused of allowing his son, Colt Gray, a high school freshman, access to the military-style rifle used in the mass shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Ga., on Wednesday morning.</p><p>The teenager’s hearing, which happened in a courtroom in Winder, lasted less than 10 minutes. He appeared alongside a public defender, Zane Harmon, who told the judge that there was no request for bond. </p><p>The blond-haired suspect, whose face was not visible to cameras because he is a minor, briefly answered procedural questions from Judge Currie M. Mingledorff II before he was escorted out of the courtroom. He wore a green T-shirt with khaki pants and boots.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Family members of those killed in the shooting lined the first row of the courtroom and spilled into the second. </p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Gray, the father, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and other crimes in connection with the shooting. Officials say that a “complex investigation” is ongoing, and that they may file additional charges.</p><p>Questions have swirled about what motivated the suspect to open fire at the school where he was a new student, just over a month into the school year. The shooter used a black AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle, according to arrest warrants. The four killings happened within minutes.</p><p>Law enforcement officials said that the suspect surrendered to school resource officers and was taken into custody.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
