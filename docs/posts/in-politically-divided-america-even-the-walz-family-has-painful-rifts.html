His own family is a prime example.</p><p>In recent days, his brother Jeff Walz has spoken out on social media and in an interview with the right-leaning outlet NewsNation about the rift between them, noting that he is “100% opposed” to Tim Walz’s political ideology.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The stories I could tell,” Jeff Walz said in a recent Facebook post about his brother. “Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future.” In another, he said he had “thought hard” about getting on stage and endorsing former President Donald J. Trump, to whom he donated $20 in 2016.</p><p>“I’m torn between that and just keeping my family out of it,” he wrote.</p><p>The divide between the Walz brothers is not the only political rift among the families at the top of the ticket in the 2024 election. Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/business/media/donald-trump-niece-lawsuit.html" title="">sued his niece</a> Mary Trump, a vocal critic of his politics, after she turned over his confidential tax returns to The New York Times. Ms. Trump’s second memoir, which describes toxicity and dysfunction in their family, was released Tuesday.</p><p>The siblings of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., supporters of the Democratic ticket, denounced his recently abandoned presidential campaign as well as his subsequent decision to publicly support Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/elections/rfk-jr-suspends-campaign-presidential-race.html" title="">which they called “a betrayal.”</a></p><p>In some ways, the splits in families at the nation’s highest rungs of politics are no different from the divisions that have torn apart many families in this deeply divided moment in the nation’s history, one where it has become normal to argue over politics at gatherings with relatives or to avoid the topic altogether in hope of preserving harmony.</p><p>“Every family has got people who don’t agree with each other,” said Jack Considine, a former Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota who became friends with Tim Walz after Mr. Walz coached his children in various sports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But for candidates in the middle of a high-stakes election, such rifts can create additional headaches — a dynamic that Mr. Walz’s brother appeared to appreciate after his initial Facebook posts drew wide attention. In his subsequent interview with NewsNation, Jeff Walz said that his reference to “the stories I could tell” referred merely to the fact that Tim Walz often got carsick as a child and that no one wanted to sit beside him on trips.</p><p>Jeff Walz did not respond to numerous attempts to contact him by phone, online and at homes he owns in Florida and Tennessee. A representative from Mr. Walz’s campaign declined to comment.</p><p>The breach in the Walz family has been painful, according to the men’s sister, Sandra Dietrich, who lives in Nebraska, where the siblings were raised. Jeff Walz has said he has not spoken with his brother, beyond a brief phone call, in years.</p><p>“They all have their own opinions, and I have mine,” Ms. Dietrich said. “They’re my brothers and I love them.” She added that she was a Democrat and planned to vote for her brother and Ms. Harris.</p><p>“We’ve always agreed to disagree,” she continued. “That’s where I’m at with Jeff. I just wish things were different — that it didn’t wreck people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>She said her father emphasized to his children the need to respect other people’s opinions. For him, she said, the golden rule was key.</p><p>“Be kind. Be good,” she said he told them. “We were taught to respect everybody, no matter what.”</p><h2 id="link-68528f4b">A family of educators</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Walz family moved to Butte, Neb., while Tim Walz was in high school.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The four Walz children were close growing up and adored their father, James Walz, who worked as a superintendent of schools in Valentine, Neb., Ms. Dietrich said.

Tim became a social studies teacher and coached football and other sports in Nebraska and in Minnesota. Ms. Dietrich moved to the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. She taught second grade there for a couple of years, and then taught at a country school outside Alliance, Neb., where she lives now. Craig taught in Nebraska and in St. Charles, Minn., and Jeff became assistant principal at a middle school in Citrus County, Fla.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Jeff Walz registered as a Republican in Florida in 1988. He owns a home in a tidy, gated community in Freeport, a panhandle community where he and his wife, Laurie, lived for years until this summer and where their granddaughter now lives.</p><p>He has two adult children, neither of whom returned requests for comment. His daughter’s ex-husband, Nathan Axelson, said he was never particularly close with his former in-laws but said he did know Jeff was a Republican. “Not nothing crazy,” Mr. Axelson said.</p><p>Of his in-law’s siblings, he had met only Craig Walz, he said.</p><p>A family friend, who has stayed in touch with the Walz family since their days growing up in Valentine, Neb., said the other siblings had not talked much about Jeff in recent years.</p><h2 id="link-18e1334f">‘Breathe in, breathe out’</h2><p>The family came together in 2016 for a funeral after a terrible accident.</p><p>Craig Walz, the youngest sibling, was on a Father’s Day camping trip with his son Jacob and two other people in the Boundary Waters region in Minnesota when a powerful storm swept through the area. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/craig-walz-st-charles-high-school/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to news reports at the time, a large white pine tree snapped and fell on the group</a>, striking Craig, a popular math and science teacher, and killing him.

But the wind was so severe that night that rescuers had to wait until the next morning to evacuate the body of his father.</p><p>“We lost our baby brother,” Ms. Dietrich said.</p><p>The Walzes comforted one another. But it was at some point near the time of the funeral that relatives became aware of the political breach in the family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Doug Reiman, a cousin, said Ms. Dietrich and Jeff Walz were not on speaking terms during that time. He did not know if politics was the sole reason for the split. Jeff Walz said on Facebook that he spoke to Tim in a quick phone call in July when Tim was being vetted as a potential vice-presidential candidate. Other than that, they had not spoken in eight years.</p><p>In his remarks to <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/jeff-walz-walks-back-comments-opposes-tim-walz-views/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NewsNation</a>, Jeff said that while he didn’t agree with his brother’s politics, he didn’t want to be involved in any political campaign going forward.</p><p>“It wasn’t my intent, it wasn’t our intent as a family, to put something out there to influence the general public,” he said.</p><p>Darlene Walz, who is a Democrat, told <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/tim-walzs-mom-darlene-walz-fights-to-keep-peace-with-his-trumpy-brother" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Daily Beast</a> that she stays out of the breach between her sons but that she is close to both and recently visited Jeff at his Florida home. They did not talk about politics, she said.</p><p>Ms. Dietrich did not want to talk about her strained relationship with Jeff.</p><p>“People need to realize we come from a large family, but we were taught to respect other people’s opinions,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>She said when she thinks about the political conflicts across the country, she channels her brother Craig’s voice. He liked to say, “breathe in, breathe out” as a reminder to stay calm and handle adversity.</p><p>And, Ms. Dietrich said, she remained hopeful that the rift would eventually heal.</p><p>“This too will pass,” she said. “Family is forever.”</p><p>Beth Braden contributed reporting from Tennessee. <!-- -->Kitty Bennett<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Dionne Searcey is a Times reporter who writes about how the choices made by people and corporations affect the future of the planet.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dionne-searcey">More about Dionne Searcey</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>16</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Even the Walz Family Can’t Bridge Politics<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/tim-walz">Tim Walz</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
