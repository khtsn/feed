associated with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps for mounting a wide-ranging attack targeting politicians, officials and journalists that led to the hacking of the Trump campaign.</p><p>The Iranians unleashed a barrage of malicious emails to a wide array of targets in recent years, but in 2024 began focusing on undermining former President Donald J. Trump, whom they regard as their most implacable enemy, according to an indictment unsealed on Friday.</p><p>The attacks were “part of Iran’s continuing efforts to stoke discord, erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process and unlawfully acquire information related to former and current U.S. officials,” prosecutors wrote.</p><p>The indictment, while expected, highlighted the heightened threat posed by hostile international actors — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/politics/october-election-interference.html" title="">Iran, Russia and China</a> chief among them — using cyberattacks in hopes of disrupting the U.S. election and intimidating domestic dissidents abroad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The hackers — Masoud Jalili, Seeyed Aghamiri and Yasar Balaghi — are all living in Iran and are not likely to ever face justice in an American courtroom. They have been charged with wire fraud, identity theft, providing material support to a terrorist organization and a variety of cybercrimes.</p><p>From 2020 to May 2024, the three men, all experienced computer experts, targeted dozens of current and former officials at the White House, National Security Council, Defense Department, and other agencies “apparently without success,” according to the 37-page indictment.</p><p>They also tried to compromise the account of at least two journalists as well as members of international nongovernmental organizations, foreign intelligence agencies, human rights groups, officials with Afghanistan’s government and United Nations personnel.</p><p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations has repeatedly denied the accusations. “The Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election,” it said in a statement last month when U.S. intelligence officials publicly accused Iran of hacking the Trump campaign.</p><p>The indictment did not identify the Trump campaign officials whose accounts had been hacked, but one of the people targeted was Susie Wiles, a senior adviser to the former president, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose details intended to be private.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Justice Department will “counter and disrupt the efforts of Iran, as well as Russia and China, to exploit” the country’s democratic freedoms, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said during a news conference on Friday.</p><p>“The American people, not a foreign power, will decide the outcome of our election,” he added.</p><p>Iran was able to infiltrate the Trump campaign accounts this year after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/politics/iran-trump-campaign-hacking.html" title="">gaining access to the email accounts</a> of a longtime political adviser, Roger J. Stone, in a type of breach that allows a hacker to infiltrate a circle of people by impersonating someone they communicate regularly with.</p><p>The material stolen from the campaign was sent to journalists at The New York Times and other outlets but was not widely published.</p><p>Iran’s hostility to Mr. Trump also includes an apparent effort to kill him, U.S. officials have said. Intelligence agencies have been tracking a potential Iranian assassination plot against Mr. Trump, and in August, the Justice Department charged a Pakistani man who had recently visited Iran with trying to hire a hit man to assassinate political figures, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/us/politics/justice-dept-assassination.html" title="">including the former president</a>.</p><p>Maggie Haberman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/islamic-revolutionary-guards-corps-quds-force">Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (Quds Force)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-justice-department">U.S. Justice Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/roger-stone">Roger Stone</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
