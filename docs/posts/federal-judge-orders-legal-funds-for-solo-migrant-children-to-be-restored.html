The government had argued that the funding was discretionary and that it was not obligated to provide legal representation for the children.</p><p>But Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín of San Francisco disagreed, saying on Tuesday that by terminating the funding, the government had potentially violated its obligations to protect children from human trafficking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Under a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/7311/text" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">law combating human trafficking</a>, which the nonprofit groups argued the government had violated, the government must, to the “greatest extent practicable,” provide legal representation to minors.</p><p>Children represented by the nonprofits, according to the groups’ complaint, arrived in the United States to flee violence, poverty and other dangers. Many of them are from Central America. Most do not speak English or have the means to hire a lawyer.</p><p>Nearly two-thirds of unaccompanied children had representation when they appeared in U.S. courts during the 2024 fiscal year, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/media/1344931/dl?inline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to official data</a>. Children who have lawyers <a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/file/852516/dl?inline=" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attend their hearings 95 percent of the time</a>, while those without representation attend only 33 percent of the time. Thousands of children in recent years who have missed their court dates have been ordered to be deported.</p><p>Since the federal funding was cut off, the groups said that they had been forced to consider cutting staff to stay financially viable or to stop providing legal services to existing and future clients. The groups, the judge said on Tuesday, would likely suffer “irreparable harm” without the funding.</p><p>Emily Hilliard, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the care of migrant children, said in an email on Wednesday that the department did not comment on ongoing litigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The order, which came into effect on Wednesday, will expire on April 16, with both parties able to file more briefs ahead of a final decision by the court.</p></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> An ‘Administrative Error’ Deportation:</strong> Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was in the U.S. legally, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/maryland-man-deportation-error-el-salvador.html">now in prison in El Salvador</a>, and federal courts have no jurisdiction to order his release, the Trump administration said in a court filing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Counting Migrant Students:</strong> A divide between Oklahoma’s governor and schools chief over undocumented students <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/oklahoma-republican-fight.html">may mark the outer limits of acceptable immigration enforcement, or the next frontier</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A City’s Split:</strong> President Trump has made Aurora, Colo. synonymous with the supposed scourge of Venezuelan gangs, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/politics/trump-aurora-migrants.html">some wonder if his immigration raids are damaging the city more</a> than the migrants ever did.</p></li><li><p><strong>Migrant Children: </strong>Aid organizations were notified by the Trump administration that it would cancel a contract that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/migrant-children-legal-representation-funding.html">funds the legal representation of more than 25,000 children</a> who entered the United States alone, a decision that leaves them vulnerable to swift deportation.</p></li><li><p><strong> Watchdog Agencies Shut Down: </strong>The civil rights branch of the Department of Homeland Security and two ombudsman offices were shut down by the Trump administration, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/trump-civil-rights-homeland-security-deportations.html">gutting the offices responsible for conducting oversight</a> of President Trump’s immigration crackdown.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
