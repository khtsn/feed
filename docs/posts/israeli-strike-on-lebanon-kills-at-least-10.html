But the mayor of the town of Toul, where the attack took place, denied the claim.</p><p>The death toll was one of the largest so far in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/08/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-destruction.html" title="">near-daily volley of border attacks</a> between Lebanon and Israel over the 10 months since the Israeli war against Hamas in Gaza began. Hezbollah and other Lebanon-based militants have been attacking Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>Tensions have escalated in recent weeks after the killings of senior leaders from Hezbollah and Hamas, both allies of Iran. Hezbollah and Iran have both vowed to retaliate against Israel.</p></div></div><div><div><p>There was a concerted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/middleeast/cease-fire-talks-doha-israel-hamas.html" title="">diplomatic push this past week for a Gaza cease-fire</a> in an effort to avert an even wider regional war. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is scheduled to travel to Israel on Saturday to help facilitate the talks, which are being mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.</p><p>All of the people killed in Toul, near the city of Nabatiye, were Syrian nationals and included a woman and her two children, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. Lebanese state-run media said they were killed when Israeli fighter jets struck a factory.</p><p>Saeed Mahmoud, the mayor of Toul, denied that the warehouse was a Hezbollah weapons facility.</p><p>“This is a place where they collected steel spare parts,” he said in a phone interview.</p><p>The Israeli military said it was looking into the claim that several civilians were harmed as a result of the strike.</p><p>Hezbollah’s chief, Hassan Nasrallah, threatened in July to hit new targets in Israel if it continues to target civilians in Lebanon. In response to the latest attack, Hezbollah said it fired a barrage of rockets at Ayelet Hashachar, a kibbutz in northern Israel.</p></div></div><div><div><p>There were no immediate reports of casualties, although the Israeli military said a soldier was severely wounded in a separate rocket attack from Lebanon.</p><p>Syrian laborers have a history of working in Lebanese factories and farms, where they can often earn more than they do at home. They often live where they work with their families.</p><p>Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets and drones at northern Israel in solidarity with Hamas, which began the war with a massive surprise attack on Oct. 7 that killed roughly 1,200 people. Israel has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza over the past 10 months, according to Gaza health officials</p><p>Israel has responded to attacks from Lebanon with bombardments that have killed more than 500 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, according to figures from the Lebanese health ministry, Hezbollah and the United Nations.</p><p>For months, Israel and Lebanon have appeared to carefully calibrate their attacks in an attempt to avoid a wider escalation.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But in the wake of a rocket attack in late July from Lebanon that killed 12 children and teenagers in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, Israel assassinated Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commander, in Beirut.</p><p>A few hours later, an explosion widely attributed to Israel killed Ismail Haniyeh, one of the most senior figures in Hamas, in the Iranian capital Tehran. He was there to attend the inauguration of a new Iranian president.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hezbollah supporters attending the funeral of Fuad Shukr, a commander of the group who was killed in an Israeli attack last month in the southern suburbs of Beirut.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Iran and its ally Hezbollah have pledged to avenge the killings. But U.S., Iranian and Israeli officials said on Friday that Iran had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/middleeast/iran-israel-hamas-cease-fire.html" title="">decided to delay any reprisals</a> against Israel to allow mediators to continue working toward a cease-fire in Gaza.</p><p>High-level talks in Qatar on a cease-fire and release of the 115 hostages still held by Hamas and its allies in Gaza ended without an immediate breakthrough on Friday. But the United States, Egypt and Qatar said the negotiations would go on next week in Cairo as mediators raced to try to secure a truce.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Even as senior officials have shuttled from capital to capital in an attempt to end the war, the fighting in Gaza has continued apace. Israeli aircraft struck dozens of sites across the Gaza Strip over the past day, the Israeli military said on Saturday, and ground troops again swept through swathes of the already-devastated southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.</p><p>The Israeli military again ordered Palestinians to flee parts of central Gaza that Israel had previously designated a “humanitarian zone” for many of the nearly two million Gazans who have been forced to leave their homes during the war.</p><p>Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesman, said Hamas and other militant groups had repeatedly fired rockets from the area.</p><p>Many Gazans have been displaced multiple times by the war. Aid groups say there is still nowhere safe for them to go, as Israel has vowed to target Hamas wherever it believes the organization is operating.</p><p>“Many of the thousands of families affected only recently arrived in the area, after other displacement orders in Khan Younis,” said Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees.</p><p>Gazans remained “trapped in an endless nightmare,” she added.</p><p>Hwaida Saad<!-- -->, <!-- -->Victoria Kim<!-- --> and <!-- -->Raja Abdulrahim<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Euan Ward is a reporter contributing to The Times from Beirut.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward">More about Euan Ward</a></span></p></div><div><p>Maria Abi-Habib is an investigative correspondent reporting on Latin America and is based in Mexico City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-abi-habib">More about Maria Abi-Habib</a></span></p></div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporting fellow with a focus on international news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman">More about Aaron Boxerman</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">Israel-Hamas War News</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
