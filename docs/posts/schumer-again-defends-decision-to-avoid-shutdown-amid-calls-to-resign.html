Feeding hungry children? Not essential’” he said, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. “On Day 4, ‘Mass transit? All transit? Aid to the states? Not essential. We’re cutting it.’”</p><p>It was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/government-shutdown-senate-democrats.html" title="">same argument Mr. Schumer made to colleagues over a week ago</a>, that a shutdown would further empower Mr. Trump and Elon Musk in their bid to defund and dismantle federal programs. But his justification has drawn rebuke from within his own party, with some even calling for him to step down or encourage others to mount a primary challenge when he faces re-election in 2028.</p><p>On Sunday, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, abruptly tried to end an interview with ABC after he was pressed on whether he wanted to see Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York challenge Mr. Schumer in the primary. Mr. Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats, has joined colleagues in criticizing Mr. Schumer but reaffirmed in the interview that he is “the leader of the party.”</p><p>Mr. Schumer on Sunday rejected any comparison between recent criticism he has faced from Democrats and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/06/us/biden-trump-election" title="">the outcry against President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</a> during his initial refusals to step aside in the 2024 election.</p><p>“Look, in my caucus, we have a disagreement as to, you know, some people voted one way, some people voted the other,” Mr. Schumer said. “But we’ve all agreed to respect each other because each side saw why the other side felt so strongly about it. And our caucus is united in fighting Donald Trump every step of the way.”</p><p>Minho Kim<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Musk Effect:</strong> Elon Musk is seemingly everywhere, dominating the news out of Washington and beyond.
