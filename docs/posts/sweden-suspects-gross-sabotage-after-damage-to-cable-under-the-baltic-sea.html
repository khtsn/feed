The ship was escorted to the coast of Sweden for an investigation, the authorities said.</p><p>“We suspect that a serious act of sabotage was committed in the Swedish economic zone yesterday,” Mats Ljungqvist, the Swedish prosecutor leading the investigation into the damage, said in a phone interview on Monday.</p><p>The authorities have not yet made public the nature or the extent of the damage to the communications cable, which runs between Sweden and Latvia.</p><p>The incident follows other suspected sabotage attempts on cables under the Baltic Sea, which has recently become a theater of potential hybrid warfare between NATO and Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Two weeks ago, the Atlantic alliance started a new patrol and surveillance operation to protect critical infrastructure in the sea, on which Russia has coastline, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/europe/finland-estonia-cables-russia.html" title="">a number of cables</a> were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/europe/finland-estonia-cables-russia.html" title="">severed</a>.</p><p>The NATO mission, called Baltic Sentry, is intended to help protect underwater cables and pipelines by enhancing the alliance’s presence in the region, said Mark Rutte, the organization’s secretary general. The operation involves frigates, maritime patrol aircraft, submarine satellites, remotely operated vehicles and drones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Aboard a French Navy surveillance plane patrolling last week over the Baltic Sea as part of a NATO mission to protect undersea cables and pipelines.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Leicester/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>NATO, of which Sweden is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/world/europe/sweden-nato-neutrality.html" title="">the newest member</a>, said the mission was an effort “to improve the ability to protect critical undersea infrastructure and respond if required.”</p><p>Alliance officials have regularly said that, while they suspect Russia of being behind the sabotage of cables and pipelines, actual responsibility is extremely difficult to prove.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Swedish security service said a preliminary investigation suggested that the incident on Sunday may have been an effort to target Swedish interests. The seized vessel “is suspected to have carried out the sabotage” the security service said in <a href="https://sakerhetspolisen.se/ovriga-sidor/other-languages/english-engelska/press-room/news/news/2025-01-27-investigation-of-sabotage-incident-in-the-baltic-sea.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement issued Monday</a>.</p><p>“Right now, Swedish authorities are on the vessel to conduct various investigative measures,” Johan Wikstrom, a spokesman for the service, said by telephone on Monday.</p><p>Mr. Ljungqvist, the prosecutor, said that the seized vessel was called the Vezhen.</p><p>Navigation Maritime Bulgare, a Bulgarian shipping company that <a href="https://www.navbul.com/en/fleet/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lists the Vezhen</a> in its fleet as a bulk carrier with a Maltese flag, posted <a href="https://www.navbul.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement on its website</a> on Monday referring to a “a force majeure situation that occurred due to the unfavorable hydrometeorological conditions in the area.”</p><p>The company said it did not have “information about any intentional actions by the crew” that could lead to cable damage and expressed its support for the authorities in the investigation.</p><p>Mr. Wikstrom said the coast guard on Sunday escorted the vessel to the Swedish coast. It is now anchored outside of Karlskrona, a southern city that is home to Sweden’s largest naval base and also the coast guard headquarters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Wikstrom declined to provide other details about the seized vessel or how and where the authorities had discovered the damage to the cable.</p><p>NATO ships and aircraft responded to the reported damage and were working with their regional allies, the alliance said on Monday in an email.</p><p>Prime Minister Evika Silina of Latvia said in <a href="https://x.com/EvikaSilina/status/1883532150932484160" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a> that Latvian, Swedish and NATO authorities were working together to investigate the incident, patrol the area and inspect vessels. She added that the cable had been damaged in Sweden’s economic zone and that the authorities had started a “criminal investigation.”</p><p>In late December, the Finnish authorities seized an oil tanker that they suspected of cutting undersea cables, accusing the ship of being part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/europe/finland-estonia-cables-russia.html" title="">Russia’s “shadow fleet,”</a> which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/world/europe/russian-oil-tankers-gabon.html" title="">Western officials say they think</a> Russia uses <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/world/europe/russia-ship-shadow-fleet-finland.html" title="">to evade sanctions</a>.

Germany’s defense minister described the severing of the cables as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/business/finland-germany-cable-baltic-sea.html" title="">an act of “sabotage”</a> aimed at European countries that have supported Ukraine while it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">fights Russia</a>, though American intelligence authorities said they were not cut deliberately.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In 2022, explosions damaged parts of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/26/world/europe/nordstream-pipeline-explosion-russia.html" title="">Nord Stream pipeline</a>, stopping Russian natural gas deliveries to Western Europe.
