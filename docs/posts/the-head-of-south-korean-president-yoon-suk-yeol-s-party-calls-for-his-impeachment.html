    <h1>The Head of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s Party Calls for His Impeachment</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If impeached, Mr. Yoon would be suspended from office until the Constitutional Court decides whether to reinstate or remove him.</p><p>Mr. Yoon’s martial law lasted only six hours, until early Wednesday. He was forced to lift it following the Assembly’s vote to reject the military rule. But the short-lived episode, which the opposition likened to a failed “palace coup” by an extremely unpopular leader, triggered outrage across South Korea. Even if briefly, it also exposed the fragility of the democracy South Koreans have been proud of.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Han said he opposed impeaching Mr. Yoon for fear of creating more national confusion. But on Friday he said, “There is fear that if President Yoon stays in office, he may repeat extreme actions like martial law.”</p><p>“If that happens, South Korea and its people will fall into a bigger crisis,” he said.</p><p>Some opposition lawmakers have warned that Mr. Yoon might attempt to impose martial again out of desperation.</p></div></div>
