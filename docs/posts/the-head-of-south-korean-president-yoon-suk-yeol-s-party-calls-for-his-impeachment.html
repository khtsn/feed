But his comments increased the likelihood that the impeachment bill against Mr. Yoon would gain enough support to pass through the National Assembly.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Han joined opposition lawmakers in warning that if Mr. Yoon stays in office, he might try to impose martial law again in a desperate attempt to hold onto power. In a powerful rebuttal to Mr. Yoon, the defense ministry said that even if he did, the military would not follow. And the country’s special forces command, which joined Mr. Yoon’s ill-fated martial law, said it would not join another.</p><p>“I want to make it clear that it will never happen,” Lieutenant General Kwak Jong-geun said when asked about the possibility of another martial law attempt during an interview he gave to two opposition lawmakers that was broadcast live on YouTube on Friday. “Even if I get such an order, I will reject it.”</p><p>A broader meeting of the P.P.P.’s 108 lawmakers was taking place inside the National Assembly that could have significant sway over Mr. Yoon’s political future. An impeachment vote is scheduled for Saturday evening. At least eight votes from Mr. Yoon’s governing camp are needed to impeach the president.</p><p>If impeached, Mr. Yoon would be suspended from office until the Constitutional Court decides whether to reinstate or remove him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The opposition proposed impeaching Mr. Yoon this week, arguing that he had committed “insurgency” and other anti-constitutional crimes when he declared martial law on Tuesday night. He banned all political activities and sent troops to take over the National Assembly. Legislation on martial law banned such acts, the opposition said in its impeachment bill formally submitted on Thursday.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Korean opposition lawmakers and civil society activists holding placards reading “Impeach Yoon Suk Yeol for rebellion!” at the National Assembly in Seoul on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Yoon’s surprise declaration of martial law lasted only six hours, until early Wednesday. He was forced to lift it following a vote in the Assembly to repeal the military rule. The short-lived episode, which the opposition likened to a failed “palace coup” by an extremely unpopular leader, triggered outrage across South Korea. Even if briefly, it also exposed the fragility of the hard-won democracy South Koreans have been proud of.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Han had said he opposed impeaching Mr. Yoon for fear of creating more national confusion. But on Friday he said, “There is fear that if President Yoon stays in office, he may repeat extreme actions like martial law.”</p><p>“If that happens, South Korea and its people will fall into a bigger crisis,” he said.</p><p>Some opposition lawmakers have warned that Mr. Yoon might attempt to impose martial law again out of desperation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The political struggle continue to unfold as more details emerged about what happened in the hours after Mr. Yoon declared martial law.</p><p>Opposition lawmakers have claimed that when martial law troops barged into the Assembly, they had an order to detain political leaders, including National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik, the main opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, as well as Mr. Han, the head of Mr. Yoon’s own party.</p><p>Opposition lawmaker Park Sun-won, who had served as a deputy chief of the National Intelligence Service, told The New York Times that the military police planned to take those who would have been detained to a bunker in the headquarters of the military’s Defense Counterintelligence Command in Gwacheon south of Seoul.</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Han said he also had credible intelligence that after declaring martial law, Mr. Yoon had ordered the counterintelligence commander Lt. Gen. Yeo In-hyong to detain key politicians in the name of rounding up “anti-state forces.”</p><p>Neither the opposition lawmakers nor Mr. Han disclosed sources for their intelligence.</p><p>Lt. Gen. Kwak, the special forces commander, said his units were not running arrest squads.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He said that Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun had instructed him to remove lawmakers from the Assembly hall, where the vote on repealing the martial law order was taking place. But he said he ignored the order.</p><p>“I knew I could be punished for disobedience,” Lt. Gen. Kwak said. “But I also thought such an order had legal problems and I told my troops not to go in there.”</p><p>Mr. Kim resigned after the martial law collapsed. He has since been barred by prosecutors from leaving the country. Opposition lawmakers asked the police to investigate Mr. Yoon and others involved in the declaration of martial law on charges of insurgency. If convicted on those charges, the mastermind of the insurgency faces either the death penalty or life imprisonment.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
