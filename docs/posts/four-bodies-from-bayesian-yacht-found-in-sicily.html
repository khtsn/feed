Body bags were lifted from a firefighting vessel in Porticello, Sicily, on Wednesday afternoon as a large group of rescuers stood by in their uniforms.</p><p>On the dock, a crowd of reporters and bystanders watched on in near complete silence, as a church bell tolled in the background.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Although 15 people made it to safety and the yacht’s cook was confirmed dead, the fate of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/business/dealbook/sicily-yacht-sinks-missing-passengers.html" title="">the remaining six people</a>, including a British tech entrepreneur, Mike Lynch, had been formally unresolved until the update on Wednesday.</p><p>In addition to Mr. Lynch, the remaining people who had been identified as missing by the authorities were his daughter Hannah; Jonathan Bloomer, the chairman of Morgan Stanley International; his wife, Judy Bloomer; Christopher J.

To complicate matters, they had to navigate through broken furnishings and electrical wiring that blocked the tight spaces inside the hull.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emma-bubola">More about Emma Bubola</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
