Instead, it prompted a new worry: Perhaps the money-gushing “Lion King” franchise (movie and TV spinoffs, a smash stage musical, theme park attractions, the sale of countless stuffed Simbas) was starting to slow. The franchise is 30 years old, after all.</p><p>But “Mufasa,” which cost $200 million to make, has since become a sleeper success. It was on pace sell roughly $16.5 million in tickets from Friday through Monday, enough for No. 1 and bringing its domestic total to about $211 million. That would push the movie into the box office top 10 for 2024. Globally, “Mufasa” has now been No. 1 for five weeks running, and domestic and overseas ticket sales now total around $600 million.</p><p>Box office analysts estimated on Saturday that “Mufasa” could add an additional $75 million to $100 million to its worldwide total by the end of its run in theaters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Competition for family viewers probably hurt “Mufasa” when it debuted on Dec. 20. Other movies going after the same audience included “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” “Wicked” and Disney’s own “Moana 2.” “Mufasa,” directed by Barry Jenkins, was the only prequel of the bunch, and prequels usually have less urgent “need to see,” to use Hollywood jargon: Why rush out to find out how a story starts when you already know how it ends?</p><p>But competition has eased. The only new movies to arrive over the weekend were “One of Them Days,” a low-budget, R-rated comedy, and “Wolf Man,” an R-rated horror movie. The historical drama “September 5,” which has received <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/movies/september-5-review.html" title="">strong reviews</a>, had been scheduled for wide release on Friday. But after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences pushed back nominations voting for the Oscars because of the Los Angeles fires, Paramount Pictures delayed the film’s rollout in the hopes that it will get nominations that it can then use in ads. (A wide release for “September 5” is now planned for early February.)</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
