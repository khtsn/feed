Bragg, the district attorney, said in the release.</p><p>Mr. Mateo’s lawyer declined to comment. His client has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of grand larceny, fraud and identity theft, among others.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While the former schoolteacher was in the nursing home, her husband remained a tenant in their apartment until he died on Sept. 1, 2022, according to the release. Just a day after his death, prosecutors said, Mr. Mateo deposited the first of 26 checks he stole from the woman. He also funneled a $3,000 check from her dead husband’s account into his personal bank account, they said, and took several of the teacher’s pension checks after her death.</p><p>That wasn’t all. According to the release, Mr. Mateo stole the teacher’s personal information from a form sent to her by the Teachers’ Retirement System of the City of New York. He used the forms to get money from an annuity and tried to change direct deposit information so that future payouts would go into his own bank account, prosecutors said.</p><p>Mr. Mateo went as far as to call the city’s retirement system and pretend to be the 91-year-old woman, asking to change the phone number in her membership files, the release said. He failed in his first attempt and tried impersonating her on a call a second time, altering his voice to mimic hers, it added.</p><p>Mr. Mateo, from Yonkers, N.Y., worked as a doorman at the building at 380 Riverside Drive for about five years, and tenants and co-workers saw him as someone who was beloved there.</p><p>People coming and going through the softly lit marble lobby of the building on Wednesday expressed surprise at the accusations. Marsha Hurst, a resident for decades, said doormen in New York City get to know tenants well, learning about their families and what is important in their lives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Tenants rarely get to know doormen in the same way, but the community at this building was different, she added. Residents trusted the doormen to guard personal information with the utmost confidentiality, she said.</p><p>“We all felt that way about Alfredo,” she said. “He never seemed to step over that line.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Oct. 2, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a building resident.
