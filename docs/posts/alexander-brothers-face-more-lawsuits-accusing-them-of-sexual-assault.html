The latest lawsuits, filed in a bundle in New York on Tuesday, include accusations of assault in Miami, Manhattan and even Moscow.</p><p>The women’s claims are now part of a growing maze of sexual assault allegations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/realestate/alexander-brothers-arrested-charged-sexual-assault.html" title="">against the brothers who were arrested</a> in December in Miami Beach on federal sex-trafficking charges. Currently jailed in New York, they are scheduled to go to trial early next year.</p><p>All three men have pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Lawyers for the brothers did not immediately respond to requests to comment on Tuesday’s legal filings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The lawsuits and criminal charges have shaken the luxury real estate industry that once crowned Tal Alexander, 38, and Oren Alexander, 37, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/realestate/tal-oren-alexander-sexual-assault.html" title="">among the country’s most prominent real estate agents</a>. The lines between their work and social lives were often blurred, as they branded their jet-setting lifestyles to sell themselves as brokers. Alongside them on the social circuit was Alon Alexander, 37, who ran the family’s security business and did not work in real estate.</p><p>Their legal troubles began in the fall of 2023 when two women began initiating lawsuits against the twins. The Real Deal, a real estate trade publication, <a href="https://therealdeal.com/national/2024/06/08/lawsuits-accuse-top-broker-oren-alexander-twin-brother-alon-of-rape/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported</a> on those suits in June, and Oren and Tal quickly tumbled from their perch and became pariahs.</p><p>A flurry of additional accusations followed and, in the last six months, more lawsuits have trickled in against the brothers. In Tuesday’s batch, Tal Alexander and Oren Alexander are named as defendants in four suits each, while in two more, they are named together, with the women claiming that the brothers took turns assaulting her. Alon Alexander is named in another suit.</p><p>Some of the allegations date back as far as 2010; others are more recent. Two claims, one in Miami against Oren Alexander and one in Manhattan against Alon Alexander, are for assaults women say happened in 2018; another in Miami, against Tal Alexander, cites an assault a woman says happened in October 2019.</p><p>All but one of the women, Leah Peters, have filed as Jane Does. In seven of the 11 suits, women say they were handed something to drink before they were assaulted, and believe they were drugged.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Peters said that she met Oren Alexander at a party at a luxury home in Miami in 2018, and that he offered to give her a tour of the property. He led her to one of the bedrooms, then aggressively threw her onto the bed and forcibly sexually assaulted her, she says in her lawsuit.</p><p>In another complaint, one of the Jane Does says that she met Tal Alexander at a nightclub in the Manhattan neighborhood of Soho in November 2014. After two days of texting, he invited her on a date, and asked her to meet him at his apartment for a drink before heading out to an event. But within minutes of arriving, the lawsuit says, he pushed her into the bedroom, removed her clothes and forcibly assaulted her. He then stood up, pointed to a tuxedo hanging near his bathroom and told the woman she could “see herself out” because he had an event to attend, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Another Jane Doe said in her lawsuit that she had a drink at a bar with Oren Alexander and then began to feel disoriented and dizzy. Mr. Alexander then brought her to his apartment, where there was another man present, as well as a girl who seemed to be about 15 years old. The girl was topless, according to the lawsuit, and the second man was watching her. Mr. Alexander led the woman to his bedroom, where she said he then assaulted her.</p><p>All of the lawsuits are being filed in New York City under a two-year window that closes on Feb. 28. It was created as an extension of the New York City Gender-Motivated Violence Act, which allows survivors of gender-based violence like sexual assault to file older claims that would otherwise have been tossed under the statute of limitations.</p><p>“These men were predators roaming the street, bringing women back to their apartments and treating them in the worst way imaginable,” said Andrew Van Arsdale, the founder of San Diego’s AVA Law Group, which along with New York’s Curis Law is representing all 11 women. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“These women’s lives were forever changed because of their actions,” Mr. Van Arsdale said, “and under the law they have a right to hold them accountable.”</p><p>AVA Law Group is also representing more than 50 men and women who have filed sexual assault claims against the hip-hop mogul Sean Combs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/diddy-sean-combs-lawsuit-allegations.html" title="">who is facing federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges</a>. Along with Curis Law and co-counsel The Buzbee Law Firm, they are representing 30 more.</p><p>The Alexander brothers and Mr. Combs are all being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.</p><p>Olivia Bensimon<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Debra Kamin reports on real estate, covering what it means to buy, sell and own a home in America today.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/debra-kamin">More about Debra Kamin</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
