Flights scheduled this Wednesday, for example, surpass the new limits during seven hours of the day.</p><p>Despite all the issues, officials have sought to assure the public that the airport is safe.</p><p>But it is unclear whether the airport will be able to mitigate all of the problems stressing its operational capacity before the flight caps are lifted.</p><p>By the F.A.A.’s own estimation, there are currently only 24 air traffic controllers tasked with overseeing Newark — far less than the estimated 38 controllers the F.A.A. believes are needed for the airport to run smoothly. There are also 26 trainees at the facility that hosts the Newark air traffic controllers, the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control, according to the F.A.A., but it was unclear how many are focused specifically on Newark.</p><p>The shortfall is emblematic of a nationwide staffing shortage among air traffic controllers, many of whom are being forced to work overtime in high-stress jobs as the government scrambles to train people to fill vacancies across the country. This month, the transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, announced a series of new incentives to recruit and retain air traffic controllers, to buttress other efforts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Yet in Newark, some recent near misses have exacerbated an already significant staffing crisis.</p><p>Last month, the Newark air traffic controllers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/nyregion/newark-airport-delays-disruptions-issues.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">briefly lost</a> radio and radar contact with planes, meaning they could not see, hear or speak to the pilots. The episode caused a raft of delays, and prompted several air traffic controllers to take leaves of absences, which they are entitled to under law after experiencing a traumatic event.</p><p>Those departures lead to even more delays and cancellations. During one evening last week, on some shifts, as few as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/newark-airport-delays-staffing-shortage.html" title="">three of the recommended 14</a> air traffic controllers were on duty for Newark.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>May 20, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article United statement misstated when the airline had proactively reduced flights in response to the problems at Newark. United made those cuts in May.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Karoun Demirjian is a breaking news reporter for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Niraj Chokshi writes about aviation, rail and other transportation industries.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
