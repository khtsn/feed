Consumers, stung by high inflation for two years and navigating a slowing job market, are still spending at a decent clip — but on store-brand soda, not new refrigerators. That puts Walmart, the company that made low prices a mantra, in a good position.</p><p>The company said on Thursday that sales at U.S. Walmart stores rose just over 4 percent, to $115.3 billion, beating analysts’ estimates. Its U.S. e-commerce business jumped 22 percent.</p><p>Many see Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States, as a gauge for how American consumers are faring. Ninety percent of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store.</p><p>Another snapshot on the state of the consumer came on Thursday, with data on nationwide retail sales from the Commerce Department. Sales in July were stronger than economists expected, rising 1 percent from the previous month. That increase outpaced inflation over that period, reinforcing the notion that consumers remain resilient, if more selective about what they are buying.</p></div></div><div><div><p>At Walmart, transactions during the quarter were up 3.6 percent, while the average amount spent per visit showed a slight increase, of 0.6 percent. That combination has been relatively rare for retailers recently: Many have seen cost-conscious shoppers visit less or spend less per trip, or both. </p><p>Notably, the company raised its full-year forecast for sales and profits, a signal of its optimism about attracting more shoppers. It said it gained market share with consumers across income brackets, with the richest households once again “primarily” driving those gains.</p><p>Walmart has said that, while it still emphasizes low prices on its sprawling range of products, the company also has been investing in technology to upgrade its supply chain and e-commerce capabilities with the goal of making it easier and quicker to shop with the company.</p><p><em>“</em>They want value,” Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, said Thursday on a call with analysts. “They want a broad assortment of items and services. They want a convenient and enjoyable experience buying them.”</p><p>Sales throughout the quarter were “fairly consistent,” Mr. McMillon said. “So far we aren’t experiencing a weaker consumer overall,” he added.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Walmart’s stock rose sharply in premarket trading. The company’s share price has risen about 30 percent this year, roughly double the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>Other recent economic statistics suggest that consumers might be feeling some relief from price increases. On Wednesday, data showed that consumer price inflation had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/cpi-inflation-july.html" title="">cooled</a> in July: Overall inflation was 2.9 percent on a yearly basis, the first reading below 3 percent since 2021.</p><p>Executives at major retailers have said they are still watching the effect that inflation and high interest rates may be having on shoppers.</p><p>Higher rates have weighed on the housing market in particular, as homeowners with cheap mortgages have been reluctant to move and aspiring homeowners have been put off by high property prices. And people appear to be putting off big home-improvement projects, perhaps as they wait for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/cpi-inflation-july.html" title="">an expected cut in interest rates</a> by the Federal Reserve next month. Home Depot saw a nearly 6 percent drop in sales of items that cost more than $1,000 or require financing, it reported this week.</p><p>“I think people just took a pause as we’ve progressed through the quarter,” Ted Decker, Home Depot’s chief executive, said on a call Tuesday with analysts, citing “macro uncertainties” as a factor.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Companies have found that consumers remain cautious when it comes to everyday purchases, too.</p><p>Executives at PepsiCo, which raised prices by double-digit percentages in 2022 and 2023, recently said that they planned to lower prices and offer more promotions on salty snacks and some other products.</p><p>Executives at Kellanova, the maker of Cheez-It crackers and Pringles, said that consumers who earn $100,000 or less and have children were especially price sensitive when shopping at the grocery store. Kellanova, which announced this week that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/dealbook/mars-kellanova-deal-pringles-cheezit.html" title="">agreed to be acquired by the M&amp;M’s maker Mars</a>, has increased its promotional activity in hopes of luring more shoppers to name-brand products.</p><p>Amazon this month reported an increase in sales in North America, but said that growth rate was slowing. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, said consumers were gravitating toward lower-cost products and those that arrive quickly. </p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris, in a speech where she will layout her economic agenda on Friday, plans to call for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/kamala-harris-price-gouging-inflation.html" title="">a federal ban on corporate price gouging</a> on groceries, according to campaign officials. It’s an effort to blame big companies for the rising cost of consumer staples, which has been a drag on the Biden administration’s approval ratings and a key point of attack by Republicans ahead of the November election.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jordyn Holman is a business reporter for The Times, covering the retail industry and consumer behavior.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jordyn-holman">More about Jordyn Holman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
