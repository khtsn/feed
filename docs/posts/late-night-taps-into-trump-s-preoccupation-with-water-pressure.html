I think the problem is Trump wears so much bronzer, he made himself waterproof.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Why does Donald Trump even need a shower? You’d think the three-hour tongue bath he gets every morning from ‘Fox &amp; Friends’ would be sufficient.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-760422e2">The Punchiest Punchlines (Another Perfect Physical Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“Tomorrow, the president is scheduled to get his annual physical.
