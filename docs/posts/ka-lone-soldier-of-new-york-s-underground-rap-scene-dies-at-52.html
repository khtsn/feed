He was 52.</p><p>His death was announced by his wife, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBHcG7USWnw/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mimi Valdés</a>, on Instagram, as well as in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBHcGIlv0WE/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> posted on his Instagram page. No cause was given, though the statement said that he had “died unexpectedly.”</p><p>First with the mid-1990s underground group Natural Elements, and then on 11 solo albums he produced himself and released over nearly two decades, Ka gripped hard-core hip-hop listeners with gloomy beats and vivid descriptions of street life and struggle.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/arts/music/new-releases-from-ka-popcaan-vena-and-bleeding-knees-club.html" title="">a 2012 review of his second album</a> “Grief Pedigree”, The New York Times pop music critic Jon Caramanica described Ka as “a striking rapper largely for what he forgoes: flash, filigree, any sense that the hard work is already done.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Kaseem Ryan was born in 1972 and raised in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York. During his teen years, he dealt crack and sold firearms.</p><p>He spent much of the 1990s trying to make a name for himself as a rapper, but then quit music altogether, only to come back a decade later.</p><p>In 2007, at the age of 35, he released his solo debut album, “Iron Works.” Initially, he had 1,000 copies of the album made and used a guerrilla approach to promote it.</p><p>“I gave them to my cousins, my friends. I still had, like, 990 CDs left. So I started giving them away,” he said in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/09/magazine/25-songs-that-tell-us-where-music-is-going.html#/ka-mourn-at-night" title="">2017 interview with The Times.</a> “I’d drive around the city, and if I heard music coming from the next car at a red light — boom-boom-boom — I’d say, ‘You like hip-hop?’”</p><p>By the time he released his second album, “Grief Pedigree,” in 2012, he had cultivated a small but passionate enough fan base to announce the release on social media and hold a curbside sale in Greenwich Village.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That led to a tradition of album releases: Ka would announce a new album on social media and set up on a street corner to sell a few dozen hard copies from the trunk of his vehicle.</p><p>In 2017, a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/09/magazine/25-songs-that-tell-us-where-music-is-going.html#/intro" title="">round up of 25 influential songs</a> said that Ka would sit in the study of his Brooklyn home, pack up orders for his CDs and mail them to his fans.</p><p>When he wasn’t making music, he was a captain in the New York Fire Department.</p><p>“I try to keep my job and music separate,” he said in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/09/magazine/25-songs-that-tell-us-where-music-is-going.html#/ka-mourn-at-night" title="">2017 Times interview.</a> “I never wanted be ‘The Rapping Captain.’ I try to be a good firefighter. And when I come home, I try to make some dope music.”</p><p>In some of his songs, Ka invoked the violent lifestyle of drug dealing in the 1990s, and he bemoaned police brutality. In a 2016 article, he was criticized by members of the New York Police Department for what they felt were anti-police lyrics.</p><p>The statement on Instagram about his death said he was a 20-year veteran of the Fire Department and responded to the 2001 World Trade Center terrorist attack.</p><p>In addition to his wife, he is survived by his mother and sister, according to the statement on Ka’s Instagram page. The survivors’ names were not given.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ka’s most recent album, “The Thief Next to Jesus,” explores Christian themes and was released this year.</p><p>In a review of the album, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ka-the-thief-next-to-jesus/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pitchfork wrote</a>: “Using understated, purposeful phrases and fragments, Ka draws you in, forcing you to hang onto each word. His delivery is patient and measured, with a steely intensity that’s unshakable, as if he’s never been more assured in his path forward.”</p><p>Sheelagh McNeill<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
