He’s just blown his credibility as a military leader.</p><p>On Monday, The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg published <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?gift=kPTlqn0J1iP9IBZcsdI5IVJpB2t9BYyxpzU4sooa69M&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the most extraordinary stories I’ve ever read</a>. Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, apparently inadvertently invited Goldberg to join a Signal group chat (Signal is an encrypted messaging app) that seemed to include several senior Trump officials, including Stephen Miller, JD Vance, Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth.</p><p>A National Security Council spokesman told The Atlantic that the chat “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?gift=kPTlqn0J1iP9IBZcsdI5IVJpB2t9BYyxpzU4sooa69M&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appears to be authentic</a>.”</p><p>No one apparently noticed Goldberg’s presence, and he had a front-row seat as they debated Trump’s decision to attack the Houthi rebels, an Iran-backed militia that had been firing on civilian shipping in the Red Sea.</p><p>Then, at 11:44 a.m. on March 15, the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” sent a message that contained “operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying and attack sequencing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This would be a stunning breach of security. I’m a former Army JAG officer (an Army lawyer). I’ve helped investigate numerous alleged spillages of classified information, and I’ve never even heard of anything this egregious — a secretary of defense intentionally using a civilian messaging app to share sensitive war plans, without even apparently noticing a journalist was in the chat.</p><p>There is not an officer alive whose career would survive a security breach like that. It would normally result in instant consequences (relief from command, for example) followed by a comprehensive investigation and potential criminal charges.</p><p>Federal law <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">makes it a crime</a> when a person — through gross negligence — removes information “relating to the national defense” from “its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted or destroyed.”</p><p>It’s way too soon to say whether Hegseth’s incompetence is also criminal, but I raise the possibility to demonstrate the sheer magnitude of Hegseth’s reported mistake. A security breach that significant requires a thorough investigation.</p><p>Nothing destroys a leader’s credibility with soldiers more thoroughly than hypocrisy or double standards. When leaders break the rules that they impose on soldiers, they break the bond of trust between soldiers and commanders. The best commanders I knew did not ask a soldier to comply with a rule that didn’t also apply to him. The best commanders led by example.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>What example has Hegseth set? That he’s careless, and when you’re careless in the military, people can die. If he had any honor at all, he would resign.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
