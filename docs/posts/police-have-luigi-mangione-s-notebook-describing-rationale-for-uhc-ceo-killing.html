You wack the C.E.O. at the annual parasitic bean-counter convention. It’s targeted, precise, and doesn’t risk innocents,” was one passage written in the notebook, the officials said.</p><p>The shooting of the executive, Brian Thompson, occurred early Dec. 4 as Mr. Thompson arrived at a Hilton hotel on West 54th Street to prepare for the UnitedHealthcare investors’ meeting. His assailant escaped on a bicycle and then disappeared.</p><p>Police officials in New York were able to match Mr. Mangione’s fingerprints to those on a water bottle and a Kind snack bar wrapper recovered near the crime scene, Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a news conference on Wednesday. His fingerprints also matched those found on ballistic evidence at the scene, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Commissioner Tisch said the New York police now have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/uhc-killing-ghost-gun-3d-printing.html" title="">the unregistered gun that was found on Mr. Mangione</a> when he was arrested in Altoona, Pa., on Monday. The police brought it to the department’s crime lab, where they matched it to the three shell casings that were found at the crime scene, she said.</p><p>Mr. Mangione, 26, was captured Monday after a tip from an employee at a McDonald’s in Altoona, who was alerted by a customer who recognized him.</p><p>Mr. Mangione, who faces a murder charge and has been denied bail, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/10/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-luigi-mangione" title="">fighting extradition to New York</a>, which starts a process that could take weeks. “He is contesting it,” his lawyer, Thomas Dickey, said on Tuesday. Mr. Dickey did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.</p><p>When Mr. Mangione was arrested, he had the ghost gun, a suppressor and false identification cards similar to those believed to have been used by the killer, officials said. He also had identification bearing his real name.</p><p>The authorities also found a 262-word handwritten note with him, which begins by appearing to take responsibility for the murder. The note, which officials described as a manifesto, also mentioned the existence of a notebook. The recovery of the notebook was first reported by CNN.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The suspect saw the killing as a “symbolic takedown,” according to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/luigi-mangione-manifesto.html" title="">New York Police Department internal report</a> that detailed parts of the three-page document. He “likely views himself as a hero of sorts who has finally decided to act upon such injustices,” the report said.</p><p>On his way into court on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Mangione shouted about “an insult to the intelligence of the American people and their lived experience.” It was not clear what he was referring to as deputies worked to push him into the courthouse. On Wednesday, the sheriff of Blair County, James E. Ott, said that otherwise Mr. Mangione had not given deputies any problems.</p><p>Mr. Mangione, part of a sprawling and prominent Baltimore family, went to an elite high school in the city and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. He had worked at several tech companies and had a long interest in developing computer games.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/10/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-luigi-mangione#luigi-mangione-health-issues-reddit" title="">In years of posts on a Reddit account</a>, he described a series of life-altering health problems. He said he had back pain that worsened until a surgery in 2023 and that he had struggled with “brain fog.” But his only reference to insurance coverage in the posts noted that Blue Cross Blue Shield had covered testing for irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p>Mr. Mangione stopped communicating with friends and family about six months ago. His mother filed a missing-person report last month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ben Brafman, a prominent defense lawyer in New York whose clients have included Sean Combs, Harvey Weinstein and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said Wednesday that the police had amassed an “overwhelming” amount of evidence that left little room for Mr. Mangione to mount a viable defense at trial.</p><p>“This was a rather brazen act of violence,” Mr. Brafman said. “Given that there doesn’t seem to be an inch of Manhattan that isn’t covered in video recording devices, it’s hard to explain away what happened.”</p><p>Still, he said, that did not mean that prosecutors’ jobs would be easy. They will have a hard time finding jurors who do not feel they have been treated unfairly by the health care industry.</p><p>“I think most people when questioned about that issue will say, ‘Yeah, I dealt with a health care industry that I was unhappy with,’” he said. “But they didn’t go out and execute the head of an insurance company.”</p><p>Police officials in New York City, already concerned that the shooting might inspire other violence, have noted that numerous mock “Wanted” posters with images of high-profile corporate executives had been posted along Manhattan sidewalks. A video on social media showed three fliers with images of top executives; one of the fliers featured Mr. Thompson’s face with an X over it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Police Department included some of the images in its internal report, which warned that people on social media were celebrating the shooting and encouraging more killings of executives. The report mentioned “an elevated threat facing executives in the near term” and said there was “a risk that a wide range of extremists may view Mangione as a martyr and an example to follow.”</p><p>Just hours after Mr. Mangione was arrested on Monday at the McDonald’s in Altoona, a young woman was standing outside the fast food restaurant holding a sign that said “Corrupt insurance C.E.O.s have got to go.”</p><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- -->, <!-- -->Mark Bonamo<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jeffery C.
