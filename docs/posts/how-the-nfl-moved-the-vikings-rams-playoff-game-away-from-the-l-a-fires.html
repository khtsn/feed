That included painting the field with the team’s and league’s logos and colors. The hometown Cardinals, though, did not have some of the needed hues on hand, including the Rams’ blue and yellow.</p><p>Giachelli’s company, World Class Athletic Surfaces in tiny Leland, Miss., provides paint to most N.F.L. and top college teams. Within hours, he and his co-workers had loaded five-gallon buckets of nine custom paint colors, as well as stencils for the N.F.L. playoff logos, onto a truck that left Thursday afternoon on a 1,500-mile journey to Arizona.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I definitely regret what’s going on in California, but I’m glad we could meet their needs,” said Giachelli, the vice president of production and distribution.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Buckets of paint being unloaded at State Farm Stadium, where the dominant color is normally red.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">World Class Paints</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Getting the right paint was just one of hundreds of details that the league, the Rams, the Vikings, the host Arizona Cardinals and ASM Global, which operates State Farm Stadium, had to juggle after the N.F.L. decided to move the wild-card round game.</p><p>The N.F.L. has canceled preseason games and postponed and moved regular-season games over the years because of hurricanes, snowstorms and other calamities. But it had not moved a winner-take-all playoff showdown since 1936, when the site of its championship game was changed from Boston to New York to drum up ticket sales.</p><p>A battalion of people — from the front-office workers to the training staffs to the thousands of game-day workers — were mobilized on short notice. Each game, particularly in the playoffs, generates tens of millions of dollars for television networks, advertisers and stadium operators, and with the season coming down to its last few weeks, there was little margin for error.</p><p>“We’ve got to have a contingency for everything,” Michael Bidwill, the owner of the Cardinals, said in an interview. “There’s a huge ripple effect” if games aren’t played.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Cardinals helped out the Rams beyond just lending their stadium. Bidwill sent two team planes to Los Angeles to help the Rams get their 300-person entourage and equipment to Arizona. Babysitters, doctors and even an ice cream shop were identified for the players’ families.</p><p>Tickets had to be sold. Starting Friday morning, Rams season-ticket holders were given the first chance to buy seats, followed one hour later by Cardinals ticket holders. (Those who had tickets for the game at SoFi Stadium could get a refund or have the tickets applied as a credit toward their 2025 season tickets. Tickets for Glendale had to be bought separately.)</p><p>After two hours, 52,000 seats were sold. The general public then scooped up the remaining tickets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>State Farm Stadium has been a backup home for other N.F.L. teams, including the San Francisco 49ers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ross D. Franklin/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Kathy and Kevin Page, a couple who live in Lake Elsinore, east of Los Angeles, bought their seats in the first wave, paying upward of $500 for two seats in the stadium’s lower bowl, plus parking passes. They met up with friends they tailgate with at Rams home games.</p><p>Called Melon Heads because they wear carved-out watermelons at games, the Pages were glad the game could still be played.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Having the game here gives people a reprieve from what’s going on,” Kevin Page said. “With all the reports coming out about the fires, this gives us a chance to reboot ourselves.”</p><p>Page and his friends hung a banner on their tent that read, “Thank you Arizona Cardinals.”</p><p>Manuel Moreno, who goes by the nickname “Suspect, the Masked Ram,” rode on one of the several dozen buses that ferried hundreds of Rams fans from SoFi Stadium to Glendale. “We appreciate the hospitality,” he said. “It’s a stress relief from the 24-hour news about the fires.”</p><p>A big reason the N.F.L. is the world’s most valuable league is scarcity. There are just 272 regular-season games and 13 playoff games, so each one is of critical importance to the 32 teams. (By contrast, there are about 400 Major League Baseball games every month during the season.) They are also critical to the owners of those teams and the league, as well as broadcast networks, sponsors and other companies that spend billions of dollars a year to attach their businesses and brands to the N.F.L.</p><p>It has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/share/_1PLTHNYy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not escaped notice</a> that one of those businesses, State Farm, had its name attached to Monday night’s broadcast less than a year after it announced that <a href="https://newsroom.statefarm.com/update-on-california/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it would not renew 30,000 homeowner policies</a> and 42,000 policies for commercial apartments in California. (The N.F.L. has donated $5 million to Los Angeles relief efforts.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>It took a long drive — 1,500 miles — to get to this end zone. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ash Ponders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>With so much riding on each contest, the N.F.L. does everything it can to play every game every year. When the league creates its season schedule each spring, it prepares contingency plans including an alternate site for each game. In 2022, when a massive snowstorm hit western New York, the Buffalo Bills played a home game at Ford Field in Detroit.</p><p>During the pandemic, outbreaks in locker rooms forced the league to postpone several games, though none were canceled. When pandemic conditions in Santa Clara County, Calif., deteriorated, the San Francisco 49ers moved to Arizona for a month, playing three home games in State Farm Stadium. Arizona was also a backstop in 2003 when the Chargers moved their home game against the Miami Dolphins because of fires in San Diego.</p><p>This time, the fires spread so quickly, the league decided to move the game five days before kickoff. Kevin Demoff, the president of the Rams, said the team had been in constant contact with officials in Los Angeles, who initially thought the game could be held at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, which was unaffected by the fires.</p><p>But that changed midweek, when fires broke out close to the team’s training facility in Woodland Hills, forcing some players and staff to evacuate their homes and for one practice to be cut short. Demoff said he did not want the players and staff to be distracted, nor did he want city and county resources to be diverted for the game when they could be used to help others in need.</p><p>Moving the game was “just a recognition that there’s some things bigger than football and we owe this to our community to make sure that this game can be played safely and not be a distraction,” Demoff said Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>ESPN was on hold as well. Four of its production trucks were en route to Los Angeles from Pittsburgh when the league told the network on Wednesday night that the game could be moved to Glendale. The crews spent the night in Kingman, Ariz. On Thursday, the plan was to set up in both stadiums in case the league waited until Saturday to decide where to play. So the trucks continued on to Los Angeles while another set of trucks left for Glendale. When the N.F.L. said Thursday that the game had been moved, the first set of trucks, which had reached Ontario, Calif., turned around and arrived in Glendale with time to spare.</p><p>“If it can be played, they play it, and in this case, it can be played in Glendale,” said Joe Buck, who called the game for ESPN. “We’re in the playoffs now, and you’ve got all this pressure to get this first round finished before Kansas City and Detroit,” which had first-round byes, “get back in.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ken Belson is a Times reporter covering sports, power and money at the N.F.L. and other professional sports leagues.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ken-belson">More about Ken Belson</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
