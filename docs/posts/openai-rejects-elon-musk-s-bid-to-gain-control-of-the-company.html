With the bid, Mr. Musk was meddling in a plan that Mr. Altman has made to change OpenAI’s corporate structure by shifting control of the company from the nonprofit to OpenAI’s investors, including Microsoft.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Musk and Mr. Altman have been at odds for years. Mr. Musk helped create OpenAI as a nonprofit in 2015, along with Mr. Altman and others. In 2018, Mr. Musk left the organization after a battle for control of the company. Mr. Altman then attached OpenAI to a for-profit company so he could raise the billions of dollars needed to build A.I. technologies.</p><p>The nonprofit retained control of the company. Last year, Mr. Altman and his colleagues began working on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/technology/openai-public-benefit-corporation.html" title="">a plan to shift control of the company</a> from the nonprofit to OpenAI’s investors. Mr. Musk’s $97.4 bid could complicate that plan.</p><p>(The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. OpenAI and Microsoft have denied those claims.)</p><p>This is a developing story.
