Asked whether he was ready to respond with countertariffs, Mr. Trudeau said Canada “will stand up strongly and firmly if we need to.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>European countries also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/business/trump-tariffs-steel-european-union.html" title="">warned of retaliation</a> in response to Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, called the levies “unjustified.’’</p><p>Leaders in Mexico said the tariffs were “unjustifiable” and risked undermining the economic integration of the North American market that was forged over the past two generations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s secretary of the economy, said he planned to appeal to President Trump’s common sense to try to fend off the tariffs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Raquel Cunha/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Noting that the United States has a trade surplus with Mexico in steel and aluminum, Marcelo Ebrard, the country’s secretary of the economy, said he planned to appeal to Mr. Trump’s common sense to try to fend off the tariffs.</p><p>“We take his word for it — common sense — not shooting ourselves in the foot, not destroying what we have built in 40 years,” Mr. Ebrard told reporters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s announcement of the tariffs on Monday took leaders in Canada and Mexico, the United States’ biggest trading partners, especially by surprise. Last month, the president threatened 25 percent tariffs on all imports from both nations, prompting them to warn of retaliation.</p><p>But a trade war was averted at the last minute when Mr. Trump and the leaders of both countries reached separate deals that yielded a 30-day postponement of the tariffs last week. Both agreements involve beefing up security at the borders the United States shares with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>The sudden imposition of tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum weeks before the end of the reprieve left political and business leaders in the country feeling whipsawed. Canada’s economy is much smaller than the United States’ and would suffer significantly from the tariffs. It now faces a repeat of the down-to-the-wire negotiations that have dominated news coverage in recent weeks.</p><p>The tariffs are likely to deepen Canada’s mistrust of the Trump administration, heighten feelings of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/world/canada/us-canada-relations-trump-tariffs.html" title="">betrayal</a> among Canadians and further fuel discussions about the need to strengthen ties to countries other than the United States.</p><p>Mr. Trump revealed that he was prepared to impose 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States on Sunday while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the Super Bowl.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Canada was the biggest supplier of steel to the United States last year, followed by Brazil and Mexico. It is also a major supplier of aluminum to the United States.</p><p>Canada’s steel industry, which employs <a href="https://canadiansteel.ca/skills-jobs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">23,000 people</a>, exports almost all of its products to the United States. There is little demand for Canadian steel in other markets, which are increasingly dominated by China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Canada is more competitive globally in the aluminum sector than it is in steel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bernard Brault/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The aluminum sector, which employs <a href="https://aluminium.ca/en/the-industry/#:~:text=The%20industry%20supports%20over%209,000,of%20over%20C$12%20billion." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">9,000 people</a> in Canada, is more competitive globally, though the United States is its major buyer.</p><p>During his first term, Mr. Trump levied tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all over the world, angering Canada, Mexico and other allies. He eventually exempted major steel-producing countries like Brazil, South Korea and Australia in exchange for quotas limiting their exports to the United States. He removed the barriers on steel and aluminum for Canada and Mexico with the signing of a revised trade agreement among the three countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>This time, Mr. Trump has laced tariff threats against Canada with talk of annexing the country and turning it into the 51st state. While the government of Prime Minister Trudeau initially dismissed Mr. Trump’s comment as a joke, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/world/canada/trump-canada-trudeau.html" title="">told</a> business leaders on Friday that he regarded the threat as real.</p><p>Mr. Trump, in an interview with Fox News on Sunday, said that he was serious about annexing Canada.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Trudeau pushed back against Mr. Trump.</p><p>“This is a moment of pride,” Mr. Trudeau said, speaking in Paris where he was attending a conference on artificial intelligence. “This is a moment of pulling together. This is a moment for Canada to be solid in our identity.”</p><p>Mexico was the third largest supplier of steel to the United States in 2024, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.</p><p>A spokesman for the Mexican steel trade association, Canacero, said it would wait to assess the impact on the industry, which is concentrated in northern Mexico and supplies steel for everything from cars to washing machines to construction materials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>When Mr. Trump imposed tariffs in his first term — 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum — Mexico retaliated with countertariffs on key American products, including pork, apples, cheese, cranberries, bourbon whiskey and Harley Davidson motorcycles, according to Valeria Moy, the general director of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness.</p><p>The tariffs were lifted about a year later with the signing of the revised free trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said he hoped to avert the imposition of the tariffs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>While the short-lived tariffs on steel and aluminum did not lead to significant gains for American manufacturers, Ms. Moy said that it was not surprising that Mr. Trump was considering turning to them again.</p><p>“It represents a win that’s easy for Trump to communicate,” Ms. Moy said. “It benefits — in the short term — an industry that’s become emblematic in the United States.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Brazil exported $4.5 billion worth of steel to the United States last year. The United States was by far the largest international market for Brazilian steel, but that represented only about 11 percent of Brazil’s steel sales, most of which are domestic.</p><p>The last time Mr. Trump implemented tariffs against steel imports, he largely exempted Brazil. Experts believed at the time that because the United States had a trade surplus with Brazil, Mr. Trump did not see it necessary to target the country with tariffs, said Carla Beni, an economist who tracks international trade at the Fundação Getulio Vargas, a university in Brazil.</p><p>Tariffs on Brazilian steel could backfire on the United States, Ms. Beni said. Brazil imports more than $1 billion a year in coal from the United States — much of it to make steel — so harming the Brazilian steel industry could hit the American coal industry, she said.</p><p>“This could be very interesting for Brazil at the negotiating table,” she said. “Because if I produce less steel, I’m going to need less coal.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Nicas is the Brazil bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of much of South America.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-nicas">More about Jack Nicas</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
