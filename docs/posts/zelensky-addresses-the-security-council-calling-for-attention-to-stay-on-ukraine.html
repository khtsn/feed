    <h1>Zelensky Addresses the Security Council, Calling for Attention to Stay on Ukraine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the bitter winter approaching, only half of the U.N.’s response plan was funded, Mr. Guterres pointed out.</p><p>“The longer this tragic war continues, the greater the risk of escalation and spillover,” he said.</p><p>Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, said the Security Council must act to address North Korea and Iran sending weapons to Russia for its war. He repeated an assertion that he first made during a trip to Britain this month — that in exchange for Iran equipping the Russian military with armed drones and short-range ballistic missiles, Russia was “sharing technology with Iran on nuclear issues, as well as space information.”</p><p>Mr. Blinken did not give more details. Russia was one of several powerful nations that joined an agreement led by President Barack Obama to place limits on Iran’s nuclear program.</p><p>Mr. Blinken said the Security Council must also help Ukraine reach “a just and lasting peace.” That means any diplomatic settlement must allow Ukraine to retain its full sovereignty and territorial integrity, despite the intent of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to occupy and annex large parts of eastern Ukraine, in addition to Crimea.</p><p>The Security Council has been deadlocked over the war in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion. Russia, a permanent member of the Council with veto power, has blocked resolutions calling for an immediate withdrawal of its troops.</p></div></div>
