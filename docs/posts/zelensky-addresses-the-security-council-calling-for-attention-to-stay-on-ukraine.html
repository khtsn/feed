    <h1>Zelensky Addresses the Security Council, Calling for Attention to Stay on Ukraine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>He said he had put together a new victory plan based on the principles and values of the U.N. charter, but did not elaborate on its details other than to say that he was organizing a peace conference. He added that he would invite all countries to the conference, including China, Russia’s most powerful partner, and India, which has said it is a neutral player in the war but is helping to sustain Russia’s economy with large oil purchases.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky was speaking ahead of meetings this week, during which he plans to present his “victory plan” to President Biden and other U.S. officials. So far, he has withheld details of the plan from the public. Mr. Zelensky has also called for the United States and other allies to permit Ukraine to use long-range missiles provided by the West to strike deep into Russia.</p><p>Secretary General António Guterres briefed the Council, telling diplomats that it was past time to end the war in Ukraine, which has led to catastrophic civilian suffering and spillover consequences, such as a rise in grain and energy prices and the displacement of millions. He also laid out the U.N.’s role in providing lifesaving humanitarian aid to some 6.2 million people in Ukraine this year, and he appealed to donors for more funding.</p><p>With the bitter winter approaching, only half of the U.N.’s response plan was funded, Mr. Guterres pointed out.</p><p>“The longer this tragic war continues, the greater the risk of escalation and spillover,” he said.</p><p>Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, said the Security Council must act to address North Korea and Iran sending weapons to Russia for its war. He repeated an assertion that he first made during a trip to Britain this month — that in exchange for Iran equipping the Russian military with armed drones and short-range ballistic missiles, Russia was “sharing technology with Iran on nuclear issues, as well as space information.”</p></div></div>
