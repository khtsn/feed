Short-term exposure can lead to bronchitis, worsen asthma and create other health issues.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Several air quality warnings were also in effect in Western Canada for areas around the fires in that part of the country, with smoke billowing toward northwest Ontario.</p><p>The smoke from the Canadian wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/weather/canada-wildfires-smoke-us-air-quality.html" title="">moved south and passed over the Midwest</a> on Tuesday. Air quality alerts remained in effect on Wednesday morning across Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio.</p><p>Marc Chenard, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center, said that satellite imagery shows a broad swath of smoke still covering the eastern United States on Wednesday. The smoke stretches from northern Georgia to New England and into parts of the Upper Midwest.</p><p>“A lot of it is aloft, but there’s still some getting down to the surface,” Mr. Chenard said.</p><p>Air quality readings in cities including Minneapolis, St. Paul and Columbus, Ohio, were at “very unhealthy” levels, between 100 and 140, early Wednesday morning, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/wildfire-smoke-air-quality-maps.html" title="">New York Times air quality tracker</a>. The index’s scale runs from 0 to 500; the higher the number, the more polluted the air.</p><p>Those levels were an improvement from Tuesday when both St. Paul and Minneapolis had registered readings of 226 in the morning. Above 200, the air is considered “very unhealthy,” and risky for everyone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In Iowa, an air quality alert issued by the state’s Department of Natural Resources was expected to remain in effect through Thursday morning, according to the Weather Service. Air pollution was expected to remain at unhealthy levels for sensitive groups, and possibly healthy people too, with residents advised to limit outdoor activities until the air quality improves.</p><p>An air quality alert for much of Minnesota remained <a href="https://www.pca.state.mn.us/news-and-stories/air-quality-alert-due-to-wildfire-smoke-continues-through-wednesday-june-4-for-southern-central" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in effect</a> through noon on Wednesday, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The alert for some areas was <a href="https://x.com/MnPCA/status/1929925544256188811" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected to reach the red category,</a> which signals it can be dangerous for everyone, the agency said.</p><p>As northern states were dealing with smoke, a large <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/weather/saharan-dust-florida-gulf-coast.html" title="">plume of Saharan dust</a> crossed the Atlantic Ocean and was expected to spread over Gulf Coast states through Thursday. Mr. Chenard said the dust had reached parts of Florida by Wednesday morning, and was expected to intensify.</p><p>“The highest concentrations of the dust is definitely going to be through today and tonight,” he said on Wednesday. “But there will be some at least lower concentrations that linger over Florida, probably into the weekend.”</p><p>Although smoke and dust could overlap in some areas of the South, Mr. Chenard said it’s more likely that smoke will clear as the dust arrives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“They’re both being moved by the same wind,” he said. As the dust moves into Florida the smoke is expected to push north out of Florida.</p><p>Vjosa Isai<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nazaneen Ghaffar is a Times reporter on the Weather team.</p></div><div><p>Amy Graff is a Times reporter covering weather, wildfires and earthquakes.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
