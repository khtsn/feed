The fate of the passengers, dozens of whom the militants said they were holding hostage, was not immediately clear.</p><p>The militants, Baloch ethnic fighters, forced the train to stop in the Bolan district of Balochistan Province after opening fire on it, according to railway and police officials. The train was traveling from Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, to Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. It was to pass through several cities, including Lahore and Rawalpindi, near Islamabad.</p><p>Shahid Rind, a spokesman for the Balochistan provincial government, said the authorities were struggling to reach the site of the ambush because of the challenging terrain.</p><p>Rashid Hussain, a trader in Quetta, said his family had left on the train for Rawalpindi in the morning but had become unreachable after 2 p.m. “I am deeply worried,” he said by telephone. “The government is not providing any updates. Neither roads nor trains are safe in this province.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The seizure of the passenger train highlighted the increasing sophistication of a separatist insurgency in Pakistan’s southwest. The attack was the latest in a series of violent episodes in Balochistan, a province bordering Iran and Afghanistan that is the site of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/world/asia/pakistan-china-attacks.html" title="">major Chinese-led projects</a>, including a strategic port.</p><p>A group known as the Baloch Liberation Army, or B.L.A., claimed responsibility for the train hijacking.</p><p>The group said it had taken 182 hostages, including members of various security agencies who were traveling while on leave. “Civilian passengers, particularly women, children, the elderly and Baloch citizens, have been released safely and provided a secure route,” the group said in a Telegram post.</p><p>That account could not be independently verified, and the government has yet to confirm reports of hostages or any casualties.</p><p>Last year, the B.L.A. carried out one of Pakistan’s deadliest terrorist attacks, a suicide bombing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/world/asia/pakistan-suicide-bombing.html" title="">that killed at least 25 people</a>, including security personnel, at Quetta’s busy railway station.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The group also claimed responsibility for a deadly bombing targeting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/asia/pakistan-chinese-workers.html" title="">a convoy carrying Chinese citizens</a> near the international airport in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city. The separatists accuse the Chinese of stealing the province’s resources.</p><p>In recent months, separatist groups have escalated high-profile attacks along Balochistan’s three major highways, directly challenging the state’s authority. Last week, an alliance of the groups, including the B.L.A., announced plans to intensify attacks on Pakistani security forces, infrastructure and Chinese interests in the region.</p><p>“It points to two key trends: the increasing operational capabilities and sophistication of separatist groups and the weakening control of the government in Balochistan,” said Abdul Basit, senior associate fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.</p><p>At the Quetta railway station, families of passengers aboard the train anxiously gathered at the information counter on Tuesday, seeking updates.</p><p>Many people in the region had begun to prefer rail travel after frequent militant ambushes on the highways in which passengers were killed after being taken off buses. Frequent protests have also caused road blockages.</p><p>Train services had resumed only in October after a two-month suspension because of militant attacks on railway tracks.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
