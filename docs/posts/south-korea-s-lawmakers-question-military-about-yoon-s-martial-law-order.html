Park An-su, the Army chief of staff, told a parliamentary hearing on Thursday. “There was confusion.”</p><p>His testimony offered the first opportunity for lawmakers to question the military about the martial law order handed down on Tuesday night by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-president.html" title="">President Yoon Suk Yeol</a>. The decree plunged the country into a political crisis, sparking widespread anger that drove thousands of protesters to the streets. Mr. Yoon was forced to reverse course after just six hours.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>General Park insisted that he had not had any role in the planning: He told lawmakers he had been caught off guard, first learning of it when Mr. Yoon announced the extraordinary move on television. The military’s follow-up announcement, under his name, banned “all political activities” and public rallies and asserted control over media outlets, among other steps. But in his account on Thursday, General Park claimed he had not read it until his signature was requested.</p><p>He described being at a loss over how to proceed as commander, unsure of what steps to take beyond trying to set up a new office.</p><p>“We were military people, some of us the best I know,” General Park said of a meeting with aides after he was made martial law commander. “But we didn’t know much about martial law. Time passed while we wondered, ‘What should we do?’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gen.

But it appeared unlikely to ease any of the anger from protesters — some of whom had lived through the traumatic era of military rule and had been part of the popular uprising that ushered in South Korea’s democracy.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the 1970s and ’80s, the military used martial law to send troops into towns and college campuses to violently suppress anti-government protesters, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/world/asia/south-korea-photos-gwangju-crackdown.html" title="">massacring</a> hundreds. It censored the news media, hauling unfriendly journalists into torture dungeons. Army generals beat up lawmakers.</p><p>South Koreans fought back with stones, firebombs and massive protest rallies. By the 1990s, the generals who had taken power through coups and bloodshed were in prison on charges of mutiny. The military worked to clean up its image, vowing not to meddle in politics.</p><p>Many South Koreans believed them. That’s why footage broadcast on Tuesday night of helicopters dropping elite troops to take over the National Assembly deeply shocked the nation. Emblematic of the rage was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUcC-5ATLg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the scene</a> of a young woman grabbing a paratrooper’s rifle barrel on Tuesday night at the Assembly, yelling: “Shame on you!”</p><p>The woman, An Gwi-ryeong, had rushed to the Assembly after the martial law declaration to find troops trying to force their way into the building to prevent lawmakers inside from voting to repeal the order. Citizens and parliamentary staff were resisting the troops.</p><p>“I thought we had to stop them no matter what,” Ms. An, a spokesman of the main opposition Democratic Party, said in an interview. “I thought if they broke in, we had no future.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. An, 35, grew up in a democratized South Korea: Her knowledge of martial law came from history textbooks and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/world/asia/south-korea-taxi-driver-film-gwangju.html" title="">movies.</a> When some lawmakers in her party suggested that the deeply unpopular Mr. Yoon could deploy martial law to silence his critics, she said she wondered whether he might do it.</p><p>“When it actually happened, it felt not real, this happening in the 21st-century South Korea,” she said. “There is a lot of blame for the military, but the one who is to blame the most is Yoon Suk Yeol, who made his military train its guns at its own citizens.”</p><p>The hearings on Thursday were an attempt to understand how and why that happened. The questioning lasted hours and appeared tense at times, as lawmakers raised their voices in frustration.</p><p>General Park told them he still did not know who had ordered the troops to storm the National Assembly — a striking claim from the man who was ostensibly their commander. When some lawmakers urged him to resign, General Park said he had already offered to do so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The country’s deputy defense minister, Kim Seon-ho, testified that the defense minister, Kim Yong-hyun, had ordered in the troops — a move he said he had opposed.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters have taken to the streets of Seoul since the martial law declaration. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

The notice gave lawmakers a head start to get to the National Assembly and conduct their vote to reject martial law before the military could break in to stop them.</p><p>The military’s failed attempt to take over the Assembly has formed a central piece in the opposition’s argument for why Mr. Yoon should be impeached for “insurgency.”</p><p>Mr. Yoon has not been seen in public or made a public statement since the early hours of Wednesday. He had insisted that martial law was necessary to protect the country from an extremely disruptive “anti-state” opposition that he said paralyzed his government. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The National Assembly is scheduled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/04/world/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-news" title="">vote on Saturday</a> about whether to move forward with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/04/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment-vote-president-yoon.html" title="">impeachment.</a> Opposition lawmakers have a majority in the legislature, but an impeachment motion needs a two-thirds vote to pass. That would require some support from members of Mr. Yoon’s party.</p><p>The opposition is hoping to take advantage of mass demonstrations scheduled for Saturday to create extra pressure as the vote takes place.</p><p>Mr. Yoon has been struggling with abysmal approval ratings for months. One of the first nationwide opinion polls conducted after the martial law suggested overwhelming public disapproval of his latest move. More than 70 percent of South Koreans are in favor of impeaching him, <a href="http://www.realmeter.net/%eb%a6%ac%ec%96%bc%eb%af%b8%ed%84%b0-%e5%b0%b9-%eb%8c%80%ed%86%b5%eb%a0%b9-%eb%b9%84%ec%83%81%ea%b3%84%ec%97%84-%ec%84%a0%ed%8f%ac-%ec%82%ac%ed%83%9c-%e2%91%a0-%ed%83%84%ed%95%b5/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the poll</a> conducted by Realmeter, based in Seoul.</p><p>The president, who was exempted from South Korea’s mandatory military service because of eye trouble, has had support<span>  </span>from many military veterans, thanks to his conservative hard line on North Korea and his efforts to expand military ties with the United States. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Korean veterans shaved their heads in protest outside the presidential office in Seoul on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ezra Acayan/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But on Thursday, old Marine veterans rallied against him near the presidential offices, calling Mr. Yoon the “mastermind of insurgency.”</p><p>“Let’s decapitate Yoon Suk Yeol!” they chanted, holding a large banner with the same slogan.</p><p>The number of protesters on the streets of Seoul swelled as evening fell, with hundreds of people converging near City Hall. Unlike the many routine protests in the city’s center that are dominated by retirees, the rally featured a vibrant cross-section of the city, grandparents standing shoulder to shoulder with students and parents with children.</p><p>People gave speeches and led chants, with “Yoon Suk Yeol must resign” as a common refrain.</p><p>Kim Sung-hwan, 67, was in the crowd.
