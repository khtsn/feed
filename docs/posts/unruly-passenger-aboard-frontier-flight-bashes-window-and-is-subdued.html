The family was sitting about 10 to 15 rows away from the man.</p><p>“I heard the commotion going on, him kicking stuff,” Mr. Starcevic said. “Then, the next thing you know, he tries to punch out the window.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Starcevic said the unruly passenger appeared to have cut his hands punching the window, which appeared to have a crack on an inner pane. In a photo taken by Mr. Starcevic, blood can be seen on the window shade and the wall next to the man’s seat.</p><p>Mr. Starcevic, 45, who said he and about four other men rushed to intervene, described a frantic search for anything that they could use to tie up the man’s hands and legs.</p><p>“He’s trying to kill us all,” Mr. Starcevic said he recalled thinking. “Someone was just kind of kneeling on him.”</p><p>His wife, Jessica, said she stayed in her seat with their daughter. “Even somebody offered my husband their headphones to try to tie him up with,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Starcevic said he and the other men took turns for the rest of the two-hour-and-16-minute flight, holding the man down and guarding him until they reached George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, where the flight was met by police officers after what Mr. Starcevic described as a delay.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It really felt like it was an eternity,” Jessica Starcevic said, adding that the announcements from the pilot were rather routine, telling passengers to fasten their seatbelts in anticipation of turbulence.</p><p>As of Saturday, the couple said that they had not heard from the airline.</p><p>Victor Senties, a spokesman for the Houston Police Department, said on Saturday that Frontier Airlines had declined to press charges at the time against the man.</p><p>Jennifer F. de la Cruz, a spokeswoman for Frontier, wrote in an email on Saturday that the F.B.I. was investigating.</p><p>Connor Hagan, a spokesman for the bureau’s Houston field office, said that the F.B.I. was working closely with Frontier and the Houston Police Department as part of the investigation. He noted that the F.B.I. has primary jurisdiction over investigating crimes that take place aboard aircraft.</p><p>The episode adds to a list of high-profile examples of air rage. In 2021, a Frontier Airlines passenger assaulted three flight attendants, punching one and groping the breasts of two others, on a flight from Philadelphia to Miami, prompting one crew member to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/business/max-berry-frontier-airlines-flight-attendant-assault.html" title="">tape him to his seat</a> until the plane landed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>In 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration said that it had <a href="https://www.faa.gov/unruly" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received 2,102 reports of unruly passengers</a> from the airlines, a 1 percent increase from 2023. While the volume has leveled off from its height during the coronavirus pandemic, when the F.A.A. developed a zero-tolerance policy for unruly airline passengers, the agency said that the recent uptick shows that it continues to be a problem.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Neil Vigdor covers politics for The Times, focusing on voting rights issues and election disinformation.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor">More about Neil Vigdor</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
