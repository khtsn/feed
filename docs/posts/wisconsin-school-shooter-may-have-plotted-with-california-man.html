The man told investigators that “he told Rupnow that he would arm himself with explosives and a gun and that he would target a government building,” an officer from the Carlsbad Police Department wrote in a document seeking a judge’s permission to seize any weapons in the man’s possession.</p><p>The petition said F.B.I. agents reviewed messages between the Wisconsin shooter and the California man. The document did not say how the two communicated, and it did not provide additional details about their correspondence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The California man does not appear to have been charged with a crime in connection with the shooting. Denise Ramirez, a spokeswoman for the Carlsbad Police Department, said in an email that city officials were helping the F.B.I. in its investigation. She added: “We do not believe there to be a threat to our city.”</p><p>Caroline Clancy, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Wisconsin, declined to comment on the agency’s involvement in the investigation.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
