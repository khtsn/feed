There will also be training sessions for staff.</p><p>This training time will be used to prepare for other new practices, too, including asking customers if they want their drink to stay or to go and offering one free refill of hot or iced coffee to customers who order a drink to stay.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The changes are part of an attempt by the company to prioritize customers and make the stores more inviting, Sara Trilling, the president of Starbucks North America, said in a letter to store managers.</p><p>“We know from customers that access to comfortable seating and a clean, safe environment is critical to the Starbucks experience they love,” she wrote. “We’ve also heard from you, our partners, that there is a need to reset expectations for how our spaces should be used, and who uses them.”</p><p>The changes come as the company responds to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/business/starbucks-earnings-sales.html" title="">declining sales</a>, falling stock prices and grumbling from activist investors. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/business/starbucks-ceo-brian-niccol-chipotle.html" title="">In August</a>, the company appointed a new chief executive, Brian Niccol.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brian Niccol was appointed chief executive of Starbucks in August and has said he plans to make changes to address slumping sales.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Taggart for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Niccol outlined changes the company needed to make in a video <a href="https://about.starbucks.com/press/2024/video-message-from-brian-the-path-forward/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in October</a>. “We will simplify our overly complex menu, fix our pricing architecture and ensure that every customer feels Starbucks is worth it every single time they visit,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The new purchase requirement reverses a policy Starbucks instituted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/business/starbucks-customers-policy-restrooms.html" title="">in 2018</a> that said people could use its cafes and bathrooms even if they had not bought something.</p><p>The earlier policy was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/15/us/starbucks-philadelphia-black-men-arrest.html" title="">introduced</a> a month after two Black men were arrested in a Philadelphia Starbucks while waiting to meet another man for a business meeting.</p><p>Officials said that the men had asked to use the bathroom, but that an employee had refused the request because they had not purchased anything. An employee then called the police, and part of the ensuing encounter was recorded on video and viewed by millions of people online, prompting boycotts and protests.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/09/business/dealbook/howard-schultz-starbucks-bathroom.html" title="">In 2022</a>, Howard Schultz, the Starbucks chief executive at the time, said that the company was reconsidering the open-bathroom policy.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
