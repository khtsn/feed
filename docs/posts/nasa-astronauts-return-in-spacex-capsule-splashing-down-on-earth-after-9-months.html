Crew-9 back on Earth.” [cheers] “Some harnessing being placed around the capsule. This harnessing is what will be used to lift the Dragon capsule out of the water and onto the recovery vessel. Wow, we got a cute little pod of dolphins. It wasn’t just one or two. The capsule will be placed inside of what you can see there is basically a basket. We call it the nest.” “Now working to get that spacecraft situated in the nest. And there you have it. The side hatch is open for the first time since September.” “It looks like we’re getting our next crew member here. That is none other than Suni Williams. Big smile, big waves.” “And of course that leaves NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore.” “And undocking confirmed. Freedom is free of its moorings. The Dragon hatch was closed at 10:05 p.m. Central time.” “Deorbit burn complete. Performance nominal. Nose cone closure initiated.” “Now, there. There’s Butch coming in through the hatch. All right. So I’m going to lead you down through the PMA, PMA 2 into Starliner.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/17astronauts-live-header645p-ftwz/17astronauts-live-header645p-ftwz-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A SpaceX capsule carrying two NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, splashed down off Florida’s Gulf Coast on Tuesday, concluding their unexpectedly long stay in space.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Keegan Barber/NASA, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang"><img alt="Kenneth Chang" title="Kenneth Chang" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-kenneth-chang/author-kenneth-chang-thumbLarge-v3.png"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-fuller"><img alt="Thomas Fuller" title="Thomas Fuller" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-thomas-fuller/author-thomas-fuller-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></a></p></div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-03-18T21:51:22-04:00"><span>Published <!-- -->March 17, 2025</span><span>Updated <!-- -->March 18, 2025</span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>They set off to spend eight days at the space station. The trip lasted nine months.</p><p>On Tuesday, two NASA astronauts who had been in orbit since June, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, splashed down in calm, azure waters off the coast of the Florida Panhandle, concluding a saga that had captivated the country since last summer.</p><p>Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore blasted off in June for the International Space Station on their test flight of Starliner, a Boeing spacecraft that was to provide NASA with another option, outside of SpaceX, to carry astronauts to and from orbit. But the Starliner experienced problems with its propulsion system, prompting NASA to send it back to Earth with no crew aboard.</p><p>It was a SpaceX capsule, the Crew Dragon, that brought them back from space on Tuesday. The spacecraft detached from the space station just after 1 a.m. Eastern time and then traveled back to Earth, slowing from more than 17,000 miles an hour before deploying four large parachutes that gently plopped the spacecraft into the water just before 6 p.m.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Minutes later, as recovery teams inspected the capsule, a pod of curious dolphins circled, a playful terrestrial welcoming party.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/7astronauts-pinned-ledeall2/17astronauts-live71-wmvp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/7astronauts-pinned-ledeall2/17astronauts-live71-wmvp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/7astronauts-pinned-ledeall2/17astronauts-live71-wmvp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Four astronauts in white space suits and gray boots sit strapped into their seats inside a white capsule." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/7astronauts-pinned-ledeall2/17astronauts-live71-wmvp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/7astronauts-pinned-ledeall2/17astronauts-live71-wmvp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/7astronauts-pinned-ledeall2/17astronauts-live71-wmvp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/7astronauts-pinned-ledeall2/17astronauts-live71-wmvp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/68271328-28ff-5900-9d6c-967baa1965cc" decoding="async" width="600" height="337"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, NASA’s Butch Wilmore, Russia’s Aleksandr Gorbunov, NASA’s Nick Hague and NASA’s Suni Williams waiting to exit the SpaceX capsule after splashing down on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">SpaceX, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Once the capsule had been hoisted onto a ship, the door was opened and the beaming astronauts were extracted from the spacecraft. After months of weightlessness, their bodies still adjusting to the pull of gravity, they were lifted onto gurneys.</p><p>“They all looked very healthy,” Steve Stich, the manager of NASA’s commercial crew program, said during a news conference after the splashdown. “They all looked like they were feeling about normal for the landing and recovery phase, where their body is trying to re-adapt.”</p><p>Returning with the two astronauts were Nick Hague, the commander of this mission known as Crew-9, and Aleksandr Gorbunov, a Russian astronaut.</p><p>The four astronauts were scheduled to fly back to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they were to remain briefly until doctors let them go home. “They’ll join their families in the next day or so,” Mr. Stich said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The mission both underlined the dominance of SpaceX in the growing field of private spaceflight, and the comparative woes of Boeing. But as with so many things in the early stages of the Trump administration, the astronauts’ return was tinged with politics.</p><p>President Trump suggested in January that the Biden administration had stranded the astronauts, and Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said this month that the Biden administration had rejected his offer to bring them home sooner.</p><p>But Bill Nelson, who served as the administrator of NASA during the Biden administration, said that NASA never heard about Mr. Musk’s offer, and that the agency’s decisions were based on what made the most sense for the operations of the space station.</p><p>“On the basis that there was no contact with NASA, there was no political consideration from NASA’s point of view,” Mr. Nelson said.</p><p>About a half-hour after the astronauts returned, the White House posted on social media, “PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>However, it has been NASA’s plan since August for the Crew-9 mission to return with Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore around this time frame.</p><p>An hour later after the White House post, Mr. Musk offered celebratory congratulations <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1902141220505243751" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on X</a> to teams at SpaceX and NASA “for another safe astronaut return!” He also thanked President Trump “for prioritizing this mission!”</p><p>But the astronauts also disputed the notion that they were stuck in space.</p><p>“It’s work. It’s fun. It’s been trying at times, no doubt,” Mr. Wilmore said in an interview from the space station last week with The New York Times. “But ‘stranded’? No. ‘Stuck’? No. ‘Abandoned’? No.”</p><p>At the station, Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore had to adjust to their unexpectedly long stay. From the start, they were short of clothes, because their suitcases had been left off the Starliner to make room for a replacement pump to fix the toilet. They relied on spare clothing in the space station.</p><p>NASA sent up their clothes and other personal items a couple of months later on a Northrop Grumman cargo ship. Such robotic cargo ships arrive periodically from Russia and the United States, bringing food, supplies and experiments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft attached to the International Space Station in July.

They tried to put a positive spin on the whole experience.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“You get a little bit more time to enjoy the view out the window,” Ms. Williams said in the interview with The Times last week.</p><p>Not everything they saw was pleasing. From space, Mr. Wilmore saw Hurricane Beryl, which hit Houston last July. The storm damaged the roof of his home. The astronauts also saw the smoke from the Los Angeles fires in January.</p><p>Mr. Wilmore, who has a wife and two children, missed most of his younger daughter’s senior year of high school and his elder daughter’s sophomore year in college.</p><p>He said his younger daughter was “tough,” but she also told him, “I didn’t know how much I needed you until you were gone.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore making pizza in the space station in September.

Without gravity, bone mass tends to diminish, a space version of osteoporosis. The astronauts worked out on the modified gym equipment in the space station, which included a treadmill with a harness that keeps the runner from floating away.</p><p>By the end of their journey, Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore had traveled nearly 121,347,500 miles, having orbited the earth 4,576 times.
