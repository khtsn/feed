The peeling paint and potholed track a testament to a neighborhood long victimized by the city’s politics of race.</p><p>Now, this stadium may finally be getting a second life as the home of one of the National Women’s Soccer League’s newest franchises.</p><p>But in sports-crazed Boston, not everyone is happy.</p><p>The proposal to renovate White Stadium is now at the heart of a legal challenge playing out in Suffolk County Superior Court. It is also the focus of a political dispute among the families atop Boston’s glittering sports franchises.</p><p>The stadium battle has landed in the city’s mayoral race, in the form of a candidate, Josh Kraft, the son of Robert, the owner of the New England Patriots. Josh Kraft is against the proposal for the city to split the $191 million renovation cost with the owners of the new women’s soccer team, a group called Boston Unity Soccer Partners.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“You have all the ingredients for what makes Boston Boston — sports, politics, intrigue and all involving some well-known families,” said Paul Scapicchio, a former member of the City Council.</p><p>The stakes are high. The soccer team’s expansion rights can be revoked if it doesn’t have a FIFA-level venue ready by next spring. (The team has not decided on an official name yet.)</p><p>“As Boston Unity Soccer Partners continues our long-overdue revitalization of White Stadium,”<span>  </span>the team said in a statement ahead of the trial, which is expected to wrap up this week, “our team is thrilled to bring professional women’s soccer to Boston and to collaborate with the city of Boston on enriching the community through our joint renovation of a beloved neighborhood landmark.”</p><p>It all started civic-minded enough (and at a far lower price tag, of $50 million) when Boston Unity Soccer Partners approached Mayor Michelle Wu in 2023 with a plan for a renovation of the 10,000-seat White Stadium, which is owned by the city and used for public school athletic events.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Our students deserve a complex that matches all they are pouring into their growth and development,” Mayor Michelle Wu said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Boston Unity Soccer Partners, the women-led group that owns the city’s new women’s soccer team, is a who’s who of prominent Boston business executives.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Its controlling owner, Jennifer Epstein, is a co-owner of the Boston Celtics. Linda Henry, the chief executive of The Boston Globe and wife of John Henry, the Red Sox owner, was also part of the group until she left amid the mounting outcry. (In another twist of Boston sports and big money, it was reported on Thursday that the Celtics are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6218327/2025/03/20/celtics-franchise-sale-william-chisholm-highest-value-billion/" title="">being sold to a new owner,</a> though the deal still needs to be approved by the league.)</p><p>The deal offered for the soccer stadium was straightforward. In return for paying half of the renovation costs, the group would take a long-term lease for 20 games and 20 practices a year, as well as a share of profits from tickets, advertising and concessions with the city. Boston Public School students could use the rehabilitated stadium the rest of the time.</p><p>Before long, the proposal had the mayor’s backing.</p><p>“I’m a mom, my kids are in the Boston public schools, and I’m in schools every week — our facilities are failing them,” Mayor Wu said in an interview. “This is the only facility for student-athletes, and it has been crumbling for 40 years. Our students deserve a complex that matches all they are pouring into their growth and development.”</p><p>The stadium, built in 1947, has long been an eyesore and a source of exasperation in this working-class neighborhood. After holding more than 60 public meetings, the city won the support for the proposed renovation deal from many public-school parents and more than 40 youth sports organizations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>For others, however, the thought of using nearly $100 million of taxpayer money so some of Boston’s wealthiest movers and shakers could build a stadium for a professional soccer team, complete with luxury suites and a beer garden, was too much. The opposition goes beyond snarled traffic and thousands of people streaming through their yards and sidewalks.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“You have a money grab by some of the city’s most powerful people,” said Rodney Singleton, a local resident, who opposes the stadium deal.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tony Luong for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“This is parkland in a Black and brown neighborhood, and you have a money grab by some of the city’s most powerful people,” said Rodney Singleton, a local resident and one of the plaintiffs who have sued to block the deal. “They wouldn’t try to do this in Boston Common.”</p><p>Karen Mauney-Brodek, the president of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, an advocacy group for Boston’s 1,100 acres of parkland, said many in the community felt bullied by Mayor Wu’s push to do the stadium deal and The Boston Globe’s encouragement to do so from its editorial page.</p><p>Last month, Linda Henry announced she was exiting the investor group. Through a spokeswoman, she declined to say why. Many in the opposition have accused The Globe of cheerleading for the soccer team. The newspaper’s rival, The Boston Herald, is against the stadium deal and has frequently pointed out Ms. Henry’s early involvement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>When the parks conservancy suggested a far less costly renovation — $30 million — that balanced the needs of students and maintained the character of the park, Ms. Mauney-Brodek said the city was not interested. The conservancy’s proposal did not include plans for the professional soccer team to play there.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Karen Mauney-Brodek, the president of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, said many community members feel bullied by supporters of the soccer stadium deal.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tony Luong for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“This is not about economics of sports but about a community’s self-determination,” she said. “It’s been this take-it-or-leave-it offer. It’s not considerate or thoughtful. These parks are essential.”</p><p>The conservancy found an ally last month when Josh Kraft announced he was entering the mayor’s race. He is new to politics but is hardly unknown. He worked at the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston for 30 years and served as the group’s president.</p><p>“The communities around Franklin Park and the people of Boston are not on board with Mayor Wu’s plan to pour $100 million, or possibly more, in public money into a project that primarily benefits a private commercial interest,” Mr. Kraft said in a statement. “To race ahead in this moment in the face of so many legitimate community concerns is a complete and total failure of leadership.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>This being Boston, Mayor Wu is in a standoff over a second soccer stadium. And this dispute also involves the Krafts.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>White Stadium has been a monument to neglect.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tony Luong for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The Kraft Group wants to build a stand-alone, 25,000-seat stadium in neighboring Everett, Mass., for the Major League Soccer team it owns, the New England Revolution. To help clear the way for that stadium, the state Legislature removed the “Designated Port Area” for a 43-acre parcel on the Mystic River, where the facility would be built near the Encore Boston Harbor resort and casino.</p><p>Since the Everett site is adjacent to Boston, the Krafts need to strike a community mitigation agreement with the city over issues like traffic and environmental concerns. The Kraft Group has offered to pay the city $750,000, far below the $68 million that Wynn Resorts paid the city in its community mitigation deal to build its casino.</p><p>“That’s not even a starting point,” Mayor Wu said.</p><p>The Kraft Group declined to comment on the negotiations. If a deal is not struck between parties by May 1, a mediator would need to get involved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dorothy Fennell and Beth Santos live near White Stadium. “This is an opportunity to invest in our neighborhood,’’ said Ms. Santos </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tony Luong for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Meanwhile, the demolition of White Stadium has already started across town. Beth Santos and Dorothy Fennell have rallied public school parents and students to back the proposed renovation. Both live in the neighborhood. Ms. Santos owns the nearby Ula Cafe.</p><p>They said a makeover for White Stadium is long overdue.</p><p>“There is a persistent and noisy group that wants things to stay as they are,” Ms. Santos said. “This is an opportunity to invest in our neighborhood, to give our kids and community something to be proud of. That park has been ignored for 50 years.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Drape is a Times reporter writing about how the intersection of money, power and sports impacts our culture.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-drape">More about Joe Drape</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/boston-globe">Boston Globe</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/boston-red-sox">Boston Red Sox</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the World of Sports</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping professional, collegiate and amateur athletics.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Film, Film, Film for the Home Team: </strong>During spring training, Major League Baseball players recorded trick shots and podcasts at a content house in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/arts/baseball-mlb-player-house-spring-training.html">hope of broadening the sport’s cultural relevance</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Could a Woman Run a 4-Minute Mile?:</strong> Researchers say <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/sports/mile-run-world-record-faith-kipyegon.html">it’s possible</a>, at least for Faith Kipyegon of Kenya, who holds the world record for the distance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shortcut to Success in China:</strong> Companies like East Goes Global serve as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/style/nba-china-social-media.html">social media surrogates for N.B.A. players</a>, expanding their reach, creating business opportunities and pushing for All-Star votes.</p></li><li><p><strong>St. John’s Basketball:</strong> The billionaire Mike Repole, who loved the homegrown team of his youth, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/nyregion/st-johns-basketball-benefactor-repole.html">helped assemble a juggernaut enabled by compensation rules</a> that one critic says created “the wild West.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Modest Sportswear:</strong> Kiandra Browne wondered why there weren’t more clothing options for Muslim women who had a passion for sports. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/style/kiandra-browne-duquesne-hijab-muslim.html">Her small business is helping fill the need for better apparel</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
