In most recent appearances, the robot is dressed like a woman with a bob haircut and is referred to as Ai-Da in honor of Ada Lovelace, the 19th-century mathematician who has been recognized as the world’s first computer programmer.</p><p>“I am trying to adapt to this slightly surreal moment,” Meller said in an interview, recalling the final moments of the sale. </p><p>The painting, which depicted Turing as the god of artificial intelligence, was offered as part of Sotheby’s digital art sale and initially was estimated to sell for $120,000 to $180,000. It received more than 27 bids and was sold to an anonymous buyer from the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Meller said the proceeds from the sale of the painting, called “A.I. God. Portrait of Alan Turing,” would help finance new improvements to Ai-Da’s design.</p><p>“We plow everything back into the project,” he said. “She is constantly being updated. She is on her third painting arm already.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The robot Ai-Da was outfitted with a bob haircut and was named in honor of Ada Lovelace, the 19th-century mathematician who has been recognized as the world’s first computer programmer.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ai-Da Robot Studios</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It was not the first time that an A.I. artwork has sold at auction. In 2018, Christie’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/design/ai-art-sold-christies.html" title="">sold a painting</a> made using an algorithm by a French start-up for $432,500. The artist Refik Anadol sold several <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/digital-catalogues/machine-hallucinations-space-metaverse" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Machine Hallucination”</a> artworks made with artificial intelligence for millions of dollars during the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/arts/design/nfts-moma-refik-anadol-digital.html" title="">2021 NFT boom</a>.</p><p>Meller originally prompted Ai-Da to create something for a <a href="https://aiforgood.itu.int/summit24/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conference on artificial intelligence</a> organized by the United Nations this year. The robot responded with a suggestion that it paint a portrait of Turing as an example of someone who predicted the power of A.I. technology as early as the 1950s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But the process of actually finishing the artwork was more complicated. Ai-Da’s programming interpreted a photograph of Turing and produced 15 individual paintings based on different parts of his face. The robot chose three of the portraits, alongside a painting it had made of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/obituaries/alan-turing-overlooked.html" title="">Bombe machine</a>, the large device that Turing and other code breakers used to decrypt ciphers generated by Nazi Germany’s Enigma machine.</p><p>The works were then photographed and uploaded to a computer that used Ai-Da’s language model to decide on the assembly of a single painting, which was then completed using a 3-D textured printer; studio assistants helped to create a more realistic finished product on the canvas. Ai-Da then added marks and textures to the portrait to complete it.</p><p>Meller said Ai-Da was supposed to prompt discussions about the ethics of artificial intelligence and how technology is changing our definition of who — or what — an artist can be.</p><p>“It is about the transferral of agency onto these machines,” Meller said. “The artwork is saying that we are going into a period where we ask algorithms about what partner we want, what job we want, even what babies we want.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zachary Small is a Times reporter writing about the art world’s relationship to money, politics and technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zachary-small">More about Zachary Small</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/alan-m-turing">Alan M Turing</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/sothebys">Sotheby&#39;s</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/11/08/arts/ai-painting-alan-turing-auction.html">6</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/11/08/arts/ai-painting-alan-turing-auction.html">6</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
