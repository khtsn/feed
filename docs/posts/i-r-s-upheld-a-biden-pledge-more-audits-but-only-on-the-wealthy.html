Biden Jr.’s administration: The Internal Revenue Service would conduct more audits of wealthy Americans, but audit rates would not rise for households earning less than $400,000 per year.</p><p>Mr. Biden and the Democrats made that pledge as they bolstered funding for the I.R.S., hoping that more enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders would generate revenue to pay for climate and health care programs.</p><p>Republican lawmakers <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2024/10/22/lack-of-irs-plan-to-protect-middle-class-families-from-increased-audits-exposes-empty-biden-harris-promise/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> that more money for the I.R.S. would lead to more audits across the board, and that middle-class taxpayers would be targeted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But new data released by the I.R.S. last week suggests that the agency upheld Mr. Biden’s promise in 2024. With an audit rate of 0.8 percent, people making over $500,000 on their latest return were more than twice as likely to be audited compared with the same point in the audit cycle in previous years.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Meanwhile, the matching audit rate for taxpayers making under $500,000 declined slightly. The figures covered 2022 tax returns that were filed in 2023 and audited during the 2024 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30.</p><p>Daniel Werfel, the I.R.S. commissioner for the last two years of Mr. Biden’s term, said in an interview Wednesday that he had changed the agency’s mandate so that it could “ramp up” audits on certain types of returns, while keeping audit rates steady for most individuals.</p><p>On average, audits of individuals with high incomes return substantially more money to the government, so proponents have argued they are the most effective way for the tax agency to collect more revenue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="irs-secondattempt" data-id="100000010200914" data-source-id="100000010200914"><div slug="irs-secondattempt" data-sourceid="100000010200914" id="embed-id-100000010200914">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Many academic tax experts say increasing enforcement is also an effective cheating deterrent. One <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31376" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> found that for every dollar the I.R.S. collects from an audit, it collects another $3 in the future because the individual will be less likely to dodge paying taxes. Other <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/revenue-and-distributional-effects-irs-funding" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies</a> have found that people pay more in taxes when they hear someone else was audited.</p><p>The new data comes with caveats. The I.R.S. generally has three years to pursue an audit, and a majority of audits are opened after more than one calendar year has passed.</p><p>Natasha Sarin, the president and co-founder of the Budget Lab at Yale, said comparing first-year audit rates presented a challenge because the I.R.S. can skew its efforts toward one type of audit early within its statute of limitations. “That’s not to say you won’t still see the shift,” she said. “I just wouldn’t be confident in saying that you won’t also see other adjustments in the next year.”</p><p>Another open question is how much money the I.R.S. will actually collect from the new audits, given the changing policies and personnel at the agency. It has experienced instability in its leadership ranks, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/irs-scott-bessent-elon-musk.html" title="">four</a> different acting commissioners since the start of the Trump administration.</p><p>With more funding during the Biden administration, I.R.S. staffing grew to about 100,000 employees from 80,000. But President Trump has sought big cuts. More than 20,000 employees offered to resign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/04/us/trump-news-updates?smid=url-share#trump-irs-layoffs" title="">earlier this year</a>, while others have been fired. A recent inspector general’s <a href="https://www.tigta.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2025-05/2025ier017fr.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> showed that the agency now has closer to 90,000 employees. And congressional Republicans have rescinded or frozen the extra I.R.S. enforcement funding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>While the number of audits opened on wealthy taxpayers did spike last year, an audit can take several years to close, especially for a high-income return. The I.R.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/upshot/irs-tax-audits-cuts.html" title="">closed fewer audits last year than in any year except 2020</a>, when adjusted for the number of returns filed. Audit collections decreased to $29 billion, down 10 percent from 2023.</p><p>The I.R.S. also <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-releases-strategic-operating-plan-update-outlining-future-priorities-transformation-momentum-accelerating-following-long-list-of-successes-for-taxpayers?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> last year that by 2026 it would increase audits on corporations with at least $250 million in assets. But in the 2024 fiscal year, the number of opened audits on these entities was similar to those in previous years.</p><p>The future of the audit rate is unclear, and the I.R.S. did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Werfel, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/business/economy/irs-commissioner-resign.html" title="">who left the agency as Mr. Trump took office</a>, said that audits are opened based on the I.R.S.’s estimated capacity of its future work force, and that it was very unusual for there to be a change of plans.</p><p>“I think we’re heading into an unprecedented set of circumstances,” he said. “I don’t know how it plays out as a result.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Blatt is a reporter for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot">The Upshot</a> specializing in data-driven journalism.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
