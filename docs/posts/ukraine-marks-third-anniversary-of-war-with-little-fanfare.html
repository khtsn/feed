Her own children were with her husband in Irpin, a nearby suburb that was partly occupied by Russia in the first weeks of the war. She grabbed the children and rushed to Irpin to join her family — heading into greater danger.</p><p>“At that time, I did not know that we are going to hell,” she said by voice message from Germany.</p><p>After more than a week of heavy bombing, they evacuated with four children in a flow of people fleeing over the remnants of a blown-up bridge. “We were there,” she said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/world/europe/ukraine-family-perebyinis-kyiv.html" title="">of the bridge</a>, which became a symbol of the suffering in the early part of the war.</p><p>The family left for Germany, but the pain remains. “The whole month of February for us, all Ukrainians who went through those horrors, it’s a terrible month,” Ms. Shtepan said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Across Ukraine, there are memorials. Some, like destroyed cars of those who tried to flee that litter the countryside, remain as they did back then, a reminder of what was lost.

As the heart kept beating, the messages — “Sofiyka Holynska, forever 6” — kept coming.</p><p>Nataliia Novosolova<!-- --> contributed reporting from Kyiv and <!-- -->Yurii Shyvala<!-- --> from Lviv, Ukraine.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
