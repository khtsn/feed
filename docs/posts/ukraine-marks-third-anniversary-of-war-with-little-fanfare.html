href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1893956340441108517" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a short video</a> praising Ukrainians for their sacrifices and honoring those who died.</p><p>No major events were planned. It was a day to remember what was lost: loved ones and previous lives.</p><p>On her way to work at a local supermarket, Olha Shtepan, a Ukrainian refugee in Hamburg, Germany, started crying. “It’s a wound that doesn’t heal,” she said of the invasion that began Feb. 24, 2022. “Sometimes, I manage to not think of all what has happened, but on a day like today it is terrible.”</p><p>Three years ago when Russia attacked, Ms. Shtepan was babysitting for her sister’s children in Kyiv. Her own children were with her husband in Irpin, a nearby suburb that was partly occupied by Russia in the first weeks of the war. She grabbed the children and rushed to Irpin to join her family — into greater danger. “At that time, I did not know that we are going to hell,” she said by voice message from Germany.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After more than a week of heavy bombing, they evacuated with four children in a flow of people fleeing over the remnants a blown-up bridge. “We were there,” she said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/world/europe/ukraine-family-perebyinis-kyiv.html" title="">of the bridge</a>, which became a symbol of the suffering in the early part of the war.</p><p>The family left for Germany, but the pain remains. “The whole month of February for us, all Ukrainians who went through those horrors, it’s a terrible month,” Ms. Shtepan said.</p><p>Across Ukraine, there are memorials. Some, like destroyed cars of those who tried to flee that litter the countryside, remain as they did back then, a reminder of what was lost. Others are newly created, as the war continues.</p><p>Ukraine Wow, a public organization that promotes Ukrainian culture, earlier this month created an animated sculpture of 12-foot-high hearts at the central railway station in Kyiv. The hearts beat faster each time they receive a message from people with the name of someone who has died in a war. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Maria Varenikova covers Ukraine and its war with Russia.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-varenikova">More about Maria Varenikova</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump Attacks Zelensky: </strong>President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-trump-russia-war.html">called Volodymyr Zelensky a “dictator without elections”</a> after the Ukrainian president said Trump was in a “web of disinformation.” Earlier Trump had falsely stated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/trump-zelensky-ukraine-comments.html">that Ukraine had started the war</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shift in Senate G.O.P. </strong><strong>: </strong>As Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia-republicans.html">moves to normalize relations with Russia</a>, Republicans who once vowed to uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/trump-putin-senate-gop-ukraine.html">have stayed silent or moderated their tone</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ukrainians React: </strong>Trump’s claim that Ukraine was responsible for its war with Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/ukrainians-trump-voices.html">has left many Ukrainians disillusioned</a>, including residents of Bucha, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/europe/bucha-russia-massacre-trump.html">a Kyiv suburb that has become a symbol of Russian brutality</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saudi Arabia: </strong>By hosting high-stakes talks over Ukraine and Gaza, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-diplomacy.html">the kingdom offers more proof of its regional clout</a> and warm relations with Trump. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/middleeast/mbs-saudi-crown-prince-what-to-know.html">Here’s what to know about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmon’s role</a> in global diplomacy.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Alarmed Alliance: </strong>Europe’s leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/europe-trump-russia-ukraine.html">met in Paris to recalibrate their relations</a> with the U.S. after Trump embraced Russia’s narrative.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Verify Our Reporting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Our team of visual journalists analyzes satellite images, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/insider/verifying-images-of-the-war-in-ukraine.html">photographs</a>, videos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/28/world/europe/reskin-russian-radio-ukraine-war.html">radio transmissions</a> to independently confirm troop movements and other details.</p></li><li><p>We monitor and authenticate reports on social media, corroborating these with eyewitness accounts and interviews. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html">Read more about our reporting efforts</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
