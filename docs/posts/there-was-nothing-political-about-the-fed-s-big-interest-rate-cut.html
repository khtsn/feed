The Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, is not in the habit of divulging information about its methods, and Israel is not likely to say anything. Yet the fusillade of exploding pagers has set a new standard — if not in ingenuity, then at least in scale.</p><p>Assassinations are as old as politics, and for most of history they were carried out by relatively straightforward means — knives or guns, with an occasional flourish. The mother of the nefarious Roman emperor Nero, for example, helped him to the throne by serving her husband Claudius a plate of poison mushrooms. (Nero then had her assassinated.)</p><p>But it is in the modern era that assassinations — now often whitewashed as “extrajudicial killings” — have become instruments of state and have harnessed cutting-edge science and inventiveness. Drones, bombs, disguised assassins or special forces are the most common killing tools, but ingenuity is still prized for the toughest targets — or as a way of sending a signal.</p><p>Israel has long been among the busiest, most creative and audacious of states that practice extrajudicial killing. According to Ronan Bergman, an Israeli journalist, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and author of “Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations,” there have been about 2,700 such killings.</p><p>The pager explosions in Lebanon were not the first time Israel used a hand-held wireless device as a weapon. In January 1996, I covered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/world/palestinians-vow-vengeance-at-gaza-funeral-of-terrorist.html" title="">the funeral of Yahya Ayyash</a>, a Palestinian known as the “Engineer” for building suicide bombs used against Israelis. He was killed in Gaza when his booby-trapped mobile phone exploded. Other noteworthy techniques used by Israel involved <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-01-24/poisoned-toothpaste-and-exploding-phones-israel-s-proxy-for-war?embedded-checkout=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poisoned toothpaste</a> and a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-and-mossad-killed-senior-hezbollah-figure-in-car-bombing/2015/01/30/ebb88682-968a-11e4-8005-1924ede3e54a_story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bomb hidden in a spare tire</a>.</p><p>One Israeli attempted hit dramatically misfired. In 1997, Mossad agents in Jordan managed to inject poison into the ear of a Mossad official, Khaled Meshal. The assassins were caught, Jordan demanded an antidote from Israel, and Meshal is today probably the top political leader of Hamas.</p><p>Dramatic hits — and certainly dramatic failures — are hardly confined to Israel. The United States tried and failed to kill Fidel Castro hundreds of times, once by exploding cigar. The Soviet Union and Russia also launched some doozies. There was the celebrated “poison umbrella” against a Bulgarian dissident in 1978, the polonium-laced tea that Alexander Litvinenko drank in 2006, or the nerve agent used against Sergei Skripal in 2018 and Alexei Navalny in 2020 (both of whom survived the attacks).</p><p>Still, the pager attacks open a new chapter in the gruesome history of assassinations. This time, the target was not one person but an entire organization, with the certainty that the dead and injured would not be limited to members of Hezbollah. The long-term goal, moreover, remains unclear — Hezbollah has not been crippled, and is now compelled to retaliate.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzhjYTk3ZTQ0LWFlOTAtNTFhYS1hZTMwLTY1ZjliMzYyZDZhMg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#springfield-harassment-maga-trump" data-source-id="100000009701652"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anna-marks"><img alt="Anna Marks" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/17/opinion/Anna-Marks/Anna-Marks-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/17/opinion/Anna-Marks/Anna-Marks-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/17/opinion/Anna-Marks/Anna-Marks-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-17T22:26:17.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 17, 2024, 6:26 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Over the last week, the Republican Party’s presidential and vice-presidential candidates have<strong> </strong>been spreading fear about immigration by knowingly,<strong> </strong>falsely claiming that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, have been eating household pets. In the days since they began peddling these lies, more than 30 bomb threats have forced hospital lockdowns and school closures. Ohio’s governor has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/us/springfield-ohio-troopers-bomb-threats.html" title="">called</a> in the State Highway Patrol to ensure children can make it to class despite threats of racially motivated violence.</p><p>The way MAGA has rocked Springfield is an extreme example of what some academics call <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051211021378" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">networked harassment</a>, in which a powerful figure’s vocal, devoted audience mobilizes to enforce conformity with a particular worldview. Online, this typically takes the form of harassing messages and death threats spread through forums and social media. But Donald Trump’s adherents have managed to bring such digital fanaticism into the real world, breathing new life into a racist culture of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/the-danger-within" title="">political violence</a> that should have died with Jim Crow.</p><p>The MAGA faithful have deployed their power before, to intimidate poll workers and to force Republican politicians to hew to Trump’s will. With the lurking threat of his powerful base backing him, the former president has slowly created an atmosphere in which it is commonly understood that opposing him invites retribution, in the form of online harassment,<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/29/us/politics/paul-pelosi-political-violence.html" title="">home invasions</a>, bomb threats, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/opinion/trump-documents-jan-6-prosecute.html" title="">violent insurrections</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/23/us/verdict-trial-gretchen-whitmer-kidnap.html" title="">kidnapping attempts</a>.</p><p>Where once this country might have relied on Republicans with a backbone to stand up against Trump’s worst tendencies, the threat of retribution has become so great that<strong> </strong>the former president has come close to achieving total submission within his own party.</p><p>What’s now playing out in Springfield, however, marks a more ominous shift in the MAGA faithful’s focus.<strong> </strong>Lacking noncompliant politicians to harass, Trump’s supporters have now turned outward, using threats against the town as a warning to the nation of what happens if it ignores MAGA’s racist demands — “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/nx-s1-5037992/trump-immigrants-border-mass-deportation-presidential-race-migrants" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mass deportation now!</a>”</p><p>It should be unsurprising that this attempt to force the culture to shift has begun just as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/my-president-was-black/508793/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another Black American</a> has a real shot at this country’s highest office. A culture of white supremacy, which Trump and Vance’s racist lies clearly serve, cannot thrive if the majority of the country welcomes a multiracial democracy with open arms. So, the thinking goes, they must be intimidated with threats of violence into acceding to Trump’s will.</p><p>Harris made it clear on Tuesday that she understands — and cares about — the risks of unrestrained speech. “When you have this kind of microphone in front of you,” she said in an interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists, “you really ought to understand at a very deep level how much your words have meaning.”</p><p>Like so many politicians throughout this country’s history, she chooses to follow a personal code of morality and decency. That used to be the norm in a national political campaign, but Trump has made such behavior seem optional. In this particular election, even Harris’s bare minimum should be enough.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2I3NDc3YzNkLTRmMmEtNTRkNy05MDQxLTRhYzM2MTdkN2ViYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#instagram-children-regulation" data-source-id="100000009699333"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zeynep-tufekci"><img alt="Zeynep Tufekci" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-17T19:56:32.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 17, 2024, 3:56 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Instagram just announced “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/technology/instagram-teens-safety-privacy-changes.html" title="">sweeping</a>” changes to how it handles minors’ accounts, a belated acknowledgment that a social platform that seeks to encourage engagement can have pernicious effects on children. Accounts whose owners self-identify as minors will now be private by default, stop notifications between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., and allow parent accounts to see who receives their children’s messages.</p><p>But these new policies will have little impact on many teenagers, because the platform has not set up age verification.</p><p>In response to Instagram’s new policy, many kids will simply create “finstas” — fake accounts — and carry on as before. Additionally, 16- and 17-year-olds will be able to opt out of these settings without needing parental approval. Anyone familiar with teenagers and the platform can see that Instagram’s new policy is less of a solution and more of a performance of doing something in response to public outcry.</p><p>Even these minor changes came only after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/technology/instagram-teens-safety-privacy-changes.html" title="">dozens of lawsuits</a> by state attorneys general and recent legislation aimed at protecting minors online that overwhelmingly passed in the Senate. In an age of polarization, such consensus is a strong indicator of how bothered the public is by all this.</p><p>While our new connected reality does have upsides, many teenagers suffer greatly from the constant judgment that characterizes social media platforms. And then there are the many documented cases of blackmail and exploitation of vulnerable youngsters.</p><p>Obviously, those best able to protect themselves from social media’s harms are going to be the young people who already have trusting relationships with their parents. Those kids are more likely to voluntarily self-identify as minors and now have slightly better default settings. But what about the rest of them?</p><p>Age verification is the kind of policy that would allow such changes to have widespread effect. But it’s not an easy fix. And it would certainly not be without major downsides, especially if it allowed a company to collect even more information on everyone. It also might overly stifle legitimate and necessary access to online information and speech. But those problems are potentially solvable in part by developing new technological approaches, if companies had the incentive to try.</p><p>So far, tech companies have little incentive to do much else besides belatedly change a few settings. Little else is likely to happen until Congress finally gets serious, resists the lobbying by these wealthy companies and puts some thoughtful effort into legislation with sharp enough teeth to force platforms to act.</p><p>Until then, the most vulnerable kids are still on their own.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFmNGIyMjA3LTA0NDctNWQ1ZC05ZjI5LWIxYTI1NzBiYzJiNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#supreme-court-roberts-immunity" data-source-id="100000009696787"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-17T09:04:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 17, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Jacquelyn Martin/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Does John Roberts live in the same world as the rest of us? One has to wonder, given how frequently the Supreme Court’s chief justice seems removed from the social and political realities of the country.</p><p>As revealed by my Times colleagues Jodi Kantor and Adam Liptak in their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/justice-roberts-trump-supreme-court.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">remarkable, deeply reported article</a> that was published on Sunday, Roberts orchestrated several high-profile rulings last term in ways that benefited Donald Trump, at least partly by acting as though the American people would not interpret them as political. In drafting the majority opinion for the Jan. 6 presidential immunity case, for example, Roberts “seemed confident that his arguments would soar above politics, persuade the public, and stand the test of time,” Kantor and Liptak wrote.</p><p>That attitude was dangerously naïve, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor tried to warn Roberts in the justices’ private conference following oral arguments in the case. The court was weighing whether to reverse a federal appeals court ruling that Trump was not immune from prosecution for his actions on and around Jan. 6. Sotomayor “did not see how the court could reverse the appellate decision. It would look like the Supreme Court was being used to delay the trial, she said,” according to the article.</p><p>She was right, of course: “Both conservatives and liberals saw it as an epic win for Mr. Trump.” Combined with the rulings in Trump’s favor in the other two Jan. 6 cases, it is no surprise that the Supreme Court’s public approval level is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/08/favorable-views-of-supreme-court-remain-near-historic-low/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hovering around its all-time low</a>. You don’t need a law degree to understand that in the post-Bush v. Gore era, the court treads on extremely thin ice when it inserts itself into presidential politics, all the more so if the justices in the majority share a political ideology with the winning side.</p><p>At the same time, Roberts gives indications of being aware of the fragility of the court’s legitimacy. In one of the article’s most telling details, the chief justice took charge of writing an opinion in a case involving Jan. 6 rioters — one that had initially been assigned to Justice Samuel Alito. Roberts did so just days after The Times reported that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/justice-alito-upside-down-flag.html" title="">a pro-Trump flag had flown outside Alito’s home</a> around the time of the Capitol attack. Given how unusual it is for a majority opinion to change hands, the timing suggests Roberts was trying to counteract a perceived bias of at least one of the justices.</p><p>Still, masking the radical partisanship of the court’s right-most flank doesn’t fool anyone. If Roberts wants to rebuild public confidence in the court, he could start by acknowledging the real world outside One First Street. In a world as polarized as ours, you can’t issue a hugely consequential ruling that’s about Trump and pretend that it has nothing to do with Trump. The immunity ruling has already affected the operation of the presidency, and it’s natural for people to consider it in light of how Trump (or Kamala Harris, for that matter) would react to it starting in 2025. </p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2U4Njc5ZTlhLTlmYjUtNTkxZC05Y2Q5LTFmNmVjNGQ4ZWMyZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#kamala-harris-polish-voters" data-source-id="100000009694363"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-alter"><img alt="Jonathan Alter" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-16T18:59:21.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 16, 2024, 2:59 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Kamala Harris’s powerful message on abortion and Donald Trump’s deranged lies about Haitian immigrants eating pets are getting most of the post-debate attention, but Harris’s appeal to Polish American voters in Pennsylvania might prove more influential in the outcome.</p><p>One highlight of the debate came when the moderator David Muir asked Trump: “Do you believe it’s in the U.S.’s best interests for Ukraine to win this war? Yes or no?”</p><p>After Trump basically said no, Harris detailed her 2023 visit to Poland and Romania on NATO’s eastern flank and her role in the “righteous defense” of Ukraine. She explained why our NATO allies are “so thankful that you are no longer president.” If Trump had been in office then, “Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland. And why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor.” She ended by calling Putin “a dictator who would eat you for lunch.”</p><p>That was a smart line of attack for reasons beyond Pennsylvania and the Polish American vote. It appeals to veterans and to swing voters looking for a candidate who will stand up for American interests in the world. Many of these voters understand that persuading other nations to contribute more to our common defense (which Biden and Harris have done) is not our only foreign policy objective.</p><p>More broadly, the exchange over the war in Ukraine made Harris look strong and Trump weak. He came across as not just a patsy for dictators (and an autocrat who uses the Hungarian strongman, Viktor Orban, as a character reference), but clueless in claiming that he could settle a complex conflict overnight. While foreign policy is rarely a critical issue in elections during which no American soldiers are in combat, Harris’s fluency in its nuances signaled to voters that she is presidential.</p><p>It’s hard to predict how all of this will play with a bellwether constituency in a bellwether state. Polish American voters have sided with the losing candidate only three times in more than a century. A gaffe by President Gerald Ford in a debate with his challenger, Jimmy Carter, (“I don’t believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.”) helped sink Ford in the 1976 election. But an overheard ethnic slur against Poles by the vice-presidential candidate Spiro Agnew in 1968 did not cost Richard Nixon the election that year.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, Polish Americans were essential to Joe Biden’s victory over Trump there in 2020, following Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss in the state. They identified with Biden as a Scranton native and fellow Catholic, advantages that Harris does not possess.</p><p>It may be “wishful thinking,” as one Pennsylvania professor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/kamala-harris-polish-americans-pennsylvania.html" title="">told The Times</a> last week, to assume Harris can make inroads with this constituency, which cares a lot about the immigration issue. But at least Harris is trying. Attacking Trump for selling out to Putin on the future of Poland is more than just good politics. It’s a sign that she is ready to be the leader of the free world.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2MxMWU1MWExLTEyMjktNWNiMi04MDc5LWZhZWNmYjRiY2Q5ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#parenting-costs-usa" data-source-id="100000009694103"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/pamela-paul"><img alt="Pamela Paul" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-16T16:43:02.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 16, 2024, 12:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Last month, the surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/28/us-surgeon-general-issues-advisory-mental-health-well-being-parents.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued an advisory</a> on the mental health and well-being of parents. Too many parents, Murthy noted, are stressed out by the demands of parenthood in an environment dominated by gun violence, social media and drug epidemics. Murthy recommended policies to support parental mental health, improve child care access, increase parental leave and improve community support.</p><p>That’s nice.</p><p>As for Kamala Harris, if she becomes president, she <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wants to offer</a> $6,000 child tax credits to families with newborns and make high-quality child care more affordable.</p><p>That’s also nice.</p><p>But it’s a drop in the bucket. Across the developed world, parents are stressed over social media and their kids doing well at school. But in many European countries, parents can <em>afford</em> to stress about those things because they have access to free or heavily subsidized child care, health care and education. (These countries also have sensible gun laws, but that’s another story.)</p><p>Here in America, we get none of that. If American parents didn’t have to sweat over saving <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/cost-raising-child" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> to pay for these larger things, they might have the time and mental space to attend to child-rearing’s ordinary challenges. If they didn’t have to panic over their kids’ futures being subject to these same expenses and a merciless job market, they wouldn’t be quite so frantic about their children’s education and whether it will adequately prepare them for an economically secure future.</p><p>My European friends think what American parents put up with is bonkers, but unlike many Americans, they don’t blame parents. They recognize that American parents are trapped in an impossible system.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, I wrote a book called “<a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805089240/parentinginc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Parenting, Inc.: How the Billion-Dollar Baby Business Has Changed the Way We Raise Our Children</a>.” That book was largely about how companies exploit parents’ fears to sell them products and services intended to make their children “succeed.” That market has since metastasized, but its underlying cause remains the same. “The cost of raising children is rising far faster than our earnings,” I wrote. “That leaves even couples who make decent salaries belaboring the decision to have children based on the bottom line.” Republicans like JD Vance have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-child-tax-credit-5000-what-to-know/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested a similarly meager tax credit</a> in their push to get Americans reproducing. And even Democrats are too tentative to push for systemic change in health care, child care or education. The picayune proposals currently on the table amount to petty change, not to any material change at all.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMyZjZmOGQwLWNhM2YtNTRkNS04NzNkLTEzZDFjZDkwZTc0ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#american-voters-in-the-shadow-of-another-gunman" data-source-id="100000009693475"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy"><img alt="Patrick Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-16T09:04:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 16, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Every Monday morning on The Point, we start the week with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign. Here’s what we’re looking at this week:</em></p><ul><li><p>After the Kamala Harris-Donald Trump debate last week, I held a focus group with young, undecided voters and we discussed the 2024 election.</p><p>“It feels like something out of a dystopian movie,” a 22-year-old said.</p><p>“Full of twists and turns,” one 24-year-old replied.</p><p>“A confusing whirlwind,” a 21-year-old called it.</p></li><li><p>These three voters grew up in a country and a world shaped and scarred by 9/11, the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, Twitter, the Great Recession, Sandy Hook, a rapidly warming planet, the famines and food crises across Africa, President Donald Trump, Charlottesville, Covid, George Floyd, Jan. 6, deep fakes, Ukraine, Oct. 7, Gaza. I call these young voters the wrong-track generation: For pretty much their entire lives, a majority of Americans have said that the country was on the wrong track, and were dissatisfied with how things were going. I’m 53 and I can’t imagine growing up and, through no fault of their own, only knowing an America where so many people thought so many things were so bad.</p></li><li><p>Yesterday I was editing the transcript of this undecided voter focus group when I got an email from the Trump campaign at 2:23 p.m. saying, “President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity.” I thought of those young voters who described last week’s debate as another twist and turn, as more dystopian confusion, and wondered, what will they think of America now?</p></li><li><p>Some have historical perspective, of course: we don’t live in a nation where a senator is caned in the chamber, or assassinations feel commonplace, or the KKK is marching en masse, they told me last week. In our focus groups, one thing people argue about the most is whether America’s best days are behind us or ahead of us. I find those arguments fascinating — the participants feel a deep stake in America, no matter what side they take. And yet I can’t imagine what it is to be a young person in America today, processing so much in a real-time information deluge. What I can imagine is why some young voters are still undecided. Many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/22/opinion/young-voters-focus-group.html" title="">loathe Trump and found Jan. 6 traumatic</a>; at the same time, they care a great deal about trust, and don’t confer it easily — and they don’t feel like Kamala Harris has earned their trust with the handful of big policy speeches, interviews and debates she’s done. People ask me, how can these voters be undecided? But I feel only empathy for them. Thinking about what America has given them in the last two decades, I reply, can you really blame them?</p></li><li><p>This week, these voters and the rest of us will learn more about the F.B.I.’s investigation of what may be an attempted assassination and of the suspected gunman. Trump and Harris both have <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/14/kamala-harris-to-make-blue-wall-campaign-stop-in-wisconsin-next-week/75223412007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">events</a> in which Sunday’s news — and the state of America — will get full airings, I’m sure. The lies about Haitian migrants will most likely continue, and the economy will swing back into public focus with a probable Fed interest rate cut. More twists and turns, in other words, as a lot of voters look for some meaning in it all and think about America’s best days.</p></li></ul></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzY1NTFiOTk4LTYwZTMtNWFmMC1iNjRhLWQwMjBmZDNjODRmZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#week-bad-political-behavior" data-source-id="100000009691364"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-13T21:43:15.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 13, 2024, 5:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>With less than two months to go until Election Day, it is impossible to keep track of all the political madness afoot.

Loomer started things off by snarking on X that if Kamala Harris wins the presidency, “the White House will smell like curry &amp; White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Get it? Because Harris is half Indian.</p><p>The smear wasn’t clever or funny and, in fact, was so thuddingly racist it prompted a public scolding from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (yep, you read that right: Marjorie. Taylor. Greene), who denounced Loomer’s post as “<a href="https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1834006729966723558?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1834006729966723558%7Ctwgr%5E63d35bad8e5c15b88f98e2572ac4f97c469a826f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fmaga-civil-war-erupts-as-laura-loomer-and-mtg-trade-blows-in-public" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appalling and extremely racist</a>” and later told CNN that Loomer lacked “<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-calls-far-right-activist-laura-loomer-s-rhetoric-huge-problem-that-doesn-t-represent-maga/ar-AA1qtqpy?ocid=BingNewsSerp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the right mentality</a>” to advise a presidential campaign. Loomer responded by slamming Greene as the real racist — and, oh, yes, also “<a href="https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1834345178460557673" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gutter trash</a>.”</p></li><li><p>But wait! There’s more. One of the Senate’s top Trump toadies, Lindsey Graham, also publicly warned his MAGA king against associating with the “toxic” Loomer, prompting Loomer <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1834305481436967305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1834305481436967305%7Ctwgr%5Eaac1537431bd7d53161ca4c898e229e4949f2b32%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rawstory.com%2Flaura-loomer-lindsey-graham%2F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to go hard</a> at Graham, with an attack on the senator’s loyalty to Trump and on his sexual orientation.</p><p>I guess this is what happens when you build a political movement on the idea that nastiness and pugilism are signs of courage and integrity.</p></li><li><p>It looks as though Mayor Eric Adams of New York may have a Trumpian predilection for surrounding himself with questionable characters. Various aides have been swept into multiple federal investigations of possible corruption at City Hall and the Police Department. The mayor, a Democrat, has had his phone seized and his judgment questioned, since many of those under investigation were his direct appointees, including the police commissioner, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">who resigned on Thursday</a>.</p><p>How is Adams responding to the gathering storm? By explaining to New Yorkers what’s going on or by vowing to clean up his administration? Don’t be silly. He is instead cloaking himself in the good book <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/nyregion/eric-adams-black-churches.html" title="">by comparing himself to Job</a>, the biblical innocent whose suffering was imposed by God as part of a divine test.</p><p>“I wish I could tell you that I had one moment in my life that was a Job moment,” he said at an evangelical Black church in Brooklyn on Sunday. “But I did not have one. I had many.”</p><p>Lord, deliver us from this shameless posturing.</p></li><li><p>Just when you thought Trump’s migrants-munching-pets hullabaloo couldn’t get any more delicious, up pops Marianne Williamson, the erstwhile Democratic presidential hopeful, <a href="https://twitter.com/marwilliamson/status/1834230977788313677" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with this</a> spiritually themed warning on X:</p><p>“Continuing to dump on Trump because of the ‘eating cats’ issue will create blowback on Nov. 5. Haitian voodoo is in fact real, and to dismiss the story out-of-hand rather than listen to the citizens of Springfield, Ohio confirms in the minds of many voters the stereotype of Democrats as smug elite jerks who think they’re too smart to listen to anyone outside their own silo.”</p><p>I’m just going to leave this here for you to unpack on your own.</p></li></ul></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2JkM2I5Y2ViLTBjYzUtNTU1NS1hMDRkLTFlZTk1YjVmNDU1MQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#fed-rate-cut-political" data-source-id="100000009704334"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-coy"><img alt="Peter Coy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-18T18:14:41.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 18, 2024, 2:14 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Was it “political” for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates less than two months before the presidential election, as Donald Trump has charged? Not a bit. Not cutting rates is what would have been political.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Fed’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cut the target range for the federal funds rate — the short-term interest rate it controls — by half a percent. A cut that big was at the high end of forecasters’ predictions. More often the Fed moves a quarter-point at a time, but the committee members apparently wanted to make sure that they didn’t fall behind the curve and allow the economy to slip into a recession.</p><p>The nub of the argument that the Fed was trying to help the Democrats is that lower rates might help the economy grow a little faster, which would in principle help the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris, since her party controls the White House.</p><p>Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/business/economy/trump-interest-rates.html" title="">referred</a> to the expected rate cut as “political stuff” during a town hall in Michigan this week. Earlier this year, in an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-trump-interview-transcript/?sref=B3uFyqJT" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with Bloomberg Businessweek, he said that an interest-rate cut by the Fed is “something that they know they shouldn’t be doing.”</p><p>Trump’s argument doesn’t hold up to scrutiny, though. If the members of the Fed committee had really wanted to help Harris get elected, they would have started cutting earlier, since it takes <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2023/oct/what-are-long-variable-lags-monetary-policy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least half a year</a>, and possibly much longer, for changes in interest rates to affect the real economy.</p><p>If anything, the Fed waited too long to start cutting. Inflation has cooled, while the unemployment rate shot up to 4.2 percent last month from 3.5 percent in July 2023.</p><p>Unfortunately, sometimes not being political is going to look political. Under these economic conditions, for the Fed to try to dodge criticism from Trump by leaving interest rates high would have been highly political — and indefensible.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
