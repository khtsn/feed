    <h1>What We Know About the Victims of the New Orleans Terror Attack on New Year’s</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many of them had arrived on Bourbon Street on New Year’s Eve to celebrate the promise of the year to come: a woman on the cusp of starting her studies to become a nurse, a father of two spending time with his cousin, a former Princeton University football player.</p><p>But at around 3:15 a.m., a Texas man drove his truck through the crowd of revelers, killing 15 people and injuring dozens more, before opening fire. The injured include two police officers who confronted the driver, two Israeli citizens and a University of Georgia student.</p><p>This is what we have learned about some of those who died in the attack.</p><h3 id="link-46130863"><span>Ni’Kyra Cheyenne Dedeaux</span></h3><p>Ni’Kyra Cheyenne Dedeaux’s family in Gulfport, Miss., learned on Wednesday that the 18-year-old had been celebrating New Year’s Eve in New Orleans with her cousin and was among those killed in the attack on Bourbon Street.</p><p>“We didn’t know she was over there, because I would’ve discouraged it, especially during times when it’s the holidays,” said Jennifer Smith, Ms. Dedeaux’s grandmother. “None of my kids go to New Year’s parties. I’ve always had that fear.”</p><p>Dante Reed, Ms. Dedeaux’s friend since middle school, said he received a frantic call from a cousin who had been with her in New Orleans, saying that they had run when they heard gunshots and that she was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Ms. Dedeaux, known as Biscuit to her family and close friends, was looking forward to starting school at Blue Cliff College later this month, where she planned to major in nursing. She was inspired by her mother and grandmother, who were both nurses, and by working in housekeeping at a hospital.</p><p>She was very close to her family and had five siblings. She died the day after the anniversary of her grandfather’s death.</p><p>“She was a joy for the little time we had her,” Ms. Smith said. “It’s hard to believe that she’s gone.”</p><p>On the day of her high school graduation in May, her family held a party. She was given bouquets of money made by her mother. She was in her red cap and gown. Her family showed up for the ceremony in T-shirts with her face on them. Even the babies wore matching onesies for the day.</p><p>“That was the proudest moment of my life. I was so happy,” Ms. Smith said, her voice breaking. “I’m very proud of all of my grandchildren, and that one especially.”</p><p>On Wednesday, Ms. Dedeaux’s mother posted a photo on Facebook of her daughter and confirmed her death in the attack. She wrote, “When your parents say don’t go anywhere please listen to them.”</p><h3 id="link-1e63055f"><span>Reggie Hunter</span></h3><p>Reggie Hunter, 37, and his cousin, Kevin Curry, 38, decided to make a quick trip down to New Orleans from Baton Rouge, La., to ring in the new year.</p><p>Shirell Jackson, another cousin, said on Wednesday that she last heard from Mr. Hunter through a family group chat, texting wishes for a happy new year.</p><p>Around 5:30 a.m., Ms. Jackson got a phone call from University Medical Center New Orleans, and she rushed there. When she arrived, about an hour later, she discovered that Mr. Hunter, a father of two, had died from internal injuries.</p><p>“He didn’t deserve this,” Ms. Jackson said.</p><p>Courtney Hunter, 33, Mr. Hunter’s younger sister, said that he loved to be around family and enjoyed their gatherings, and that he was especially competitive when it came to playing games.</p><p>Ms. Jackson said Mr. Hunter, who worked as a manager at a warehouse, had a great sense of humor that sometimes came with a touch of sarcasm. He was known for dressing up, she said, and New Year’s Eve was no exception; he sported a pair of black-and-white Nike Jordans and a black polo shirt.</p><p>“Always wanted to look very nice,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Curry was also injured in the attack and will need surgery to repair a broken femur.</p><h3 id="link-6934bf4d"><span>Tiger Bech</span></h3><p>Tiger Bech, a former football player at Princeton University, was also killed in the attack, the university <a href="https://goprincetontigers.com/news/2025/1/1/princeton-football-mourns-the-loss-of-tiger-bech-21" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>St. Thomas More Catholic High School in Lafayette, La., where Mr. Bech, 27, played football, lacrosse and track and field before his graduation in 2015, <a href="https://www.stmcougars.net/fs/comms-manager/view/e1c52218-bde1-4fc4-83ac-dd782206a389" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hosted a rosary prayer service</a> for the Bech family on Wednesday evening.</p><p>“Love you always brother!” said Jack Bech, Mr. Bech’s brother and a football player at Texas Christian University, captioning a social media post sharing the news of his death. “You inspired me everyday now you get to be with me in every moment. I got this family T, don’t worry. This is for us.”</p><h3 id="link-1f056636"><span>Kareem Badawi</span></h3><p>Kareem Badawi recently finished his first semester at the University of Alabama, where he majored in mechanical engineering. While he was home in Baton Rouge, La., for the holidays, he and his friends decided to celebrate the New Year in New Orleans.</p><p>“They say, ‘Let’s go there and have fun and let’s make this year special,’” Mr. Badawi’s father, Belal Badawi recalled in an interview.</p><p>Mr. Badawi, 18, was social and had many friends, his father said. He was the youngest of three children and cared for his family. At the university, he joined the Sigma Chi fraternity. He told his father he wanted to go to school in Alabama because he wanted to see a different state.</p><p>“He loves people,” Mr. Badawi said.</p><p>In a <a href="https://news.ua.edu/2025/01/message-from-ua-president-stuart-r-bell/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, the university’s president, Stuart R. Bell, confirmed that Mr. Badawi was a student there.</p><p>“I grieve alongside family and friends of Kareem in their heartbreaking loss,” Mr. Bell said.</p><p>Mr. Badawi’s father said that his favorite memories with his son were from when they traveled as a family. He had been to many states, including beaches in Florida, and the family had traveled to Mexico. Last year, the family took a trip to London.</p><p>“He was a lovely boy,” his father said, crying.</p><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg<!-- --> contributed reporting and <!-- -->Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div>
