    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><div><p>The S&amp;P 500 spiked, showing investors’ relief to President Trump’s decision to pause high tariffs for most countries, except for China.</p><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="markets-embed-sp" data-id="100000008938528" data-source-id="100000008938528"></section><div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-04-09T14:57:17-04:00"><span>Published <!-- -->April 8, 2025</span><span>Updated <!-- -->April 9, 2025, <span>2:57 p.m. ET</span></span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Stocks surged on Wednesday afternoon, ripping higher after President Trump said he would back down on tariffs for most of the world for the next 90 days, citing new talks with foreign nations.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 climbed over 7 percent in a matter of minutes after Mr. Trump posted the decision on Truth Social, sharply reversing days of losses. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that a tariff of 10 percent would remain in place.</p><p>Mr. Trump said that the pause did not extend to China and that he would instead raise tariffs on its exports to 125 percent after Beijing announced a new round of retaliation. Beijing had earlier added its own 50 percent levy on American goods in response, bringing the total tariff on U.S. exports to China to 84 percent.</p><p>Still, the news offered a welcome reprieve to investors after markets had been uprooted last week by Mr. Trump’s announcement of across-the-board tariffs on dozens of countries. Those initially took effect on Wednesday, before Mr. Trump’s reversal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Even after the S&amp;P 500’s sharp rise, the index remains roughly 12 percent below its recent high, in February. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose 10 percent on Wednesday but is still roughly 16 percent below its December high. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies more exposed to the outlook of the economy remains roughly 22 percent below its November high.</p><p>“The tariff clouds parted for the first time today, but it’s too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow — or 90 days from now,” said Daniel Skelly, head of the wealth management market research and strategy team at Morgan Stanley. “As welcome as the announcement was, investors can’t assume it’s the end of the tariff story, or that the market’s day-to-day volatility will disappear.”</p><p>Earlier in the day, when stocks were still oscillating between small gains and losses, Mr. Trump posted “BE COOL” on his Truth Social platform, before adding, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!”</p><p>Wednesday was the best day for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2020 and the market recovery from the early pandemic-induced sell-off. Nearly every stock in the index rose. Airlines, some tech companies and Tesla were among those companies to soar over 20 percent.</p><p>Shares of automakers rose sharply even though 25 percent tariffs on imported cars remain in place. Ford and General Motors both rose about 8 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Oil prices rose, as did the U.S. dollar. The yield on short-dated government debt also rose, a sign of investors dialing back expectations for interest rate cuts to prop up the economy after the threat of tariffs had been reduced. Other measures of worry also eased.</p><p>“So a 90-day pause on tariffs on ‘non-retaliating countries,’ and for China their tariff rate now goes to 125 percent,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group. “Respite? Further economic suicide? It will all depend on where you source product from, of course, and unfortunately about $450 billion is still being imported from China.”</p><p>Markets in Asia and Europe, which had closed for trading before Mr. Trump’s new tariff announcement, mostly slumped: Taiwan’s was the worst hit, sinking more than 5 percent, while benchmark indexes fell more than 3 percent in Japan.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 3.5 percent, and the FTSE 100 in London fell about 3 percent.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to spin the pause as part of Mr. Trump’s strategy and not a capitulation, saying that the tariffs had worked to get some of China’s closest neighbors to seek deals with the United States. “Do not retaliate, and you will be rewarded,” he said.</p><p>This week, Japan emerged as the first major economy to secure priority tariff negotiations with the Trump administration. The news prompted a brief surge in Tokyo-listed stocks before they resumed their decline on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some analysts warned that even as U.S. markets rose on Wednesday, the uncertainty caused by the Trump administration’s aggressive imposition of tariffs is likely to chill the economy.</p><p>“The initial market response speaks for itself, but for now, this is just a step in the right direction — investment, hiring and consumer spending are likely to slow as policy winds continue to swirl,” Mr. Skelly said.</p><p>Others also cautioned that the rally could just as quickly reverse course.</p><p>“We’re not out of the woods yet,” said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide. “In periods of heightened volatility, sharp rallies are just as emotionally driven — and potentially misleading — as steep sell-offs.”</p><p>Alan Rappeport<!-- --> and <!-- -->Jack Ewing<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.</p></div><div><p>Eshe Nelson is a reporter based in London, covering economics and business news for The New York Times.</p></div><div><p>River Akira Davis covers Japan, including its economy and businesses, and is based in Tokyo.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
