Trump’s government efficiency project.</p><p>Mr. Ramaswamy told Ohio allies of his plan after the state’s governor, Mike DeWine, named Ohio’s lieutenant governor, Jon Husted, to fill the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Vice President-elect JD Vance.</p><p>For now, Mr. Ramaswamy plans to continue working alongside Elon Musk at the new Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He hopes to make some progress before turning his attention to the governor’s seat, which becomes open in 2026.</p><p>The billionaire entrepreneur is already engaged in the high-profile government cost-slashing project. He and Mr. Musk have taken meetings together on Capitol Hill and have announced grand — and many believe unrealistic — plans to cut $2 trillion out of the federal budget. But given Mr. Musk’s vastly larger wealth and profile, it has not been an equal partnership, and Mr. Musk’s top lieutenant, Steve Davis, largely oversees the effort.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jonathan Swan is a political reporter covering the 2024 presidential election and Donald Trump’s campaign.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-swan">More about Jonathan Swan</a></span></p></div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a White House correspondent, reporting on the second, nonconsecutive term of Donald J.
