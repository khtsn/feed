    <h1>What Do You Win When You Work at the Carnival?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>I grew up going to amusement parks and fairgrounds in Quebec and the United States. Back then, the only thing on my mind was worrying about having my head turned upside down on the rides. My memories are full of the bright lights, fast rides and greasy food stands of those carnivals.</p><p>Years later, when I revisited this world as an adult, all I could see was what was happening behind the scenes: workers busy building a wonderful world for children who aren’t their own, and men and women trying to escape a well-ordered life to find freedom and hope in their own way.</p><p>The short documentary above was born out of my encounter with Kim Lalonde, who has spent a large part of his life working in carnivals, doing his best to put a smile on strangers’ faces. He also dreams of following other passions, but leaving the close-knit carnival world and his best friend, Billy, would be like losing a family. This tension between freedom, roots, kinship and new possibilities touched me — I wanted to capture this world where people never stop dreaming of somewhere else.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/isafrancke/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Isabelle Grignon-Francke</a> is a director and producer based in Quebec.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/op-docs" title="">Op-Docs</a> is a forum for short, opinionated documentaries by independent filmmakers. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/opinion/about-op-docs.html" title="">Learn more</a> about Op-Docs and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/site/editorial/op-video/video.html?ref=opinion" title="">how to submit</a> to the series.</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
