He invited them to take photos in the presidential bedroom on the plane, something a White House staff member had just said was strictly forbidden.</p><p>But the president overruled his aide, according to Sean McGarvey, one of the top union officials present. Mr. Biden snapped some selfies with the group, and even let them lie down on one of the most exclusive parts of the aircraft: his bed.</p><p>Two months after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/politics/biden-drops-out.html" title="">abandoning his bid for a second term</a>, Mr. Biden appears to be liberated by the decision, enjoying his long farewell and soaking up the adoration from supporters, even if it all comes with a painful truth: When people chant, “Thank you, Joe,” they are, at least in part, thanking him for quitting.</p><p>In private and public, Democratic voters are finding ways to say goodbye to a man who has been in public service for the better part of 50 years. They camp out along motorcade routes, hold up homemade signs and crack jokes that betray a hint (or more) of relief.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>One of Mr. Biden’s supporters, who was at the White House recently for Hispanic Heritage Month, said the quiet part out loud after the president expressed regret for never having learned Spanish.</p><p>“You’re going to have time now!” the woman shouted from the audience.</p><p>“I do,” Mr. Biden replied, laughing.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s unusual send-off is a result of some unusual circumstances: He withdrew from the race under pressure from his own party, as concerns mounted about his age and his ability to prevent former President Donald J. Trump from gaining power again. </p><p>Not everyone is praising Mr. Biden on his way out the door. He has come under enormous criticism for his positions on Israel and the border, for example. And Mr. Biden has privately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/biden-2024-election-dropped-out.html" title="">expressed resentment</a>, at times, for the way he was pressured to get out.</p><p>But many Democratic voters have a deep well of affection for the president, whose long career has been defined by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/us/politics/bidens-resiliance-defiance.html" title="">personal tragedy and resilience</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I knew it was time to hang up his coat,” said Stephen Foster, a 38-year-old Amtrak foreman from Delaware who comes from a family of die-hard Biden supporters. His mother, Linda, knew Mr. Biden when he was a camp counselor six decades ago, and his wife once took a class taught by the first lady.</p><p>“He is older, so it’s good he’s made it this far,” Mr. Foster said. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many Democratic voters have a deep well of affection for Mr. Biden, whose long career has been defined by personal tragedy and resilience.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Even some of Mr. Biden’s critics have seemed to soften toward him at times. While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/biden-trump-hat.html" title="">visiting a firehouse in Shanksville, Pa., earlier this month</a>, Mr. Biden encountered a Trump supporter who jokingly asked if the president remembered his own name.</p><p>“I don’t remember my name,” Mr. Biden said. “I’m slow.”</p><p>When Mr. Biden encouraged the man to wear an autographed presidential cap, the man asked the president to wear his Trump hat. Mr. Biden agreed.</p><p>“I’m proud of you now,” the man said, shortly after referring to Mr. Biden as an “old fart.”</p><p>Celebrities who just months earlier had turned on Mr. Biden are now singing his praises.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>George Clooney, the actor and Democratic donor who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html" title="">called for Mr. Biden to drop</a> out in an opinion essay in The New York Times, said during the Venice Film Festival that the president’s decision to step aside was “selfless” and admirable.</p><p>Aaron Sorkin, the playwright and screenwriter, had suggested in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/opinion/biden-west-wing-aaron-sorkin.html" title="">his own opinion essay</a> that Democrats replace Mr. Biden with a Republican. But after the president withdrew, Mr. Sorkin lauded him during an appearance at the White House to celebrate the 25th anniversary of “The West Wing,” known for its idealistic portrayal of politics.</p><p>“I’ve noticed that during times of peak political tension, pundits will warn us not to expect a ‘West Wing’ moment,” Mr. Sorkin said. “They mean not to expect a selfless act of statesmanship. Not to expect anyone to put country first, don’t expect anyone to swing for the fences or reach for the stars. But the fact is, ‘West Wing’ moments do happen.”</p><p>Mr. Biden’s decision to drop out, he said, was proof of that. (The president was not in the audience at the time. Mr. Sorkin appeared with Jill Biden, the first lady.)</p><p>On the day Mr. Biden withdrew from the race, he also found time to say thank you.</p><p>Mr. McGarvey, the president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, said he was surprised to receive a call that day from a White House official connecting him to the president. Mr. Biden, still recovering from Covid, wanted Mr. McGarvey to deliver a message.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I want you to thank everybody,” Mr. Biden said. “Tell your members, tell your leaders thank you for everything they’ve done for Joe Biden.”</p><p>“I gave it my all,” Mr. Biden said. “And then I get Covid.”</p><p>“When it rains, it pours,” Mr. McGarvey said.</p><p>“It sure as hell does,” Mr. Biden replied.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent, covering President Biden and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs">More about Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/jill-biden">Jill Biden</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
