<p>The series started on Ascent, with Paper Rex sticking to their double-Sentinel composition with <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7378/jinggg">
		Jinggg	</a>
</span> on Sage while Heretics ran double-Duelist with <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/21328/wo0t">
		Wo0t	</a>
</span> on Jett. Heretics took A-site fast and forced an uncomfortable retake from PRX to win the first pistol, and continued that aggression to convert the bonus. Both Duelists from Heretics were preventing that traditional PRX playstyle with their own aggro plays. It took until round six for PRX to win their first defense round, and <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9801/f0rsaken">
		f0rsakeN	</a>
</span> helped keep that momentum going the round after. Just as it looked like Paper Rex had recovered, Wo0t showed off just how good he can be on Duelist.</p>


<p><em>Wo0t fries Paper Rex on Jett.</em></p>

<p>Heretics ended the first half up 8-4, a great attack side for Ascent. Yet, Paper Rex won the second pistol off a great call from <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9803/d4v41">
		d4v41	</a>
</span>, starting the second half strong. Heretics prevented the bonus round conversion, but Paper Rex won a 1v2 off of d4v41. Just as it looked like Paper Rex would tie the game, Wo0t and <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/10971/riens">
		RieNs	</a>
</span> converted a thrifty to extend a late lead. That couldn&#39;t prevent the eventual tie, as the map reached 10-10. Heretics took a late lead off a fight in mid, but a f0rsakeN ace tied it 11-11, and a strong post-plant put PRX on map point. PatMen was the closer as he won a 1v1 against <strong>Boo</strong> to close out Ascent 13-11 and put PRX in the driver&#39;s seat heading into map two.</p>

<p>Next up was Bind, with both teams running different variations of double-Duelist. Heretics opted for the newly named mosquito composition with Waylay and Yoru, while Paper Rex ran Raze and Yoru instead. Paper Rex won the first pistol, and a failed clear from RieNs led to a bonus conversion. Heretics needed a round soon, so they converted the next round as a thrifty win, but Paper Rex remained on top thanks to f0rsakeN.</p>


<p><em>f0rsakeN solo holds A-site against Team Heretics.</em></p>

<p>Heretics won some post-plants afterward, but PatMen got four to extend the lead. It did end up much closer than the start of the half showed, with Paper Rex only up 7-5 at the half. Heretics won the pistol to tie the map back up at 7-7 quickly, but d4v41 prevented the bonus conversion to keep PRX on top. Heretics managed another thrifty win, which rebuilt some confidence as they took the lead from Paper Rex late on Bind. Just as it looked like it was another 13-11, Wo0t won a big 1v1 against Jinggg to effectively end the map 13-9 and take the series to Lotus.</p>

<p>Lotus would end it, and both teams needed a better performance than their previous try. Paper Rex continued running their double-Duelist while Team Heretics ran their variation of the double-Sentinel with Chamber and Deadlock. Once again, Wo0t was the star as Heretics won the first pistol, but Paper Rex prevented that bonus round win. Even as the economy evened out, Heretics were winning very clean retakes. After a timeout. The savior for PRX was <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13744/patmen">
		PatMen	</a>
</span>, as they got their first lead up 5-4. As d4v41 got the Operator and started to punish mound aggression from Wo0t, Paper Rex ended the first half up 8-4. Jinggg won the second pistol in a 1v1 versus Wo0t to put even more pressure on Heretics, and converting the bonus was the cherry on top.</p>


<p><em>Paper Rex wins a big bonus to end Lotus against Team Heretics.</em></p>

<p>That extended the lead to 12-4, and Paper Rex wasn&#39;t going to throw away the lead this time. Paper Rex won the map 13-4, the series 2-1, and kept their Champions hopes alive by eliminating Team Heretics. </p>

<p>The best player in the win was f0rsakeN, who ended the series with a 1.22 match rating, 53 kills, 245 ACS, 78% KAST, and 153 ADR on the Controller role.</p>

<p>With this win, Paper Rex will play in the lower semifinals against the victors of the <span data-ref-id="9">
