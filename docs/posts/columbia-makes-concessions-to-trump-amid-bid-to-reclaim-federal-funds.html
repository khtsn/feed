Harvard, Stanford, the University of Michigan and dozens of other schools face federal inquiries and fear similar penalties, and college administrators have said Columbia’s response to the White House’s demands may set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>This week, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-to-pause-175-million-for-university-of-pennsylvania-over-transgender-policy.html" title="">University of Pennsylvania</a> was also explicitly targeted by the Trump administration, which said it would cancel $175 million in federal funding for the university, at least partly because it allowed a transgender woman to participate on a women’s swim team.</p><p>Columbia, facing the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in government grants and contracts, opted to yield to the Trump administration on several of its most substantial demands.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The news of Columbia’s response was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Columbia’s interim president, Katrina A.
