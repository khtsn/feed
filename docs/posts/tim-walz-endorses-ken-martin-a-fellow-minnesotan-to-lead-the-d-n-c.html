Tim Walz of Minnesota, the Democratic Party’s 2024 nominee for vice president, on Thursday endorsed Ken Martin to be the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee.</p><p>Mr. Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota Democrats, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/us/politics/tim-walz-kamala-harris-2024.html" title="">a longtime Walz ally</a> who led the state party during Mr. Walz’s rise from Congress to the State Capitol to the national ticket. Mr. Walz is now the highest-profile Democratic official to endorse Mr. Martin to lead the party.</p><p>“In Minnesota, Ken has built a national model for how to elect Democrats in a competitive state,” Mr. Walz said in a statement provided by Mr. Martin’s campaign. “I have seen Ken’s leadership in action, and it’s exactly what we need from our next D.N.C. chair.”</p><p>Mr. Martin and Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chairman, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/us/politics/dnc-race-ben-wikler-ken-martin.html" title="">the front-runners in a sprawling field of candidates</a>. The election is set to be held on Feb. 1.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Martin has claimed endorsements from more than 100 D.N.C. members, including entire delegations from Missouri, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota and Tennessee.</p><p>Mr. Wikler’s team has not disclosed his whip count, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/02/schumer-wikler-dnc-chair-00196199" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Senator Chuck Schumer</a> of New York, the Senate minority leader, endorsed him.</p><p>On Tuesday evening, the Association of State Democratic Chairs, which Mr. Martin founded and is the president of, declined during a virtual meeting to endorse a candidate in the D.N.C. race. An effort by Mr. Wikler’s allies for the group to make a dual endorsement of Mr. Martin and Mr. Wikler failed.</p><p>Jaime Harrison, the current D.N.C. chairman, is not seeking a second term. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/us/politics/chair-democratic-national-committee.html" title="">Others vying to replace him</a> include <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/martin-omalley-dnc-chair-race.html" title="">Martin O’Malley</a>, a former governor of Maryland and former mayor of Baltimore; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/politics/skoufis-democratic-national-commitee-chair.html" title="">James Skoufis</a>, a New York state senator; Marianne Williamson, the perennial presidential candidate; and Nate Snyder, a former Homeland Security official.</p><p>The party has planned four forums for its candidates for chair, vice chair and other positions.

Trump’s return to the White House. Among the most imminent and high-profile tasks will be setting the rules for the 2028 presidential primary race, including which states vote first.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
