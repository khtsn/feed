Trump chose him to be his running mate over the summer. And Mr. Gaetz, a Florida congressman, inhabited the right-wing fringe, shadowed by allegations of drug use and sex with an underage girl.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Vance, now the vice president-elect, returned with considerably more political capital, but also significant questions about whether it was enough to persuade his erstwhile colleagues to confirm Mr. Gaetz as the nation’s top law enforcement officer.</p><p>The two men, who have campaigned together before, hunkered down for much of the day in the Strom Thurmond Room in the Capitol, an ornate conference room just steps from the Senate floor, as senators streamed in individually and in pairs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At the same time, the allegations against Mr. Gaetz were coming into sharper focus. Federal investigators established <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/matt-gaetz-venmo-payments-sex.html" title="">a trail of payments</a> from Mr. Gaetz to women, including some who testified that Mr. Gaetz hired them for sex, according to a document obtained by The New York Times and a lawyer representing some of the women. He has denied their accounts, and the federal investigation was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-justice-department.html" title="">closed by the Justice Department</a> without any charges against him.</p><p>But behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, Mr. Vance and Mr. Gaetz asked senators to keep an open mind. According to people who met with them, they asked the senators to allow Mr. Gaetz to defend himself and hear his plans for overseeing more than 10,000 attorneys in the world’s largest law firm, known as the U.S. Department of Justice.</p><p>In a social media <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1859253884415332418" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Wednesday, Mr. Vance offered a glimpse of the message he delivered during the meetings, crediting Mr. Trump’s victory with carrying Republicans to the majority in the Senate.</p><p>“He deserves a cabinet that is loyal to the agenda he was elected to implement,” Mr. Vance said.</p><p>How much progress the two men made was unclear.</p><p>“We didn’t get into a lot of details,” Senator Mike Lee of Utah said. “But he expressed confidence that what is before the committee are a series of false accusations.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The meetings focused on Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will be the first stop for Mr. Gaetz once Mr. Trump takes office in January. Most senators said after their meeting that Mr. Gaetz deserved a fair hearing, even while acknowledging there was little discussion about specific allegations.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the top Republican on the judiciary panel, was the first to meet with the pair. He said he told Mr. Vance and Mr. Gaetz that there would be “no rubber stamps and no lynch mob.”</p><p>“Matt is a very, very smart guy,” Mr. Graham told reporters. “These allegations will be dealt with in committee, but he deserves a chance to confront his accusers.”</p><p>Most of the meetings lasted about 45 minutes. One of the quickest discussions was with Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, whose visit lasted for about 20 minutes. He said it was the first time he had met Mr. Gaetz, a combative Floridian known for his fierce loyalty to Mr. Trump and his willingness to agitate fellow Republicans.</p><p>“It’s a beginning,” Mr. Cornyn said about their conversation. “We’re going to do our investigations and our research and give him the opportunity to answer any questions.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri said Mr. Gaetz wanted the chance to show how he would ensure that the Justice Department was not engaged in “politically motivated, partisan activity.”</p><p>Mr. Trump spent much of his presidential campaign complaining, without proof, that the criminal charges he faced were designed to keep him out of the White House while also vowing to seek retribution by targeting his political opponents.</p><p>“We’ve got to remember that a cabinet secretary is not an exercise in individuality,” Mr. Hawley said. “You’re there to serve the president, and he has a sense of what the president wants to do in terms of prioritizing law enforcement.”</p><p>Republican senators have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/matt-gaetz-attorney-general-senate-republicans.html" title="">expressed alarm</a> about the selection of Mr. Gaetz, whose resignation from the House last week effectively ended the yearslong investigation by the House Ethics Committee into the sexual misconduct allegations. On Wednesday, Republicans on the committee blocked the release of a report into those allegations.</p><p>Mr. Trump has remained unequivocal about his selection of Mr. Gaetz and has assigned his running mate the task of shepherding him and other embattled nominees through the initial stages of their confirmation process. That task is not typically carried out by the vice president-elect; usually it is a job for a midlevel official or someone with deep personal relationships on the Hill.</p><p>Mr. Vance will get another chance on Thursday, when he is scheduled to host similar meetings for Pete Hegseth, the Fox News host Mr. Trump has picked for defense secretary. Mr. Hegseth, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is facing allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman, which he has denied.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Nov. 20, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the timing of Pete Hegseth’s visit to Capitol Hill. His appearance was moved to Thursday; he was not there on Wednesday, as previously expected.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Michael C. Bender is a Times political correspondent covering Donald J.
