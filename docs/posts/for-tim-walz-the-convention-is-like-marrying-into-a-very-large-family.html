Tim Walz of Minnesota in person.</p><p>After rising on a comet-like trajectory to become Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, Mr. Walz is finding himself the political equivalent of someone marrying into an extremely large family and meeting all the relatives for the first time.</p><p>“It’s a big family, and a lot of that family’s cousins served with him in the U.S. House of Representatives or worked with him with the Democratic Governors Association,” said Representative Betty McCollum of Minnesota, who is a Walz-knower of two decades and has been <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/07/19/congresswoman-mccollum-urges-biden-to-bow-out-of-presidential-race" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">something of a proselytizer for him</a>. “They kind of know somebody who knows somebody who knows Tim. It’s like you’ve been invited to the wedding and you’re the family member of the vice-presidential candidate.”</p><p>Picture an aunt or a distant cousin squealing with delight at their first opportunity to hug and pinch the cheek of their new family member. That is essentially what Mr. Walz is going through after he spent the first days of the convention scurrying from one delegation or caucus meeting to another.</p></div></div><div><div><p>At a Hispanic Caucus meeting on Monday, he dived right into his remarks as if he were an old friend. He did not acknowledge the newness of the relationship. To the L.G.B.T.Q. caucus, Mr. Walz began with a review of his recent visits to gas stations in western Pennsylvania before controversially declaring that the ones in the Midwest were superior.</p><p>“Wisconsin folks and Minnesotans know <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/19/tim-walz-declares-himself-kwik-trip-guy-in-talk-with-dnc-delegation/74856266007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it’s all about Kwik Trip</a>,” he said.</p><p>Travis Nelson, a state legislator from Oregon, said he had not known much about Mr. Walz before Ms. Harris began her vice-presidential search and had never seen him give a speech until he joined her ticket. Mr. Nelson said he saw Mr. Walz speak for the first time at the party’s caucus gathering, then came back to see him again at the L.G.B.T.Q. caucus meeting.</p><p>“The only person who got the same kind of reception was Maxine Waters,” the veteran California congresswoman who addressed the Black caucus, Mr. Nelson said. “He is the kind of person that you like from a distance, but then you meet him in person and you like him even more.”</p><p>The universal assessment of Mr. Walz from longtime friends and political allies is that he is precisely what he appears to be on television.</p><p>Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who served with him in the House, called him “a walking, talking political antidepressant.” Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota was one of several Democrats interviewed who called him “a happy warrior.” Al Franken, the former Minnesota senator, who helped raise money for Mr. Walz’s first House race, said he had “the basic humility of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/democrats-midwest-appeal.html" title="">well-adjusted people from the Midwest</a>.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Democratic delegates said Mr. Walz just looked like a regular guy they would like to meet.</p><p>“I love him. He reminds me of Chris Farley — you know, the man down by the river,” said Mary Alice Palacios, a fourth-time delegate from Edinburg, Texas, referring to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb6Zk6KueZA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the memorable “Saturday Night Live” gag</a> by Farley, the Wisconsin-born comedian.</p><p>The comparison may stop at Mr. Walz’s accent, which is not that far from Farley’s. But unlike the comedian’s character, Matt Foley, Mr. Walz has long played a role as a conciliator.</p><p>During the 2020 presidential primary race, when Ms. Klobuchar — for whom Mr. Walz served as a campaign co-chairman — was sparring on and off the debate stages with Pete Buttigieg, Mr. Walz called one of Mr. Buttigieg’s top supporters and tried to make peace.</p><p>“He called at the height of the Democratic primary to keep relations up,” said Jon Soltz, a co-founder of VoteVets, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-votevets-endorsement.html" title="">Democratic veterans group that backed Mr. Buttigieg</a>. “It was the height of Iowa and New Hampshire and here’s a guy, he’s saying, ‘We’re all friends here.’”</p><p>In interviews, many Democrats said they were excited to greet Mr. Walz for the first time. One senator was so embarrassed about having no recollection of meeting Mr. Walz — even though he thought he had probably been in a room with him before — that he declined to be identified as saying so. The senator said he hoped to give Mr. Walz a hug at some point during convention festivities at the United Center.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Even delegates who had roughly followed Mr. Walz’s career and declared themselves big fans said they had never heard Mr. Walz speak before he popped up on cable television <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/arts/tim-walz-trump-weird.html" title="">calling former President Donald J. Trump and Senator JD Vance of Ohio “weird”</a> after Mr. Biden ended his campaign.</p><p>“He was a bit of an unknown because most of us had not heard him speak or seen him in person,” said Pete Zeigler, an election administrator from Akron, Ohio, who had followed Mr. Walz’s congressional career and knew he was governor of Minnesota.</p><p>Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, however, something of a patriarch for Democrats in Washington, said Mr. Walz was no stranger.</p><p><em>“</em>I knew him decently well,” Mr. Schumer said on the convention floor on Monday night after leading the New York delegation in various cheers. “You know, he has a combination of that Midwestern avuncularness and toughness. It’s a great combination<em>.”</em></p><p>Jazmine Ulloa<!-- --> contributed reporting from Chicago.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
