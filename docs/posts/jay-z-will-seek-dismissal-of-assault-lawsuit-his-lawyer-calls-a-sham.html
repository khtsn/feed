Mr. Carter strongly denied the allegation.</p><p>NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jay-z-rape-accuser-comes-forward-nbc-news-acknowledges-inconsistencies-rcna183435" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published an interview</a> with the accuser on Friday evening in which she acknowledged inconsistencies in her account, but maintained that her allegation of assault was true.</p><p>The woman’s lawsuit claimed that after the encounter she was picked up by her father, whom she called from a gas station. But NBC reported that her father, who would have had to drive hours from his home in upstate New York to pick up his daughter following the after-party, did not recall having done so. The father was also unnamed in the report.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The plaintiff, who now lives in Alabama, also told NBC that she had spoken to the musician Benji Madden, a member of the band Good Charlotte, at the party after the awards that night. But Mr. Madden, who was not accused of any wrongdoing in her suit, was on tour in the Midwest at the time.</p><p>Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Mr. Carter, wrote a letter Friday night to U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres saying that Mr. Carter intends to file a motion to strike the complaint, citing the NBC report. “The interview outs plaintiff’s allegations for what they are: a sham,” he wrote in the letter.</p><p>And on Monday, Mr. Spiro spoke to reporters at the Manhattan offices of Roc Nation, Mr. Carter’s entertainment empire. He provided a timeline of the night in question that he said undercut the plaintiff’s account and displayed a photo that he said showed Mr. Carter at a nightclub after the Video Music Awards, not a private residence.</p><p>“The story doesn’t work,” he said. “It doesn’t check out.”</p><p>Tony Buzbee, the lawyer for the woman who sued, wrote in an email that his client remained “adamant” about her claim even as she acknowledged that she may have been mistaken about which celebrity she encountered at the party that night. “We are talking about events from 20 years ago,” he said in an email. He said that he did not think the photograph of Mr. Carter at a nightclub “proves or disproves anything.”</p><p>“Courts exist to resolve factual disputes,” he said. “I don’t think it’s appropriate to do so in a news article.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When the plaintiff initially filed the suit in October, Mr. Combs was the main defendant and Mr. Carter was referred to only as “celebrity A.” Mr. Combs, who is facing federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges and more than 30 civil suits, has denied sexually assaulting anyone.</p><p>Mr. Buzbee, a Houston lawyer, then amended the claim to add Mr. Carter, one of the most prominent music industry figures in the country, prompting a multifaceted legal dispute.</p><p>Before Mr. Buzbee filed the amended claim naming Mr. Carter, his firm wrote Mr. Carter a letter seeking to discuss the plaintiff’s claims. Mr. Carter’s lawyers then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/arts/music/jay-z-diddy-lawsuit-buzbee.html" title="">filed a lawsuit</a> — as an anonymous plaintiff — accusing Mr. Buzbee of seeking to extort a financial settlement over false claims.</p><p>Then, Mr. Buzbee’s firm filed a petition in Texas asking a judge to prevent the law firm representing Mr. Carter, Quinn Emanuel, from contacting his employees and their relatives, accusing the firm of harassment. The judge denied the request.</p><p>Each side has defended its practices as typical legal procedure.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Spiro — a well-known lawyer whose celebrity clients have included Elon Musk, Alec Baldwin and Mayor Eric Adams of New York — spoke to the press in an effort to discredit the plaintiff.</p><p>In seeking to get the claim thrown out, Mr. Spiro, in his letter to the judge, accused Mr. Buzbee of violating a federal rule requiring a lawyer to “conduct a reasonable inquiry” into the facts of their client’s claim before signing their name onto a case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Buzbee, in an email, defended his firm’s handling of its client’s claim, saying that while the case was referred by another law practice, at least three lawyers from his firm interviewed her before filing the amended complaint. He said a background check was run on her, an investigator was engaged to vet some of the details in her claim and she signed two affidavits related to her account.</p><p>“Our conduct has been beyond reproach and will continue to be,” Mr. Buzbee said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
