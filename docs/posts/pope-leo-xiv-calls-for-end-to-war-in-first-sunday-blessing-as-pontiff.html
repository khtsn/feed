Leo’s appeal was addressed to the world’s most powerful leaders, and he noted that it had been almost 80 years to the day since the “immense tragedy” of World War II had ended. He quoted Pope Francis, his predecessor, who often referred to the current global wave of violence as “a third world war in pieces.”</p><p>Leo was elected pope on Thursday, becoming the first American pontiff on the second day of the conclave. Since then, he has had a busy calendar, with Vatican observers watching closely for clues on how he plans to lead.</p><p>On Friday, with the cardinals who had elected him the previous day, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/pope-leo-mass-catholic-church.html" title="">celebrated his first Mass</a> in the Sistine Chapel as pope. In his homily, he pledged to align himself with “ordinary people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The pope met with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/world/europe/leo-xiv-pope-francis-catholic-church.html" title="">cardinals again on Saturday,</a> saying he would continue the work of Francis in steering the church toward greater collegiality and a focus on caring for marginalized people.</p><p>On Sunday, he continued to echo themes that Francis spoke about regularly in his Sunday addresses, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.</p><p>The pope called for an “authentic, just and lasting peace” in Ukraine and the freeing of all prisoners in that war. He added that children should be returned to their families. Although he did not specify which children, many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-children-russia-war.html" title="">Ukrainian children have been taken to Russia</a> during the war against the wishes of their families.</p><p>Leo also made a plea for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and for humanitarian aid to be allowed to be distributed “to the exhausted civilian population” in the territory, as well as the return of the hostages taken in the Hamas assault on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Thousands gathered in St. Peter’s Square to hear Pope Leo’s first Sunday address as pontiff.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marko Djurica/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Sunday also marked the World Day of Prayer for Vocations, he noted. Leo said he was praying, along with the faithful, that more Catholics would take up callings to the priesthood and religious orders. “The Church has such a great need for them!” he said, at a time when the number of people joining the priesthood and religious orders <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2025-03/pontifical-yearbook-2025-priests-religious-statistics.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been declining</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“And to young people I say, do not be afraid,” accept the call of the church, he said, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/homilies/1978/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19781022_inizio-pontificato.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">citing the words</a> that Pope John Paul II said at his official inaugural Mass as pontiff in 1978.

In one passage, he urged clerics to listen. “Listen to the word of God, then listen to others, know how to build bridges, know how to listen in order not to judge, not to close doors thinking that we have all the truth and no one can tell us anything.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Some 100,000 people filled the square and the avenue leading to it, according to the Vatican. Next Sunday, St. Peter’s is expected to fill with the faithful once again for his official inaugural Mass.</p><p>Leo takes over the church at an especially busy time, as 2025 is a Jubilee Year, when Catholics seek penance and forgiveness of sins. Jubilee Years occur every quarter century, and millions of visitors are likely to visit Rome for dozens of events.</p><p>Marching bands crisscrossed the square on Sunday, as this weekend was the Jubilee of Bands. Leo greeted “these pilgrims with affection,” thanking them for enlivening the morning with their music and performances.</p><p>“Viva il Papa,” or “Long live the pope,” people cheered when he finished his address. </p><p>The Vatican said that Leo and several Vatican officials then went to the Apostolic Palace, where officials had sealed Francis’ apartment when he died. On Sunday, the seals were removed.</p><p>Leo has not said where he will live, but Francis broke with a longstanding tradition and resided in a Vatican guesthouse rather than in the palace.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Candice Dias, from California, was in the square Sunday to hear Leo’s blessing. “He seems to be very down to earth,” she said before he spoke.</p><p>Tim Salaba, 62, a retired engineer from Lonsdale, Minn., who was also there, said he had been surprised by the cardinals’ choice. “Like most people, we thought the odds of an American pope were very low,” he said. “I hope in time he will be referred to less as the American pope and just as the pope.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a Times reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
