Mr. Gallant, a popular and experienced former general, was pushing for a cease-fire deal in Gaza that would secure the release of hostages held there. His firing removed the main proponent in the Israeli government for such an agreement.</p><p>But it quickly prompted accusations that Mr. Netanyahu was prioritizing personal goals over national ones by trying to appease the right wing of his coalition. Centrist columnists described it as an attack on democracy, and protesters blocked traffic and lit bonfires on a major Tel Aviv highway overnight.</p><p>Yair Lapid, a rival of Mr. Netanyahu, told a news conference on Wednesday that Gallant’s firing was “not normal.”</p><p>“There is no one left in the government,” he added. “The prime minister cannot be trusted, the cabinet cannot be trusted, the last person who could be trusted in this crazy government was fired yesterday.”</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu opted to replace Mr. Gallant with <a href="#israel-katz-defense-minister" title="">Israel Katz</a> — a staunch ally who was serving as foreign minister and is viewed as unlikely to criticize or push back against his hard-line approach to cease-fire discussions. Unlike Mr. Gallant, a popular and experienced former general, Mr. Katz has never held a top military position.</p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>U.S. election:</strong> Israel’s right-wing government <a href="#trump-israel-netanyahu" title="">celebrated Donald J. Trump’s victory</a> effusively. Even before the race was officially called, Mr. Netanyahu spoke of “true friendship” in congratulating Mr. Trump on a <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1854070348926328965" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“huge victory.”</a> The results of the U.S. election could have major implications on the American approach to the war in the Middle East. Mr. Gallant had maintained close contact with senior U.S. officials, who often chose to communicate with him instead of Mr. Netanyahu.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hezbollah rockets:</strong> Air-raid sirens sounded across central Israel on Wednesday morning, including in Tel Aviv for the first time in about a week. Israel’s military said that “approximately 10 projectiles” had been launched into Israel from Lebanon, and that some were intercepted. The barrage came 40 days after the death of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike. The date holds symbolic weight in Islam, where 40 days mark the end of the formal grieving period.</p></li><li><p><strong>Syria strikes:</strong> As Israel expands its war efforts in the Middle East, it appears to be intensifying its focus on Syria. The Israeli military announced on Tuesday that it had <a href="#israel-syria-west-bank" title="">struck targets in Syria</a> for the second day in a row, attacks it said were aimed at cutting off the flow of weapons and intelligence between Hezbollah, the armed Lebanese group, and its sponsor, Iran. The announcement was the third time in a week that Israel made the rare admission of attacking inside Syria.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RjN2UzZTcwLTA2OTAtNWZhMi04YTU3LTVhMGI0NDIyMDU0MQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/06/world/israel-gaza-iran-lebanon#an-act-of-madness-israeli-news-commentators-condemn-gallants-firing" data-source-id="100000009810921"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aryn-baker"><img alt="Aryn Baker" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-06T12:29:24.479Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 6, 2024, 7:29 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters took to the streets of Jerusalem on Tuesday night after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed his popular defense minister, Yoav Gallant.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Before the results of the U.S. presidential elections swept news sites on Wednesday morning, the headlines in Israel were dominated by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to fire the country’s defense minister.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/netanyahu-fires-gallant.html" title="">dismissal of the popular defense minister</a>, Yoav Gallant, on Tuesday night comes as Israel’s military is fighting on several fronts, and many news outlets emphasized the danger of the moment in their coverage.</p><div><p>“Netanyahu Fires Defense Minister Gallant at the Peak of a Regional War,” read the top headline on the left-leaning news outlet Haaretz’s English site, followed by a damning analysis with the headline: “Netanyahu Is a Clear and Present Danger to Israel. Now Its Defense Chiefs Face a Dire Dilemma.”</p><p>The Hebrew-language daily Maariv documented an “Outpouring of Anger” after tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Israel overnight and blocked traffic in Tel Aviv for hours.</p><p>Channel 13 News called it “An Act of Madness,” quoting Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid.</p><p>In the Times of Israel newspaper, co-founder David Horovitz declared that “<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahus-firing-of-gallant-mid-war-is-reckless-divisive-and-dangerous-to-israel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Netanyahu’s firing of Gallant mid-war is reckless, divisive and dangerous to Israel</a>.</p><p>The conservative Israel Hayom, a widely distributed free Hebrew-language paper, disparaged the dismissal and echoed accusations from Israeli opposition leaders that it was a political move designed to secure Mr. Netanyahu’s standing with religious conservatives.</p><p>“Last night, it became official: Israel is being led by a prime minister who is a danger to state security,” columnist Yoav Limor wrote, calling the move “a stinging slap in the face to everyone who has paid the price of this terrible war.”</p><p>“They now know more than ever before that it is not the country’s security that guides the man who sends them into the battlefield, but personal and political whims,” he said.</p><p>The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth carried the headline “Gallant’s Dismissal was Carried Out for the Sake of Haredi Parties” — a reference to political pressure from ultra-Orthodox groups to scuttle a bill that challenges their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/world/middleeast/ultra-orthodox-jews-israel-court-ruling-explained.html" title="">exemption from military service</a>. Columnist Sima Kadmon likened Mr. Gallant’s dismissal to “a drone attack on the heart of the nation.”</p><p>“Is there a single sane person left who doesn’t understand what is happening here?&#34; she wrote. “A segment of society that doesn’t serve, that shares no role in the war effort, a segment of society that shirks its responsibility and which is suffocating the reservists and their families to look out for itself—decided yesterday who would be at the helm of our military.”</p><p>Another columnist, Nahum Barnea, was more succinct.</p><p>“As of this morning you are living in a former democracy,” he wrote in the same news outlet.</p><p>“There are some democracies that die overnight, in a blood bath,” he added. “Our democracy has died slowly, gradually, softly.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNTFhODFhOGYtYWY4MC01YmViLTljZGItZDhhZjljNTkzMjRi"><div id="51a81a8f-af80-5beb-9cdb-d8af9c59324b" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/06/world/israel-gaza-iran-lebanon#51a81a8f-af80-5beb-9cdb-d8af9c59324b"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nader-ibrahim"><img alt="Nader Ibrahim" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/11/11/reader-center/author-nader-ibrahim/author-nader-ibrahim-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/11/11/reader-center/author-nader-ibrahim/author-nader-ibrahim-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/11/11/reader-center/author-nader-ibrahim/author-nader-ibrahim-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-06T11:47:32.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 6, 2024, 6:47 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Ramy Nasr, 44, a displaced former trader in Gaza City, said that it doesn’t matter to him who the next U.S. president is.

Trump’s victory on Wednesday morning as if it had just won the American election itself.</p><p>“Dear Donald and Melania Trump, Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback!” Israel&#39;s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1854070348926328965" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on a social media</a> soon after Mr. Trump’s victory speech.</p><div><p>“Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!” the Israeli leader enthused, signing off, “In true friendship, yours, Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu.”</p><p>Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s ultranationalist minister of national security, posted a festive “Yesssss” on social media, along with emojis of a flexed bicep and the Israeli and American flags, even before the last polls had closed in Alaska.</p><p>An <a href="https://en.idi.org.il/articles/56992" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overwhelming majority</a> of Jewish Israelis view Mr. Trump as a better option for Israel’s interests than Vice President Kamala Harris. They assume that he will go easier on Israel than the Biden administration, which has widely supported Israel’s war effort in Gaza over the past year but has also criticized the humanitarian aspects of it, including the high civilian death toll.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu may now feel emboldened by the prospect of a more amenable U.S. president as he continues to insist on total victory in Israel’s wars and engages in a high-wire exchange of blows with its archenemy, Iran.</p><p>In a sign of lesser restraint, Mr. Netanyahu on Tuesday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/netanyahu-fires-gallant.html" title="">fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant</a>, a main point man with the Biden administration, against a background of differences over ending the war in Gaza and over pressing domestic issues that were threatening the stability of Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition.</p><p>Mr. Trump has, like the Biden administration, called for Israel to wrap up the wars in Gaza and Lebanon that were set off by the Hamas-led terrorist attack against Israel 13 months ago, but analysts say that a Trump administration would probably support ending them on terms more favorable to Israel.</p><p>That sentiment is largely based on Mr. Trump’s first term, when he bestowed political gifts on Mr. Netanyahu’s previous government, including moving the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.</p><p>But analysts also note that the policies of the next Trump administration are unknown, and that Mr. Trump is notoriously unpredictable.</p><p>“I think Netanyahu prefers the unpredictability of Trump over Harris,” said Kobi Michael, a fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, a conservative-leaning Jerusalem-based research group. “But there’s a degree of wishful thinking,” he said, “because Trump can easily turn on us in seconds.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s relationship with Mr. Netanyahu has become more complicated. Last year, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-netanyahu-let-us-down-before-the-2020-airstrike-that-killed-iranian-gen-soleimani" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly accused</a> the Israeli prime minister of having let the United States down by pulling out of an operation to kill <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/03/world/middleeast/who-is-qassim-suleimani.html" title="">Gen.

href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/netanyahu-fires-gallant.html" title="">dismissing Israel’s defense minister,</a> a move analysts said would make it easier for him to set Israel’s wartime trajectory but that also comes with risks.</p><p>Yoav Gallant, the departing defense minister, had broken with Mr. Netanyahu by pressing for a cease-fire with Hamas, saying it was the only way to free dozens of Israeli hostages held by the group in Gaza. On the domestic front, Mr. Gallant had pushed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/18/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas" title="">scrap an exemption from military service</a> for ultra-Orthodox Jews, a measure that risked collapsing Mr. Netanyahu’s government because it angered its ultra-Orthodox members.</p><div><p>“Netanyahu saw Gallant as the opposition within his own coalition,” said Nadav Shtrauchler, a political analyst and former strategist for Mr. Netanyahu. “Now, it will be easier for him to go in his own direction, not just politically, but militarily and strategically.”</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu swiftly denied that he would use Mr. Gallant’s departure to fire other senior members of the security establishment. Still, commentators speculated that by replacing Mr. Gallant with Israel Katz, who is expected to be a more pliant defense minister, it would be easier for Mr. Netanyahu to remove the military chief of staff, Herzi Halevi.</p><p>But in firing the defense minister, Mr. Netanyahu has drawn accusations that he is prioritizing personal goals over national ones to appease far-right members of his coalition. And it suggested that he will double down on policies that are either deeply unpopular, in the case of the exemption for the ultra-Orthodox, or at least polarizing — like his refusal to compromise in the cease-fire negotiations with Hamas.</p><p>In a signal of the widespread discontent over Mr. Netanyahu’s decision, centrist columnists described it as an attack on democracy, while tens of thousands of protesters spilled into the streets in Israel on Tuesday night, blocking a major highway.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu is “evidently calculating that it will only be a short term firestorm and he will then be left in a better position,” said Michael Koplow, an analyst at the Israel Policy Forum, a New York-based research group.</p><p>But his support for the policies opposed by Mr. Gallant “will cost him in the long term,” Mr. Koplow said. “So even if his short term calculation is correct, he may turn out to be penny wise and pound foolish.”</p><p>On issues that matter most to Israel’s critics, like the conduct of Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon, Mr. Gallant was fairly aligned with Mr. Netanyahu.</p><p>Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought arrest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/world/middleeast/icc-hamas-netanyahu.html" title="">warrants for both men</a> in relation to the Gaza offensive. It was Mr. Gallant who played a bigger day-to-day role in managing a campaign against Hamas that has killed tens of thousands of Gazans and damaged most of its buildings. Mr. Gallant was also one of the first ministers to push for the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, months before the government signed off on his assassination.</p><p>But within Israel, Mr. Gallant was seen as a thorn in Mr. Netanyahu’s side.</p><p>His <a href="#netanyahu-gallant-israel" title="">public disputes with Mr. Netanyahu</a> began several months before the war began, when in March 2023 he spoke out against the prime minister’s efforts to overhaul the judicial system. Mr. Netanyahu fired him days later, only to rescind his dismissal after mass protests swept the country.</p><p>During the war, Mr. Gallant had spoken publicly about Palestinian governance in postwar Gaza, an idea that Mr. Netanyahu had avoided discussing in detail for fear of angering far-right allies who seek to settle Jewish civilians in the territory.</p><p>And Mr. Gallant had developed a strong and independent relationship with the Biden administration, irking Mr. Netanyahu, whose relationship with President Biden has become fractious even as the president continues to arm and fund Israel’s military.</p><p>Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> and <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzU3NzdhODU2LTg2NTYtNWQxYS05ZjdkLTQ0MGQzMGI0MjA3OA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/06/world/israel-gaza-iran-lebanon#israel-yoav-gallant" data-source-id="100000009808788"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eve-sampson"><img alt="Eve Sampson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-06T00:22:04.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 5, 2024, 7:22 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yoav Gallant at Israel’s Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, after being fired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nir Elias/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/netanyahu-fires-gallant.html" title="">fired Yoav Gallant</a>, his powerful and popular defense minister, on Tuesday, after the two clashed over the course of Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu announced his decision in a video statement published by his office, saying that “significant gaps on handling the battle” had created a wedge between him and Mr. Gallant. “In recent months, that trust between the defense minister and I was damaged,” the prime minister said.</p><div><p>Here’s more background on the ousted defense minister.</p><h2 id="link-31b1310">A history of clashes</h2><p>After the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and led to the abduction of 250 others, Mr. Gallant emerged as the most high-level dissident to Mr. Netanyahu within his own government.</p><p>The ousted defense minister, who was a moderate voice on security issues, had been viewed as an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/middleeast/gantz-quits-israel-netanyahu.html" title="">internal</a> roadblock to Mr. Netanyahu’s approach to cease-fire talks. Mr. Gallant repeatedly broke with Mr. Netanyahu and urged him to reach a deal to free the remaining hostages in Gaza.</p><p>In August, the defense minister <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/middleeast/netanyahu-gallant-gaza-total-victory.html" title="">questioned</a> the Israeli leader’s goal of “total victory” over Hamas in Gaza, calling it “nonsense.”</p><p>The defense minister also suggested that Mr. Netanyahu was letting Israel slide toward long-term military rule in Gaza — a choice that Mr. Gallant said would be disastrous.</p><p>Mr. Katz, an ally of the prime minister, is unlikely to stand in the way of Mr. Netanyahu’s approach to cease-fire talks, which critics say have undermined the possibility of a deal.</p><p>Even before the war in Gaza, Mr. Gallant had repeatedly clashed with Mr. Netanyahu over the prime minister’s hotly contested plans to weaken the country’s judicial system.</p><p>Amid widespread street protests, in March 2023, after Mr. Gallant gave a speech warning that the proposals were tearing the country apart, Mr. Netanyahu sought to fire him.</p><p>That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/10/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gallant.html" title="">attempted dismissal</a> roiled the country further, prompting mass protests and a general strike. Mr. Netanyahu ultimately backed down and walked back his decision to oust Mr. Gallant.</p><h2 id="link-1e4dd3bc">Political and family background</h2><p>Before entering politics, Mr. Gallant, 65, served as a senior general who led the Israeli military’s southern command, which oversees Gaza. In 2010, he was tapped to potentially serve as the military’s chief of staff, but the appointment never came to pass.</p><p>Mr. Gallant joined the Israel Defense Forces in 1974 and served in a commando unit before holding various leadership roles over a 35-year military career.</p><p>After leaving the military, Mr. Gallant entered politics, first with a centrist party before switching over to Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud faction.

Mr. Gallant approved initial conscription orders for thousands of ultra-Orthodox men.</p><p>The ultra-Orthodox exemption has long polarized Israeli society, where most Jewish 18-year-olds, men and women, are conscripted for years of obligatory service. Many ultra-Orthodox view sending their children to the Israeli military as unacceptable, fearing they might be swayed by secularism or looser interpretations of religious practice.</p><p>As the ultra-Orthodox population has grown to over one million — more than 13 percent of the country — other Jewish Israelis have become increasingly frustrated and resentful of its military exemption. They say it is fundamentally unfair and untenable, especially as Israel is fighting wars on multiple fronts.</p><p>Political analysts said that the government’s internal struggle over conscription also threatened the stability of Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition, which depends on the support of two ultra-Orthodox parties that support the exemption.</p><p>Yesterday, Mr. Gallant approved the conscription of an additional 7,000 ultra-Orthodox men, adding new fuel to the dispute.</p><h2 id="link-51001070">‘Total victory’ over Hamas</h2><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s office publicly slammed Mr. Gallant in August after Israeli news media reported that the defense minister had disparaged the prime minister’s goal of achieving a “total victory” over Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>Mr. Gallant reportedly told lawmakers in a private security briefing that the idea was “nonsense.”</p><p>“When Gallant adopts the anti-Israel narrative, he harms the chances of reaching a hostage-release deal,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement. Victory over Hamas and the release of hostages, the statement said, is the “clear directive of Prime Minister Netanyahu and the cabinet, and it obligates everyone — including Gallant.”</p><p>In his video statement on Tuesday about dismissing Mr. Gallant, Mr. Netanyahu began by saying that his primary obligation as prime minister was to ensure Israel’s security and lead the country to “total victory,” and he again accused Mr. Gallant of playing into narratives that undermine Israel’s interests.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yoav Gallant salutes at the end of a news conference after he was fired as Israel’s defense minister by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Tel Aviv on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nir Elias/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-5f299810">Postwar reckonings, for Gaza and Israel</h2><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-idf-war.html" title="">rift with the defense minister</a> was evident in May when Mr. Gallant, in a televised address, criticized Mr. Netanyahu’s lack of vision for a postwar Gaza.</p><p>This failure, Mr. Gallant said, was driving Israel toward two possible outcomes, both unappealing: Either Israeli would occupy Gaza militarily, or Hamas would return to power, undermining Israel’s military gains. “We will pay in blood and many victims, for no purpose, as well as a heavy economic price,” Mr. Gallant said.</p><p>The defense minister also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/19/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas-rafah/netanyahu-may-face-little-risk-from-a-rivals-political-ultimatum-analysts-say?smid=url-share" title="">implicitly accused Mr. Netanyahu</a> of putting his own political survival above national interests.</p><p>In addition, Mr. Gallant and other Israeli officials have called for an investigation into the security failures that led to the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that ignited the current conflicts. More than a year into the war, there has been no such reckoning, which could lay blame at the feet of both the prime minister and the defense minister.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has said that an investigation should wait until after the war. Mr. Gallant said on Tuesday after his dismissal that “only sunlight, and an investigation of the truth, would allow us to draw lessons and build our forces to face the challenges of the future.”</p><h2 id="link-1597a731">Israel’s judicial overhaul</h2><p>In early 2023, Mr. Netanyahu announced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/30/world/middleeast/israel-yoav-gallant-netanyahu.html" title="">he had fired Mr. Gallant</a> — and then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/10/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gallant.html" title="">reversed his decision</a> 15 days later — during a contentious clash within Israel over Mr. Netanyahu’s proposed overhaul of the judicial system to limit the power of Israel’s Supreme Court</p><p>With many military reservists vowing not to serve if the overhaul was enacted, Mr. Gallant criticized the plan and said it threatened military readiness. His dismissal spurred nationwide protests and intensified an already dramatic domestic crisis — one of the gravest in Israeli history, which many in Israel have come to believe helped to embolden Hamas to execute the Oct. 7 attacks.</p><p>The episode cemented Mr. Gallant’s reputation among some Israelis as a bulwark against the most extreme far-right elements of Mr. Netanyahu’s government, and the defense minister seemed to embrace that image throughout the war.</p><p>Announcing the decision last year to keep Mr. Gallant in his cabinet, after all, Mr. Netanyahu said: “There were disagreements between us, even serious disagreements on some issues, but I decided to leave the disagreements behind us.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People sift through the ruins of a building destroyed by Israeli bombardment, in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzYxNWFhOGI4LWI0MzQtNWI5Mi1iNTdmLTcyOTcwYjEyZmFkMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/06/world/israel-gaza-iran-lebanon#israel-katz-defense-minister" data-source-id="100000009807919"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eve-sampson"><img alt="Eve Sampson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-05T22:44:11.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 5, 2024, 5:44 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israel Katz addressing the United Nations General Assembly in 2019, during an earlier stint as Israel’s foreign minister.

Both militant groups are backed by Iran, a country which attacked and was attacked by Israel during his time as the country’s top diplomat.</p><p>After Israel barred the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, from the country last month for failing to strenuously condemn an Iranian missile attack, one of the largest such barrages in history, Mr. Katz <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/israel-guterres-un-ban-persona-non-grata.html?searchResultPosition=6" title="">criticized</a> him. In a statement, Mr. Katz said of the secretary general “anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran’s heinous attack on Israel, as nearly all the countries of the world have done, does not deserve to set foot on Israeli soil.”</p><p>Mr. Katz previously served as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/31/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news?searchResultPosition=4#israel-names-a-new-foreign-minister-part-of-a-prewar-political-agreement" title="">foreign minister</a> from 2019-2020 before being reappointed in early 2024 as part of a political agreement implemented before the country’s war against Hamas. He is a former member of the Israeli Parliament and has worked in other government positions such as minister of finance, transportation, energy and agriculture.</p><p>He has never held a top military position, unlike the popular Mr. Gallant, an experienced former general.</p><p>After former President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017, Mr. Katz, then serving as a minister of transportation and intelligence, petitioned to name a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/world/middleeast/israeli-yisrael-katz-trump-station.html?searchResultPosition=7" title="">train station</a> after the American leader, “for his courageous and historic decision.” </p><p>Like the prime minister, Mr. Katz is a decades-long member of the Likud party and a supporter of the settlement movement.</p><p>Before firing Mr. Gallant on Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu had clashed with him both over the conduct of the war and domestic issues.</p><p>The two disagreed over proposals for the future administration of Gaza and the cease-fire talks.

The Israeli military raided Palestinian villages in the northern part of the West Bank early Tuesday, setting off clashes with militants. Four Palestinians were killed, according to Palestinian health authorities.</p><p>It was not clear whether the dead included militants or civilians and Palestinian authorities do not differentiate in their death tolls.

He described a chaotic scene, with military vehicles moving along the main north-south highway and sounds of gunfire in the distance.</p><p>“We’ve become used to this situation,” he said. “But every time it happens, it upends our lives. Workplaces and schools shut down.”</p><p>During a funeral procession held in Tamoun, one of the Palestinians killed on Tuesday had been wrapped in an Islamic Jihad flag. Palestinian militant groups often drape their fallen members in flags bearing their emblems. They also will occasionally claim unaffiliated people as being among their ranks.</p><p>The raids in the West Bank suggested that Israel’s military was continuing to target armed fighters in the northern part of the territory even as it conducts major operations in Gaza and Lebanon and braces for the possibility of a wider conflict with Iran.</p><p>In northern Gaza, a deadly strike hit the town of Beit Lahia overnight, Zaher al-Waheidi, an official at the health ministry in Gaza, said on Tuesday. Israel launched a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/world/europe/northern-gaza-evacuation-risks.html" title="">wide-scale operation in northern Gaza</a> in October, targeting what it says is a resurgence of Hamas in the area.</p><p>The Israeli military said it struck a weapons storage facility where a militant was operating. It said it had sought to reduce the risk to civilians before the strike, without explaining what measures it had taken.</p><p>Video from the scene obtained by Reuters showed people digging through rubble around a half-collapsed building in Beit Lahia, indicating it was caused by a recent strike.</p><p>The New York Times independently verified that the scene in the Reuters video matched other imagery captured by professional photographers on Tuesday morning. Walls and concrete beams had collapsed, and a sofa appeared half buried amid the debris. In a clearing surrounded by heavily damaged buildings, four white plastic shrouds could be seen being buried at a makeshift grave.</p><p>Here’s what else is happening in the Middle East:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Defense minister dismissal: </strong>Mr. Netanyahu <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/netanyahu-fires-gallant.html" title="">fired his defense minister</a>, Yoav Gallant, on Tuesday over differences on the prosecution of the war in Gaza and over domestic political issues. Mr. Gallant was pushing for a cease-fire deal in Gaza to secure the release of hostages, and his dismissal removes the main proponent in the government for such an agreement. The two men had also clashed over the conscription of ultra-Orthodox Israelis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza evacuations</strong>: The World Health Organization is preparing to evacuate an expected 113 critically injured and sick Palestinians from Gaza on Wednesday in what would be one of the biggest such operations in months, according to Rik Peeperkorn, the organization’s representative for the Palestinian territories.</p></li><li><p><strong>Polio vaccines</strong>: The Gaza Health Ministry and U.N. aid agencies extended an emergency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-vaccine.html" title="">polio vaccination campaign</a> in northern Gaza by an additional day, aiming to increase vaccination coverage among children under 10.
