It’s a “work resort,” meaning that its office space designs have taken a page from boutique hotels.</p><p>The complex is a 6.4-acre town square steps from the Menlo Park Caltrain station in San Francisco’s Bay Area. It includes two premium office buildings, nine restaurants, outdoor work spaces and terraces where people can mingle and connect, gym facilities, a high-end golf simulator, an upscale Italian grocery store and a 183-unit residential building. And like any good resort, it has a calendar of community events from craft cocktail fairs to silent discos.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The lobby entrance to the residential building at Springline.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Springline’s plaza is another communal space.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>With an office vacancy rate at about 20 percent in the United States, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, downtown business districts are trying whatever they can to get workers back — including resort-like work spaces that match or surpass the comfort of their homes.</p></div><div><div><p>The concept comes from “the image of a resort, of a beautiful location or a beautiful building, something that makes you say, ‘I want to see this experience, I want to be there,’” said Matthias Hollwich, founding principal of the global design firm HWKN who is designing a work resort complex, <a href="https://hwkn.com/projects/canada-water/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sky Island at Canada Water</a>, in London. “It’s not like home. It’s not like the other office buildings. It’s novel.”</p><p>“So many people go into the office and say, ‘Why am I here? I could do exactly the same thing at home,’” he added. “So you have to offer something that is better, but it’s not about making it entertaining like a club. People still want to go to work to be efficient.”</p><p>Transforming traditional offices into work spaces with hotel-like amenities is referred to as “hotelification.” In this new iteration, there is the additional layer of the “hospitality experience,” which Amy Campbell, an architect and senior associate at Gensler in San Francisco, describes as “anticipating the needs of others and then creating accommodations for that.” Ms. Campbell said she was seeing hotelification in all sectors, including residences and airports — and called it “a niche market that we’re going to see grow.”</p><p>The concept exists in Ms. Campbell’s own office, she said, an experience she describes as “like walking into a spa.”</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Canteen is one of the many restaurants at the Springline complex.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mercato Che Fico, an upscale grocery store, is also part of the Springline development.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>“There’s music playing, you can get a drink, you can sit on a lounge seat and work a little bit, or you can tuck into a room and take a quick call,” Ms. Campbell said. “The space anticipates all the different needs that someone might have.”</p><p>Having those needs met is exactly what makes a workplace go from good to great, according to a recent <a href="https://www.gensler.com/gri/global-workplace-survey-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gensler workplace survey</a>, which found that simply being a functional and effective place to work is no longer enough. Instead, the survey said the most important factors were “feeling that the space is beautiful, welcoming and inspires new thinking.”</p><p>One of Springline’s tenants since 2022 is Kilpatrick Townsend &amp; Stockton, a law firm. The firm’s old office had no restaurants nearby, and the company was spread out on several floors, said Joe Petersen, the firm’s office managing partner. “I could be in the office and not encounter any other colleagues,” he said. At Springline, where the firm occupies 10,100 square feet on a single floor, the company could “reimagine our office for the post-pandemic world,” Mr. Petersen said. “We wanted space for interaction and collaboration and flex space.”</p><p>The firm has about 22 lawyers and “on any given day about half are on site,” Mr. Petersen said. He added that the firm’s in-office attendance was “materially better than our peer firms,” which he attributes to the space, saying it had “a buzz” and “draws people out.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joe Petersen is the managing partner at Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton, a law firm that occupies office space at Springline.

Mr. Sanandaji said the company “will be implementing all the same functions as Springline in more of a vertical setting.”</p><p>Other work resort concepts around the country include <a href="https://www.habitatlosangeles.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Habitat</a> in Los Angeles, which calls itself a “live-work-thrive” campus, and <a href="https://www.themart.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Mart</a> in Chicago, which has 2.4 million square feet of office space that includes tenant lounges, a speakeasy, an upgraded fitness center with private spin classes, meditation pods, an on-site registered dietitian, Normatec compression boots and an infrared sauna, Ms. Campbell said.</p><p>In London, the 62-story <a href="https://22bishopsgate.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">22 Bishopsgate</a> is home to 25 companies as well as high-end restaurants; a commuter area with lockers, space for 1,000 bicycles and a cycle repair shop; food stalls and restaurants; and fitness facilities.</p></div></div><div><p>And Mr. Hollwich’s <a href="https://hwkn.com/projects/canada-water/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sky Island at Canada Water</a> is a 350,000-square-foot complex that is expected to break ground next spring and will be between downtown and Canary Wharf.</p></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The golf simulator at Springline.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Employees of Workboard enjoying brews at Bare Bottle, one of the restaurants at Springline.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>Sky Island will include two office buildings as well as an open market square with stalls offering food, drinks, music and entertainment. There will be a “laptop bar,” and other communal and individual work spaces, according to Mr. Hollwich, who said he coined the term work resort.</p><p>Terraces on its upper floors are meant to encourage outdoor meetings, as will the boat they plan to keep near Canada Water Dock. The top floor will be dedicated to “relaxation and socializing,” Mr. Hollwich said, and feature a saltwater therapy spa. For the commute home, kayaks and bicycles can be rented.</p><p>Companies have over the years improved their spaces in the hopes of getting more out of employees. In the 1870s, the Larkin Soap Company in Buffalo, N.Y., featured airy, light-filled interior lunchrooms, a bathhouse, hospital clinics and a gym. The Connecticut General Insurance Company building in Bloomfield, Conn., completed in 1957, had a small-format Lord &amp; Taylor department store, bowling alley and hair salon. And Silicon Valley tech company have campuses with video game lounges and volleyball courts.</p></div></div><div><p>All are striving to create happier, healthier employees — which will ultimately bump productivity, said Nikil Saval, author of “Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace.” “There was a kind of perceived discontent among the work force that drove design changes,” Mr. Saval said. There was an idea that “if you made environments better it would address a basic discontent over work.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mary Miller, head of business development for the investment firm Norwest Venture Partners, said the office space at Springline made the hour to 90 minutes she spent commuting worth it.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Rich amenities are appealing, but will it get people to leave their comfortable homes, endure a long commute and return to offices? Mr. Saval, now a Pennsylvania state senator, said he “would not argue against investing in environments conducive to work and people’s well-being,” but he cautioned companies that the concept might not completely fix resistance to returning to the office.</p><p>But for Mary Miller, head of business development for the investment firm Norwest Venture Partners, the office space at Springline makes what can be a two- to three-hour round trip commute worth it.</p><p>“You get to Springline and there’s the fountain and you feel relaxed and refreshed even though you’ve just battled the 101,” Ms. Miller said. “There’s so much negativity around office life. I feel like we’re an exception to that kind of talk. I feel lucky.”</p></div></div></section><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Online Hate to Real-World Violence: </strong>Social media posts assailing immigrants have fomented a climate of fear and hatred in Britain, Portugal and other countries. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/09/technology/migrants-racism-social-media-violence.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">The vitriol is now spilling onto the streets</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bari Weiss Knows What She’s Doing: </strong>The founder of The Free Press has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/bari-weiss-free-press.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">built a new media empire</a> by persuading audiences that she is a teller of dangerous truths.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reviving Downtown San Francisco: </strong>The city, which is among those most devastated in the United States after the pandemic, is trying to lure businesses back with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/san-francisco-storefronts-free-rent.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">free rent for up to six months</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>How to Not Get Scammed: </strong>Online schemes get more sophisticated all the time. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/business/online-scams-advice.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Here’s how to protect yourself and what to do if you get duped</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skirting A.I.
