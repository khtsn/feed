Thank goodness for pictures. This year, I went to three continents, six countries and seven cities to photograph people in the streets and in the crowds at fashion shows, an endeavor that involved the use of five cameras and six lenses.</p><p>Certain themes emerged among the countless clothes I documented. Wardrobe staples like knitwear and suits took new shapes and forms. Patterns and prints were mixed with abandon. Elaborate accessories signaled the end to an era of quiet luxury. These trends, exemplified in the following images, might not have been directly linked. But all brought to mind an adage associated with memorable style: It’s not what you wear but how you wear it.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-14f78900">Mashing and Clashing</h2><p>Wearing contrasting patterns and prints, while not new, became something of an art form as people experimented with eye-catching combinations. Many found harmony through complementary color palettes. Others stood out not for mixing visual motifs, but for ensembles emphasizing just one bold pattern.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-2"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/22STYLEOUTSIDE-BESTOF24-PATTERNS-03-chgw/22STYLEOUTSIDE-BESTOF24-PATTERNS-03-chgw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/22STYLEOUTSIDE-BESTOF24-PATTERNS-03-chgw/22STYLEOUTSIDE-BESTOF24-PATTERNS-03-chgw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/22STYLEOUTSIDE-BESTOF24-PATTERNS-03-chgw/22STYLEOUTSIDE-BESTOF24-PATTERNS-03-chgw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Five people walking together out of a building.
