And though Mr. Khamenei <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-talks-khamenei.html" title="">made an unusual gesture</a> last year of openness to talks, he has generally taken a publicly hostile posture toward Washington even while quietly allowing Iranian officials to negotiate.</p><p>In comments on Friday, Mr. Khamenei argued that Iran’s previous experiences negotiating with the United States showed that Washington could easily renege on agreements. Under Mr. Trump’s previous administration, the United States unilaterally withdrew from a nuclear deal under which Iran would limit its enrichment and stockpiling of uranium in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>“Negotiating with America will solve no problem. The proof? Experience,” Mr. Khamenei said, according to Iran’s state news agency, IRNA, which said his comments came during a meeting with commanders and staff from the Iranian armed forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The very same person who is now in office tore up the agreement,” Mr. Khamenei said. “One shall not negotiate with a government like this. Negotiating is unwise, unintelligent, not honorable.”</p><p>Ali Vaez, the Iran project director for the International Crisis Group, said on social media that the comments could simply be “in line” with Mr. Khamenei’s previous public approach. In 2011, he had publicly opposed negotiations with the Obama administration, even as he authorized negotiators to meet secretly with U.S. officials in Oman.</p><p>“If a true ban, it’s once again his stubbornness making him the antagonist in his own story.” Mr. Vaez said.</p><p>The leader’s comments seemed to undercut gestures last week from Iran’s reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, who told NBC News he was ready to negotiate with the United States, as long as they “respect our honor and wisdom and are conducted on an equal footing.”</p><p>Tehran is feeling weakened by its diminishing influence in the Middle East — including through Israel’s successful decimation of its Lebanese partner, Hezbollah, and the rebel ouster of its longtime ally in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad — which has raised concern that it would be even more inclined to turn to weapons-grade nuclear enrichment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>U.S. officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/iran-nuclear-weapon.html" title="">warned</a> earlier this week that they believe that Iran was working to develop a faster, cruder approach to developing an atomic bomb.</p><p>In his comments on Friday, Mr. Khamenei brushed aside concerns that rejecting talks would further hurt Iran’s economy, arguing Iran must find domestic responses to the crisis.</p><p>“What resolves those problems is a domestic element,” he said.</p><p>Earlier this week, Mr. Trump himself seemed to indicate he was looking to revive negotiations, even as he signed an executive order that would return a “maximum pressure” policy that would seek to block Iranian oil exports, a critical source of revenue for the country.</p><p>“This one I’m torn about,” he told reporters as he signed the order. “Everyone wants me to sign it. I’ll do that,” he said, but added he was “unhappy to do it.”</p><p>On his social media site, the president this week <a href="https://x.com/KhalilJeries/status/1848367086965227927" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed</a> to negotiate a “verified nuclear peace agreement,” similar to the one he torpedoed in his previous administration. He said he wanted to start working toward a deal “immediately.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I want Iran to be a great and successful Country, but one that cannot have a Nuclear Weapon,” he wrote.</p><p>But Mr. Trump also threatened this week he would have Iran “obliterated” if its assassins killed him.</p><p>Mr. Khamenei’s remarks on Friday included an apparent response to that threat. “If they threaten us, we will threaten them,” he said. “If they actuate that threat, we will actuate ours. If they violate our nation’s security, we will violate their security.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/ali-khamenei">Ali Khamenei</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trans Athletes:</strong> President Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-order-transgender-athletes-womens-sports.html">executive order effectively barring transgender athletes</a> from competing in girls’ and women’s sports relies heavily on a new interpretation of Title IX, a 1972 civil rights law. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-trans-athletes-executive-order.html">Here’s what we know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.: </strong>Trump administration appointees and allies of Elon Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/trump-musk-usaid.html">wanted to use the Treasury’s sensitive payment system </a>so that the Treasury could freeze U.S. Agency for International Development payments.</p></li><li><p><strong>E.P.A.:</strong> Employees at the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Environmental Justice were told in a telephone meeting that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/climate/epa-environmental-justice-workers-leave.html">some of them could soon be placed on administrative leave</a>, according to four people familiar with the matter.</p></li><li><p><strong>DOGE:</strong>  Though no official records have been released documenting it, the White House said that Musk is a “special government employee.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/elon-musk-special-government-employee-explainer.html">What does that mean</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration:</strong> The Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/migrants-trump-guantanamo-prison.html">prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba</a> that has housed men accused of being members of Al Qaeda, U.S. defense officials said.
