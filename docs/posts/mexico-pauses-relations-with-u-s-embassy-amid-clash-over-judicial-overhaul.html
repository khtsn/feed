But Mr. López Obrador said that overall relations would not be affected, seeking to allay concerns over a potential effect on trade. Mexico is the United States’ top trading partner, and there are growing concerns and warnings about the effect of the judicial reforms on business confidence and the economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. López Obrador also announced a pause in relations with the Canadian Embassy after its ambassador, Graeme Clark, relayed Canadian investors’ concerns over the judicial overhaul.</p><p>It was unclear what such a pause with the State Department and the embassies would mean in practical terms. Mr. López Obrador did not specify how the pause would play out. But on Tuesday afternoon Mexico’s foreign affairs minister, Alicia Bárcena Ibarra, said on social media that the relationship “with our friends and neighbors in North America is a priority and fundamental, and on a daily level remains fluid and normal.”</p><p>The president’s remarks came after comments made last week by Ken Salazar, the American ambassador, <a href="https://x.com/USAmbMex/status/1826703121894248523" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling</a> the proposed judicial changes, which include electing judges by popular vote, “a major risk to the functioning of Mexico’s democracy.”</p><p>Mr. Salazar asserted that the measures could threaten Mexico’s trade relationship with the United States by eroding confidence in Mexico’s legal framework and emboldening drug cartels to “take advantage of politically motivated and inexperienced judges.”</p><p>The criticism was a sharp departure from his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/05/world/americas/united-states-mexico-diplomacy.html" title="">long conciliatory approach</a> to his relations with Mr. López Obrador. The Biden administration, which needs Mexico’s cooperation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/americas/mexico-biden-migration-border.html" title="">to control migration flows</a>, has rarely criticized Mr. López Obrador, let alone done so publicly, and Mr. López Obrador has asked the United States to leave Mexico’s internal affairs to Mexicans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, the United States Embassy <a href="https://x.com/USAmbMex/status/1828498736743600194" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">affirmed</a> its “utmost respect for Mexico’s sovereignty” and its “desire to continue its close collaboration with Mexico,” but said that it had “significant concerns that the popular election of judges would neither address judicial corruption nor strengthen the judicial branch.”</p><p>Claudia Sheinbaum, the president-elect and Mr. López Obrador’s protégée, has fully embraced the president’s judicial initiative.</p><p>“There is this idea that with the judicial reform, the independence and autonomy of the judiciary is lost,” she told reporters on Monday. “It is the other way around.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ken Salazar, the American ambassador to Mexico, called the proposed judicial changes to the country’s judiciary “a major risk to the functioning of Mexico’s democracy.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alejandro Cegarra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mexico’s newly elected Congress could start voting as early as next week on the changes proposed by Mr. López Obrador. If passed, they would shift the judiciary from an appointment system largely based on specialized training and qualifications to one where just about anyone with a law degree and a few years of experience could run in elections to become a judge.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The measure could force more than 5,000 judges, from the Supreme Court down to local district courts, from their jobs.</p><p>Thousands of federal judges and court workers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/americas/mexico-judges-strike.html" title="">have already joined nationwide strikes</a>. On Sunday, protesters took to the streets in more than 20 Mexican cities in hopes of bringing attention to what they called an attack against the judiciary.</p><p>Attempts to weaken the courts have long been seen as a sign that a country’s democracy is in danger. Once judicial independence takes a blow, experts say, countries can quickly slide toward autocracy. In Poland and Hungary, crackdowns on the courts have made it easier for leaders to consolidate power. Most recently, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel faced mass protests when he tried to bar judges from overruling government decisions. (The effort was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/01/world/middleeast/israel-supreme-court-netanyahu.html" title="">struck down</a> by Israel’s Supreme Court earlier this year.)</p><p>Mr. López Obrador says the overhaul is needed to prevent corruption and rulings that allow drug traffickers to go free. Although his term ends in October, the new Congress — where the ruling party, Morena, and its allies have secured large majorities in both houses — has a one-month window while Mr. López Obrador is still in office to approve dozens of proposed constitutional changes, including the president’s plan to elect judges and justices by popular vote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judicial workers protesting outside the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation in Mexico City this month.

And — as he himself has said — it would allow his government’s plans, such as transferring the National Guard from civilian to military control, to go unchallenged by Mexico’s Supreme Court.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The judiciary is hopeless, it is rotten,” he said in May of last year, when he first presented his ideas for an overhaul. “It is completely at the service of the conservative bloc,” he said, referring to his opponents.</p><p>But others, citing the president’s barrage of attacks on judges who have ruled against some of his plans, say the measures amount to a thinly veiled pretext for eroding judicial independence and enhancing the power of Mr. López Obrador’s nationalistic political movement.</p><p>“They intend to disappear us as an institution,” said José Fernando Miguez, a spokesman for the striking workers and a court employee in Mexico City. “They intend to disappear people who have spent their entire lives working as judges and magistrates with extensive experience.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Simon Romero is a Times correspondent covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
