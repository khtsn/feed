Trump took the stage at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, a parade of speakers had already spent hours disparaging Latinos, Black people, Palestinians and Jews; directing misogynistic comments at Vice President Kamala Harris; and echoing language used by the Ku Klux Klan.</p><p>In the backlash that followed, Mr. Trump’s campaign publicly disavowed only one of the remarks, a line from the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe: “There’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. Yeah. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.” A senior campaign adviser, Danielle Alvarez, said in a statement, “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.”</p><p>Here is a look at other things speakers said at the rally, which the campaign has not commented on.</p><h3 id="link-34728503"><span>Tony Hinchcliffe</span></h3><p>In addition to disparaging Puerto Ricans, Mr. Hinchcliffe made a crudely sexual anti-immigrant remark about Latinos in general. “It’s wild,” he said of people crossing the border. “And these Latinos, they love making babies too, just know that. They do. They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country.”</p><p>Two minutes later, pointing to someone in the audience, Mr. Hinchcliffe said: “Cool, Black guy with a thing on his head? What is that, a lampshade? Look at this guy, oh my goodness. Wow. I’m just kidding, that’s one of my buddies. He had a Halloween party last night. We had fun. We carved watermelons together.” (Watermelons have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/12/how-watermelons-became-a-racist-trope/383529/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a long history</a> as an anti-Black stereotype.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He described Palestinians as violent and Jews as cheap: “When it comes to Israel and Palestine, we’re all thinking the same thing. Settle your stuff already,” he said. “Best out of three. Rock, paper, scissors. You know the Palestinians, they’re going to throw a rock every time. But you also know the Jews have a hard time throwing that paper, if you know what I’m saying.” He made a motion with his hands to indicate dollar bills.</p><p>Then, brushing off an analogy Hillary Clinton had made between Sunday’s event and a 1939 pro-Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden, Mr. Hinchcliffe made a crude comment about former President Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky and about the false conspiracy theory that the Clintons were involved in the suicide of a White House lawyer.</p><p>“She calls him Hitler,” he said, referring to Mr. Trump. “Let me remind you, Hillary, it was your husband who shot innocent people — or, as he called them, interns. Yeah, Hillary, I bet you did not see that one coming. By the way, if I commit suicide in three weeks, I didn’t.”</p><p>And he implied that the N.F.L. star Travis Kelce might kill his girlfriend, pop star Taylor Swift, whom Mr. Trump is angry at for endorsing Ms. Harris.</p><p>“I think football should be all year round,” Mr. Hinchcliffe said. “So many great athletes. I don’t know about you guys, but I think that Travis Kelce might be the next O.J. Simpson.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h3 id="link-59ba87c"><span>Sid Rosenberg</span></h3><p>Sid Rosenberg, a conservative radio host who once called Ms. Harris’s Jewish husband, Doug Emhoff, “a crappy Jew,” also lashed out at Mrs. Clinton for comparing the event to a Nazi rally. In doing so, he declared that Democrats were bad people and made a point to emphasize that he was talking about every Democrat in the country.</p><p>“She is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton, huh?” he said. “What a sick son of a bitch. The whole fucking party, a bunch of degenerates, lowlives, Jew-haters and lowlives. Every one of them. Every one of them.”</p><p>Then he suggested that undocumented immigrants were taking resources from more deserving people. “You got homeless and veterans, Americans, Americans, sleeping in their own feces on a bench in Central Park,” he said. “But the fucking illegals, they get whatever they want, don’t they?”</p><h3 id="link-39dfe87f"><span>Grant Cardone</span></h3><p>Grant Cardone, a businessman, disparaged Ms. Harris with a term used to describe a prostitute: “Her and her pimp handlers will destroy our country.”</p><p>Moments later, urging Mr. Trump’s supporters to give him not just a narrow victory but a resounding one, he used violent language: “We need to slaughter this other people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h3 id="link-c322110"><span>Rudolph Giuliani</span></h3><p>Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor turned Trump lawyer, argued that because some Palestinians had committed violence, people shouldn’t trust any of them or allow any of them into the United States.</p><p>“They won’t let a Palestinian in Jordan. They won’t let a Palestinian in Egypt,” he said, referring to two countries that have sizable Palestinian populations. “And Harris wants to bring them to you. They may have good people. I’m sorry, I don’t take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at 2.”</p><h3 id="link-32993125"><span>Stephen Miller</span></h3><p>Stephen Miller, a Trump adviser and an architect of the former president’s immigration policy, told the crowd that Mr. Trump would “stand up and say the cartels are gone, the criminal migrants are gone, the gangs are gone, America is for Americans and Americans only.”</p><p>“America for Americans” was a slogan <a href="https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Image/IM58857" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used by the Ku Klux Klan</a>.</p><h3 id="link-15a20f30"><span>Tucker Carlson</span></h3><p>The former Fox News host Tucker Carlson gave a speech that resembled his remarks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/politics/tucker-carlson-trump-spanking.html" title="">at a rally last week</a> — filled with grievance and exhortations to Trump supporters to view themselves as a maligned and downtrodden majority.</p><p>In pushing that message, Mr. Carlson nodded to the so-called great replacement theory, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/15/us/replacement-theory-shooting-tucker-carlson.html" title="">racist claim</a> that Democrats are trying to “replace” white Americans with foreigners.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“People know, in a country that has been taken over by a leadership class that actually despises them and their values and their history and their culture and their customs, really hates them, to the point that it’s trying to replace them — they know someone who actually has affection for them, and that’s Donald Trump,” he said.</p><p>And in a long, sarcastic spiel that framed a hypothetical victory for Ms. Harris as illegitimate and not to be believed, Mr. Carlson cast the vice president as an intellectual lightweight and mocked her ethnicity with an obviously false descriptor.</p><p>“It’s going to be pretty hard to look at us and say: ‘You know what, Kamala Harris, she’s just, she got 85 million votes because she’s just so impressive as the first Samoan-Malaysian, low IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president,’” he said. “‘It was just a groundswell of popular support, and anyone who thinks otherwise is just a freak or a criminal.’”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Astor covers politics for The Times, focusing on breaking news, policies, campaigns and how underrepresented or marginalized groups are affected by political systems.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-astor">More about Maggie Astor</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/republican-party">Republican Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/tucker-carlson">Tucker Carlson</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
