The Silicon Valley giant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/technology/google-wiz-deal.html" title="">worked for months last year to forge a deal for</a> Wiz, which was most recently valued at $12 billion. In July, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/technology/google-wiz-deal-ipo.html" title="">Wiz rejected Google’s $23 billion takeover offer</a>, saying it wanted to pursue an initial public offering, but an I.P.O. never came.</p><p>The splashy purchase, which the companies expect to close in 2026, would inject fresh momentum into Google Cloud, the division that sells computing services to other businesses. It would also be the tech giant’s most aggressive effort to keep up with Microsoft, its longtime rival, in cybersecurity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Today, businesses and governments that run in the cloud are looking for even stronger security solutions, and greater choice in cloud computing providers,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Together, Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds.”</p><p>But first, Alphabet, Google’s parent company, would have to clear regulatory hurdles.</p><p>The deal will test the company’s ability to conduct major acquisitions during protracted antitrust battles with the U.S. government. The Justice Department has sued Google in two separate monopoly cases, one targeting its ubiquitous search engine and another seeking to break up its digital advertising-technology business. A federal judge ruled last year that the company had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html" title="">illegally maintained a monopoly in online search</a> and will decide on remedies to restore competition by August.</p><p>Under President Trump, regulators have continued taking a stand against corporate consolidation. In January, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-block-hewlett-packard-enterprises-proposed-14-billion-acquisition" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisition</a> of a rival, Juniper Networks, arguing that the deal would eliminate competition and raise prices in the computer networking industry.</p><p>For Google, which has shied away from large acquisitions in recent years, Wiz proved to be worth the regulatory risk. Mr. Pichai highlighted the startup’s ability to drive growth, saying on a conference call on Tuesday about the deal that half the Fortune 100 companies use Wiz’s technology.</p><p>The purchase also fits into Alphabet’s yearslong strategy of trying to diversify from the search engine, YouTube video service and other online advertising businesses that bring in three-quarters of its revenue. Alphabet has created venture companies like the self-driving car company Waymo and Verily, which is focused on health care, but they have yet to fully pay off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The company has pumped resources into Google Cloud. Like its competitors Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, the business offers services to help companies store and analyze data, as well as run applications.</p><p>The Wiz acquisition aligns with a plan to make Google Cloud a bigger player in cybersecurity. Under Thomas Kurian, the unit’s chief executive, Google Cloud bought two cybersecurity firms in 2022 — Mandiant for $5.4 billion and Siemplify for a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/google-beefs-up-internet-security-with-siemplify-buyout-2022-01-04/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported $500 million</a>. The strategy could help Google catch up to Microsoft, which has said it generates more than $20 billion in annual revenue from security, making it the world’s largest provider of cybersecurity software.</p><p>Google has already suggested that the deal would not undermine competition in the cloud market. Mr. Kurian said on the conference call that if Wiz joined his division, it would continue working with other cloud providers including Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle. He added that with Wiz, Google will be able to give customers more visibility into their own systems and defend against new threats emerging with artificial intelligence.</p><p>If completed, the deal may help reinvigorate Google Cloud’s revenue expansion. As the business has grown, its pace has usually slowed, though revenue in the fourth quarter rose a stout 30 percent from a year earlier, to $12 billion.</p><p>Wiz has grown rapidly. Last year, it said it had $350 million in recurring revenue, up from $100 million two years earlier. The company, which is based in New York, has said it plans to reach $1 billion in recurring revenue in 2025.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The acquisition will “accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a stand-alone company, thus enabling us to protect more organizations,” Assaf Rappaport, the chief executive of Wiz, said on the call.</p><p>Wiz’s investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Greenoaks and Advent International.</p><p>Lauren Hirsch<!-- --> contributed reporting from New York.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nico Grant reports on Alphabet’s Google and YouTube as well as the corporate culture of Silicon Valley.
