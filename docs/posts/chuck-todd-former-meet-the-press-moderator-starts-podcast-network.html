    <h1>Chuck Todd, Former ‘Meet the Press’ Moderator, Starts Podcast Network</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Chuck Todd is sleeping in. Kind of.</p><p>For nearly a decade, Sunday mornings meant waking up at 3:30 and putting on a suit and tie while preparing for his work as moderator of “Meet the Press,” where Mr. Todd would interview presidents, senators and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-1XoojLorE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the occasional movie star</a> on America’s longest-running TV show.</p><p>No longer. His 5:30 a.m. alarm these days is his 14-year-old poodle, Ruby, and his work uniform is more understated — jeans and a quarter-zip maroon fleece for a recent trip to the Capitol. But he’s still interviewing senators.</p><p>After leaving the corporate home of “Meet the Press” in January, Mr. Todd is embarking on a career as a media entrepreneur. He has a podcast and a YouTube channel, and plans to hire other hosts for a podcast and video network focused on politics and culture. He also said he was working with an adviser from a major financial firm to build or acquire a company focused on community news.</p><p>Mr. Todd said he was adjusting to the realities of digital entrepreneurship and full-time podcasting. Sound bites are out, Mr. Todd says. Longer interviews are in — because many officials want time to make their points with fuller context. The first episode of the podcast, “The Chuck ToddCast,” released Wednesday, has an interview with Senator John Fetterman, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and lasts about 45 minutes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The current system of legacy television just doesn’t allow for that,” Mr. Todd said. He plans to release three podcasts a week with the help of a full-time producer.</p><p>Mr. Todd’s relationship with NBC News, his professional home for 17 years, became bumpy after he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/24/business/chuck-todd-ronna-mcdaniel-nbc-msnbc.html" title="">criticized the network’s leadership</a> over a decision to hire Ronna McDaniel, the former chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, as an on-air analyst. Less than a year later, he was out. He had a podcast named “The Chuck ToddCast” at the network, and the company let him take the name with him. “I was ready to go,” Mr. Todd said.</p><p>Mr. Todd said he missed some aspects of TV news, such as collaborating with producers and managing a team of journalists. But he said he was excited to “sing for his supper” on the podcast and eager to find a business solution to a problem that had vexed investors for decades: the collapse of local news.</p><p>Mr. Todd’s business plan calls for a constellation of local sites owned by their communities — like his beloved Green Bay Packers — and anchored by coverage of local youth sports. The growing popularity of athletics and their importance to families who view them as a gateway to college make them an ideal subject to build around. No matter your politics, Mr. Todd said, you care about local coverage of your child’s latest game.</p><p>Mr. Todd and the bank he is working with are eyeing a purchase that could cost up to $2 billion, he said. He declined to say whether he had lined up any backers or specify the company they were looking at, but he ruled out major newspaper publishers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His decision to pursue the somewhat quixotic venture — one that has flummoxed many media executives — is inspired by his own experience. After years of covering Washington, Mr. Todd said, he concluded that the decline of local news had coarsened U.S. politics. Legislators have told him that their constituents aren’t paying attention to local policy anymore because there are almost no local journalists around to cover it.</p><p>“A guy named Craig one day thought classified ads ought to be free,” he said about the rise of Craigslist, which decimated classified ad revenue for newspapers. “Yada, yada, yada, Donald Trump became president.”</p><p>No deal on local news is imminent, though. So for now Mr. Todd is settling into his new job as a full-time podcaster and streamer.</p><p>“The big change for me?” Mr. Todd said. “I get to make breakfast.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Mullin reports on the major companies behind news and entertainment.
