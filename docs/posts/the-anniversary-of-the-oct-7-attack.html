    <h1>The Anniversary of the Oct. 7 Attack</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><div id="top-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-top">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p><div></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Many Israeli families were starting their weekend routines — on a Saturday, the Jewish sabbath, one year ago — when the first signs of trouble appeared. Hamas sent explosive drones and fired thousands of rockets from Gaza into Israel.</p><p>Soon after, militants smashed through border fences out of Gaza and landed in southern Israel on paragliders. They killed more than 1,100 people and took hundreds more hostage, broadcasting some of the attacks on social media.</p><p>The Oct. 7 attack, among the deadliest acts of terrorism in history, has reshaped the Middle East in the year since. In today’s newsletter, I’ll focus on three main changes: First, Israel has weakened its enemies. Second, Israeli attacks have devastated Gaza and its people. Third, the Middle East is on the precipice of a regional war. At the bottom of the newsletter, I’ve also included links to The Times’s coverage of this somber anniversary.</p><h2 id="link-5d512afe">1. A weakened axis</h2><p>When Israel went into Gaza, it vowed to destroy Hamas, the Iran-backed group that launched the Oct. 7 attack. Israel has not done so, and U.S. officials are skeptical that it ever will. But the incursion into Gaza has nonetheless devastated Hamas. Israel has killed thousands of its fighters and destroyed much of its weapons stockpiles. Israel has also killed many of Hamas’s leaders, including the head of its political wing, Ismail Haniyeh, while he was in Iran. Many of the group’s previous bases of operations, in Gaza, are in ruins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel has also weakened Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group on its northern border. Hezbollah began firing missiles into Israel the day after the Oct. 7 attack, in solidarity with Hamas. The barrages have forced tens of thousands of Israelis out of their homes in the north. In recent weeks, Israel has become much more aggressive toward Hezbollah; through airstrikes and covert operations, it has killed many of the group’s members and leaders, including its head, Hassan Nasrallah.</p><p>Together, these successes have reduced the ability of Israel’s enemies to carry out another attack like Oct. 7.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Family members of hostages.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>One thing Israel has not accomplished: bringing home all of the hostages. More than 100 hostages, some of whom have died, still have not been returned. A cease-fire agreement to bring them home remains elusive, despite the U.S. and Arab countries’ efforts to negotiate a deal.</p><h2 id="link-1aadde6f">2. A humanitarian crisis</h2><p>Second, the war has caused a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israeli attacks have killed more than 41,500 Palestinians, including both civilians and militants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Frequent airstrikes have forced Palestinians to cower in shelters and flee their homes. As tanks have rolled into Gaza, survivors have lost family and friends to fighting. Food, water and medical supplies remain scarce, leading to starvation and untreated illness. Entire neighborhoods are now rubble, leaving people without housing and other important infrastructure.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the southern Gaza Strip in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>For all of Israel’s military successes, Gaza’s suffering has consumed much of the international attention to the conflict and damaged Israel’s reputation abroad. Israel argues that Hamas is largely to blame for the civilian deaths, because the group deliberately hides in schools, hospitals and other civilian buildings and even uses them as command centers. That forces Israel to strike these places to take out Hamas. Still, many people who see the destruction in Gaza, knowing that Israel has the ability to end the war, demand that Israel do so for the sake of Palestinians.</p><p>Biden administration officials argue that Israel has largely achieved its military objectives in Gaza and should reach a cease-fire to return the remaining hostages. Israeli officials say that withdrawing would allow Hamas to rebuild itself.</p><h2 id="link-258e4616">3. A wider war</h2><p>What began as an Israeli campaign into Gaza has turned into a multifront conflict between Israel and Iran, which has financed and advised both Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel has also invaded Lebanon, where Hezbollah controls territory, forcing thousands of Lebanese civilians to flee. And Iran has twice fired a barrage of missiles at Israel. Israel promised to retaliate for the second attack, which took place last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Israel and Iran do not seem to want an all-out war, but at the same time they both believe that they have to respond to each other’s attacks. Iran wants to assert its influence over the Middle East and demonstrate that it can inflict pain on Israel for strikes on Iran’s allies. Israel wants to show Iran that it can’t fund terrorist attacks on Israel without consequences. Each side hopes that its attacks will get the other to back down, out of fear of what could come next.</p><p>The attacks have instead led Israel and Iran to steadily escalate over the past year. Each side seems to want to deter the other, but in practice both are in a cycle of violence that is pushing the region further into war.</p><h2 id="link-2213500">More on the anniversary</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A gathering at the site of the Nova music festival near Re’im, Israel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><ul><li><p>Israelis are commemorating the attacks.
