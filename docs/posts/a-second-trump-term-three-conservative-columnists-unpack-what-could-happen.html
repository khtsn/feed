Here’s what I’m going to tell them.</p><p><strong>Bret Stephens: </strong>Assuming the brace position, Ross.</p><p><strong>Douthat: </strong>The 2024 Republican nominee, is even in the national polls, is favored to win in betting markets and is poised to win a bigger share of the African American, the Latino and possibly the youth vote than the G.O.P. has at any point in our lifetimes. He’s assembled a team of future leaders that includes the author of a 2016 best-selling memoir about working-class dysfunction, the electric-car hero Elon Musk, a former rising-star Democratic congresswoman who switched parties to the G.O.P., a scion of the Kennedy family and more. He’s moved the Republican Party to the center on entitlements, same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization — and he is trusted more than his Democratic rival on the economy, immigration and foreign policy. The main issue where he isn’t trusted, abortion, is a big debate only because a conservative takeover of the Supreme Court was so successful that Roe v. Wade was overturned.</p><p>I expect our 2016 Never Trump selves may be relieved to hear all this. Is there anything else I should mention to them?</p><p><strong>Stephens:</strong> That, in assembling this admittedly intriguing new coalition, this 2024 nominee was responsible for a string of electoral losses — the loss of the House in 2018, the loss of the White House in 2020, the loss of the Senate in 2021 and the strong showing of Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections, which historically should have swung strongly to the G.O.P., save for some atrocious Senate candidates like Herschel Walker in Georgia and Blake Masters in Arizona.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Also, a Republican Party that has abandoned many of the positions that attracted so many principled conservatives to it in the first place. For instance, a commitment to NATO and the defense of embattled democratic allies abroad. Or a belief, rooted in empirical evidence, in the economic benefits of free trade. Or a moral conviction that immigrants are a net positive for the country. Or a sense that civic health requires examples of moral leadership at the top.</p><p>And one more thing: that in 2024 roughly half the country sees the Republican Party not only as a challenge to their preferred policy positions but also as a mortal threat to democracy itself. If our 2016 selves thought the country couldn’t possibly be more polarized, suspicious, conspiracy-minded and furious, they are in for a rude surprise.</p><p><strong>David French: </strong>That’s an intriguing way to frame the question, Ross. Because I was just thinking about how much my 2016 self underestimated what we faced in Trump. As badly as I viewed him, I never imagined that he’d try to overturn the results of an American election. I did not see the dizzying crime spikes and chaos in 2020. This is a man, after all, who pledged to end “American carnage.”</p><p>But there were some things that were quite predictable. What you called a move to the center on entitlements is just part and parcel of a larger abandonment of any pretense of fiscal responsibility, which is but one of a wholesale series of abandonments of conservative principles.</p><p>On abortion, the story is more mixed. I would have been surprised that his one term yielded three Supreme Court nominees, but I would also be surprised that the decades-long decrease in the abortion rate reversed itself during his presidency, and I would have been stunned by the electoral collapse of the pro-life movement. He truly brought the country together: It’s more pro-choice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>Douthat: </strong>I think you both have rounded out our message to our past selves nicely. But my provocation was meant to push us toward a few questions I hoped that we could wrestle with here.</p><p>Start with your point about underestimation, David. I think, to a lot of people, opposing Trump from the right in 2016 felt like a temporary maneuver, a response to a fluke nominee that would resolve back into conservative normalcy when his candidacy went down to defeat. Does it still feel that way in 2024? What does it actually mean to be an anti-Trump conservative eight years — and counting? — into the Trump era? Is there a conservatism in America apart from Trump and the larger populist realignment? Is imagining a different form of right-wing politics the equivalent of pining for the return of the Rockefeller Republicans or blue-collar pro-life Democrats or the 19th-century Whigs?</p><p><strong>Stephens: </strong>I think there’s plenty of life left in normie conservatism, if I can use that term. Most successful G.O.P. leaders I can think of are in that camp, from Mike DeWine in Ohio to Glenn Youngkin in Virginia to Brian Kemp in Georgia. Even to Mike Johnson, the House speaker: They all know that they can’t govern or even win most elections as full-on MAGA Republicans. Ask Kari Lake later this week.</p><p>The problem the normies have is twofold: First, no normie Republican today can match Trump’s political charisma. Ron DeSantis auditioned for that job, just as Ted Cruz did eight years ago, and both bombed. Second, they live under the permanent threat of Trump’s blackmail, which forces them to bow and scrape at his altar more than they would otherwise like. But I hope that’s a problem that resolves itself when Trump eventually, inevitably, leaves the stage.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> I agree with Bret that there’s life left in normie conservatism. You’d be surprised by how little your rank-and-file Republican voter has paid attention to the ideological realignments on the right. They still think they’re with the limited government, pro-life party. That’s changing, of course, but it’s far more gradual than the online activists would have you believe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Plus, if there’s one thing we learned from the rise of Trump, it’s that voter ideology is far more malleable than we once thought. Republicans moved with blinding speed from imposing an unyielding ideological litmus test on their candidates to imposing an even more unyielding test of personal loyalty. Ideological changes are not fixed, and in the absence of any real evidence that the MAGA ethos works for swing state candidates not named Donald Trump, I wonder about its staying power after Trump leaves the scene.</p><p><strong>Douthat:</strong> So I half-buy this argument. The parts I buy are that most Republican voters still have political defaults closer to Reaganism than to whatever set of issues unites, say, Tucker Carlson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and that the Trump style will not automatically transfer to a post-Trump party and its leaders. Even Trump’s — for now — heir apparent, JD Vance, sounded quite different — normal, mainstream, like a conservative answer to Bill Clinton — in his debate with Tim Walz than in, for example, the podcast clips that dogged his candidacy in the beginning. And I think that point generalizes: Future Republicans who want to win will be more normal than Trump, who, because of his celebrity and distinctive kind of charisma, gets away with a style of politics that doesn’t work as well with imitators.</p><p><strong>Stephens: </strong>Trump’s one of a kind. He leads the G.O.P. not as a party figure in the mold of Lyndon Johnson or as an ideological icon like Ronald Reagan. He’s a cult of personality figure, in the mold of Juan Perón. He draws his power not only from the adulation he inspires among supporters but also from the hatred he generates from his opponents. If he reversed all of his positions tomorrow, his followers would still love him, and his enemies would still hate him. He’s a once-in-a-century phenomenon.</p><p><strong>French: </strong>Yes, Vance can come across as more normal than Trump — and sometimes not, as the podcast clips demonstrate — but is there evidence that a normal MAGA candidate can be more popular than Trump himself? In 2022 the Trump endorsement sealed Vance’s primary victory, but he substantially underperformed his normie Republican governor, Mike DeWine, in the general election.</p><p><strong>Douthat: </strong>I agree that what you might call the normal-populist model hasn’t been fully road-tested. But here’s where I’m doubtful about normie Republicanism’s revenge: On substance and policymaking, a party isn’t just its voters or its purple-state governors. It’s also its activists and intellectuals and policy wonks and staff members and so forth. And when I look around the ranks of younger conservatives — the kind of people doing staff work and campaign work and idea work — I think a populist shift has really taken hold: a belief that Bush-era and Romney-era conservatism was a failure rather than something to be recovered, that the party needs to be more nationalist and culturally combative and skeptical of overseas commitments and so on, down a list of Trump-adjacent ideas. Do you have that sense as well?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Stephens: </strong>I do. And some of the change is undoubtedly healthy. The kind of management-consultant Republicanism epitomized by Romney isn’t particularly responsive to important working-class concerns revolving around, say, rampant opioid abuse, family breakdown or the struggles of alienated and purposeless young people, particularly men, in school and the workplace. I also think my brand of conservatism is probably insufficiently allergic to the cultural left. We dislike it but accommodate it, whereas younger, Trumpier conservatives hate it and mean to wage cultural war on it. Good for them; I lack the energy, and maybe the stomach, to write columns about, say, transgenderism.</p><p>On the other hand, some of the G.O.P.’s more populist positions are ones they’ll come to regret. High tariffs on imports sound great until you realize it will raise the prices of thousands of consumer goods without doing much to improve the economy at home. Cutting off aid to Ukraine is another idea Republicans will regret when Russian troops march into Kharkiv and China sees it as a case study in how to wear down the West in its own theater of interests.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> I don’t think there’s any doubt that the young activists online and in Washington are very aggressively anti-woke and much more populist. I also think they’re deeply unrepresentative of their generation and their sense of isolation is driving many of them into dark spaces. The level of outright racism and antisemitism emanating from the young activist right is astounding.</p><p>It’s hard for me to forget what Aaron Sibarium, a rising-star reporter at The Washington Free Beacon, <a href="https://x.com/aaronsibarium/status/1686035822850555904" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X: “Whenever I’m on a career advice panel for young conservatives, I tell them to avoid group chats that use the N-word or otherwise blur the line between edgelording and earnest bigotry.” The fact that his advice is necessary is astounding.</p><p>I have to dissent from Bret when he says, “Good for them,” about this young activist response to the cultural left. I spent decades in courtrooms fighting left-wing illiberalism on campus, and I don’t believe right-wing illiberalism is an improvement. If you’re drafting speech codes — for example, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/26/federal-courts-florida-stop-woke-law-00171451" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Florida’s Stop Woke Act</a> — to target left-wing speech, you’re still drafting speech codes. You’ve become the problem to fight the problem.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Douthat:</strong> OK, what about the sheer unknowability of the next four years if Trump wins or if he doesn’t? Yes, various aspects of the Trump era were foreseeable in 2016 — but many aspects were considerably less imaginable. For instance, you both mention the cultural left: I think liberalism has been internally transformed in profound ways that none of us welcomed, even if the pendulum has arguably swung back in some ways lately, and that certainly changed my own relationship to liberal institutions and the Democratic Party — my trust in them to be sane and stable, even when I disagreed with them.</p><p><strong>Stephens: </strong>Good question. I worry about the ricochet effects of either presidency — of Trump or Kamala Harris. One of my main fears about a second Trump term is that it will revive the resistance not just in terms of an even more woke culture at universities or in the media but also in terms of street violence of the kind that paralyzed much of the country after George Floyd’s murder. Then again, if Harris proves to be an incompetent president or if she leans further into the cultural left, it will further radicalize the right, assuming that’s even possible.</p><p><strong>French: </strong>I share many of Bret’s concerns. I wonder if the so-called Great Awokening would have happened had Trump lost in 2016. There were certainly stirrings of it in the Black Lives Matter movement and the unrest after Ferguson, but white Democrats, in particular, did lurch left in the Trump years. There was a sense that desperate times called for desperate measures, and we all saw a shocking level of intolerance for dissent in many left-leaning and establishment institutions.</p><p>If Harris wins — and finally ends Trump’s political career — after tacking away from the left-wing positions she embraced in 2019, I’m hopeful for continued cooling in the culture wars. If she loses, I fully expect parts of the left to take that loss as proof that the path of moderation is the path of defeat, that Harris never should have opened the door to the likes of Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney and that it’s time to fight fire with fire.</p><p><strong>Douthat: </strong>I just have a lot of uncertainty about this. You had a great surge of awokened politics under Trump, yes, which might suggest that it’s all reactive and so things would heat back up if Trump returns and cool further under a President Harris. But the seeds of the Great Awokening were clearly sown in Barack Obama’s second term, out of a sense of frustration inside left-wing institutions with the resilience of Republican power and a desire for a more radical style of engagement than a gridlocked D.C. allowed. So if a Harris presidency is legislatively impotent, there will be strong pressure on her administration to be bureaucratically and culturally aggressive, to cede more administrative power to the activist and the ideological groups on the left.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>And speaking of uncertainty, there’s foreign policy, where my 2016 self expected global chaos under Trump, and then we got much more of it under President Biden.</p><p>This is something you gestured toward in your <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/opinion/trump-conservative-harris-election.html" title="">extremely reluctant endorsement of Harris</a>, Bret, but to me, it’s a major question mark: Is it really the case that returning the Biden-Harris team to power is the safer move for the Pax Americana? Trump will negotiate with Vladimir Putin, absolutely. Do we think that Harris won’t be forced to do the same? Do we really know which kind of presidency will give Beijing more pause in its designs on Taiwan? Isn’t it possible that Trump’s mercurial style, his mix of aggressive and retrenching impulses, has some advantages over a liberal internationalism that talks a lot about America’s global mission but can’t come up with the means to match its ends?</p><p><strong>Stephens: </strong>Maybe. Or maybe Trump got lucky in being surrounded by sober-minded advisers like H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn, who steered him away from his worst foreign policy instincts — and who won’t be around in a second Trump term. Remember, the global disorder we’ve seen under Biden started with the shambolic retreat from Afghanistan, which I predicted at the time would embolden Russia to pursue its own adventures in Europe. That withdrawal, though executed by Biden, was originally Trump’s idea — patiently negotiated by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p><p>On the other hand, probably my biggest misgiving about Harris is that Putin, Xi Jinping or Ali Khamenei will seek to test her early in her presidency and that she won’t rise to the occasion. Either way, it feels as if we are drifting toward the rapids.</p><p><strong>French: </strong>Every time I hear the argument that voting for Trump is a vote for stability, I think of the mad dash inside his administration to try to stop him from implementing an order for a <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2022/10/13/trump-ordered-rapid-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-after-election-loss/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sudden withdrawal from Afghanistan</a> after he lost the 2020 election. I’m also reminded that many of the people he selected to help him craft his foreign and defense policy now are telling the American public that he’s a dangerous man. The very people who helped him achieve the most successful policies of his first term are jumping up and down and yelling, “Don’t do this again!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The Trump of 2017 and 2018 is gone. Don’t expect a national security establishment packed with some of the most respected military leaders in America. Instead, expect a Mos Eisley cantina full of cranks and sycophants — and many of those cranks and sycophants are deeply hostile to Ukraine and deeply hostile to NATO.</p><p><strong>Stephens: </strong>Mos Eisley — you mean the “Star Wars” bar, right? Go on.</p><p><strong>French: </strong>I completely understand that wars tend to end with negotiations, but that also brings us back to Afghanistan. The “deal” Trump negotiated to end that war — which included forcing the Afghan government to release thousands of Taliban prisoners — was a disaster. If and when Russia and Ukraine go to the bargaining table, Ukraine should be negotiating from a position of strength, with the arsenal of democracy backstopping its defense. That is not the position of Trump-Vance.</p><p><strong>Douthat:</strong> Well, but again, prodding you toward uncertainty: If all hawkishness rests on material foundations, which administration is more likely to budget for substantial increases in defense spending — Harris-Walz or Trump-Vance? My bet is the latter.</p><p><strong>French: </strong>We’re already ramping up domestic defense production. We have a goal to <a href="https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2024/9/11/arms-manufacturers-catching-up-with-worlds-insatiable-need-for-155mm-rounds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">produce 100,000 155-millimeter artillery shells per month</a> by next year, for example. But even if Trump would outspend Harris — by the way, his economic plan would <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">add much more to the deficit</a> than hers — a bigger defense budget isn’t helpful to Ukraine if the weapons and munitions are withheld while Ukrainians fight for their lives.</p><p><strong>Stephens: </strong>I want to stay open to the idea — and maybe this is wishful thinking — that a second Trump term could hold some pleasant surprises, just as the first one did. There is something to the madman theory of international relations, which holds that American adversaries might be better deterred by Trump’s erratic and sometimes truculent instincts than by the cautious, measured and predictable patterns of the Biden administration’s foreign policy. Trump was also more right than wrong about some big foreign policy questions, such as opposing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have made Germany even more dependent on Russian gas; promoting peace between Israel and the more moderate Arab states; and, most important, seeing China as the aggressive and determined adversary that it is.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>I also think it’s important to acknowledge that, as much as I detest Trump the man, there are sides of the MAGA movement that deserve respect. I don’t think of it as a collection of unadulterated bigots. Most Trump voters I know are decent people who don’t like being condescended to by a morally smug and self-serving elite that fails to see the many ways in which the federal government fails ordinary people. I also think Trump’s voters see things that too easily escape the notice of Trump’s haters, whether it was the farce of many of the Covid rules and restrictions or the double standards by which Trump’s opponents claim to be defending democracy while using every trick in the book to put him in prison.</p><p><strong>Douthat:</strong> David, can I induce you to follow Bret in saying something optimistic about the possibilities of a second Trump administration?</p><p><strong>French: </strong>I’m a harder sell. While I love and respect many, many people who vote for Trump, I do not have anything good to say about the MAGA movement itself. Perhaps you have to be embedded in deep-red communities to see its effect on the ground, but I have never seen people go deep into MAGA without profound negative effects on their character, their temperament and their relationships with people outside MAGA.</p><p>For example, to truly be a member of MAGA in good standing, you have to defer to the election lie. Any movement that requires that degree of dangerous dishonesty as a condition of remaining in good standing is corrosive to the country.</p><p>Regarding a second Trump term, I do have some degree of optimism that he’ll continue to nominate judges like many of the judges I know from his first term — high-integrity civil servants who’ve proved to be dedicated to the rule of law. In fact, many of them helped block his effort to steal the election in 2020. But I’m worried even about that. There are deep MAGA resentments against many of Trump’s judges, and there is a sense that they don’t want any more justices quite like Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Also, and this is no small thing, even if a second Trump administration is far more pro-choice than any Republican administration in my adult lifetime, it won’t try to codify Roe, there will be no move to expand or pack the Supreme Court, and it won’t try to aggressively wield Title IX to coerce compliance with far-left theories about gender or to deny due process on campus. Each of those moves can be blocked by courts or Congress, even if Harris wins, but I’d rather not see a presidential administration try any of those things.</p><p><strong>Douthat: </strong>And now, Bret, since both you and David have reluctantly argued that anti-Trump conservatives should accept a Harris presidency, give me your optimist’s view of where you think conservatism will stand a few years into a Harris administration.</p><p><strong>Stephens: </strong>Very optimistically: Trump will be remembered by Republicans as the repeat loser of winnable elections and will be quietly repudiated by rank-and-file conservatives who want candidates who win by appealing to the center of America. The party will regain some of its Reaganite bearings, especially by rejecting protectionism and isolationism and regaining its broadly positive view of immigration, its belief in smaller government and its faith in the free world. Republicans will also demand that their leading political candidates pass the moral smell test and the intellectual laugh test — no more Matt Gaetz or Marjorie Taylor Greene. And it will remember that the ultimate purpose of American conservatism is to defend a liberal order rooted in the words “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” “created equal” and “unalienable rights.”</p><p><strong>French:</strong> I’m not naïve. I know that a renewed Reaganism isn’t waiting in the wings. The way I look at a Harris presidency is that it will give Republicans a chance to redefine themselves without Trump threatening, bullying and intimidating everyone who doesn’t fall in line. There are still many quite good and competent Republicans in Congress and in state capitals, and even if they may end up more populist and less libertarian than I’d prefer, there is a world of difference between them and Trump. I would have been happy to vote for many, many non-MAGA Republicans, had they gotten the party’s nomination instead of Trump.</p><p>You don’t have to look far to find them. I’m thinking of Kemp, the governor of Georgia. I’m thinking of Bill Lee, my governor in Tennessee. Republicans may never welcome Liz Cheney or Adam Kinzinger back in the fold, and I think they know and accept that, but a Trump loss will create an opening for others. MAGA may still win the Republican civil war that would erupt with a Harris win, but at least decency will have a chance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p><strong>Douthat: </strong>And on that note, we’ll conclude and plan to reconvene in four years. If Harris wins on Tuesday, maybe we’ll be talking about a Trump-Harris rematch — God help us.
