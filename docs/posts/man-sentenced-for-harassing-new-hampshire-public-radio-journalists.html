The men also threw rocks and bricks through the windows of some of the homes.</p><p>Three other men — Eric Labarge, Michael Waselchuck and Keenan Saniatan — have been indicted in connection to the harassment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Labarge and Mr. Waselchuck have both pleaded guilty and are waiting to be sentenced. Mr. Saniatan is expected to plead guilty on Thursday, prosecutors said.</p><p>Mr. Cockerline pleaded guilty in December to one count of conspiracy to commit stalking through interstate travel and using a facility of interstate commerce.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Waselchuck declined to comment on Sunday and lawyers for the other three men did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday.</p><p>“Journalists are accustomed to covering crime rather than becoming victims of crime,” Jim Schachter, the president and chief executive of New Hampshire Public Radio, said on Sunday. “If this sentencing and the attention this case has drawn discourage others from attacking journalists just doing their jobs, a greater good will have come from this ugly episode.”</p><p>The harassment began after New Hampshire Public Radio <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/2022-03-22/eric-spofford-granite-recovery-center-nh-sexual-misconduct" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a story</a> in March 2022 that detailed allegations of sexual misconduct against Eric Spofford, who had owned the state’s largest network of drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Spofford is not named in the federal criminal complaint or the news release from the U.S. attorney’s office, and he has said that he had nothing to do with the vandalism. </p><p>Mr. Spofford filed a defamation lawsuit against New Hampshire Public Radio but a judge dismissed the case in December 2023.</p><p>The judge, Daniel St. Hilaire of Rockingham County Superior Court, said in an order that he had reviewed nearly 3,000 documents that detailed the station’s reporting and said that they “contain absolutely no evidence of falsity,” <a href="https://www.nhbr.com/judge-rules-former-business-owner-has-no-viable-basis-to-sue-nhpr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The New Hampshire Business Review</a> reported.</p><p>Mr. Spofford and his lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.</p><p>Lauren Chooljian, a senior reporter at New Hampshire Public Radio, reported and wrote the story about Mr. Spofford.</p><p>A month after it was published, a home where Ms. Chooljian used to live, her parents’ home and the home of her editor, Daniel Barrick, were vandalized.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Federal prosecutors said that Mr. Labarge, whom they described as “a close personal associate” of Mr. Spofford, asked Mr. Cockerline to vandalize Ms. Chooljian’s former home in Hanover, N.H.</p><p>In April 2022, Mr. Cockerline spray-painted in large, red letters a vulgar word on the front door of the home and threw a brick through an exterior window. Two other homes were vandalized in a similar way that night.</p><p>On the night of May 20, 2022, Mr. Cockerline spray-painted a vulgar word on the front of the home of Ms. Chooljian’s parents in Hampstead, N.H., and left a brick on the ground by their front door, prosecutors said.</p><p>Hours later, Mr. Waselchuck threw a brick through the window of Ms. Chooljian’s home in Melrose, Mass., and spray-painted the phrase “Just The Beginning” in large, red letters on the front of the house.</p><p>New Hampshire Public Radio earned a national Edward R. Murrow Award for Ms. Chooljian’s investigation. The station later released a podcast called “<a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/1179417899/the-13th-step" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The 13th Step</a>” about the reporting and the harassment that followed. The podcast was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2024.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
