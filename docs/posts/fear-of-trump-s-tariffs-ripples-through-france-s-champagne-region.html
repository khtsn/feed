Working in a buttery morning light, a dozen field hands secured knotted brown vines to wires ahead of the spring growing season on freshly plowed earth in the shadow of the Champagne-producing town Reuil, just west of Épernay.</p><p>Even these jobs were at risk, said Patrick Andrade, who runs a small company that helps maintain Champagne vineyards. The 12-hectare (30-acre) plot belongs to a small house that exports to the United States, he said.</p><p>Should sales fall, wine producers would need fewer field hands, and there would be less work for tractor operators, cork makers and bottle makers.
