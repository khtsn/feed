The C.I.A.’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Born in Nebraska in the 1920s, Malcolm X rose to prominence in the Nation of Islam, the Black nationalist group, and became an at times controversial but fiery and persuasive leader.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A year before his killing, he had left the Nation of Islam and started the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/10/archives/malcolm-x-organization-of-afroamerican-unity.html" title="">Organization of Afro-American Unity</a>. On Feb. 21, 1965, as he began to speak in Washington Heights about the new group, three gunmen rushed the stage and shot him in front of his pregnant wife and three of his daughters.</p><p>For decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/nyregion/malcolm-x-assassination-case-reopened.html" title="">historians cast doubt on official accounts</a> and on the guilt of Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam. A joint investigation by the Manhattan district attorney’s office and lawyers for the two men found in 2021 that prosecutors, the police and the F.B.I. had withheld key evidence at the time. It also found that authorities knew that the Nation of Islam had been targeting Malcolm X.</p><p>Days before Malcolm X was killed, his family had escaped <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/02/15/101527042.html?pageNumber=1" title="">a firebomb attack</a> on their home in Queens. A bomb had been thrown into the nursery where his four young daughters were, Ms. Shabazz said Friday.</p><p>Anthony V. Bouza, a police detective who worked on the original murder investigation, <a href="https://www.theragblog.com/books-tony-bouza-manning-marables-malcolm-x/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in 2011</a> that it had been “botched.” Mr. Bouza, whose estate is named as a defendant in the suit, wrote that a “parallel tragedy lies in the N.Y.P.D.’s obvious stonewalling of any release of records likely to help our understanding.”</p><p>The actions and inaction of the law enforcement agencies led to the conditions that allowed the gunmen to kill Malcolm X, the suit claims.</p><p>“For decades, Malcolm X’s wife, Betty Shabazz, the plaintiffs and their entire family have suffered the pain of the unknown,” the suit says. “They did not know who murdered Malcolm X, why he was murdered, the level of N.Y.P.D., F.B.I. and C.I.A. orchestration, the identity of the governmental agents who conspired to ensure his demise, or who fraudulently covered up their role.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko">More about Hurubie Meko</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>32</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Malcolm X Family Sues F.B.I., C.I.A. and Police Over His Killing<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Housing Crunch:</strong> Our new five-part series looks to not just explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/nyregion/housing-crunch-affordable-housing.html">New York City’s affordable housing crisis</a> is so difficult to solve but also explore what people are doing about it.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Rightward Shift:</strong> New York City has rarely been as liberal as the rest of the nation thinks it is, and the results of the presidential election <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/trump-nyc-voters.html">clearly indicate that Donald Trump made inroads in the city</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Urban Beekeeping:</strong> At many offices in Manhattan, the level of activity remains well below prepandemic levels.
