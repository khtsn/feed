Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/11/arts/eurovision-final" title="">the competition was overshadowed</a> by protests over Israel’s involvement because of the country’s military campaign in Gaza.</p><p>Austria was represented this year by JJ, a classically trained singer, who performed “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ieSTNpxvio" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wasted Love</a>,” a dramatic song about heartbreak. He received 436 points to Israel’s 357.</p><p>Sweden, the pre-event favorite, came fourth.</p><p>Austria last won the competition in 2014, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/arts/music/conchita-wurst.html" title="">Conchita Wurst, a bearded drag queen,</a> triumphed with “Rise Like a Phoenix.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>JJ, a 24-year-old whose real name is Johannes Pietsch, is a countertenor, meaning that his vocal range most closely matches that of a female mezzo-soprano.

Some 6,500 fans cheered in the arena throughout.</p><p>Last year’s competition, held in Malmo, Sweden, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/11/arts/music/eurovision-final-winner.html" title="">had an altogether different atmosphere</a>. The lead-up to the final had been tense after some fans, and even some performers in the competition, protested Israel’s presence there because of its actions in the war in Gaza. Some audience members in the arena for the event booed loudly when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/arts/music/eurovision-israel-eden-golan-hurricane.html" title="">Israel’s contestant, Eden Golan</a>, performed, though others cheered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This year, Israel was represented by Yuval Raphael, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/arts/music/yuval-raphael-israel-eurovision-2025.html" title="">a survivor of the Hamas-led October 2023 attacks</a> on southern Israel. During her performance at the Eurovision final, only a handful of boos and whistles were audible in the arena.</p><p>Before the final, many Eurovision fans had speculated that Celine Dion, the Canadian singer, would make an appearance onstage. Dion won Eurovision in 1988, representing Switzerland with <a href="https://youtu.be/VXLWfXmlXPc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi”</a> (“Don’t Leave Without Me”), and fans had hoped that she would reprise that track in Basel, even though she has barely appeared in public since 2022, when she announced that she had a rare neurological disorder known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/well/live/stiff-person-syndrome-symptoms-treatment.html" title="">stiff person syndrome</a>. In the end, Dion was absent from Saturday’s event.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>JJ thanked the voters and called on them to “spread more love” in the world.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fabrice Coffrini/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>JJ, who spent most of his childhood in Dubai, started singing classically at age 15 when he moved to Austria.

He began watching YouTube videos of performances by Maria Callas and Montserrat Caballé and imitating those renowned sopranos, he said.</p><p>JJ said that he hoped his performance would “awaken interest in classical music” among Eurovision’s viewers.</p><p>After the winning the trophy, he sang “Wasted Love” a second time during the final, and finished with a piercing “high C.” Then, he burst into tears.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alex Marshall is a Times reporter covering European culture.
