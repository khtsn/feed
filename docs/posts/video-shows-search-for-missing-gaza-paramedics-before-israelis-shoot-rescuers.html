They termed the killings “a full-fledged war crime” and called on the United Nations Security Council and the international community to demand accountability and an independent investigation.</p><p>The Israeli military, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/world/middleeast/israel-killing-rescue-workers-gaza.html" title="">admitted to killing</a> the 15 men, said on Monday that a “preliminary inquiry indicated that the troops opened fire due to a perceived threat following a previous encounter in the area,” and it would continue investigating. It said that six of those killed “were identified as Hamas terrorists,” but cited no evidence.</p><p>The Red Crescent and the United Nations have said that the dead were unarmed aid workers who posed no threat. They said the men were wearing their uniforms and riding in clearly marked emergency vehicles, flashing their emergency lights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>An Israeli military official <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/world/middleeast/israel-killing-rescue-workers-gaza.html" title="">who briefed reporters</a> on the incident on Saturday declined to say whether the men were armed.</p><p>Also on Monday, an Israeli strike near a hospital in southern Gaza killed two people, including a journalist for the Palestine Today news agency, bringing the number of Palestinian journalists killed in the war to 210, Gaza’s government press office said.

A Red Crescent ambulance responded and was hit by Israeli gunfire, according to the aid group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>When a convoy of emergency vehicles — including two more Red Crescent ambulances, as well as an ambulance and a fire truck from Gaza’s Civil Defense service — arrived to rescue the first ambulance, Israeli troops fired again, in a five-minute-long barrage.</p><p>Dr. Younis Al-Khatib, the Palestine Red Crescent Society’s president, said the Israeli troops had set up an “ambush” for the convoy. Israeli forces then shot at a fourth Red Crescent ambulance that came to help the others, Red Crescent officials said. A worker on the field security team for the U.N.’s agency for Palestinian refugees was among those killed, according to an agency spokeswoman, Tamara Alrifai.</p><p>The attack on the convoy was captured in a video the Red Crescent said was later discovered on the cellphone of one of the paramedics who was killed.

On Monday, the Red Crescent said that all but one of the bodies were discovered piled together in a black mesh bag and buried “in a brutal and degrading manner that violates human dignity.”</p><p>Preliminary autopsies showed multiple gunshot wounds to the upper parts of the men&#39;s bodies, Dr. Al-Khatib said at the news conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the Palestine Red Crescent and other emergency services carry bodies of fellow rescue workers killed a week earlier by Israeli forces, during a funeral procession in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on March 31.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The video released on Monday, shows the convoy racing down dark roads to rescue the ambulance that had disappeared. The man who recorded it, identified as Rifaat Radwan, a Red Crescent paramedic, is heard praying repeatedly that his co-workers are alive and asking God to protect them.</p><p>As his ambulance barrels down a road lit only by its headlights, Mr. Radwan says to the driver, “We’re calling their phones and no one is answering.” Naming the three missing colleagues, he says, “Ezzedine usually answers, and so do Mustafa and Munther.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The ambulance pulls up next to another ambulance, and after some discussion about where to find the missing ambulance, the two crews join a convoy that includes the Civil Defense ambulance and fire truck. Someone tells Mr. Radwan to stop recording.</p><p>“These moments need to be documented,” he replies. “Oh Lord, let them be OK May the injuries be minor.”</p><p>A little while later, the convoy comes upon the missing ambulance, a white shape beside the road. The vehicles stop, and some of the paramedics get out.</p><p>Then staccato gunfire can be heard for about five minutes, mingled with Mr. Radwan’s desperate prayers.</p><p>At one point, he addresses his mother. “Forgive me, Mom, forgive me,” he says. “I swear I only chose this path to help others.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>His last words before the video ends: “The Israeli soldiers are coming, the Israeli soldiers are coming.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A grieving woman is comforted as she mourns the medics killed in the Israeli attack on the rescuers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Hiba Yazbek<!-- --> contributed reporting from Jerusalem.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Yee is a Times reporter covering North Africa and the broader Middle East.
