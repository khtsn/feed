Residents were already trying to organize fund-raisers, hold vigils and pull together money to support the victims and their families, just as they had done in the past in this agricultural region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Six years ago, residents here suffered through the Camp fire, which killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise about 20 miles up the road. And a year before the blaze, everyone in Oroville had to toss their belongings into a vehicle and scramble out of town one night, fearing that the towering Oroville Dam would erupt at any minute.</p><p>In Wednesday’s shooting, the authorities believe the gunman, identified as Glenn Litton, 56, had targeted the parochial school because of its affiliation with the Seventh-day Adventists, a Protestant Christian denomination. He later killed himself.</p><p>Mr. Litton had scheduled an appointment on Wednesday with Feather River’s principal to discuss the possibility of enrolling his grandson in the school — a meeting that now appears to have been a pretense to enter the tightly-guarded school grounds, the authorities said.</p><p>Shortly after the meeting and a tour, Mr. Litton walked toward the exit as though he was leaving the campus. Then, he abruptly turned around and headed toward the playground, the authorities said. </p><p>The principal heard gunshots and screams.</p><p>Sheriff’s deputies and a California Highway Patrol officer arrived minutes after a 911 call was placed and found the two injured boys and Mr. Litton, who had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The authorities said that Mr. Litton had suffered from mental health issues for decades. Based on writings they uncovered after the shooting, investigators said that he believed that he was an officer in a paramilitary organization tasked with performing child executions.</p><p>It’s unclear why Mr. Litton chose the Feather River school, as he appears to have had no connection to the campus. He did, however, attend an Adventist school in Paradise as a child, said Kory L. Honea, the Butte County sheriff.</p><p>Mr. Litton had also scheduled an appointment for Thursday at another Adventist school, in Red Bluff, Sheriff Honea said.</p><p>Born in nearby Chico, Mr. Litton had a criminal history that dated back to his teenage years and included convictions for identity theft, forgery and petty theft, the authorities said. He had been incarcerated several times, though the authorities noted that none of his previous crimes were violent.</p><p>Mr. Litton, however, could not legally buy a gun because he was a felon. Mr. Honea said investigators believed that the handgun that Mr. Litton used was a homemade, untraceable gun made of parts from different weapons, often called a “ghost gun.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Roman was struck by two bullets that punctured his liver and spleen, Ms. Diaz said. He is being treated at U.C. Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, where he has undergone multiple surgeries and has two more scheduled for Friday.</p><p>Roman has a twin brother, and both boys began attending Feather River this fall, Ms. Diaz said. Their mother, a practicing Adventist who lives in Oroville, chose the campus in part because of its strict security protocols, Ms. Diaz said.</p><p>She added that Roman loved Spiderman and was the more outgoing of the twins.</p><p>“He’s a little daredevil,” she said. “He’s always happy. He’s just a typical little boy, so much energy, you can never get him to sit down.”</p><p>Elias was struck by one bullet in his abdomen, Sheriff Honea said. The sheriff said that he had visited both boys and their families in the trauma center and that he expected that both would spend many more days in the hospital.</p><p>“They have a very long road ahead of them in terms of recovery,” he said. “But the fact that they are currently still with us, I think, is a miracle and something we should all be very thankful for.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Feather River Adventist campus, which serves about 35 students, is a familiar marker for locals, rising from the fields along Highway 70, the main road that leads south to Sacramento. It also has hosted local basketball games and other community events.</p><p>Stephanie Reynolds Bever, who was born and raised in Oroville, was planning a vigil for Friday to support the boys’ families, immediately before the town’s annual Christmas tree lighting, she said.</p><p>“Everyone wants to help in some way,” said Ms. Reynolds Bever, 56. “I just want to bring the community together as a whole and lift those babies up and their families.”</p><p>Dale Orlando, whose daughter is in sixth grade at Feather River, said the tragedy had shaken families at the campus. Parents had been looking forward to attending the school’s Christmas play on Saturday. Instead, they were left on Thursday trying to process the tragedy.</p><p>“We’re all family. We all go to the same church,” he said. “We’re just trying to hold our loved ones closer now.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Seventh-day Adventists, who are known in part for their religious observances on Saturdays instead of Sundays, run several hospitals and schools in Northern California, where they have a long history. The first Adventist church on the West Coast opened in Santa Rosa, Calif., in 1869, and the oldest Adventist hospital in the nation was built in 1878 in St. Helena in the Napa Valley.</p><p>The Northern California Conference of the Seventh-day Adventists said on Thursday that it had closed all its schools to “allow everyone to spend time with their families.”</p><p>“We are deeply saddened by the events that occurred today,” the organization said in a statement. “Join us as we lift up these children and their families in prayer.”</p><p>Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> and <!-- -->Mandy Feder-Sawyer<!-- --> contributed to this report.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
