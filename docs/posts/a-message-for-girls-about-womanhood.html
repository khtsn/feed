His victory was seen as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/01/america-misogyny-gender-politics-trump/680753/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic-am&amp;utm_term=The+Atlantic+AM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a setback</a> for women; the defeat of Kamala Harris, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/11/06/women-react-to-kamala-harris-loss/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a reflection</a> of entrenched <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/11/13/opinion-kamala-harris-misogyny-racism-toxic-masculinity/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">misogyny</a>.

True, 45 percent of women voted for Trump, but for the rest of us, end times: “What are the other women — those who feel that they’re living in a nation that is hostile to their very existence — to do?” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/election-2024-trump-reproductive-rights/680572/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a writer for</a> The Atlantic asked.</p><p>Given this grim outlook, who wouldn’t bemoan or regret her sex?</p><p>Girls are already feeling stymied and dispirited. According to a <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/girls-self-confidence-has-plummeted-a-new-survey-shows/2023/11" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2023 survey</a> of more than 17,500 girls, girls’ self-confidence has plunged since 2017. Their levels of anxiety are way up. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/health/teenage-girl-depression-sadness-pandemic.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240807&amp;instance_id=131006&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=13209773&amp;segment_id=174425&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=a92c5b5c754103b124349f9961946e6e" title="">a recent report</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 53 percent of girls reported extreme depressive symptoms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There are plenty of reasons behind these trends. But it’s worth asking if part of the problem is that girls see womanhood less as something to look forward to than as something to dread. The constant emphasis on female vulnerabilities and worst-case scenarios not only overplays the extent of the challenges, it also fails to offer a full or accurate picture of what it means to be a woman in America today.</p><p>After all, by multiple measures, particularly with regard to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2024/08/07/women-continue-to-outpace-men-in-college-enrollment-and-graduation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">academic</a> <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2024/01/women-outnumber-men-in-us-law-school-classrooms-but-statistics-dont-tell-the-full-story/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and</a> <a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/women-are-changing-face-medicine-america#:~:text=Women%20drive%20growth%20in%20the%20largest%20specialties&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20these%2020%20specialties,physicians%20in%20the%20United%20States.&amp;text=Among%20the%2020%20largest%20specialties,Gastroenterology%20%E2%80%94%20219%25" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">career</a> <a href="https://www.bestlawyers.com/article/women-making-strides-in-the-legal-field/5274" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">achievement</a>, American girls and women are thriving. (The opposite sex, alas, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/books/of-boys-and-men/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not so much</a>.) After 50 years of legal gains and social progress, however incomplete, this is objectively the best time in history to be a woman in America. Yet our culture continues to portray womanhood as a problem that happens to girls rather than as something intrinsically powerful.</p><p>Perhaps it’s time to consider a more encouraging message.</p><p><strong>Women know</strong> firsthand that the messages we receive as young girls matter. Born on the heels of the women’s movement, I never learned about girls’ supposed inferiority. When I was a child, I didn’t think about whether being female was an advantage or a disadvantage because I didn’t think about it at all. Perhaps I was an outlier in the wider world, but in my liberal enclave of New York we were all just kids.</p><p>People talk about the carefree childhoods of the 1970s, when second graders walked to school alone and gathered in packs like a bunch of Peanuts until dinnertime. What often goes unmentioned is how girls especially were encouraged to be more carefree. I was never made to worry about how feminine or girly I appeared, or whether I was enough of a girl. Though not a tomboy, I mostly wore the same striped turtlenecks and corduroys as my brothers.</p><p>In the media I was exposed to, “Sesame Street” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/04/opinion/free-to-be-you-and-me-anni.html" title="">Free to Be You and Me</a>,” differences between boys and girls were a side note, a matter of distant reproductive functions as set out in the ubiquitous 1968 manual “<a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/how-babies-are-made_steven-schepp_blake-hampton/246333/item/29931997/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=high_vol_midlist_standard_shopping_customer_acquisition&amp;utm_adgroup=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=666157863328&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA9bq6BhAKEiwAH6bqoNHSIA7TGBCJimMRdkRIAPR6uOx_eRZ6inQSQqZDZUzYqQLrNVTfXBoCoPEQAvD_BwE#idiq=29931997&amp;edition=8479340" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How Babies Are Made</a>.” I truly had no idea there’d even been a fight for women’s rights because the battle seemed won.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Thirty years on, when I had a daughter, I marveled at the number of newly available children’s books about girls and women struggling throughout history but was conflicted over reading them to her aloud. Why introduce a young child to the notion that girls were ever considered less than boys? The last thing I wanted to do was encourage a mind-set of grievance or inferiority. I wanted my daughter to grow up assuming she was tough, not needing to be told she wasn’t weak. To my eye, the barrage of “Girl power” posters and exhortations of “empowerment” unwittingly betray a certain defensiveness and desperation.</p><p>I often think about an anecdote <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/10/miss-independent-katharine-hepburns-obsessive-originality" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Katharine Hepburn</a> told of her childhood. Once, when young Katharine was spotted climbing a tall tree, a neighbor ran to Katharine’s mother in alarm. “Kathy is in the top of the hemlock,” she cried. “Yes, I know,” her mother replied. “Don’t scare her. She doesn’t know that it’s dangerous.”</p><p><strong>I have a</strong> vivid memory of the point at which I could no longer wrestle my little brothers to the ground and had to accept that I’d be the one pinned down in the end. (The punishment was that the winner could drool onto the loser’s face.) Not having had my supposed disadvantages drummed into me, my relative physical weakness came as a surprise.</p><p>Just as sex stereotypes were avoided in liberal circles of the 1970s, so were sex differences. The goal of the women’s movement had been total equality; emphasizing biological difference was often seen as impeding women from achieving that. In that spirit, and in line with what was known as “equality feminism,” which argued for equitable treatment in both the domestic and public spheres, women were often reluctant to call out biological distinctions for fear they’d be held against them.</p><p>Imagine letting that fear go. What if we acknowledged that when it comes to innate sex differences, women may be less physically strong than men, but that does not mean we are fundamentally disadvantaged?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Because all these years later, we still allow our differences to be framed in largely negative ways: Our bodies are treated like hardships that will inevitably betray us. Female hormones are viewed as a liability, a source of inconstancy and reactivity, whereas male hormones are seen as a source of stamina and strength, even though it’s equally true that the sexual impulses and poorly channeled aggression stimulated by testosterone wreak their own havoc. Also undervalued are the ways in which female hormones are conducive to emotional processing, empathy, sexuality, sensitivity and bonding. Many women take these superpowers for granted.</p><p>Even women’s greatest physical power — our ability to bring life into this world — is framed as a form of weakness and constraint at least as much as it is embraced. It is certainly true that governments can deny women control of their bodies, that women disproportionately bear the responsibility of birth control and suffer both from unwanted pregnancies and pregnancies that are wanted but not achieved. Not all women can or choose to give birth. Pregnancy and childbirth can be arduous, even life-threatening. No one can deny these realities.</p><p>But childbearing is also a form of strength. Like many women, I didn’t breeze through pregnancy and I crumbled quickly under the pain of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/19/opinion/abortion-adoption-birth-risk.html" title="">childbirth</a>, but the fact that I endured it three times, albeit with serious painkillers, felt like a feat. There is simply no other human activity that approaches its physical or emotional magnitude.</p><p>As for pregnancy, I never got over the marvel of growing another life inside my own body. Those first flutters, the startling hiccups and kicks, the knowledge you are carrying within an entire being: All of it is miraculous, the most manifest way to experience our species’ resilience. To many women I know, these positive elements of womanhood came as a complete surprise.</p><p>In a similar vein, we minimize the joys of breastfeeding for women. We dwell on the pressures, the difficulties, the reality that not every woman or infant is able to nurse. We reduce the conversation to a debate over health benefits to the baby and the trade-offs for women. Why not also mention the deep satisfaction of feeding one’s own, the rush of oxytocin and the bond it creates between mother and child?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Women are lucky. Yet discussion and celebration of our fortune or fortitude don’t make it into public discourse nearly enough.</p><p>Perhaps one reason women don’t talk about these things is because we don’t want to make other women feel less than for their own choices or abilities. We may also unwittingly play into what the dominant culture says about women’s misfortunes.</p><p>But we cannot refuse to let in good news simply because we also feel bad about the bad. What we choose <em>not</em> to talk about is just as important as what we do.</p><p>Surely, a half-century after the dawn of the modern women&#39;s movement, we should be able to openly celebrate our advantages. Recognizing fundamental sex differences need not mean acceding to inequality.</p><p><strong>Looking at the</strong> messages about womanhood to which my daughter is subjected, the fearmongering and pessimism, the unforgiving judgments over the right way to be a girl or a woman, I see how I benefited from being less freighted by dire warnings, less frightened about how others might perceive women and more confident in my ability to handle things — and not because I was particularly exceptional but because of what I considered the norm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>While it is undeniable that societal and cultural forces still affect women’s place in American society, they need not determine how girls or women conceive of<em> themselves</em>. Sex differences are real, but sex stereotypes are not. No girl should grow up thinking that being “feminine” is a prerequisite to being female. How girls look or behave is their choice.</p><p>And while young women should be aware of misogyny, they should equally be aware that they have the means to resist it. They should know that while women are often perceived as weak, in reality, women are remarkably strong, and girls are much tougher than they’ve been told.</p><p>Most important, we should make sure girls realize that womanhood is something to look forward to. And that they are lucky to have been born female.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Pamela Paul is an Opinion columnist at The Times, writing about culture, politics, ideas and the way we live now. <span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
