And in a concise joke delivered deftly, he said: “Bob Dylan wanted to be here, but not that badly.”</p><p>The whole thing had a light touch: little roasting and no politics. The edgiest joke might have been when he promised that no A.I. was used in making the Oscars, before fessing up: “We used child labor.” But you got the sense this punchline mattered less than his follow-up, when Conan added out of nowhere: “We lost little Billy.” Not since David Letterman, the most underrated Oscar host of the modern era, has a monologue been this loopy.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the World of Comedy</h2><hr/><ul><li><p>Michael Palin, the Monty Python veteran, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/arts/television/michael-palin-monty-python-diaries.html">looks back on his experiences</a> performing in the revered sketch troupe and touring the world as a travel host.</p></li><li><p>Tom Green, a Y2K-era phenomenon most famous for his MTV prank show and surreal brand of comedy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/arts/television/tom-green-show-amazon-prime.html">is returning to the spotlight</a> with a flurry of new projects for Amazon Prime Video.</p></li><li><p>In a world where comics are pressured to post constantly on social media, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/arts/television/netflix-comedy-marketing.html">they often spend more time on promotion</a> than they do on jokes, at the expense of the art form.</p></li><li><p>The comedian Youngmi Mayer is fearless on TikTok, about her Korean American identity and foodie culture.
