Trump’s campaign message. Polls show Americans still see it as a major problem. And several high-profile homicides this year, including the recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/24/nyregion/nyc-subway-fire-what-to-know.html" title="">killing</a> of a homeless woman who was set on fire in a New York subway, may fan concerns.</p><p>But in 2023, the number of murders fell at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/murder-crime-rate-fbi.html" title="">steepest rate ever recorded</a>, according to the F.B.I.’s data.</p><p>That trend may be continuing, according to data from a mix of sources covering most or part of 2024. In some major cities, the numbers are at or below what they were before the pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Through October, data collected by the Real-Time Crime Index, based on reports from hundreds of law enforcement agencies, showed a nearly 16 percent decline in murders from 2023. The F.B.I.’s preliminary data for the first half of the year showed an even steeper decline.</p><p>But the F.B.I.’s data for the year is not yet complete, and it will not be until next year. Even with all of the statistics, the data set may not reflect the fullest picture on crime across the nation, as some law enforcement agencies do not report their numbers to the F.B.I.</p><p>Even with the data limitations, experts said the overall trend of declining murders nationally was clear. And several major cities saw striking reversals in the number of murders over the last two years.</p><p>Detroit, which last year recorded the lowest number of homicides in 57 years, is on track to see even fewer this year, according to the city’s data. In San Francisco, homicides have fallen by a third, according to that <a href="https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/stay-safe/crime-data/crime-dashboard" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">city’s Police Department</a>. Chicago has so far recorded its lowest number of homicides and shootings since 2019, city data shows.</p><p>Other crime categories also had declines. Car thefts, which had risen steadily over the last few years, have fallen by about 20 percent this year, according to the Real-Time Crime Index. The number of rapes and aggravated assaults have also slightly declined.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Despite positive signs in many places, murders are still above their prepandemic levels in some cities, including in <a href="https://compstat.nypdonline.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York City</a> and <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/dailycrime" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Washington, D.C</a>.</p><p>But New York still has seen a roughly 7 percent drop in murders and shootings this year, according to New York Police Department data through mid-December, compared with the same time period last year. Incidents of rape, however, surged 20 percent from around 1,400 last year to 1,685.</p><p>There have been upticks in crime in some cities, as well. <a href="https://www.charlottenc.gov/cmpd/News-Information/Crime-Statistics-Report" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Charlotte, N.C.</a>, and <a href="https://www.longbeach.gov/globalassets/police/media-library/documents/crime-info/statistics/2024/2024-11_monthly_ibr" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Long Beach, Calif.</a>, saw an increase in violent crime in the first three quarters of this year, according to data from those cities. And in nearly two dozen cities, shoplifting appeared to be on the rise, according to the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Car thefts spiked 12 percent in 2023, but have fallen in many cities this year.

In most places, it’s because there’s less gun violence and shooting.”</p><p>The number of murders spiked in 2020, when the pandemic disrupted family finances, schools, social services, courts and policing. Now, homicides are falling more rapidly than many other crimes. The reasons are likely to be debated for years to come, but researchers said the return to normalcy after pandemic lockdowns has played a key role.</p><p>Local law enforcement leaders also said they took targeted steps to fight the wave of homicides.</p><p>In Boston, the number of homicides last year fell to one of the lowest figures in two decades, according to police data. In 2024, with less than a week left in the year, the city was on track to see an even smaller number of murders, according to Boston officials.</p><p>The city focused on the areas where most shootings occurred, did more community engagement and expanded youth programming, officials said. Mayor Michelle Wu said in an interview that the goal now is “to end violence in Boston.”</p><p>Detroit leaders say a community violence intervention program that started in mid-2023 helped the city <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/news/after-one-year-detroit-community-violence-initiative-all-6-cvi-zones-record-historic-reductions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reduce the number of murders</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In San Francisco, where worries about crime have been a hot-button political issue, homicides are on track to reach the city’s lowest rate since the 1960s, according to the police chief, William Scott.</p><p>Chief Scott said the department also made car break-ins a focus. Among other tactics, the department used “bait cars” to apprehend thieves, helping to reduce the number of break-ins from about 19,000 in 2023 to 9,000 this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>High-profile killings, like the death of a homeless woman who was burned on a New York subway, may raise concerns despite a broader decline in violent crime.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Still, concern about crime remains politically salient. About a quarter of Americans say crime is an extremely serious problem, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/652763/smaller-majorities-say-crime-serious-increasing.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to a Gallup poll, a larger share than at almost any time this century. The poll found that about two-thirds of Americans surveyed believe crime increased in the last year, although that represented a drop from the previous year, when it was just over three-quarters.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/04/us/trump-crime-fact-check.html" title="">campaign trail</a>, Mr. Trump insisted that F.B.I. data was “fake” and that crime is “through the roof.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The numbers are falling back to earth, but a combination of high-profile national incidents and street-level disorder are keeping people on edge,” said Adam Gelb, president and C.E.O. of the Council on Criminal Justice.</p><p>Charles Fain Lehman, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said the perception of disorder, including shoplifting and public drug use, may help explain Americans’ worries, even though “major crime is objectively very rare.”</p><p>In 23 cities, shoplifting was up by about 25 percent in the first half of 2024, according to a report by the Council on Criminal Justice, though it noted it was unclear whether that was because of more reporting by retailers. Shoplifting increased by nearly 40 percent in California in 2023, according to the state’s <a href="https://www.ppic.org/blog/commercial-burglaries-fell-in-2023-but-shoplifting-continued-to-rise/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Justice Department</a>.</p><p>California voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/california-crime-election.html" title="">overwhelmingly passed</a> a ballot measure imposing harsher penalties for shoplifting and drug possession. In Los Angeles and Oakland, they turned out liberal district attorneys who had promised to reduce incarceration and hold the police accountable.</p><p>And despite declines in all major crime categories in San Francisco, voters there showed their discontent by ousting Mayor London Breed in favor of Daniel Lurie, an heir to the Levi Strauss fortune. Mr. Lurie, a first-time candidate, campaigned on promises to fight open-air drug markets and reduce encampments of homeless people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“When people have an experience or see things that impact their quality of life, it can be unsettling,” Chief Scott said, citing encounters with individuals in drug-induced psychosis as an example.</p><p>Some major cities have experienced different trends. Washington recorded a substantial increase in murders in 2023, though this year, the number had dipped back closer to 2019 levels.</p><p>Charlotte recorded 106 murders as of mid-December, above last year’s tally and above its five-year average of about 93. Local leaders and residents are especially concerned about a specific data point from the police: an increase in the <a href="https://www.charlottenc.gov/cmpd/News-Information/Crime-Statistics-Report#:~:text=Even%20more%20disturbing%20and%20disheartening,vs%204%20YTD%20in%202023)." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">number</a> of teenage victims in homicides in the first half of the year. That data also shows an uptick in the number of teenagers who are suspects in homicides.</p><p>Apryl Alexander, director of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte’s Violence Prevention Center, said city nonprofits have responded by offering mentoring programs and activities for teenagers.</p><p>She noted that as Charlotte grows, rents are increasing, “causing stress and strain on community.” But the explanation for the rise in violent crime is unclear.</p><p>“Why Charlotte?&#34; she asked. “That’s what we’re trying to figure out.”</p><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabelle Taft is a reporter covering national news and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their career.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabelle-taft">More about Isabelle Taft</a></span></p></div><div><p>Kate Selig is a Times national reporter and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their career.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-selig">More about Kate Selig</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/federal-bureau-of-investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/police-department-san-francisco-calif">Police Department (San Francisco, Calif)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/30/us/murders-decline-crime-concerns.html">87</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/30/us/murders-decline-crime-concerns.html">87</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
