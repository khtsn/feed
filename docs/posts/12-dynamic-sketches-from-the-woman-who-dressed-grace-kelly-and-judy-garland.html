In 1923, when Ms. Head saw a job posting from Paramount seeking a costume sketch artist, she asked students at the art school where she was working to give her sketches that she could pass off as her own.<strong> </strong>The apparent versatility of her portfolio amazed the studio’s chief costume designer, Howard Greer.</p><p>When Ms. Head started at the job and her abilities weren’t quite as advertised, Mr. Greer told her he had always known she had borrowed the sketches. He hired her, Ms. Head <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDGbI0i2nCg&amp;t=75s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recalled years later</a>, because “anyone who had that much desire to get into the studio deserved the job.”</p><p>On Thursday morning, a dozen of Ms. Head’s sketches from the 1950s and ’60s (these are actually hers) <a href="https://doyle.com/auction/24th02-stage--screen/?au=9014" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were put up for sale by Doyle</a>, an auction house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The <a href="https://doyle.com/auction/search/?st=Edith%20Head&amp;sto=0&amp;au=9014" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lots</a> included art from two of the most recognizable characters Ms. Head ever dressed: Grace Kelly’s Frances Stevens in “To Catch a Thief” (two sketches of costumes for Ms. Kelly in the film went for $5,000 apiece) and Kim Novak’s Madeleine Elster in “Vertigo” (final bid: $1,800).</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-1"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Head was a frequent collaborator with Alfred Hitchcock.

Her range was expansive, if often reliant on a snugly nipped waist.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Head, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/27/obituaries/edith-head-fashion-designer-for-the-movies-dies.html" title="">died in 1981</a>, concocted several ways to highlight the ambitious shoulders of Anne Baxter and Bette Davis in “All About Eve,” she made endless variations on a delicate little skirt suit for the heroines of Alfred Hitchcock nail-biters, and she designed full skirts that seemed entirely made of glitter for festive eyepoppers like “White Christmas.”<strong> </strong>She popularized the sarong, the toreador pant and other fashions from abroad for Western audiences. Still, she remained cleareyed about her limits with a resigned humor, famously saying, “You can lead a horse to water and you can even make it drink, but you can’t make actresses wear what they don’t want to wear.”</p><p>Colleen Atwood, the Oscar-winning costume designer for “Chicago” and “Memoirs of a Geisha,” praised Ms. Head’s restraint. “I have always liked Edith Head because she designs with simplicity,” Ms. Atwood said. “It’s not over-designed.”</p><p>Ms. Atwood, 76, had a poster of one of Ms. Head’s designs for “The Birds” hanging in her apartment in London while she was working on the Netflix series “Wednesday.” She said that Tippi Hedren’s icy wool suit was a direct inspiration for Gwendolyn Christie’s character in the show.</p><p>Ms. Atwood also reported a Head sighting in the wild — at Studio 54 in the 1970s. “She came in with this entourage of young, beautiful boys,” Ms. Atwood recalled on Sunday. “Edith had on this black top, this Pop Art black-and-white skirt. She looked amazing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-6"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A design for Judy Garland in “I Could Go On Singing.” “No flare as before,” Ms. Head instructs in a note.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Edith Head/Collection of Emerio Gonzalez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A heavily annotated sketch for a costume for “The Geisha Boy” offers technical guidance for Ms. Head’s Paramount colleagues.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Edith Head/Collection of Emerio Gonzalez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Throughout her career, Ms. Head exhibited an intuitive skill for self-promotion by going on radio shows, selling dress patterns, writing instructive books and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071350/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even playing herself on “Columbo.”</a> Perhaps to set herself apart from the actors and actresses around her, Ms. Head developed an signature style for her public image: round dark glasses, sleek curled bangs and little suits, as tightly styled as her witticisms.</p><p>Drake Stutesman, a film scholar and historian, said that Ms. Head “was inventive and simple and sexy — she was very good at those three things together. This could be on Mae West and it could be on Audrey Hepburn.”</p><p>Ms. Head’s influence in the world of fashion started right away: After the release of her wardrobe for Mae West in 1933’s “She Done Him Wrong,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/03/style/elsa-schiaparelli-exhibition-surrealism-paris.html" title="">Elsa Schiaparelli</a> designed hourglass-emphasizing dresses topped with feathered hats and boas. But Ms. Head borrowed as much as she gave. In one notable minor scandal, she snubbed Hubert de Givenchy, withholding credit for his work in “Sabrina,” the 1954 romance starring Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn.</p><p>Ms. Head’s distinctive look made her an easy icon. She <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/37c-costume-design-single%3Anpm_2003.2011.46.3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeared on a postage stamp</a> in 2003 and in a <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/edith-heads-116th-birthday/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Doodle in 2013</a>, and though the exact inspiration is debated, Edna Mode, the gutsy costume designer character in “The Incredibles,” with her dark glasses and severe haircut, seems in the mode of Ms. Head.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mae West in “She Done Him Wrong,” one of the hundreds of films from the Golden Age of Hollywood with costumes designed by Edith Head.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettmann/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Even when surrounded by Hollywood stars, with her round-framed eyeglasses and curled microbangs, Ms. Head cut a distinctive figure.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Peter Costanzo, Doyle’s executive director for books, autographs and photographs, said Ms. Head’s sketches are notable for their dynamism. Contrasting Ms. Head’s illustrations with the more static sketches of other designers, which might show a character modeling a costume as if she were a clothes hanger, Mr. Costanzo, 44, pointed to a sketch of Judy Garland that was set to be auctioned. “In Edith Head’s costume sketches,” he said, “there is a lot of movement.”</p><p>Of the 12 Edith Head designs up for auction, all but one — the <a href="https://doyle.com/auction/lot/lot-29---a-unique-edith-head-design/?lot=1407969" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only sketch made and signed by an assistant</a>, not Ms. Head herself — found buyers. The two Grace Kelly designs fetched the highest sums, and although most of the hammer prices fell short of estimates, a partial sketch for a costume to be worn by Judy Garland in “I Could Go On Singing” that <a href="https://doyle.com/auction/lot/lot-24---a-partial-sketch-by-edith-head-for-judy-garland-in-i-could-go-on-singing/?lot=1407986" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">features no head but a deliciously jutted hip</a> drew a hammer price of $1,400 — more than double its upper estimate.</p><p>Most of Ms. Head’s sketches for sale were from the collection of Emerio Gonzalez, an interior designer and collector in St. Petersburg, Fla. Mr. Gonzalez, 64, started collecting costume sketches 30 years ago. He noted that Ms. Head had a strict attention to detail, evident in her penciled notes beside her drawings, which would sometimes feature notes like “don’t let the scarf cover this piece of jewelry.”</p><p>Ms. Head’s goddaughter, Melissa Galt, a business strategist for interior designers in Scottsdale, Ariz., said that like Ms. Galt’s mother, the actress Anne Baxter, Ms. Head had never stopped working.</p><p>“That passion is kind of rare,” Ms. Galt, 63, said. “There would have been a lot of doors and opportunities closed to her if she had not self-promoted.” She remembered “Aunt Edi” wore bright “big Mexican skirts, which was quite an interesting contrast” with her cultivated public image. She complimented her godmother for keeping secrets. When asked for an example of one, Ms. Galt said she didn’t know: “She kept them!”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Style Coverage</h2><h3>The latest in fashion, trends, love and more.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Sculpture Turned Necklace: </strong>Sophie Thatcher, the star of “Heretic,” doesn’t always wear <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/style/sophie-thatcher-heretic-necklace.html">the piece made by her twin sister</a>, but keeps it close.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emma Chamberlain’s Next Phase: </strong>The YouTube star, who has a coffee company, a podcast and a new collaboration with Warby Parker, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/style/emma-chamberlain-warby-parker.html">isn’t doing much posting</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dressing America: </strong>Aaron Levine has designed for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Club Monaco and Madewell. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/style/aaron-levine-mens-wear.html">Now, he’s introducing a brand of his own</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A New Face of Girl Power: </strong>The dancehall artist Shenseea’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/style/shenseea-dancehall-music-style.html">seductive songs about the pursuit of female pleasure</a> are making women “feel free.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rise of Zyn: </strong>The nicotine pouches have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/style/zyn-nicotine-pouch-masculinity.html">a new symbol of American masculinity</a> — and a surprising political lightning rod.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
