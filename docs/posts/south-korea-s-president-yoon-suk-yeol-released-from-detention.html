The procedural violation rendered Mr. Yoon’s detention invalid, the court said.</p><p>Prosecutors, who had a week to appeal the decision, requested instead that he be released.</p><p>Mr. Yoon smiled broadly, waving at supporters as he walked out of a detention center south of Seoul, where he had been held since Jan. 15.</p><p>His release does not affect the insurrection charge he faces in a Seoul criminal court related to his martial law declaration, or the separate proceedings at the Constitutional Court. That body is deliberating whether his parliamentary impeachment was legitimate, and if he should be formally removed from office. But it does mean that he will be free while standing trial.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><em>This is a developing story.
