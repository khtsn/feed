Kamala Harris has accepted her party’s ringing nomination. President Biden has been relegated to the wings, a lame duck before his time. What role should he play between now and January?</p><p>An answer is offered by Abraham Lincoln. One hundred sixty years ago, the fate of the nation hung on a presidential election, as it does now, and Lincoln, like Mr. Biden, was a lame duck — or at least he assumed he was. His most trusted advisers (including Henry J. Raymond, the editor of The Times), told him that his rival, the Democratic candidate George B. McClellan, was going to win. The Union armies had suffered staggering fatalities and scored no recent major victory.</p><p>Democratic operatives had spread rumors that the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was ready to negotiate for a restoration of the Union. Lincoln knew that Davis would never back down, but the propaganda worked. Many Northern voters were deceived into thinking that Lincoln’s insistence on Black freedom was the only thing keeping the war alive.</p><p>In response, on Aug. 23, 1864, Lincoln drafted the “Blind Memorandum” — a document from which Mr. Biden might take his cue. The memo <a href="https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/lincolns-blind-memo#:~:text=Then%20it%20will%20be%20my,not%20possibly%20save%20it%20afterwards." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stated</a> that if Lincoln lost the election, he would “cooperate with the president elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration.” Then Lincoln distributed it to his cabinet secretaries with the text hidden (hence it was “blind”) and told them to sign it even though they could not read it.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He thus committed his administration to a bipartisan mission to preserve the Union regardless of the election’s outcome. It was a risky move but a noble one, which reflected Lincoln’s insistence that nation had to come before party.</p><p>Presidential transitions, Lincoln understood, were at least as important as presidential elections. He had known as much since 1861, when the transition to his presidency had put the nation on the verge of civil war.</p><p>The potential volatility of a presidential transition is something Americans today should know about, too, especially in light of the disastrous 2020-21 transition, which too many people seem willing to dismiss as an anomaly. Regardless of the results of the upcoming election (and especially if Donald Trump loses), the next transition is likely to be as ugly as the last one. What will Mr. Biden do to preserve the Union during that trying time?</p><p>A few days before writing the Blind Memorandum, Lincoln held a meeting in the White House with War Democrats, the faction of the rival party that opposed peace negotiations with the Confederacy but also opposed the Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln argued that his opposition to slavery was not standing in the way of peace. Rather, emancipation would create a Union that would never again be rived by war.</p><p>Lincoln also met with the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass. He told Douglass that he expected to lose the election. The Slave South would then have its own nation. He asked Douglass to design a plan to convey as many enslaved Black people as possible from the South to the North before the new president took over, explaining that this was now the only way to ensure their freedom.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Like Lincoln in 1864, Mr. Biden in 2024 is the best-placed politician to protect the Union. Kamala Harris has called for national unity, but as a presidential candidate, she will have to be sharply partisan at times in the months to come. By contrast, Mr. Biden, as a lame duck, would lose nothing by reaching across the aisle. He can continue to push for his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/08/fact-sheet-president-bidens-unity-agenda-for-the-nation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unity Agenda for the Nation</a>, parts of which, such as fighting opioid addiction and enhancing veterans’ benefits, already have been adopted with bipartisan support.</p><p>More important, Mr. Biden will need to be bipartisan in overseeing the coming presidential transition. Regardless of how Americans vote in November, he will still be the most powerful person in the country and he will still control the messaging from the White House Press Room, the granting of presidential patronage (and pardons) and the policing powers of the executive. All of these tools, along with his Lincolnian deftness at working with partisan opponents, will be essential as he guides the nation through a turbulent time.</p><p>In the two weeks after Lincoln wrote the Blind Memorandum, two top Union officers won major military victories: Gen. William T. Sherman took Atlanta and Adm. David G. Farragut took Mobile Bay. These successes buoyed Lincoln’s popularity and gave the lie to claims that only peace negotiations could end the war. And as we know now, Lincoln ended up winning the 1864 election.</p><p>A few days after his victory was secure, Lincoln broke the seal of the Blind Memorandum and read it to his cabinet. Secretary of State William H. Seward mocked the spirit of bipartisanship that it promoted. If Lincoln had lost the election, he said, the lame duck’s political rivals would never have cooperated with him. Maybe so, Lincoln responded, but “at least I should have done my duty and have stood clear before my own conscience.” That goal should be Mr. Biden’s as well as he faces a presidential transition that, like the one envisioned by Lincoln, could leave the country in tatters.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Michael Vorenberg teaches at Brown University and is the author of the forthcoming book “Lincoln’s Peace: The Struggle to End the American Civil War.”</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
