condition as he undergoes treatment for pneumonia and a complex infection, the Vatican said Sunday.</p><p>Beyond the brief text — “The night passed quietly, the pope rested” — the Vatican did not provide further details, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/world/asia/mass-pope-francis-prayers-photos.html" title="">concerns mounted worldwide</a> about the health of the 88-year-old pontiff.</p><p>On Saturday, the Vatican had said that Francis had had a long “asthmatic respiratory crisis” earlier in the day that required “high flows of oxygen.” He also had a blood transfusion, but was alert, according to the Vatican, which is issuing bulletins in consultation with the medical staff at the hospital as well as the pope’s doctor at the Vatican.</p><p>Francis was admitted to the Policlinico Agostino Gemelli on Feb. 14 with a complex respiratory tract infection that developed into pneumonia in both lungs. Doctors said the calibration of his treatment was especially complex because of his age, and pre-existing lung disease.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Speaking to reporters on Friday, doctors had for the first time described Francis’s condition as critical, adding that his situation could change day by day. Sergio Alfieri, a surgeon who is on Francis’ medical team, has said that the pope had told him that he was aware of his own fragility and that his health was precarious. “ He told us both doors are open,” he said.</p><p>The Vatican said Sunday that Francis was using oxygen, was conscious and apparently experiencing discomfort associated with his trouble breathing.</p><p>The pope’s already full schedule had intensified since the beginning in December of the 2025 Jubilee, a year of faith, penance and forgiveness of sins that takes place every quarter century. But the hospital stay has meant the pope has had to cancel all imminent engagements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Catholics gathering buy a life-size cardboard cutout of Pope Francis, during Sunday mass in Dili, East Timor, on Sunday.

At noon — the traditional time of the Angelus prayer — dozens of faithful gathered in the square in front of the Gemelli hospital. Some prayed silently or lit votive candles to place at the foot of a statue of St. John Paul II, another former patient of the hospital, alongside colorful balloons with “get well” wishes for Francis. Others recited the rosary.</p><p>Massimo Chiarucci and Sonia Salaro came to Rome from Latina, some 70 kilometers away, to pray that he recover.</p><p>“He’s like a grandfather, someone dear to us, that’s part of our lives,” said Ms. Salaro, a housewife. “We brought our prayers because he has to get better, he still has a lot to do, there’s a need for his intercession ” said Mr. Chiarucci, a surveyor.</p><p>Silvana Serrani, a resident of Rome who is originally from Buenos Aires, where Francis was once an archbishop, said the pontiff was a man who always put the poor first. “He was always a very simple man,” she said. “Let’s hope he gets better.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>For days now, prayer vigils have also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/world/asia/mass-pope-francis-prayers-photos.html" title="">been held around the world</a>. A Mass to pray for Francis’s recovery was scheduled for later Sunday at the Basilica of St. John Lateran that was being presided over by Cardinal Baldassare Reina, vicar general of the Diocese of Rome. At the Gemelli, the preceding vicar general of Rome, Cardinal Angelo De Donatis, said he was one of many praying for Francis, “to ask for help to the Lord in this moment.” </p><p>“We hope the pope can feel the strong embrace of all those who love him, there are so many,” Cardinal De Donatis said. “And we wish him to continue his service.”</p><p>Jason Horowitz<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
