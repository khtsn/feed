data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In Syria, “forever” is over.<span>  </span>The regime of former President Bashar al-Assad, whose supporters once chanted “our leader forever,”<span>  </span>has been deposed by an alliance of rebel groups after a 13-year civil war. </p><p>The rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led the lightning offensive that overturned the Assad regime in less than two weeks, is now working to establish a transitional government. But chaos still reigns in much of the country, with other rebels groups fighting each other and jousting for influence, as are outside powers like Israel, Turkey and the United States. </p><p>What do previous rebellions tell us about Syria’s chances of establishing a stable government? A <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/bsmhp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new study</a> examined dozens of rebellions since 1900 to answer a question that has long puzzled researchers: Why are some rebel groups able to establish governments that last for decades, while others collapse into renewed fighting in just a few years? </p><p>The answer, the researchers concluded, comes down to a single factor — one with sobering implications for Syria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-4e2d3b4">Winning is easy; governing is harder</h2><p>Killian Clarke, Anne Meng and Jack Paine — political science professors at Georgetown, the University of Virginia, and Emory University respectively — collected an exhaustive data set of every rebellion that overthrew a government since 1900. </p><p>The researchers examined a wide range of variables to figure out what could explain which of the rebel-founded governments survived: How long did the rebellion last? Did the rebels have the backing of a foreign government? What was their ideology? None of those factors ended up mattering much. </p><p>Only one made a significant difference: Rebellions that were unified, with just one major group taking power, tended to build long-lasting governments. But fractured rebellions, in which multiple rebel groups formed a coalition to defeat the previous regime, tended to produce short-lived governments.</p><p>The reason, the researchers found, was that fractured rebellions struggled to maintain their ad hoc alliances after victory. The principle of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” may work well in wartime, but not after that enemy has been defeated. </p><p>“What we see, in case after case after case, are these attempts to share power among themselves. And then within a few years, typically less than 10, somebody reneges on the deal and they return to civil war,” Clarke said. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Take Somalia, for example. In the early 1990s, three rebel groups fighting the government collaborated on military strategy during the civil war. But that alliance quickly collapsed after the government fell, and the groups turned to fighting each other. </p><p>More recently, several Libyan militias banded together to oust Muammar el Qaddafi. But the transitional government they formed quickly disintegrated, and the country descended into civil war. </p><p>In a small number of cases, one group within the fractured rebellion was dominant enough to either crush or demobilize other groups rather than share power with them, essentially ending up as a unified rebellion. After the end of Hungary’s “White Terror” revolution in 1920, for example, the Hungarian National Army demobilized the White Guard militias.</p><p>The researchers found just four cases in which power-sharing succeeded after a fractured revolution, and the new government lasted for at least a decade. Strikingly, three of them — Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Burundi — were democracies, with power sharing determined via competitive elections rather than a treaty among armed groups. (Burundi, Clarke noted, later became less democratic.)</p><p>Statistically speaking, one cannot draw a conclusion from such a small sample. However, Clarke and Paine told me that it makes sense that democracy would help divided governments survive, because it’s a system that offers an effective way to share power and resolve political disputes without having to resort to violence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Establishing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/magazine/democracy-elections-game.html" title="">democratic equilibrium</a> is not easy, but once it’s in place, it can be stable and self-sustaining. </p><h2 id="link-74345ca7">Syria’s stark challenges</h2><p>Syria’s rebels are anything but unified. Many different groups, often with backing from foreign countries, opposed the Assad regime, which itself was aided by foreign powers and its own allied militia groups. The country is also a complex patchwork of different ethnic and religious groups.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: Institute for the Study of War and AEI&#39;s Critical Threats Project | Areas of control are as of Dec. 11. | By Samuel Granados</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some of the larger factions include:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-government-assad.html#link-6597ae89" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, whose name means Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, is a former affiliate of Al Qaeda that broke with the older group years ago and came to dominate the last stronghold of Syria’s opposition. It was the main rebel group leading the offensive that overthrew the Assad government.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-government-assad.html#link-748d389c" title="">Syrian Democratic Forces</a> are led by fighters from the Kurdish ethnic minority, which makes up about 10 percent of Syria’s population. It controls a large autonomous area in Syria’s northeast, backed by the United States.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-government-assad.html#link-4960f4ea" title="">The Syrian National Army</a> is an umbrella group that includes dozens of groups with different beliefs. It receives funding and arms from Turkey, which has long been focused on expanding a buffer zone along its border with Syria to guard against the activities of Kurdish militants, which it sees as a threat.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-government-assad.html#link-597b9509" title="">The Druse militia</a> is part of a <a href="https://en.etilaf.org/all-news/news/opposition-fighters-form-southern-operations-room-to-liberate-daraa-and-advance-on-damascus" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">newly formed group</a> of Syrian rebels, which includes fighters from other backgrounds, working under the name the “Southern Operations Room.” Syria’s Druse minority, a religious group that practices an offshoot of Islam, is concentrated in the southwest.</p></li></ul><p>Making matters even more complicated, Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/israel-demilitarized-zone-syria.html" title="">sent ground forces</a> into Syrian territory in recent days and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria.html" title="">bombed military assets</a> to keep them from falling into rebel hands. Turkey and the United States are also carrying out airstrikes.</p><p>While those circumstances will inevitably pose a challenge to whatever government is to come, there are some positive signs, too. The leaders of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham have promised to protect Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities. Their decision to work with some former regime officials in a transitional government also suggests a desire to integrate different factions into the new government, the researchers said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Another question is whether the international community will help guide Syria toward stability, or if it will interfere in ways that drag the country back toward civil war.</p><p>“Forging a successful power-sharing agreement is really going to be up to the Syrians in these different groups to do for themselves,” Clarke said. “The international community’s role here is really to try to help and create a structure for that. And then, frankly, to get out of the way.”</p><p>Additional reporting by <!-- -->Ephrat Livni<!-- -->.</p><hr/><p><strong>Thank you for being a subscriber</strong></p><p>Read past editions of the newsletter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-interpreter" title="">here</a>.</p><p>If you’re enjoying what you’re reading, please consider recommending it to others.
