I would do jack <em>[expletive]</em>. At most, I’d get high and watch videos all day like that dramatic chipmunk on a loop.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“After all, the Constitution does start with, ‘We the people do whatever rich boy tells us. Rich boy makes the big square truck car. LOL.’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Last night, President-elect Trump hosted Jeff Bezos at Mar-a-Lago. But an hour into the dinner, Elon Musk showed up and sat between them at the table. Even Trump was like, ‘OK, this is actually starting to freak me out, OK? You’ve got to get a friend.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“To settle who he loves more, Elon and Bezos are going to put Trump down in the middle of the room and see who he goes to first: ‘All right, here boy!’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Oof, what’s it like to be on a text chain with Elon Musk? Based on the speed in which he posts on social media, I’m guessing there’s not a lot of chill in his texting.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-38e00341">The Punchiest Punchlines (Merry Christmas, Matt Gaetz Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“After the House Ethics Committee voted in secret to release its report on him, former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz defended himself in a post on X yesterday and said his behavior was ‘embarrassing, though not criminal.’ Just too bad he can no longer use that as a campaign slogan.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“You may remember that Gaetz was nominated to be attorney general, until it came to light that he’s awful and everyone hates him. Also, there’s that nitpick that he might be a sex criminal.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Well, the House Ethics Committee investigated Gaetz and reportedly found evidence of, among other things, illicit drug use and sex trafficking. And sex trafficking is terrible. That’s why I don’t do orgies — I can’t stand the bumper-to-bumper.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Martin Short and Chloe Fineman participated in the random instrument challenge on Thursday’s “Tonight Show.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, Stephanie Hsu, Tommy Martinez and Zosia Mamet in a scene from “Laid.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">James Dittiger/Peacock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
