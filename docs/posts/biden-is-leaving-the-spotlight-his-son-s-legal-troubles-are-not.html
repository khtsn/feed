Trump saw Hunter Biden’s trials as their best chance to push an unproven narrative of a “Biden crime family” to tie the father to the lurid sins of the son, particularly after their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/politics/republican-impeachment-report-biden.html" title="">efforts to impeach the president faltered</a>.</p><p>While Mr. Trump gripes about President Biden’s departure after years of preparing for a rematch of 2020, House Republicans have quickly pivoted to possible investigations of Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>But the legal system is not done with Hunter Biden, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/us/politics/hunter-biden-guilty-gun-trial.html" title="">who was convicted</a> in the gun case in Delaware. He still faces charges of evading a tax assessment, failing to file and pay taxes, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return.</p><p>On Wednesday, Leo J. Wise, the lead prosecutor in the case, made it clear he would present evidence that Mr. Biden had chosen to spend his cash on drugs, female companions, clothes and expensive hotels, rather than pay his taxes.</p><p>Introducing salacious evidence was central to proving that, said Mr. Wise, a top deputy to David C. Weiss, the special counsel who brought both cases.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But Mark J. Geragos, a veteran lawyer in California who recently joined Mr. Biden’s legal team, accused the special counsel’s prosecutors of trying to obscure flaws in their argument by humiliating him in front of a jury.</p><p>“They want the character assassination, they want to slime him, that is the whole purpose,” Mr. Geragos said during a hearing over which evidence, arguments and witnesses can be introduced at trial.</p><p>Judge Mark C. Scarsi, the Trump appointee who is presiding over the case, rejected arguments by defense lawyers that the jury should be allowed to consider two powerful traumas that they say pushed Hunter Biden to the edge: the death of his mother and baby sister in a 1972 car crash and the death of his brother Beau from cancer in 2015.</p><p>“Why is the cause of Mr. Biden’s addiction relevant?” asked the judge, who rejected a defense request to call as a witness an expert on addiction.</p><p>The gloomy proceedings — held in a sunlit seventh floor courtroom — were shadowed by the spectacle of the Delaware trial, which culminated with Mr. Biden’s daughter Naomi taking the stand to testify on his behalf. She delivered an emotionally raw defense of her father’s character, but prosecutors challenged some of her factual assertions during an aggressive cross-examination.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Geragos, who did not participate in the gun case, quipped that even “the mafia” chose not to go after a target’s “children.”</p><p>A few minutes later, Mr. Wise, cheeks reddening, shot back: “That was awful. We didn’t do it.”</p><p>Mr. Biden has been sober for several years, and has passed numerous drug tests issued by federal probation officials, according to court documents.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/us/politics/hunter-biden-jill-biden-gun-trial.html" title="">During much of the gun case</a>, Jill Biden, the first lady, sat in the second row of the public gallery, and the president has drawn his son close in its aftermath, turning to him for advice after a fumbling debate performance.</p><p>The tax trial, expected to start in early September, is both more serious and more complex than the gun case. Prosecutors have signaled in court filings that they are likely to revisit some of the same personal issues, and they also plan to introduce new evidence about Mr. Biden’s lucrative foreign business dealings and effort to make easy cash off his family name.</p><p>People close to Mr. Biden say he is dreading another trial, but is willing to fight because he believes his prosecution was politically motivated. Mr. Biden’s California legal team believes the trial could last as long as 10 days.</p></div></div><div><div><p>On Monday, Judge Scarsi rejected Mr. Biden’s long-shot effort to throw out the case.</p><p>President Biden has repeatedly said he would not pardon his son, although some in his orbit have questioned whether he would hold the line as his one-term presidency ends — particularly if Mr. Trump, who has vowed to prosecute the Biden family, wins.</p><p>In December, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/07/us/politics/hunter-biden-indictment.html" title="">federal grand jury in California charged Mr. Biden</a> in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/07/us/hunter-biden-tax-charges.html" title="">scathing 56-page indictment</a> that chronicled his years of drug abuse, debauchery, wild spending and flouting of federal tax laws.</p><p>That Mr. Biden was even facing trial at all was not the outcome Mr. Weiss or Mr. Biden expected — or wanted.</p><p>A deal reached in early 2023 that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/19/us/politics/inside-hunter-biden-plea-deal.html" title="">would have granted Mr. Biden broad immunity</a> from future prosecution <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/us/politics/hunter-biden-plea-deal-charges.html" title="">imploded under intense questioning</a> from a federal judge in Wilmington, Del., that July. The collapse of the deal prompted Mr. Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware, to request appointment as special counsel.</p><p>In recent weeks, Hunter Biden’s team has been in regular communication with deputies working for Mr. Weiss, but there have been no indications that the two sides are working on another plea agreement.</p></div></div><div><div><p>That could change quickly, however, and preliminary hearings are often a forum for discussions that could lead to such a deal.</p><p>And many prosecutors view tax cases as particularly tricky because jurors tend to be more sympathetic with defendants, like Hunter Biden, who have already paid their back taxes and penalties, according to former prosecutors.</p><p>Judge Scarsi sided with prosecutors on many of the motions considered during the Wednesday session and he suggested, in no uncertain terms, that if either side tried to bring up issues that he ruled inadmissible they would personally pay the price.</p><p>He threatened to impose “six-figure sanctions” on any lawyer who tried to administer “rough justice” by contradicting his instructions.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
