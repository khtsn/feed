Very grateful.</p><p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/03/statement-from-secretary-rubio-and-nsc-waltz-on-call-with-zelenskyy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The statement</a> recounting the call mentioned four times that Mr. Zelensky had thanked the president for his efforts to negotiate terms of a ceasefire with Russia. It then went on to note that Mr. Zelensky was “grateful” for Mr. Trump’s leadership.</p><p>The description revealed a pattern in the Trump administration’s shaping of its foreign policy agenda: When it comes to diplomacy, Mr. Trump wants an implicit or explicit display of personal gratitude from American allies.</p><p>Michael Froman, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said that Mr. Trump’s transactional approach to diplomacy suggests that he sees aiding U.S. allies as a favor, rather than as a cornerstone of foreign policy that will pay dividends down the road.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“That does sort of signal a fundamentally different notion of order than we have had for the last 80 years, which is that while our allies need to step up and do more for their own defense, our support of their defense is also in our interest,” Mr. Froman said. “I believe President Trump is questioning that.”</p><p>The starkest example of Trump’s insistence on a thank-you came during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-us-ukraine-russia.html" title="">a meeting last month in the Oval Office</a> that included Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Mr. Zelensky.</p><p>“You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,” Mr. Vance scolded the Ukrainian leader. The last words Mr. Trump said to Mr. Zelensky as he brought the meeting to a close were: “You’re not acting at all thankful. And that’s not a nice thing.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia-putin.html" title="">Last week’s phone call</a> was the first time the two have spoken since then.</p><p>Mr. Trump appears to have taken a softer approach with Russia. In a description of a phone call between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin last week, no expressions of gratitude were noted.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s desire for thanks is something of a shift in U.S. diplomatic relations. It is not unusual for presidents to want recognition for contributions to military and humanitarian support; President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had his own frustrations with Mr. Zelensky for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/24/us/politics/biden-zelensky-ukraine-russia.html" title="">relentlessly pushing</a> for more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But any friction between world leaders typically takes place behind closed doors, with a more restrained public description of a “full and frank discussion.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,” Vice President JD Vance told Mr. Zelensky in the Oval Office.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>White House officials defended Mr. Trump’s approach.</p><p>“It’s called respect,” said Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman.</p><p>“Every U.S. president should demand that from both allies and adversaries, especially when being asked to contribute billions of taxpayer dollars in their defense,” Mr. Fields said.</p><p>Kori Schake, the director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute who also served as a national security aide to President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump treats “our allies like subjects instead of acting like peers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“What this signals is that in a strictly transactional global order, if you humble yourself in front of the American president, you can get what you want,” she added.</p><p>The parade of foreign visitors to the White House appears to have taken the hint.</p><p>NATO’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, top-billed his remarks with Mr. Trump earlier this month with “thank you so much.” He went on to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-rutte-zelensky-ukraine-ceasefire.html" title="">credit Mr. Trump, who has long railed against the organization,</a> for the alliance’s increased military spending and declined to defend Greenland, the territory of one of its members, from Mr. Trump’s threat of a hostile takeover.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/takeaways-ireland-martin-trump-tariffs.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">a visit to the White House the same week</a>, Micheál Martin, the prime minister of Ireland, did not explicitly say the words “thank you.” Instead, he made a reference to Mr. Trump’s personal investment in the country rather than respond to the president’s complaint that Ireland was using a trade imbalance to take advantage of the United States.</p><p>“You have the distinction of being, I think, the only president that has physically invested in Ireland through Doonbeg,” Mr. Martin said of Mr. Trump, referring to one of his properties. “It’s just stunning,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Mr. Trump was smitten. “I love this guy,” he replied.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Radoslaw Sikorski, left, the Polish foreign minister, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio got into a heated exchange on social media earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Harnik/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Even some of Mr. Trump’s cabinet members have started soliciting for thanks.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio jumped into an exchange on social media between Poland’s foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, and Elon Musk about Starlink, the satellite internet service that Mr. Musk’s rocket company SpaceX has been providing to Ukraine.</p><p>When Mr. Sikorski asserted that the service was paid, in part, by the Polish Digitization Ministry <a href="https://x.com/sikorskiradek/status/1898700362460070080" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and warned Mr. Musk against threatening</a> to yank it, Mr. Rubio accused him of <a href="https://x.com/marcorubio/status/1898755922492588082" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“just making things up.”</a></p><p>In a post on social media, Mr. Rubio said: “And say thank you because without Starlink Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now.”</p><p><a href="https://x.com/WZembaczynski/status/1898799417643139123" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Witold Zembaczynski, another</a> Polish minister, wrote the words Mr. Rubio demanded, but in support of Mr. Sikorski.</p><p>“Thank you. It’s so simple #standwithukraine not with war criminalist #Putin.”</p><p>Matt Duss, the executive vice president at the Center for International Policy, said Mr. Trump has put on a “dominance display” throughout his career, both as a businessman and politician.</p><p>“He approaches foreign policy, the U.S.-led order, as a protection racket,” Mr. Duss said. “If you want protection, you have to show respect to the boss, and you’ve got to pay upstairs.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Erica L.
