International students are worried about having their visas revoked.</p><p>In contrast with past generations, what a speaker says on a commencement stage now reaches an audience far larger than the crowd that day. Universities routinely post footage of ceremonies online, giving faraway relatives of graduates a chance to tune in and handing keynote speakers a global stage.</p><p>The New York Times studied videos of dozens of keynote commencement addresses that were posted online — more than 170,000 words delivered this spring at a cross section of America’s higher education institutions — in order to analyze the most pressing topics. Many speakers, including <strong>Kermit the Frog</strong> at the University of Maryland, the gymnast <strong>Simone Biles</strong> at Washington University in St. Louis and Homeland Security <strong>Secretary</strong> <strong>Kristi Noem</strong> at Dakota State University, avoided the political fray and focused on timeless lessons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><p>transcript</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Rather than jumping over someone to get what you want, consider reaching out your hand and taking the leap side by side. because life is better when we leap together.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/arts/Kermit_photo/Kermit_photo-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But plenty of others, including journalists, scientists and politicians from both parties, weighed in directly on the news of the moment.

That means there are more possibilities before you than ever before.” “We have the hottest country in the world, and the whole world is talking about it. That’s an honor for all of us.

And that’s why your voices matter.” “Journalism is under attack. Universities are under attack. Freedom of speech is under attack.” “Don’t believe those who tell you there is no real truth. That’s a lie.” “I think we need to think about reliable information as a human right — the way we think about freedom or food or fair treatment under the law.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/02/arts/Open-Debate/Open-Debate-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Videos posted by Siena College, Wake Forest University, Washington College and Hobart and William Smith Colleges showed widespread concern among graduation speakers about threats to the truth.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Al Roker</strong>, the NBC News broadcaster, told Siena College students that “truth is under attack.” <strong>Scott Pelley</strong> of CBS News said at Wake Forest University that “journalism is under attack.” And <strong>Jonathan Karl</strong> of ABC News said at Washington College that if someone suggests there is no real truth, “that’s a lie.”</p><p>At Hobart and William Smith Colleges, <strong>Nancy Gibbs</strong>, a longtime magazine reporter and editor, lamented the decline of newspapers and the rise of conspiracy theories, telling students that “I think of you as a wartime generation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-656e4c3d">Division, All Around</h2><p>Speakers from inside and outside the political arena called out the dangers of polarization.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-16"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Videos posted by Norwich University, Duke University, Piedmont University, Yeshiva University and New College of Florida showed commencement speakers warning against extremism and calling for graduates to consider opposing viewpoints.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Polarization, seeing everything through a simple political lens, whether you’re either with me or against me, is doing real harm to our nation.” “To respect means that we give others grace, even if we disagree. To include means that we pull more chairs up to the table. We don’t fear different voices.” “We’re not curious enough in this country. We’re either polarized to one side or the other. We only ask the same questions that we’ve already heard.” “Staying in that center and not edging out to the extreme ends is what keeps us all agile and questioning, seeking and thinking. It keeps us on our toes.” “We know that many on the left and the woke philosophy and the intolerance have victimized people on the right. Now my warning is to the right. Don’t do the same thing to the left. Don’t try to get even.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/02/arts/Polarization/Polarization-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Videos posted by Norwich University, Duke University, Piedmont University, Yeshiva University and New College of Florida showed commencement speakers warning against extremism and calling for graduates to consider opposing viewpoints.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>Grant Hill</strong>, a retired N.B.A. player, urged Duke University students to show respect amid disagreement and not to fear dissenting voices. <strong>Rachel Goldberg-Polin</strong>, whose son died after being taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, said at Yeshiva University that “the salty, tasty extreme is comforting, it’s fun, and sometimes it even feels righteous,” but that staying in the center “is what keeps us all agile and questioning, seeking and thinking.”</p><p><strong>Phil Scott</strong>, the Republican governor of Vermont, said at Norwich University that divides were “doing real harm to our nation, our state, our communities.” <strong>Doug Collins</strong>, the secretary of veterans affairs, said the country was “not curious enough” in his speech at Piedmont University. And at New College of Florida, <strong>Alan M. Dershowitz</strong>, a legal scholar who represented Mr. Trump in his first impeachment trial, criticized what he saw as the excesses of the left in higher education. But he also urged conservatives not to “try to turn a university into a platform for conservatism, a platform for right-wing ideology.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-46a6f090">Civil Rights Revisited</h2><p>Some of the most pointed and urgent speeches were delivered at historically Black colleges and universities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-21"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Videos posted by Alabama State University, Tougaloo College, Shaw University and Spelman College showed many commencement speakers at historically Black institutions warning about threats to civil rights.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Don’t feel discouraged by the attacks that we’re seeing on efforts to make sure that people who look like you and me have a level playing field in this country, which wasn’t created with fairness for you in mind.” “Jim Crow never died. He just lied in wait. They’ve always attacked diversity, equity and inclusion. They’ve always attacked people and institutions who serve on behalf of Black people.” “While some of us are trying to go viral, they’re plotting to erase the economic gains of Black Wall Street. And for those of you who claim to be above politics, they’re trying to erase the very existence of you.” “Right now today, our books are being removed, our rights as women are being challenged, our Blackness is depicted as a threat. We are being denied in every sector imaginable.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/02/arts/Henson_Cover/Henson_Cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Videos posted by Alabama State University, Tougaloo College, Shaw University and Spelman College showed many commencement speakers at historically Black institutions warning about threats to civil rights.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Many speakers harked back to the civil rights movement of the 1960s, warning graduates that gains that once seemed permanent were now threatened.</p><p>“Jim Crow never died,” <strong>Representative Jasmine Crockett</strong>, a Democrat, said at Tougaloo College. <strong>Mayor Leonardo Williams</strong> of Durham, N.C., also a Democrat, warned Shaw University graduates against political apathy, saying “there’s a whole system trying to dismantle the very rights that our ancestors bled for.”</p><p>At Spelman College, the actor <strong>Taraji P. Henson</strong> said “our Blackness is depicted as a threat.” <strong>LeVar Burton</strong>, of “Reading Rainbow” fame, told Howard University graduates that he loved the United States, but that “America is still addicted to its racism.” And at Alabama State University, <strong>Representative Shomari Figures</strong>, a Democrat, told students not to “feel discouraged by the attacks that we’re seeing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-3987b0c4">America’s Shifting Role</h2><p>Global uncertainty, military threats and America’s changing place in the world were persistent themes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-26"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Videos posted by Yale University, the University of Notre Dame and Stillman College showed many graduation speakers discussing issues facing the United States on the global stage.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>The era of uncontested US dominance is over.

The world that you are about to enter is a world where geography and networks and space and populations are increasingly congested and congested, driving the pace of change to accelerate exponentially.
