Trump has baselessly insisted that Haitian immigrants are eating their neighbors’ pets expressed concern on Thursday after Mr. Trump publicly promised to visit in two weeks.</p><p>The city, Springfield, has become a focus of unwanted national attention after Mr. Trump’s running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, began sharing since-debunked claims that Haitian residents had been taking and eating people’s pets. Mr. Trump himself amplified that claim in his debate last week against Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>On Wednesday night at a rally on Long Island, Mr. Trump said he planned “to go there in the next two weeks.” The former president has a long history of saying he’ll do something — and do it in two weeks — only to move on and never mention it again.</p><p>Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio and the city’s mayor, Rob Rue, both of whom are Republicans, said on Thursday that preparations were underway for a potential visit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At a news conference, the mayor, Mr. Rue, said he hoped Mr. Trump would change his mind and that doing so would “convey a significant message of peace” to Springfield. Mr. DeWine, appearing at the same news conference, said that if Mr. Trump continued to make baseless allegations about the Haitian residents of Ohio, he would correct him, but that it wasn’t his place to discourage Mr. Trump from visiting his state.</p><p>Mr. Rue also issued a public safety proclamation for the city. The directive, according to a city statement, grants the mayor “temporary emergency powers to mitigate public safety concerns.” The city has faced bomb threats, many of which Mr. DeWine has said were from foreign actors looking to stir chaos.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump said she had nothing more to add about when a visit might take place. And a person briefed on Mr. Trump’s plans said that some members of his team believe that a visit to Springfield is so contentious that he might appear in a different city but would still tie it to his focus on immigrants.</p><p>That would be a relief to Sue Call, 75, the owner of Sue’s Furniture in downtown Springfield.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” she said on Thursday of a possible Trump visit. “It’s just going to stir a lot of people up.”</p><p>Ms. Call was among those who were unhappy with Mr. Trump pushing a claim that local officials have repeatedly said has no merit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“For that caliber of person just taking hearsay? That hurt a lot of people,” she said, adding that Haitians are among her regular customers. “They respect me, I respect them. It’s all been good that I can see.”</p><p>The Haitian community in Springfield is mostly made up of immigrants who are in the country legally, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/us/politics/vance-haitian-immigrants-illegal.html?smid=url-share" title="">Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance’s repeated insistence</a> on using them as an example of undocumented immigrants taking over a city. Most of the immigrants are protected legally because they fled dangerous conflict in Haiti.</p><p>At least some Springfield residents, however, said they were receptive to a Trump appearance.</p><p>Standing in line to pick up items at a mobile food pantry run by the nondenominational Central Christian church, Dave Ryan, 46, welcomed a Trump visit.</p><p>“I think it’s good if a soon-to-be president comes here to see how the Haitians are affecting people here and how to fix it,” Mr. Ryan said.</p><p>He said Mr. Trump needed to see the situation firsthand, adding, “The Haitians affect everyone. People are scared. Their way of life is different than ours.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ann Walters, who was volunteering at the food pantry, disagreed, and said Mr. Trump’s presence in Springfield would be bad for the city.</p><p>“I think there’s been enough attention already,” she said. “It would just create more violence and problems.”</p><p>And Reginald Silencieux, 40, the pastor of First Evangelical Church of Springfield, said the former president was free to visit. Pastor Silencieux, a Haitian immigrant, spoke in an interview on Thursday assisted by a congregant who speaks English and Haitian Creole.</p><p>He added that there had been a significant cost to the Haitian community, because of the threats brought on from the attention.</p><p>“We are scared to go outside,” he said. “We’ve been receiving a lot of threats, physically and verbally.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
