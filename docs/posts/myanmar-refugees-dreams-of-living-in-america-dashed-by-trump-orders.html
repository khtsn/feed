They packed blankets, tin plates, one blade for clearing the land in their future home and one for chopping meat. They left behind what they were not supposed to bring: slingshots, fish paste, traditional medicines from their native Myanmar.</p><p>But the family never made it to Ohio. Last month, their flights were abruptly canceled. Now with President Trump’s order to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-administration-refugee-flights-canceled.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">pause refugee resettlement</a>, even for thousands of those who have gone through the yearslong approval process, they say they have lost hope in ever becoming Americans.</p><p>“I don’t have an opinion about American politics,” said Saw Steel Wah Doh, a 35-year-old lab technician, who is now back in a refugee camp in Thailand with his wife and two children. “I want to become American, work hard, love democracy.”</p><p>The Trump administration’s refugee suspension and foreign aid freeze are upending efforts to address one of the world’s most dire humanitarian crises.

Three representatives of Myanmar-related aid groups said they were told that the N.E.D. has not been able to draw funds from the U.S. Treasury to pay for grants that had already been approved.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
