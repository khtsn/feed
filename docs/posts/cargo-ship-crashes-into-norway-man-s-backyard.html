I looked out the window, and he said: ‘Haven’t you seen the ship?’”</p><p>The ship was towering over the house, having missed the bedroom by only five or six yards. Had its vector been slightly different, Mr. Helberg said, the ship could have “picked up speed and plowed into the house. It’s completely surreal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I impressed myself by staying cool,” said Mr. Helberg, a retired museum director. “I have seen and been through worse.”</p><p>The neighbor, in contrast, had seen the ship come plowing onto land and had been “in shock all day,” Mr. Helberg said — as were many other Norwegians, startled to see photos and videos of a gigantic container vessel wedged onto an unassuming shore.</p><p>“Big ships pass us now and then,” Mr. Helberg said, but mostly at a distance, keeping to the deeper waters of the fjord.</p><p>“We don’t usually see ships right outside our living room window,” he added. “So this is especially strange.”</p><p>The Norwegian coastal authorities said in a statement on Thursday that no injuries or oil spills had been reported. The 440-foot-long<strong> </strong>ship had entered the fjord on the way to the town of Orkanger, the authorities said, and it was not immediately clear what had led to the crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“As long as the vessel remains stationary, there is no danger of further incidents,” a police official, Martin Hammervik Aarhoug, said on Thursday night.</p><p>“After the ship grounded, there was a clay landslide about 100 meters wide that the authorities believe was caused by vibrations from the ship coming ashore,” said Anette Bonnevie Wollebæk, at the Norwegian Coastal Administration. The police had set up cordons around the landslide to prevent anyone from falling in.</p><p>It was not immediately clear where the crew members were on Thursday night. Mr. Helberg said that there were 16 men onboard, with a Norwegian captain and a crew of Russians and Ukrainians. He said he and his partner had spoken with them,<strong> </strong>shouting from his yard up to the ship,<strong> </strong>to find out whether anyone was hurt, but that they had not addressed<strong> </strong>having crashed their boat on his property.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The NCL Salten ran aground  Thursday morning and remained stuck through the day.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jan Langhaug/NTB, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“This is a serious incident, and we are grateful that nobody was injured in the grounding,” Bente Hetland, the chief executive of the company that had chartered the ship, NCL, said in a statement. For now, Ms. Hetland added, “we do not know what caused the incident and are awaiting the conclusion of the ongoing investigation.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Hetland said that NCL and the ship’s owner, Baltnautic, were working with the authorities, and that they were assessing damage to the ship and hoping to safely “refloat the vessel and restore normal operations as swiftly as possible.”</p><p>NCL and a salvage company tried to use a tugboat to pull the vessel at high tide on Thursday evening, but found they could not do so, the authorities said.</p><p>Mr. Helberg had his own ideas about what happened. He said that the fjord’s entrance bends a little, forcing ships that enter it to quickly turn. The NCL Salten, he said, adjusted course once but not twice — putting it on a path for his garden.</p><p>“I’ve actually seen a couple of ships before that seemed to go suspiciously far before realizing something was wrong,” he said. </p><p>By Thursday night, the ship was still stuck, and Mr. Helberg was fielding calls from friends, family, acquaintances and international news organizations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Online, his friends and family expressed relief that he was OK — and teased him about his unexpected guest, with one writing, “Nothing beats the view from Byneset on a beautiful spring morning, does it?</p><p>Mr. Helberg agreed. “People often say this is the best view of the Trondheimsfjord,” he said. “We’re right at the tip of the peninsula outside Trondheim. So we have a view in every direction.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
