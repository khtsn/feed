At lunch one day, the co-host Michael Kinsley mused about an alternative idea: “Ceasefire,” a program where Republicans and Democrats tried to find areas of agreement.</p><p>“It sat with me for, gosh, 20-something years,” Mr. Feist recalled.</p><p>Now Mr. Feist is the chief executive of C-SPAN, the low-key public affairs network beloved by political junkies. And “Ceasefire” is about to become a reality.</p><p>Envisioned as a respectful conversation between lawmakers from opposite sides of the aisle, “Ceasefire,” which is expected to debut in the fall, will be C-SPAN’s first new weekly program in two decades. “No shouting, no fighting, no acrimony,” Mr. Feist said in an interview. “Just two American political leaders with a willingness to find common ground.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And where, pray tell, does he expect to find those?</p><p>Mr. Feist, a fixture of the Washington press corps who led CNN’s elections coverage for many years, acknowledged with a laugh that bipartisan relations in the nation’s capital were at a low ebb. That, he explained, is why a show like “Ceasefire” is sorely needed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I’m not sure this program would work on CNN or Fox News or MSNBC,” said Sam Feist, the chief executive of C-SPAN since September.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The country rarely sees Republicans and Democrats engaged in a productive conversation,” he said. So for the past year, every time he has met with a member of Congress, Mr. Feist has pitched his idea for the show and asked the lawmaker who his or her best friend from the opposing party is.</p><p>“And you know what? Almost every one of them gave me a name,” he said. “Almost all of them said they would do it.”</p><p>A host — not yet chosen — will act as a facilitator of the discussion, but C-SPAN hopes that the lawmakers will take the lead.</p><p>“Ceasefire” is Mr. Feist’s first major programming move since he took over C-SPAN in September, after 35 years at CNN. He has set out to put a modern mark on a channel often known for rambling listener call-in shows and gavel-to-gavel coverage of the House and Senate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A few cosmetic changes are in store. Mr. Feist ordered a subtle refresh of the channel’s cozy onscreen graphics, which are sometimes compared to public-access TV. (The white-on-blue logo will remain the same.) He also has plans for a picture-in-picture feature so viewers can monitor events on C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3, sort of like sports networks that show multiple games at once.</p><p>C-SPAN is a nonprofit funded by the cable and satellite industry. As at other channels on traditional TV, changing viewer habits have posed problems.</p><p>Millions of cable subscribers have ditched cable altogether or switched to streaming services like YouTubeTV and Hulu, which do not carry C-SPAN. Once available in nearly 100 million households, C-SPAN now reaches roughly half that many. And because it relies heavily on fees paid by cable systems for revenue, the channel’s financial outlook <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/cspan-google-youtube?srsltid=AfmBOorCSATBsiLwyT8G4YbSHA-W2SctZucOAb7uOj-6YA05Chks2PJB" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has darkened</a>.</p><p>Google, the owner of YouTubeTV, has so far declined to pay the fee to carry C-SPAN’s three stations — 87 cents a year per subscriber. Google told Vanity Fair this week that it could not “justify the increased cost to subscribers’ monthly bills.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jon Stewart as a guest on “Crossfire” in 2004, when he said the show was “hurting America.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">CNN</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Besides its coverage of Congress, C-SPAN sends camera crews to record local forums, campaign-trail speeches and other news events on the national political calendar.</p><p>CNN <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/business/media/cnn-will-cancel-crossfire-and-cut-ties-to-commentator.html" title="">canceled “Crossfire”</a> in 2005, not long after a memorable episode in which Jon Stewart, the host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/20/arts/television/no-jokes-or-spin-its-time-gasp-to-talk.html" title="">confronted the co-hosts</a> about the program’s adversarial format, saying it was “hurting America.”</p><p>So is “Ceasefire” Mr. Feist’s idea of penance?</p><p>“I don’t think of it that way,” he said. “I worked for a different organization. C-SPAN is very different than the cable news channels.” He added, “I’m not sure this program would work on CNN or Fox News or MSNBC. I don’t think it would be a good fit. And I don’t think another cable news channel could have the same credibility trying to bring this program on the air that C-SPAN does.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
