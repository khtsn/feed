But it had also become a pressing source of concern.</p><p>The Randall’s Island Park Alliance, a nonprofit organization that helps maintain the island, had threatened to sue the city after the shelter was erected, arguing that it was an illegal takeover of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/11/nyregion/nyc-migrant-crisis-eric-adams.html" title="">public parkland</a>.</p><p>“The administration heard our concerns, and we appreciate them working with us on this issue,” Deborah Maher, the president of the alliance, said in a statement on Wednesday. “We look forward to working with NYC Parks to restore this important resource, and welcoming back thousands of children from across the city to their newly restored sports fields as soon as possible.”</p><p>Reports of petty thefts and brawls among migrants have been common inside the shelter, where migrants sleep in rows of back-to-back military cots. The grounds outside the shelter also became the site of occasional violence, including a stabbing in August and a shooting in July that left one Venezuelan mother dead and injured two other migrants.</p><p>A makeshift encampment of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/nyregion/migrants-homeless-encampment-nyc.html" title="">homeless migrants</a> had also popped up outside the shelter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/homeless-migrants-encampment-randalls-island-sweep.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">despite the city’s efforts to take it down</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As problems at the shelter flared this summer, city officials announced that they had moved 800 migrants, or more than 25 percent of the shelter’s population, out of Randall’s Island in an effort to make the situation more manageable.</p><p>City Hall indicated on Wednesday that it would continue to reduce the number of migrants in the shelter over the coming months to gradually restore the athletic fields and parkland it occupies.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Adams Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Adams Indictment</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Federal prosecutors unveiled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html">five-count indictment</a> against Mayor Eric Adams, charging him with bribery conspiracy, fraud and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations.</p></li><li><p><strong>What Happens Next?</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The indictment of Adams prompted calls for his resignation, but there is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/impeach-adams-governor-ny-city-charter.html">no legal requirement that he leave office</a>.
