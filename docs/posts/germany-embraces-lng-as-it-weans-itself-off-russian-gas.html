It had no ports to bring in alternative energy sources needed to keep its factories running and homes warm. Three years on, it now has four.</p><p>The most recent began operating in late May when a tanker called the Energy Endurance pulled in close to shore at the harbor town Wilhelmshaven and began unloading its cargo: liquefied natural gas from the Gulf Coast of the United States.</p><p>Watching from a dike, where lambs and their mothers grazed on spring grass, was Marco Alverà, chief executive of TES, a green energy company in the Netherlands that helped construct the terminal, estimated to have cost 400 million euros, at the request of the German government, which now operates it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This is the icebreaker,” Mr. Alverà said.</p><p>Mr. Alverà and his colleagues have been eyeing Wilhelmshaven for years and initially planned to focus on importing a cleaner form of fuel made with renewable hydrogen to help the country meet its target of reaching climate neutrality by 2045.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Sheep grazing on a swath of grass between a highway and a body of water." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph/11biz-europe-lng-02-lzph-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ea061693-e921-5c61-9045-c12018101462" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sheep are used to control the vegetation on the dikes around Wilhelmshaven.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patrick Junker for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A tanker called the Energy Endurance is connected to a vessel called the Excelsior that receives the chilled fuel and converts it back to gas.

The appeal of L.N.G. is that it can be brought from any country — the United States, Qatar, Australia — that have the plants needed to chill gas to liquid form so it can be carried on special ships.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Since the summer of 2022, Europe has increased its capacity to receive L.N.G. by about 30 percent a year, or 60 million metric tons, said Laura Page, an analyst at Kpler, a research firm. “Much of this increase has been in Germany,” Ms. Page said.</p><p>L.N.G. made up about 40 percent of Europe’s gas supplies in 2024, nearly double from 2020. Close to half of the imports came from the United States.</p><p>Europe’s overall consumption of natural gas has been falling, but L.N.G. fills many energy needs and can be purchased from diverse sources, which means that reliance on it could increase in the coming years, especially if Brussels delivers on commitments to further reduce consumption of Russian gas, which still makes up nearly 20 percent of the bloc’s pipeline and L.N.G. imports in 2024.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marco Alverà, chief executive of TES, a green energy company in the Netherlands that helped construct the most recent terminal to bring in liquefied natural gas to Germany.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patrick Junker for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“L.N.G. from non-Russian sources is expected to play an increasingly important role as a flexible and geographically diversified supply source,” said a recent study by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, a European energy agency.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>TES, the Dutch company, saw an opportunity to bolster energy security, and it agreed to help the German government build an L.N.G. terminal. Like most of the other recent additions, this one is centered around a leased, floating vessel called the Excelsior that warms up the frigid liquid to a gaseous state. Pipes from that terminal enter the national grid on a 360-acre property that the company wants to develop.</p><p>In Mr. Alverà’s plans, the existing terminal will eventually give way to a permanent, multibillion-euro energy complex connected to a €600 million jetty with docking space for six ships.</p><p>This hub, which Mr. Alverà hopes to gradually sell off to investors, would be capable of handling several times as much L.N.G. as the floating vessel and, over time, would process the gas more cheaply.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Unesco World Heritage site, the Wadden Sea visitor center, in Wilhelmshaven.

As a result, Wilhelmshaven, which was something of a backwater despite being the country’s only deepwater port, hosting a naval base and a container port, now looms large in the plans of energy developers.</p><p>“What makes it different is that you are in the gateway to a very material market — namely Germany,” said Julian Metherell, a former senior Goldman Sachs banker who is a board member at TES.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Wilhelmshaven was once Germany’s most important war port.
