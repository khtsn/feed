Haveland, was a <a href="https://www.nationalbook.org/people/solvej-balle/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nominee</a> for last year’s National Book Award for translated literature, and many critics have raved about it since its release last year. Hilary Leichter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/books/review/solvej-balle-on-the-calculation-of-volume.html" title="">in a review for the The New York Times</a>, said that in Balle’s hands “the time-loop narrative takes on new and stunning proportions.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The six shortlisted titles — four of which are under 200 pages — also include Vincenzo Latronico’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/books/review/vincenzo-latronico-perfection.html" title="">Perfection</a>,” translated from Italian by Sophie Hughes, about an expatriate couple living in a hip Berlin neighborhood and struggling to engage with life outside their bubble. Ryan Ruby, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/books/review/vincenzo-latronico-perfection.html" title="">in a review</a> for The Times, said that “with ethnographic precision, Latronico taxonomizes the tastes, attitudes, vanities and blind spots of the people we now call digital nomads.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Established in 2005, the International Booker Prize was originally given to an author for their life’s work, but since 2016 has been awarded to a single book translated into English and published in Britain or Ireland.
