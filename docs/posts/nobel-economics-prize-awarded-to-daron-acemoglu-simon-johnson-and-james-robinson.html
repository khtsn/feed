Their pioneering use of theory and data has helped to better explain the reasons for persistent inequality between nations, according to the Nobel committee.</p><p>“Reducing the huge differences in income between countries is one of our times’ greatest challenges,” Jakob Svensson, chairman of the economics prize committee, <a href="https://www.kva.se/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said while announcing</a> the award. Thanks to the economists’ “groundbreaking research,” he said, “we have a much deeper understanding of the root causes of why countries fail or succeed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>According to the researchers, prosperity today is partly a legacy of history — and, specifically, to what happened in a given nation during European colonization.</p><p>Countries that developed institutions that protected personal property rights and allowed for widespread economic participation tended to end up on a pathway to longer-term prosperity. Those that had extractive institutions — ones that helped elites to maintain control, but which gave workers little hope of sharing in the wealth — merely provided short-term gains for the people in power.</p><p>“Rather than asking whether colonialism is good or bad, we note that different colonial strategies have led to different institutional patterns that have persisted over time,” Dr. Acemoglu said during a news conference after the prize was announced.</p><p>“Broadly speaking, the work that we have done favors democracy,” he said.</p><p>In fact, the laureates found that colonization brought about a major change in global fortunes. European nations used more authoritarian systems to control places that were densely populated at the time of colonization, while those that were sparsely populated often saw more settlers and established a more inclusive form of governance — if not quite a democratic one.</p><p>Over time, that led to a turnabout in economic fate: While the Aztec empire was more populous and rich than North America at the time of early European exploration, today the United States and Canada have outstripped Mexico in economic prosperity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This reversal of relative prosperity is historically unique,” the Nobel release explained. “If we look at the parts of the globe that were not colonized, we do not find any reversal of fortune.”</p><p>The legacy is still visible today, the researchers said. As an example, Dr. Acemoglu and Dr. Robinson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">point</a> to the city of Nogales, which straddles the border between Mexico and Arizona.</p><p>Northern Nogales is more affluent than its southern portion, despite a shared culture and location. The driver of differences, the economists argue, is the institutions governing the two halves of the city.</p><p>The economists wrote books based on their work, including “<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2012/why-nations-fail-0323" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Why Nations Fail</a>,” by Dr. Acemoglu and Dr. Robinson, and “<a href="https://shapingwork.mit.edu/power-and-progress/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Power and Progress</a>,” by Dr. Acemoglu and Dr. Johnson, published last year.</p><p>The economists’ arguments <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Why-Nations-Fail" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have</a> at times <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09538259.2022.2037930" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">been debated</a>, including by academics who think that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306360200_Institutions_Without_Culture_A_Critique_of_Acemoglu_and_Robinson&#39;s_Theory_of_Economic_Development" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">culture matters</a> more to development than they let on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And while their research tends to favor it, Dr. Acemoglu acknowledged during Monday’s news conference that “democracy is not a panacea.”</p><p>Representative government can be hard to introduce and volatile at first, for one thing. And there are pathways to growth for countries that are not democracies, he said, including rapidly tapping a nation’s resources to ramp up economic progress. But, Dr. Acemoglu said, “more authoritarian growth” is often more unstable and less innovative.</p><p>Dani Rodrik, an economist at the Harvard Kennedy School who studies globalization and development, said that the three laureates had contributed a clearer understanding that democracy could be important to successful development — something that had not always been widely accepted within the profession.</p><p>“They’ve elevated the important and positive impact of democracy on long-term economic performance,” he said.</p><p>The researchers have also helped to make studying history and institutions, formerly out of vogue, “cool again,” Dr. Rodrik said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Dr. Acemoglu has for years topped lists of who might win a Nobel, but he said that the award was not something that one could anticipate. He was in Athens when he got the call.</p><p>“You dream of having a good career, but this is over and on top of that,” Dr. Acemoglu said during the news conference.</p><p>Dr. Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, woke up to a bevy of congratulatory text messages in the United States. He said in an interview that he was “surprised and delighted.”</p><h2 id="link-641433f1">Who was awarded the economics prize in 2023?</h2><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/business/economy/claudia-goldin-nobel-prize-economics.html" title="">Claudia Goldin</a> was awarded for her research uncovering the reasons for gender gaps in labor force participation and earnings.</p><h2 id="link-38e405f3">Who else received a prize this year?</h2><ul><li><p>The Nobel in physiology or medicine went to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/health/nobel-prize-medicine.html" title="">Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun</a> for their discovery of microRNA, which helps determine how cells develop and function.</p></li><li><p>The award for physics was awarded to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/science/nobel-prize-physics.html" title="">John J.
