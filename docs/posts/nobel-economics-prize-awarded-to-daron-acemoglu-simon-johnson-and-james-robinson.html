href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2024/press-release/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences</a> was awarded on Monday to Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson, both of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and to James Robinson of the University of Chicago.</p><p>They received the prize for their work on the gaps in prosperity between nations, and for their research on how institutions affect prosperity. </p><p>The laureates used both theory and data to better explain inequality between countries, according to the prize committee.</p><p>“Reducing the vast differences in income between countries is one of our time’s greatest challenges,” Jakob Svensson, chairman of the economics prize committee, said in a statement. “The laureates have demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for achieving this.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Their research has shown that the institutions that were introduced during European colonization have helped to shape economic outcomes in the once-colonized countries in the time since.</p><p>“Rather than asking whether colonialism is good or bad, we note that different colonial strategies have led to different institutional patterns that have persisted over time,” Dr. Acemoglu said during a news conference after the prize was announced.</p><p>Their findings suggest that inclusive institutions tend to put countries on a pathway to longer-term prosperity, while extractive ones — designed to keep those in power in control — provide short-term gains for the people in power.</p><p>“Broadly speaking, the work that we have done favors democracy,” Dr. Acemoglu said. “But democracy is not a panacea.”</p><p>Democracy can be hard to introduce, he noted, and there are pathways to growth for countries that are not democracies, including rapidly tapping a nation’s resources to ramp up economic progress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But he said that “more authoritarian growth” is often more unstable and less innovative. </p><p>Dr. Acemoglu has long topped lists of who might win a Nobel, but he said that the award was not something that one could anticipate.</p><p>“You dream of having a good career, but this is over and on top of that,” Dr. Acemoglu said, calling into the news conference from Athens. “It’s a great surprise and honor.”</p><h2 id="link-641433f1">Who was awarded the economics prize in 2023?</h2><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/business/economy/claudia-goldin-nobel-prize-economics.html" title="">Claudia Goldin</a> was awarded for her research uncovering the reasons for gender gaps in labor force participation and earnings.</p><h2 id="link-38e405f3">Who else received a prize this year?</h2><ul><li><p>The Nobel in physiology or medicine went to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/health/nobel-prize-medicine.html" title="">Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun</a> for their discovery of microRNA, which helps determine how cells develop and function.</p></li><li><p>The award for physics was awarded to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/science/nobel-prize-physics.html" title="">John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E.
