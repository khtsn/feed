For weeks, President Trump has threatened to devastate the Canadian economy with tariffs and mockingly belittled the nation by suggesting it become the United States’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/politics/canada-trump-51st-state.html" title="">51st state</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau’s swift riposte after the game tapped into an anger that has simmered across Canada since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. His message was echoed from across the political aisle. “The true North, strong, free and golden,” Pierre Poilievre, Canada’s opposition leader, <a href="https://x.com/PierrePoilievre/status/1892796625174643180" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p><p>The political tensions had been spilling over into sports arenas for weeks; the U.S. national anthem was loudly booed at N.B.A. and N.H.L. games in Canada.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That did not deter Mr. Trump from repeating his taunt before the championship game.</p><p>“I think they have to become the 51st state,” he said during a speech on Thursday in Washington. “And you heard the people booing the national anthem, but I think ultimately they’ll be praising the national anthem.”</p><p>Mr. Trump went on to refer to Mr. Trudeau as “governor,” which he has done often in recent weeks.</p><p>Mr. Trump also called the U.S. team to express his support. At the White House, his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said he was looking forward to watching the game. “And we look forward to the United States beating our soon-to-be 51st state, Canada,” <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1892646911259140304" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she said</a>.</p><p>Later, there were some boos at the Boston arena as Chantal Kreviazuk, a Canadian musician, sang “O Canada.”</p><p>There was a twist in her rendition too. She changed the words “in all of us command” to “that only us command.” Ms. Kreviazuk <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGUhyqPtaCB/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Instagram</a> that the change was in response to the talk of annexation.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s repeated digs have had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/world/canada/us-canada-relations-trump-tariffs.html" title="">a unifying effect in Canada</a>, forging a rare consensus among the public and the political class despite the country going through one of its most divided political periods in recent history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A <a href="https://angusreid.org/canada-51st-state-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey published last month</a> by the Angus Reid Institute, a research center, found that 90 percent of Canadian respondents were opposed to being a part of the United States.</p><p>The political significance of a win was not lost on the team, Jon Cooper, the Team Canada coach, said after the game on Thursday.</p><p>“Not only, like, our team, but Canada needed a win,” <a href="https://x.com/TSN_Sports/status/1892823966617661923" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Cooper said</a>. “This one was different.
