It would be a couple of hours until the White House released the list of those being offered clemency — and until Ms. Parrett, 76, found her name.</p><p>All day, she said, “I have just been in tears.”</p><p>Like many of those whose sentences were commuted by President Biden on Thursday, Ms. Parrett had been released from prison during the pandemic to serve her sentence on home confinement. While that was a relief, she has lived in constant worry that she would be sent back to prison — and Republican lawmakers had been threatening to do just that, by pushing legislation that would have forced people who had been released to home confinement during the pandemic back behind bars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Now, Ms. Parrett, who receives Social Security benefits and recently moved into an apartment in Prescott Valley, Ariz., is hoping she can travel to Indiana to celebrate Christmas with her son, who recently had open-heart surgery. She has five great-grandchildren who live in Florida and Indiana and whom she has never met. As soon as she learns the details of her commutation — which could take a few days, her case manager told her — she will be making travel plans.</p><p>“I’m certainly praying for just a complete release, time served,” she said.</p><p>For Ms. Parrett, the commutation is a joyous turn in a journey that she almost didn’t survive. After being convicted of securities fraud and other financial crimes in 2008, Ms. Parrett, still on bond, fled to Mexico, where, she said, she planned to commit suicide. “I thought life would be better if I was gone,” she said.</p><p>There, she said, she started volunteering in an orphanage and a nursing home and met “people who were worse off than I was.”</p><p>She had been sentenced in absentia to 25 years in prison and was captured in 2010 and began serving her sentence. Much of her time served was in a troubled federal prison in Northern California where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/12/us/warden-ousted-sex-abuse-womens-prison.html" title="">sexual abuse was rampant for years</a>. The federal government recently announced the prison would be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/05/prisons-closing-sexual-abuse-safety#:~:text=The%20BoP%20is%20permanently%20shuttering,assaults%20of%20women%20in%20custody." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed permanently</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, she was thinking about Christmas and was going through old photographs of her son. “It would be a wonderful Christmas, the best I’ve had in a long time,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Around the time that Ms. Parrett’s hairdresser called her, Brian Rowe, who has been living with his mother in Enterprise, Ala., since being released to home confinement three years ago, received a text message from a friend alerting him to the news from the White House.</p><p>Mr. Rowe said that after losing his job as a loan officer during the 2007-8 financial crisis, he had turned to cocaine trafficking. After he was arrested, he refused to cooperate with investigators in exchange for a lighter sentence, and after being convicted at trial, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.</p><p>“It’s amazing, man,” he said. While incarcerated, he said, “I kept fighting. I wrote over 6,500 letters, to senators, congressmen, celebrities, LeBron James.”</p><p>While in home confinement — which allows people to work, attend to errands, volunteer and go on some social outings, based on a schedule agreed to with a case manager — Mr. Rowe, 46, has been working as an assistant manager at a Dollar General store. He said he was waiting to receive the details on his commutation but was planning to celebrate at a Japanese steakhouse. “I have no idea if it’s completely over, but I’m excited,” he said.</p><p>As Ms. Parrett waits to hear when she can travel to see her family, she was spending Thursday afternoon at a local library where she does research and works on writing children’s books about geese.</p><p>While serving her prison sentence in Northern California, she became enamored with the life cycles of Canada geese, who annually migrated to that region. “I have tons of notes about the geese,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
