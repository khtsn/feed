Yanukovych outside a school in a suburb of Madrid on Wednesday morning, according to the Spanish authorities and local news reports.</p><p>Spain’s Interior Ministry said that police officers had responded to an emergency call around 9:15 a.m. about a person with gunshot wounds in the town of Pozuelo de Alarcón. It identified the victim as Andriy Portnov, saying he was shot “several times” in the back and head as he was getting into a vehicle.</p><p>The ministry did not provide further details on any potential suspects or a motive, saying only that there were “several” attackers who had fled the scene and that a homicide investigation was underway to “clarify events.” Local news media reported that Mr. Portnov was shot near the private American School of Madrid, which has not commented publicly on the episode.</p><p>Mr. Portnov served as the deputy head of Mr. Yanukovych’s administration from 2010 to 2014, when Ukrainians took to the streets to protest the president’s decision to forgo closer ties to Europe and instead more closely align with Moscow. The uprising ousted the government of Mr. Yanukovych, who fled to Russia with several allies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Portnov, a former politician, also went into exile but had <a href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2025/05/21/7513311/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">retained some influence</a> in Ukraine.</p><p>Reports said that he had <a href="https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/news-48326968" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">returned to Ukraine</a> after the 2019 election of President Volodymyr Zelensky but that he later <a href="https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-skhemy-portnov-vyyizd/31939594.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">left again</a>.</p><p>In December 2021, the United States imposed sanctions on Mr. Portnov and his charitable foundation on <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0523" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">allegations of corruption and bribery</a>.</p><p>It was unclear whether Mr. Portnov had more recently been engaged in any political activity.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Varenikova covers Ukraine and its war with Russia.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
