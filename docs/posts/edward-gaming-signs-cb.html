</span> playing a variety of agents across the Initiator, Sentinel, and Duelist roles. In that time, Nova has generally hovered around the middle of domestic standings, with their best result being a top-six placement in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2006/champions-tour-2024-china-stage-1" target="_blank">Stage 1 2024</a>.</p>

<p>cb is the latest reinforcement for the storied EDG core best known for lifting the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions 2024</a> trophy as they seek to return to worldbeater form. After winning all three regional events in 2024, EDG struggled to maintain their dominance over China in 2025, missing out on an international event for the first time with a fourth-place finish in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2359/vct-2025-china-stage-1" target="_blank">Stage 1</a>. They managed to qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025/group-stage" target="_blank">Champions 2025</a> in an attempt to defend their Champions title in Paris, but quickly exited the tournament after going 1-2 in the group stage. </p>

<p>EDG has not stated who cb is set to replace, as the team currently has seven players signed to their roster. </p>

		<p>hfmi roles clashed with chichoo sadly. And he was only good on raze..</p>
<p>Cb is ini flex. Good with sent neon raze. Quite different player to s1mon. </p>
<p>Edg is just looking for  firepower to bail them out. </p>	</div>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="5846822" id="29">

	
	
	<div>
		
		<p>I feel like neon raze are lowk kk best agents rn, unless he can play yoru how he used to play jett bc this year his yoru was kinda bum</p>
<p>hopefully roles can figure themselves out bc edg core is one of the oldest cores still together and they are all so individually good</p>	</div>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="5846830" id="30">

	
	
	<p>He gonna stick with yoru. coz his op is nasty if he can combine with yoru &amp; chamber.</p>

		<p>Nova 24k is joining edg in asst coach role.  Cb move is looking like long term solution to bring stability back to edg.. </p>
<p>I think they gonna fry in China. And 1st seed is  important in master 1 &amp; 2.Quite helpful to make deeper int run.</p>
<p>Only challenge is xlg if they are getting wsleo. That guy is similar caliber of happywei rarga.</p>	</div>
