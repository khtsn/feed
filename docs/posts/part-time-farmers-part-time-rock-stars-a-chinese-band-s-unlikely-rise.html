Rather than the usual staples of love and longing, their lyrics dwell on pesticides and poultry rearing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Varihnaz means “fields filled with fragrant rice flowers,” in the language of Guangxi’s Zhuang ethnic minority. To fans, the group offers a refreshing break from China’s hyper-commercialized popular entertainers, with music about a simpler, slower way of life, an alternative to the intense competition of modern Chinese life.</p><p>Ba Nong hopes his music helps people consider shrugging off mainstream expectations themselves. “The more tolerant and developed a society is, the more diverse its lifestyles should be, too,” said the musician, who is 44.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ba Nong harvesting beans on his farm, a few days before the start of his band’s national tour.

He and his bandmates’ commitment to their lifestyle, even at the cost of conventional success, has been a guiding principle since they started attracting national attention last year, on a reality music competition, “The Big Band.”</p><p>When asked on the show what would happen if they advanced to the final rounds that September — which would interfere with the harvest — Ba Nong replied: “Then we’ll try not to get to September.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Before appearing on “The Big Band,” Ba Nong had been making music with a rotating cast of friends under the name Varihnaz for almost 20 years, as a hobby. The group played for crowds of 30 or 40 people and had little desire for more.</p><p>But when the reality show, which has often highlighted <a href="https://jakenewby.substack.com/p/how-tv-show-the-big-band-became-a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">less mainstream musicians</a>, approached him, he readily agreed.</p><p>“It was the peak of the pandemic, there were all kinds of quarantines, and there was also the Russia-Ukraine war,” he recalled during an interview in Guangxi, while loading the last of his harvest into a winnowing machine. “Everything felt very divided and tense.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ba Nong preparing his farm’s organic rice.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>He saw an opportunity to share a message of peaceful coexistence, inspired by natural farming techniques, which eschew chemicals.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“When we went on, I was explaining to everyone about organic rice farming,” he said, laughing. “I was overeager.”</p><p>The broadcast “didn’t show much of that,” he said.</p><p>Yet the band members — who by that point consisted of Ba Nong; Shi Ba, the other farmer; and the bricklayer, Lu Min — also made clear that they were not rejecting modern life, but adapting it. They talked onstage about breaking up harvest days with red wine. Often described as folk music but frequently crossing into rock or blues, their songs are as likely to feature electric guitars as a whistle made of fresh-picked leaves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ba Nong making music with leaves during the first date of Varihnaz’s national tour.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ba Nong was born in rural northwestern Guangxi. At the time, China’s economy was booming, and like so many in his generation, he dreamed of moving to a city.</p><p>He eventually found work as a graphic designer in Guangzhou, the megacity near Hong Kong. On the side, he taught himself guitar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>He played love songs at first. But then friends introduced him to pirated CDs of African folk songs, and to Taiwanese Indigenous musicians who infused traditional sounds with contemporary influences. He wondered why Chinese music seemed to be separated into only two distinct genres — either pop, or folk music like the kind he’d grown up with, which was dismissed as uncultured.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ba Nong holding one of the traditional instruments he studied after returning to his home in rural Guangxi.

Another song, “A Mei Wants to Be a City Girl,” was folk “but expressed the mood of modern people,” he said.</p><p>At the same time, he was growing disaffected by his work designing insurance ads. He read “<a href="https://ishes.org/en/interview/itv04_01.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Half Farmer, Half X Lifestyle</a>,” a book by a Japanese environmentalist about getting by through sustainable agriculture mixed with passion projects. In 2012, he moved home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The change was lonely at first. Most young people were in the cities working, so Ba Nong played with village children. Other villagers couldn’t teach him to farm, because they all used pesticides.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ba Nong at home.

Cognizant that his hometown traditions were endangered, he visited local museums to study traditional instruments. He collected nursery rhymes in the Zhuang language, which has faded as schools push standardized Mandarin, and published a book of his lyrics and poems.</p><p>“Some people told me that my coming back was like retreating from the world,” he said. “I said no, after coming back, I am more useful.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ba Nong couldn’t rely on other villagers to teach him to farm, because they all used pesticides.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>During an event promoting his book in a nearby city, Ba Nong met Shi Ba, who after graduating from a top university chose an itinerant lifestyle, raising pigs, bartending and busking. Shi Ba introduced him to Lu Min, who had left school at 13 and learned to play guitar while working in factories.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Together, they reconstituted Varihnaz, which had gone dormant as Ba Nong pursued other projects.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVEgwFnWhSM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Big Dream</a>,” a song written by Shi Ba, cemented Varihnaz’s popularity on “The Big Band.” The lyrics span a migrant worker’s life, from childhood to old age, and narrate his exhaustion trying to make a living.</p><p>Many audience members cried during the taping. The song went viral, with some declaring it an anthem for a disillusioned generation.</p><p>Fame brought critics, too. Some viewers accused the band of overly romanticizing the countryside, or of exaggerating their farming lifestyles as a marketing ploy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Varihnaz fans at the Guilin concert.

He planned to stay in the city for now. But admired Varihnaz for highlighting the beauty of what he had left behind.</p><p>“To be able to get this emotion from others, and let myself settle down and find a good job, is enough,” he said.</p><p>While Ba Nong expressed some disappointment that Varihnaz’s new popularity had not translated into more people reassessing their own routines, he knew that was a lot to expect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>The band has already achieved more than he ever imagined.
