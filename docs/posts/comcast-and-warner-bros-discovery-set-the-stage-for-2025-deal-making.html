Among them are the leaders of Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN; Comcast, the owner of NBC; and John Malone, the influential investor behind Live Nation.</p><p>In addition, Paramount, the owner of MTV and Nickelodeon, could soon have a new owner in David Ellison, who has access to billions of dollars in capital that could be used to strike additional deals.</p><p>The starting gun went off in October, when Comcast’s president, Michael Cavanagh, said the company was exploring a spinout of its cable networks, which include SyFy, USA and MSNBC, into a new company. Analysts expect the as-yet-unnamed company to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/business/comcast-msnbc-cnbc-spinoff.html" title="">go on a shopping spree</a>, buying up smaller cable networks and peeling off channels from rivals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Malone, the cable pioneer with stakes in many major entertainment companies, went next. In November, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/business/liberty-media-john-malone.html" title="">replaced</a> his longtime chief executive, Greg Maffei, in tandem with a sale of the broadband business Liberty Broadband and a spin out of Liberty Live, a major shareholder in the concert promoter Live Nation. Some of Mr. Malone’s investors think another merger, between Liberty Live and Live Nation, is in the offing.</p><p>On Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was planning to reorganize its company into two big divisions, lumping its traditional TV networks into one group and its streaming and studio businesses into another. In its announcement about the change, the company said it would increase its “strategic flexibility,” corporate argot for creating options to buy and sell things. The company’s shares spiked 15 percent on the news, with investors expecting some kind of transaction.</p><p>The move was intended as a signal to potential suitors that the company was willing to entertain deal discussions, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s strategy.</p><p>“The climate for deal making is going to be really strong in 2025 for a lot of reasons,” said Reed Phillips, the co-founder and chief executive of Oaklins, an investment bank for media, marketing and technology. “It’s a combination of a good economy, the uncertainty about the election being resolved, and there are a lot of companies that need to show growth again so that they themselves are attractive to investors.”</p><p>There is no shortage of smaller companies for these media mammoths to scoop up. The decline of traditional cable has created a clutch of small TV companies trying to navigate the industrywide transition to video streaming. Those players, including AMC Networks, Hallmark Media and A&amp;E Networks, are potential targets for the likes of Comcast and Warner Bros. Discovery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There are also new players coming onto the scene that are interested in acquiring media companies. Antenna, a media company that owns a stake in the Saudi broadcaster MBC, has been exploring deals for English-language media companies, including the News Movement. RedBird IMI, a media company backed by the United Arab Emirates and run by the former CNN chief executive Jeff Zucker, recently tried to purchase The Telegraph, the British newspaper.</p><p>Wall Street bankers have been gearing up for the prospect of a deal spree following the election of Donald J. Trump, who they anticipate will put up fewer regulatory roadblocks on deals than President Biden.</p><p>David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, told analysts on an earnings call in November that he was optimistic about prospects under the new administration.</p><p>“It may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different, that would provide a real positive and accelerated impact on this industry that’s needed,” Mr. Zaslav said.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s picks to lead the antitrust agencies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/politics/trump-gail-slater-antitrust-justice-department.html" title="">Gail Slater</a> as assistant attorney general at the Justice Department and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/trump-ftc-andrew-ferguson.html" title="">Andrew Ferguson</a> at the Federal Trade Commission, have so far largely reassured deal makers. Still, the pair have made it clear they will continue to closely scrutinize the kind of big technology companies, like Amazon, that may be buyers of media companies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And some antitrust experts say that Ms. Slater and Mr. Ferguson could apply greater scrutiny to media companies that they believe have a liberal bias. Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/business/dealbook/att-time-warner.html" title="">opposed</a> AT&amp;T’s acquisition of Time Warner during his first term, a stance many attributed to his frustrations with CNN. A federal judge ultimately overruled the Justice Department’s opposition to the deal. </p><p>“The reality is that under a Trump administration,” said David Schwartz, a partner at the law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, “deals that are disfavored politically are likely to see significantly heavier scrutiny.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lauren Hirsch covers Wall Street, including M&amp;A, executive changes, board strife and policy moves affecting business.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lauren-hirsch">More about Lauren Hirsch</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Media Industry</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Onion:</strong> A judge said he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/business/media/the-onion-infowars-alex-jones.html">not approve the sale of Infowars</a>, the website founded by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, to the satirical publication, prolonging a messy tug of war between two high-profile suitors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fox News and News Corp.:</strong> A Nevada commissioner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/business/media/rupert-lachlan-murdoch-family-trust.html">ruled against Rupert Murdoch’s attempt to change his family’s trust</a> to consolidate his eldest son’s control of his media empire and lock in Fox News’s right-wing editorial slant, according to a sealed court document.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Observer:</strong> Shortly after a 48-hour strike by journalists ended, the Guardian Media Group said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/business/guardian-observer-sale.html">struck a deal to sell The Observer</a>, the U.K.’s oldest Sunday paper, to the digital start-up Tortoise Media.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Los Angeles Times:</strong> Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the newspaper’s billionaire owner, said that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/business/media/la-times-owner-bias-meter.html">planned to introduce a “bias meter”</a> next to the paper’s news and opinion coverage as part of his campaign to overhaul the publication.</p></li><li><p><strong>DirecTV:</strong> The company is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/business/dealbook/directv-dish-network-deal-collapse.html">calling off its plans to acquire the rival satellite TV giant, Dish Network</a>, after Dish’s lenders refused to agree to the terms of the deal.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
