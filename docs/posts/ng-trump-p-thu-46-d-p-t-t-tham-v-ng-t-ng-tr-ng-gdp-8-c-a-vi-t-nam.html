</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The reason is not just the pandemic. For at least a decade, starting around 2013, students in the bottom quartile have been losing ground on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a key exam that tests a national sample of fourth and eighth grade students in math and reading.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The bottom quartile is made up of students from various backgrounds, but it includes a higher proportion of students with disabilities, students learning English and children from poor families. Since the pandemic, their scores have often continued to fall, even as high achieving students stabilize.</p><p>“Whatever is happening to the lower performers is still happening,” said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank, who has <a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/testing-theories-of-why-four-keys-to-interpreting-us-student-achievement-trends/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracked the trend</a>.</p><p>Researchers point to a number of educational and societal changes over the past decade, including a retrenchment in school accountability, the lasting effects of the Great Recession and the rise of smartphones, which has coincided with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8016c64-63b7-458b-a371-e0e1c54a13fc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worsening cognitive abilities even among adults</a> since the early 2010s.</p><p>Figuring out what has happened to the lowest performers is critical, not just for their futures, but for the country’s success.</p><p>By leaving behind a huge swath of students, the United States is preparing fewer citizens to do the most technical and high-paying jobs, said Jason Dougal, who studies effective school systems at the National Center on Education and the Economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That only widens income inequality in the labor market, he said. And it pushes the United States further from top countries on education — places like Singapore, Japan and Ireland — which succeed not just by raising scores for their top performers, but by lifting up their lowest students.</p><p>“To get high average performance, you can’t allow a significant portion of your population to be performing at low levels,” Mr. Dougal said.</p><h2 id="link-24bc6950">More students with challenges</h2><p>Since the early 2010s, the United States has taken in <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/immigrant-population-over-time" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more immigrants</a>, which means <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cgf/english-learners-in-public-schools#:~:text=The%20percentage%20of%20public%20school,%2C%20or%204.6%20million%20students)." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more students learning English</a> have entered public schools. Schools are also serving <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cgg/students-with-disabilities" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more students with disabilities</a>.</p><p>Those demographic shifts could help explain some change in scores. Both groups are more likely to score below their peers on standardized tests. But it is most likely not the biggest factor, experts said.</p><p>The increases are small as a share of the total public school population.</p><p>And since 2013, almost every student category has seen significant declines among low performers, said Chad Aldeman, an education researcher and columnist for The 74, a nonprofit news site, who has <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/across-all-ages-demographics-test-results-show-americans-are-getting-dumber/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">written about</a> the phenomenon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The declines have sometimes been greater for more advantaged groups.</p><p>For example, in eighth grade math, the bottom 10 percent of proficient English speakers lost more ground than the lowest-scoring English learners, <a href="https://www.chadaldeman.com/p/dont-blame-the-subgroups" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Aldeman found</a>. Similarly, his analysis showed that the lowest-scoring students who did not have a disability fell more than the lowest-scoring students who did. The bottom scoring middle- and higher-income students lost more ground than the bottom low-income students.</p><p>This suggests that there is something about being a low-achieving student, regardless of background, that is driving the trend.</p><h2 id="link-6ee0aace">School accountability has faded</h2><p>One possible explanation is the end of <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/no-child-left-behind-an-overview/2015/04" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">No Child Left Behind</a>, the contentious school accountability law President George W. Bush signed in 2002.</p><p>The law is perhaps best known for its legacy of standardized testing, including annual exams in math and reading in third through eighth grade.</p><p>But it also put a sharp focus on low performers, part of Mr. Bush’s campaign against what he called “the soft bigotry of low expectations” in public schools. The law set a goal of having all students reach proficiency. Schools were required to break out testing data by race, income and special education status, and schools that did not show progress could face penalties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It corresponded with a period of rapid improvement in test scores, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/2018-brown-center-report-on-american-education-trends-in-naep-math-reading-and-civics-scores/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">particularly in math</a>. Reading scores also improved, though more modestly.</p><p>The biggest increases were for students at the bottom.</p><p>But the law was also deeply unpopular on the left and the right.</p><p>Critics argued it was too punitive, with unrealistic goals. Many said it led a “drill and kill” culture of teaching to the test, leaving less time for other important subjects like social studies and the arts.</p><p>By the early 2010s, states had gotten waivers from the law, and in 2015, the Every Student Succeeds Act returned power to the states, which in many cases led to more relaxed accountability.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Around the same time, scores among low performers began to fall.</p><p>“When we had meaningful accountability at the state and local level, kids were doing better,” said Margaret Spellings, Mr. Bush’s education secretary from 2005 to 2009. “When we stopped doing that, we went the wrong direction.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Today, 90 percent of U.S. adults and a similar share of teenagers own a smartphone, as do one in three 9-year-olds.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Whitney Curtis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-59751bdd">Other theories: screen time and the Great Recession</h2><p>School policies are most likely only part of the picture.</p><p>Adults have also been struggling with literacy since 2012, not only in the United States but also in other countries, according to <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/survey-of-adult-skills-global-launch-presentation-11-december-2024/273993577#10" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an international survey of 16- to 65-year-olds</a>.</p><p>The declines were driven by adults in the bottom tier of literacy, a shift that could not be explained by demographic trends, said Andreas Schleicher, director for education and skills at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which manages the survey.</p><p>He and other researchers pointed to another possibility: the rise of smartphones, which before <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2013</a> had not reached half of American adults. Today, 90 percent of U.S. adults and a similar share of teenagers own a smartphone, as do <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/8-18-census-integrated-report-final-web_0.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one in three</a> 9-year-olds.</p><p>It’s not entirely clear why smartphone use would have a greater effect on low performers. But smartphones also take time away from other activities. Children (<a href="https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/2022-SPPA-final.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and adults</a>) are reading fewer books than in the past, with low-scoring students being <a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/ltt/2023/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the least likely to read recreationally</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Still, other societal changes could also be at play.</p><p>After the Great Recession, states cut school spending, leading to teacher layoffs and other cutbacks. The spending cuts took place over several years, peaking <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d23/tables/dt23_236.15.asp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in the 2011-2012 school year</a>. Experts say the cuts were more likely to affect low-scoring students, who tend to be in poor school districts that relied heavily on state funding.</p><p>“Many things can be true at the same time, but I’m confident that changes in school spending over time are a big part of it,” said Kirabo Jackson, an economist at Northwestern University, whose <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20180674" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> found that students most exposed to Great Recession cuts experienced greater declines in test scores and college attendance.</p><h2 id="link-48fab1a5">What now?</h2><p>Part of the answer may lie in simply focusing on students at the bottom, said Carey Wright, the former state superintendent in Mississippi, where the lowest-performing students have defied national trends.</p><p>Mississippi’s lowest-scoring fourth graders have improved since 2013, and eighth graders have fallen less than the national average. Mississippi received widespread attention for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/reading-scores-phonics-mississippi-alabama-louisiana-5bdd5d6ff719b23faa37db2fb95d5004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dramatically improving reading scores</a> after adopting a new, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/us/science-of-reading-literacy-parents.html" title="">phonics-based approach</a> to teaching reading in 2013.</p><p>But the state also approved a new school accountability policy that same year. Schools receive <a href="https://www.mdek12.org/sites/default/files/Offices/MDE/OCGR/understanding_accountability.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A-F letter grades</a> based on how well students perform on tests, with an emphasis on the progress made by the lowest 25 percent of students. Literacy coaches are also assigned to the lowest-performing schools.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“We really started drawing teachers’ eyes, principals’ eyes, to who is in the bottom? What do they need?” said Dr. Wright, now the superintendent in Maryland.</p><p>Soon, though, there could be even less reliable information on how the lowest-performing students are doing, as the Trump administration seeks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trumps-education-back-to-the-states.html" title="">shrink the role of the federal government</a> in education.</p><p>As part of a major downsizing at the U.S. Department of Education last month, the Trump administration laid off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/education-department-cuts.html" title="">nearly all federal employees</a> who work on education research, including the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the only test that makes it possible to compare students across the country.</p><p>The cuts could hamper the national test, which is required by law every two years.</p><p>“Eventually, I hope we’re going to be closing these gaps,” said Thomas Kane, an economist at Harvard University who focuses on student achievement. But the test results are “the only way we’re going to know it.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
