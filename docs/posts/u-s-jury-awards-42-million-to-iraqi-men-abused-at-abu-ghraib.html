It awarded each of the men $3 million in compensation and another $11 million in punitive damages.</p><p>The jury found that the contractor conspired with U.S. soldiers to “inflict torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment” on the three detainees.</p><p>The verdict came in the second trial of the case. The first ended in a mistrial earlier this year when a jury was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/us/abu-ghraib-torture-lawsuit-mistrial.html" title="">unable to reach</a> a verdict.</p><p>Both trials took place before Judge Leonie M. Brinkema in the Eastern District of Virginia.</p><p>The first jury heard testimony directly from the three plaintiffs, Salah Hasan Al-Ejaili, Suhail Al Shimari and Asa’ad Al-Zuba’e — the first time that a civilian jury had heard accounts of America’s post-9/11 torture program directly from detainees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/world/middleeast/contractor-settles-case-in-iraq-prison-abuse.html" title="">similar case</a> against the Titan Corporation, as well as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/us/cia-torture-lawsuit-settlement.html" title="">lawsuit against two psychologists</a> who contracted with the C.I.A. to help devise the agency’s brutal post-9/11 interrogation methods, settlements were reached before there was a trial.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/us/iraq-prison-lawsuit-abu-ghraib-abuse.html" title="">The three men said</a> they were subjected to harsh and degrading treatment at the hands of their captors, including threats against family members, being chained to pipes overnight, and being forced to strip naked and masturbate. Some of the military police who were involved with abusing the men were seen in photos that became public and made Abu Ghraib a scandal in 2004.</p><p>“This is a big day, even for America,” Mr. Al-Ejaili said on Tuesday. “Finally, we reach some justice for some of the Abu Ghraib detainees.”</p><p>In court, the defense contractor, CACI International, argued that there was no evidence to show that its employees were directly involved in the abuse at Abu Ghraib. But the jury agreed with the plaintiffs that CACI was liable because it had supplied the interrogators who instructed the military police officers to “soften up” the detainees.</p><p>The verdict is a milestone in more than a decade of litigation between the three men and CACI International, based in Virginia, and its subsidiary CACI Premier Technology.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The men were represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a human rights organization, and by Patterson Belknap Webb &amp; Tyler, a law firm based in New York City.</p><p>“After 21 years, justice has been served for our clients,” said Shereef Akeel, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, who has been representing Abu Ghraib detainees in court since 2004. “The jury heard their pain loud and clear.”</p><p>J. William Koegel Jr., CACI’s general counsel, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment about the verdict and about whether CACI planned to appeal.</p><p>Torture at Abu Ghraib was ultimately investigated by three <a href="https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/taguba.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Army</a> <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA429125.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">generals</a>, <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/16551-document-07-cia-ig-special-review" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the C.I.A. inspector general</a>, two <a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Detainee-Report-Final_April-22-2009.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Senate</a> <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CRPT-113srpt288.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">committees</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/11/world/the-struggle-for-iraq-inspectors-red-cross-found-abuses-at-abu-ghraib-last-year.html" title="">the Red Cross</a>. But the record compiled during the lawsuit, which included internal company communications, and testimony from interrogators, soldiers, and the victims themselves, contained some of the most granular information that has come to light about the prison to date.</p><p>Among the testimony was a 2013 video deposition of Charles A. Graner Jr., who was often described as the prison guards’ “ringleader” and was sentenced by a military jury to 10 years’ confinement. In his testimony, he described the abuse of detainees held at the prison as systemic.</p><p>“Written or unwritten, we followed what we were instructed to do,” Mr. Graner said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump’s Immigration Raids: </strong>Five years ago, the raids upended life for immigrant families in poultry towns, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/arrestees-trump-workplace-immigration-raid-mississippi.html">the industry still runs on their work</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Feud Over One Great Highway: </strong>San Francisco residents are debating whether to turn a two-mile stretch of road along the Pacific Ocean into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/san-francisco-great-highway-proposition-k.html">a bikeway and walking path</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kentucky’s Homeless Camps: </strong>Angel Sivado tries to move people from the streets to permanent housing.
