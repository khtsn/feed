The lawsuit said the Trump administration’s policy of allowing appointees and “special government employees” access to these systems, which contain sensitive information such as bank details and Social Security numbers, was unlawful.</p><p>Members of Mr. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which is not actually a department, have been combing through the databases to find expenditures to cut. The lawsuit says the initiative challenges the Constitution’s separation of powers, under which Congress determines government spending.</p><p>A U.S. district judge in Manhattan, Paul A. Engelmayer, in an emergency ruling early Saturday morning, ordered such officials who had been granted access to the systems since Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, to “immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded from the Treasury Department’s records and systems.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Judge Engelmayer said in the order that the officials’ access heightened the risk of leaks and of the systems becoming more vulnerable to hacking. He set a hearing in the case for Friday.</p><p>The Trump administration’s filing on Sunday noted that the government and the attorneys general were negotiating to “at least narrow” the issues in dispute. The administration’s filing called Judge Engelmayer’s order “markedly overbroad” and said it wrongly constrained even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.</p><p>“There is no sound reason that it should extend to Treasury’s leadership, who are charged with overseeing and administering the department without interruption,” they wrote. “To the extent the order applies to senior political appointees at Treasury, it is an extraordinary and unprecedented judicial interference with a cabinet secretary’s ability to oversee the department he was constitutionally appointed to lead.”</p><p>Federal lawyers defending Mr. Trump, Mr. Bessent and the Treasury Department said the court should dismiss or at least modify the injunction.</p><p>They argued that the order violated the Constitution by ignoring the separation of powers and severing the executive branch’s right to appoint its own employees. The restriction, they wrote, “draws an impermissible and anti-constitutional distinction” between civil servants and political appointees working in the Treasury Department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The filing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/vance-trump-federal-courts-executive-order.html" title="">followed warning shots</a> over the weekend. Vice President JD Vance declared that the courts and judges were not allowed “to control the executive’s legitimate power,” although American courts have long engaged in the practice of judicial review.</p><p>On Saturday, Mr. Trump called the ruling by Judge Engelmayer a “disgrace” and said that “no judge should, frankly, be allowed to make that kind of a decision.”</p><p>The legal battle is just one of dozens of challenges that have sprung up in response to Mr. Trump’s agenda. States and organizations across the country have turned to the courts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/trump-federal-courts-lawsuits.html" title="">in an attempt to create a firewall against</a> the executive orders and policy changes arriving at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-policy-blitz.html" title="">breakneck speed</a>.</p><p>The lawsuit against DOGE in New York could pose a fundamental test of America’s rule of law and the power of the executive against the checks and balances — like the courts and Congress — at the core of U.S. government.</p><p>In their suit, the attorneys general argued that the president cannot unilaterally grant “unfettered access” to secure systems that were previously only accessible to a limited number of career civil servants with security clearances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The president does not have the power to give away our private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress,” they wrote in a statement. “This level of access for unauthorized individuals is unlawful, unprecedented and unacceptable.”</p><p>In the past, federal officials have at times responded to unfavorable decisions with grudging compliance or by dragging their feet. Outright disobedience is exceedingly rare. There has been no clear example of “open presidential defiance of court orders in the years since 1865,” according to a <a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-131/the-endgame-of-administrative-law/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harvard Law Review article published in 2018</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko">More about Hurubie Meko</a></span></p></div><div><p>Benjamin Weiser is a Times reporter covering the federal courts and U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and the justice system more broadly.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benjamin-weiser">More about Benjamin Weiser</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/treasury-securities">Treasury Securities</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/paul-a-engelmayer">Paul A Engelmayer</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/letitia-james">Letitia James</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Executive Power:</strong> President Trump’s early moves to slash the federal government and expand American territory represent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-ideology-power.html">significant ideological swings from his first term</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Courts:</strong> With a compliant Congress and mostly quiet streets, Trump’s opponents are turning to the judicial branch to stop some of his executive orders. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/trump-federal-courts-lawsuits.html">But can the courts keep up?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:</strong> Less than 36 hours after Trump appointed Russell Vought as the consumer bureau’s acting director, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/business/vought-cfpb-musk-trump.html">he shut its operations</a>, throwing the agency into chaos.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Work Force:</strong> One thing lost in the Trump administration’s war on the federal bureaucracy is the collective voice of the employees. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/federal-workers-trump.html">But some have begun to speak out</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> The collapse of the aid agency at the hands of Trump and Elon Musk is already leaving gaping holes in vital health care and other services that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/world/africa/usaid-africa-trump-musk.html">millions of Africans rely on for their survival</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
