    <h1>Trump Argues That Courts Cannot Block Elon Musk’s DOGE Team From Treasury Systems</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Judge Engelmayer said in an emergency order that the officials’ access heightened the risk of leaks and of the systems becoming more vulnerable than before to hacking. He set a hearing in the case for Friday.</p><p>Federal lawyers defending Mr. Trump — as well as the Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and the Treasury Department — called the order “markedly overbroad” and said the court should dismiss the injunction, or at least modify his order.</p><p>They argued that the order violated the Constitution by ignoring the separation of powers and severing the executive branch’s right to appoint its own employees. The restriction, they wrote, “draws an impermissible and anti-constitutional distinction” between civil servants and political appointees working in the Treasury Department.</p><p>The filing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/vance-trump-federal-courts-executive-order.html" title="">followed warning shots</a> over the weekend. Vice President JD Vance declared that the courts and judges aren’t allowed “to control the executive’s legitimate power,” although American courts have long engaged in the practice of judicial review.</p><p>On Saturday, Mr. Trump called the ruling by Judge Engelmayer a “disgrace” and said that “No judge should, frankly, be allowed to make that kind of a decision.”</p></div></div>
