    <h1>Take Better Care of Your Skin</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The beauty industry has always preyed upon our insecurities: Try this lotion or potion to look (and thus be!) happier, healthier, prettier, younger. Savvy marketers use that vanity to convince us that we need products uniquely formulated for cold weather, warm weather, crow’s feet, undereye areas, lips, necks, scalps — and yes, even derrières.</p><p>As a result, there have never been more skin care products out there. My family’s crowded bathroom counter is evidence of this, and my 15-year-old daughter is its driving force. Like many of her peers, she has developed a seemingly limitless appetite for all manner of beauty products. In fact, thanks to Gens Z and Alpha, global beauty sales are expected to reach $590 billion in 2028 (up from $466 billion in 2023).</p><p>But, it turns out, a basic routine still reigns supreme. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain what Wirecutter’s beauty team learned about skin care from months of research, testing and interviews with dermatologists. And I’ll share a simple regimen for healthier skin that won’t break your budget.</p><h2 id="link-76285155">Easy does it</h2><p>That focus on simplicity is something we heard repeatedly during our reporting and testing.</p><p>“Simple is good,” Dr. Neelam Vashi, a dermatologist in Boston, told us. “You really just want to have products that moisturize, rejuvenate and feel comfortable on your skin. There is no magic cream. The magic is just finding the routine and sticking to it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The more extraneous goops you layer on, the more you risk irritating your skin — and the trickier it becomes to discern exactly which ingredient might have triggered a reaction.</p><p>In general, products with short ingredient lists are preferable. And scan ingredient lists to check that your products have components targeting specific skin care concerns — sometimes called active ingredients.</p><p>On the labels of moisturizers and body lotions, for instance, look for water-trapping additives like glycerin, squalane, hyaluronic acid and ceramides. When shopping for a retinoid serum, look for retinol or retinaldehyde (aka retinal). And if you need an exfoliant to improve texture and tone, look for skin-buffing glycolic and lactic acids, or oil-fighting salicylic acid.</p><p>If a product is a bargain, don’t assume it will feel like a compromise: Many of our picks are under $20. Don’t get bamboozled by fancy packaging, either. Some truly amazing products reside in lackluster tubs and tubes (and underperformers can lurk in luxe bottles).</p><h2 id="link-54fedc64">Four steps for skin care</h2><p>It doesn’t take much to maintain healthy skin. Here’s a routine you can follow that requires only a few products and a few minutes of your day.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cleanse. </strong>At night, remove grime, sweat, dirt and makeup. Clean skin allows for better absorption of serums and moisturizers. When you wake up, you can wash again to remove residual skin care products. (If you have dry or sensitive skin, try just rinsing rather than full-on cleansing.)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Treat. </strong>In the morning, use an antioxidant like vitamin C serum to offset damage from sunlight and pollution. On alternating nights, use either a hydroxy acid exfoliant, which whisks away dead skin cells, or a retinoid, which helps minimize fine lines and other signs of aging, acne and oiliness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Moisturize. </strong>Apply cream or lotion to your face and body both morning and night. Massaging the product into slightly damp skin will boost its effectiveness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protect. </strong>Every morning — rain or shine, clear or overcast, at the beach or in the basement — wear sunscreen.</p></li></ul><p>Our testing led us to 31 stellar products across skin types and categories — each ready for heavy rotation in an easy routine. You can find them in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/beauty/skincare/" title="">Wirecutter’s new Skin Care Essentials package</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Mandalay, Myanmar.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sai Aung Main/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><ul><li><p>The death toll of the earthquake that shattered central Myanmar has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/world/asia/myanmar-earthquake.html" title="">surpassed 1,600 people</a>.

Not only does he stare down the myths that landed the woman known as John Lennon’s wife in the cross hairs of conspiracy theorists, he gives Ono her due as an artist, musician, peacemaker and revolutionary in her own right. And Sheff — who’s best known for “Beautiful Boy,” a memoir of his son’s drug addiction — is well qualified to do so, if biased in ways he acknowledges: In September 1980, he spent almost three weeks with Lennon and Ono, interviewing them for an article that appeared in Playboy the week Lennon died. He later became friends with Ono. “I didn’t varnish the truth to depict Yoko as either a saint or a sinner,” Sheff writes. “Instead, I did my best to strip the varnish away.” The result is a time capsule from another era, and a thoughtful look at a determined woman who tried to make it better.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Montgomery for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lulu-garcia-navarro"><img alt="Lulu Garcia-Navarro" title="Lulu Garcia-Navarro" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/29/reader-center/author-lulu-navarro-garcia/author-lulu-navarro-garcia-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p></div></div></div><p><em>This week’s subject for The Interview is the former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who now hosts “The Megyn Kelly Show” on YouTube and SiriusXM.</em></p><p><strong>One of the things you did, which is a red line for most journalists, is that you showed up at one of Donald Trump’s rallies right before the election, and you formally endorsed him.

I don’t agree with that because I can still hit Trump, and do. There’s no question that I owned my bias on Trump and crossed a line that I had never crossed before, and never would have crossed when I was still straight news, ever. It’s just this weird new hybrid lane I’m in that even made it a possibility in my mind, that I even allowed myself to consider saying yes to the invitation.</p><p><strong>I think a lot of people saw you endorsing Trump as caving — as essentially going to where the power is.</strong></p><p>I don’t think it was me caving.
