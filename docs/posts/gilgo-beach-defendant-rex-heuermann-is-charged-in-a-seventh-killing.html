Six of the women Mr. Heuermann is charged with killing were found along Gilgo Beach on Long Island; another of his alleged victims was found nearby in Southampton.</p><p>Mr. Heuermann was arrested last year, and charges continue to mount even as his case inches toward trial. He has pleaded not guilty repeatedly, and did so again on Tuesday, one of the few times Mr. Heuermann’s voice has been heard since he was taken into custody in Manhattan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Your honor, I’m not guilty of any of these charges,” he said, dressed in a jacket and tie, his hands cuffed behind his back. The declaration elicited snorts from several victims’ relatives attending the hearing.</p><p>Mr. Heuermann’s methods of dismembering and disposing of Ms. Mack mirrored many of his manual’s techniques, as well as the content in his “significant collection of violent, bondage and torture pornography,” prosecutors wrote in court papers.</p><p>Ms. Mack’s partial remains were found in 2011 near Gilgo Beach, but 11 years earlier, investigators found other parts of her body in Manorville, on Long Island, after being alerted by a group of hunters, prosecutors said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Victims’ relatives comforted Ms. Mack’s family after Mr. Heuermann was indicted in her killing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johnny Milano for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Prosecutors said that Mr. Heuermann used rope to bind Ms. Mack, a sharp object to mutilate one of her breasts and a hand saw to cut her in pieces. He seemed to have cut off a tattoo from Ms. Mack’s foot to obscure her identity, they said, and possibly used drain cleaner to assist with the disposal of her body. He even seemed to have mentioned the dumping location, near Mill Road in Manorville, in the planning document, they said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The document’s final entry under the heading “Body Prep” was “package for transport.”</p><p>Mr. Heuermann remains in jail awaiting a trial that the judge in the case, Timothy P. Mazzei, is pushing to schedule next year.</p><p>After the hearing, the Suffolk County district attorney, Ray Tierney, spoke of the “tension” between having to expedite the case and investigating other deaths that might be connected to Mr. Heuermann.</p><p>Prosecutors say that DNA matches, phone records and internet activity all tie Mr. Heuermann to the killings, and that advances in technology have enabled them to match hairs found on the remains of the six victims to the genetic profiles of Mr. Heuermann’s immediate family.</p><p>In Ms. Mack’s case, prosecutors say that hairs found on her body match the genetic profile of Mr. Heuermann’s wife, Asa Ellerup, and their daughter, Victoria Heuermann, who would have been a little girl at the time.</p><p>Prosecutors have said the family members were not involved with the killings and were typically out of town during the crimes. They have said Mr. Heuermann waited for his wife and children to leave on vacations and then may have attacked his victims in the basement of the family’s home in Massapequa Park on Long Island.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>This enabled him to lead a double life, one that they say the planning document provides a window into. It suggests he engaged in sadistic sexual acts with his victims before and after their deaths.</p><p>After the court hearing, Mr. Heuermann’s lawyer, Michael J. Brown, told reporters that investigators seemed to have found no evidence of the alleged victims’ DNA on the truckloads of items seized from his house.</p><p>Mr. Brown said there seemed to be “something weird” about prosecutors’ pattern of finding a withered hair or two on each victim they connected to Mr. Heuermann, while likely ignoring other possible genetic evidence that might weaken their case.</p><p>Mr. Brown also questioned the admissibility of the genetic evidence, saying that the California lab that prosecutors used to conduct the genetic tests had “never been deemed reliable in our state” for criminal evidence.</p><p>Investigators discovered 10 Gilgo victims in 2010 and 2011. They included eight women, a man and a little girl.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The so-called Gilgo Four, a quartet of bodies in a neat grouping along a quarter-mile stretch of Ocean Parkway near Jones Beach, were quickly identified. Progress was much slower in identifying the other bodies.</p><p>After Mr. Heuermann was arrested in July 2023, he was charged with killing the Gilgo Four. In June, he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/nyregion/gilgo-beach-rex-heuermann.html" title="">indicted in the fifth and sixth murders</a>: of Jessica Taylor, whose partial remains were found in the Gilgo area, and of Sandra Costilla, whose remains were found in Southampton and who had not been previously associated with the Gilgo investigation.</p><p>The unidentified victims include a young Asian man found wearing women’s clothing, a woman referred to as Peaches because of a tattoo and her toddler daughter, who was found wrapped in a blanket, wearing gold jewelry and bearing no signs of trauma.</p><p>For years, Ms. Mack was known only as Jane Doe No. 6. Then in 2020, investigators matched her genetic profile with a cousin in Georgia and then to blood relatives in New Jersey, including Tricia Hazen, a half sister of Ms. Mack.</p><p>With that, they were able to find and notify her adoptive parents, Edwin and JoAnn Mack, who had not seen Ms. Mack since 2000. She had led a troubled life involving drugs and prostitution and at 24 disappeared after leaving her parents’ home, bound for New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Mack was born in 1976 as Valerie Fulton, the youngest of five children of Patricia Fulton, who herself was one of 15 children and whose life was so marred by drugs and hardship that she placed her young children in foster care, Ms. Hazen said in an interview before the indictment.</p><p>The Macks, who attended the hearing on Tuesday, gained some solace in 2021 by claiming Ms. Mack’s remains and holding a memorial on their back deck. Her ashes are kept in a container next to a framed photo of her.</p><p>“He’ll get his punishment, either here or in the next world,” Ms. Hazen said of Mr. Heuermann before the indictment. “He has to answer to God and hopefully he’ll answer here on earth, too.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Corey Kilgannon is a Times reporter who writes about crime and criminal justice in and around New York City, as well as breaking news and other feature stories.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/corey-kilgannon">More about Corey Kilgannon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
