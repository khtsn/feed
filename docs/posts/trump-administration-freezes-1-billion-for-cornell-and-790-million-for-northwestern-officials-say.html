Other schools that have had funds threatened include Brown, Columbia, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton.</p><p>Cornell and Northwestern are both facing investigations into allegations of antisemitism and into accusations of racial discrimination stemming from their efforts to promote diversity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Cornell officials said in a statement that they had received more than 75 stop-work orders from the Defense Department on Tuesday, but that they had no information to confirm that more than $1 billion in funding had been suspended. The affected grants, they said, supported research that they described as “profoundly significant to American defense, cybersecurity and health.”</p><p>“We are actively seeking information from federal officials to learn more about the basis for these decisions,” said the joint <a href="https://statements.cornell.edu/2025/20250408-federal-research-funding.cfm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from Michael Kotlikoff, the university president; Kavita Bala, the provost; and Robert Harrington, provost for medical affairs.</p><p>Jon Yates, a spokesman for Northwestern, said that the university had not been notified by the federal government that funding had been frozen.</p><p>Northwestern, a Big Ten university, is the first non-Ivy League school to have funding from the Trump administration targeted under investigations of alleged discrimination. The university issued a “<a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/leadership-notes/statements/2025/progress-report-on-northwestern-university-efforts-to-combat-antisemitism.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">progress report</a>” last week that highlighted its efforts to protect Jewish students, including mandatory antisemitism training for all students, faculty and staff.</p><p>“Federal funds that Northwestern receives drive innovative and lifesaving research, like the recent development by Northwestern researchers of the world’s smallest pacemaker, and research fueling the fight against Alzheimer’s disease,” Mr. Yates said. “This type of research is now at jeopardy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Yates added that Northwestern had “fully cooperated” with federal and congressional investigations.</p><p>Linda McMahon, the education secretary, has been explicit about the administration’s focus on elite universities, which Mr. Trump has criticized as bastions of left-wing thought. She has said that taxpayer support is a “privilege” that can be withdrawn if universities do not adhere to civil rights law.</p><p>Like other universities, Cornell and Northwestern were the site of clashes over the war in Gaza.</p><p>Cornell and Northwestern were among 60 universities that the Trump administration warned last month of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/trump-colleges-antisemitism.html" title="">potential enforcement actions</a> over investigations into allegations of antisemitism. Each school also has investigations pending into accusations of racial discrimination.</p><p>Last month, the Republican-controlled House Education Committee chided Northwestern over legal clinics at its law school that had represented organizers of an anti-Israel protest.</p><p>University officials have said the legal clinics were providing <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/07/northwesterns-legal-clinics-draw-scrutiny-congress" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">training for students</a> and were not representing the views of the school. In a <a href="https://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ltr_to_northwestern_3.27.25.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> to the school, Representative Tim Walberg, the chairman of the committee, and Representative Burgess Owens, the chairman of the panel’s subcommittee on higher education, described the training as “illegal, antisemitic conduct.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Cornell also recently defended itself against claims that it was not doing enough to stop antisemitism. In a New York Times opinion essay, Dr. Kotlikoff, the president of Cornell, described the nation’s universities as institutions built to uphold and advance democratic norms even in the face of escalating political and legal risks.</p><p>“A messy event that turns into viral videos causes understandable concern to trustees and alumni, and adds more fuel to already burning fires,” Dr. Kotlikoff <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/opinion/ideas-universities-controversey-protest.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" title="">wrote</a> last week. “But if we are to preserve our value and our meaning, we cannot let our caution overtake our purpose. Our colleges and universities are cradles of democracy and bulwarks against autocracy.”</p><p>Vimal Patel<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael C.
