The train was traveling from Boston to Richmond, Va. There were no reported injuries among the 236 passengers and crew members on the train, the spokeswoman added.</p><p>The police were responding to a call around 5:58 p.m. that multiple people were on the train tracks, Bristol Borough Police Chief Joe Moors said. As officers walked up the hill to the tracks, Chief Moors said, they saw the train hit all three people. Bristol is a small community about 20 miles northeast of Philadelphia.</p><p>The three people were members of the same family, he said. It is not immediately clear why they were on the track. No further information was released as of Thursday evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Train service has resumed at restricted speeds between New York and Philadelphia about four hours after the delays, Amtrak said.</p><p>Trains between Penn Station and Washington Union Station were also experiencing delays, and normal operations would resume once the affected area had been cleared, Amtrak said on its website. The suspension effectively halted traffic along the midpoint of the Northeast Corridor, the busiest train line in the country.</p><p>Passengers on the Acela high-speed train involved in the incident were moved to nearby train stations, either north to Tullytown or south to Croydon, Chief Moors said at a news conference on Thursday.</p><p>This is the second fatal train strike in Bucks County this week. In neighboring Bensalem, Pa., on Wednesday, an Amtrak train traveling from Washington to Boston struck and killed a man near Cornwells Heights Station.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
