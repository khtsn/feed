At least two others were also hit by the train.</p><p>The train hit three people on the tracks at around 6:10 p.m. near Bristol Station, according to an Amtrak spokeswoman. The train was traveling from Boston to Richmond, Va. There were no reported injuries among the 236 passengers and crew members on the train, the spokeswoman added.</p><p>The Amtrak Police Department is leading the investigation into the incident in cooperation with the Bristol Township Police Department.</p><p>Trains between Penn Station and Washington Union Station were also experiencing delays, and normal operations would resume once the affected area had been cleared, Amtrak said on its website. The suspension effectively halts traffic along the Northeast Corridor, the busiest train corridor in the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, whose district includes Bristol, called the train strike a “devastating tragedy.”</p><p>A coroner had arrived on the scene as of late Thursday evening, according to <a href="https://levittownnow.com/2025/04/03/multiple-people-struck-by-train-in-bristol/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Levittown Now</a>, a local news outlet.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></div></div></section></article></div>
