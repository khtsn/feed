On Sunday morning, the storm forecast for Sunday night was rated as severe enough for people to start chasing the aurora borealis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Some people in northern Europe, Wyoming and Canada did report seeing the northern lights on Sunday night. But the storm weakened, disappointing people elsewhere who had hoped to see a show.</p><p>The magnetic orientation of a geomagnetic storm can change “in a minute’s notice,” and the energy transfer can become less efficient, said Lt. Cmdr. Bryan R. Brasher, a project manager at the Space Weather Prediction Center at NOAA.</p><p>“To get the aurora, you need a very strong C.M.E. or several C.M.E.s,” he said, referring to coronal mass ejections, and for the “magnetic field to be southward and stay southward,” he said.</p><p>While there are multiple characteristics that influence the northern lights, a strong southern magnetic field is most favorable for creating a high-ranking geomagnetic storm. The colors of the northern and southern lights are then generated by the particles flying from the sun and interacting with that magnetic field.</p><h2 id="link-7d7f56aa">Why is it so hard to forecast these storms?</h2><p>We’re talking about a space storm here. It’s a far cry from trying to measure the chance of rain, Commander Brasher said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Space weather is monitored using telescopes and other instruments, and the Space Weather Prediction Center has a five-level scale to rate geomagnetic storms. The storms are rated on a “G” scale of 1 to 5. The higher the rating, the more severe the storm. In May 2024, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/world/europe/aurora-northern-lights-solar-storm-photos.html" title="">a global northern lights show</a> was ranked as G5.</p><p>Forecasters are looking for coronal mass ejections on the sun some 92 million miles away and rely on cameras to determine their trajectory and speed.</p><p>Despite those challenges, the forecasters are pretty good at it, he said.</p><h2 id="link-33424026">Will there be another chance to see the northern lights on Monday?</h2><p>The storms predicted for Monday are on the weaker end of the scale, ranked G1 and G2, Commander Brasher said, but that means there’s still a chance to see the northern lights overnight across parts of the northern United States, including Alaska, northern Montana and northern Minnesota. (The key word here? “Chance.”)</p><p>Make sure to keep an eye on the weather forecast, too. Clouds and rain are expected in northern Minnesota, which would hide the aurora borealis.</p><h2 id="link-22a341b7">What’s the best way to chase the northern lights?</h2><p>To start, go somewhere really dark away from city lights. Aim for a midnight viewing far from any light pollution, Commander Brasher said. (If the sky is cloudy, you are unfortunately out of luck; the clouds will block out the light show.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“These things wax and wane very quickly,” even in a big geomagnetic storm, Commander Brasher said. Every once in a while there will be a burst of aurora and then it will go quiet for one to two hours.</p><p>So if you really want to see the northern lights, you’ll need to be patient. Keep an eye on the Space Weather Prediction Center’s <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aurora forecast</a>, and hunker down.</p><p>“True aurora watchers are there for several hours,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Talya Minsberg is a Times reporter covering breaking and developing news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
