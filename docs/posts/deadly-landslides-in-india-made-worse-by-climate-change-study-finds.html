		<p>Let&#39;s just agree that Riot saying &#34;This team cant be on this side of the playoff bracket&#34; is what ruined the draw. They&#39;re saying they&#39;d rather have 3 same region matchups, then the possibility of a Trace Lev rematch or a DRX Fnc rematch in winners. - Not having rematches in the opening round is great, but the same side of bracket things makes 1st round GROUP A vs B and GROUP C v D</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="3971041">
		
		
		<p>Yes that was a very weird rule, and now we have regional matchups. Good thing is that we have at least a losers bracket so there won&#39;t be any &#34;team kills&#34; yet. Very sad to see my china bros fighting against each other :&lt; </p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div></div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="3976418">
		
		
		<p>It makes sense to me. Group stage rematches aren‚Äôt allowed in upper bracket and it was clearly a random draw as seen on live broadcast so no riot didn&#39;t say &#34;this team cant be on this side of the playoff bracket&#34; . Just sucks to have regional match ups and even then most people don&#39;t watch every region but most likely do watch every international tournamnets and idk bout you guys but I&#39;d rather not watch the same shit 2 days later. Aside from the fact that the draws were completely fair, to win the whole tournament, whether it be the first game or the grand finals, you gotta be able to beat the best to be the best. I don&#39;t understand how people cant seem to grasp this simple concept. Why complain? just because your team may have a &#34;hard route&#34; doesn&#39;t mean that its rigged. I say &#34;hard route&#34; as trace beat lev. And on top of that, we&#39;re sill in the upper brackets so there are no stakes on these matches. These regional match ups guarantee that in the lower bracket, where its actually fight or die, we will have different regions knocking each other out of the tournament which to me is a million times more interesting. This was the best case scenario. </p>
