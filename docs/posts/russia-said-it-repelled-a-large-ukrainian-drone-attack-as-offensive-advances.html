    <h1>Russia Said It Repelled a Large Ukrainian Drone Attack as Offensive Advances</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Russian authorities said they had shot down a total of 45 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory overnight. Ukraine said it had intercepted 50 Russian drones over its territory overnight. Neither claim could be independently verified, and the Ukrainian military did not comment on the reported drone attack on Moscow.</p><p>Dual drone assaults away from the front lines have become a feature of the war in Ukraine, with both countries targeting each otherâ€™s military complexes and energy infrastructure. Russia, in particular, has hammered Ukrainian civilian centers with barrages of aerial attacks mixing missiles and attack drones.</p><p>The Ukrainian cross-border offensive in the Kursk region, the largest foreign incursion on Russian soil since World War II, has brought the war to Russia as never before, forcing more than 120,000 civilians to evacuate their towns and villages and leaving the Kremlin scrambling to send reinforcements to halt the Ukrainian advance.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-20-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Institute for the Study of War</a>, a Washington-based think tank, said on Tuesday that Ukraine was continuing to make marginal advances in the Kursk region of Russia. Footage from the battlefield that was geolocated by the Institute shows that Ukrainian troops have entered the outskirts of Korenevo, a small town of about 5,000 people, and pushed into two more villages.</p><p>The Institute also reported that the Ukrainian army is targeting pontoons that Russian forces are trying to install across a section of the Seym River, in the Kursk region, following the destruction or damage of three bridges there by Ukrainian strikes. The attacks in the area seem designed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/europe/ukraine-attacks-russia-bridges-border.html" title="">sever supply routes for Russian troops defending the pocket of territory</a> wedged between the river and the Ukrainian border.</p></div></div>
