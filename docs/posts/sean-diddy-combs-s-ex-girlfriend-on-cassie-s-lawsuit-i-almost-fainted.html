In her suit, Ms. Ventura, known as the singer Cassie, said those encounters left her repulsed but she felt unable to say no.</p><p>“I almost fainted,” Jane testified at Mr. Combs’s federal trial on Monday. “In fact I think I did.”</p><p>“There was a whole other woman feeling the same thing,” she added.</p><p>Mr. Combs is charged with sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy in connection with Jane and Ms. Ventura’s accounts of sexual exploitation. He has pleaded not guilty and vehemently denies coercing the women into sex.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Ventura quickly settled the suit with Mr. Combs for $20 million, but her claims became the basis for a criminal investigation.</p><p>Three days after Ms. Ventura’s suit was filed, Jane texted Mr. Combs: “I feel like I’m reading my own sexual trauma. It makes me sick how three solid pages, word for word, is exactly my experiences and my anguish.”</p><p>Jane is on her third day of testimony in Federal District Court in Lower Manhattan about her tumultuous relationship with Mr. Combs, which started in 2021 and continued until his arrest in 2024.</p><p>She is a remarkable witness against Mr. Combs in part because she continued to date him through the criminal investigation into his conduct. When the government raided Mr. Combs’s homes in March 2024, federal agents visited her home when she was not present. When CNN released a video that May of Mr. Combs brutally assaulting Ms. Ventura, Jane was at his home in Miami Beach and reviewed a draft of his apology. Mr. Combs continues to pay her legal fees, she said, as well as her rent.</p><p>During hours on the stand, Jane read aloud from dozens of emotionally charged text messages chronicling her relationship, which had been sent before and after Ms. Ventura’s suit. They included what she described as threats from Mr. Combs to release sexually explicit videos of the hotel nights to her child’s father.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Jane has testified that at the start of her relationship with Mr. Combs, she began to participate in the encounters with a succession of hired men. The couple called these encounters “debauchery” or “hotel nights” in an effort to fulfill her boyfriend’s fantasies.</p><p>The hotel nights, which Jane said followed a repetitive pattern, left her feeling used, exhausted and at times physically sick, she testified. But Mr. Combs was dismissive whenever she voiced her reluctance, she said, and she continued to participate out of a desire to please him — and, eventually, out of a fear that he would revoke financial support if she did not.</p><p>In the spring of 2023, Mr. Combs began paying her rent, creating a dynamic that prosecutors have framed as financial coercion.</p><p>“It’s dark, sleazy, and makes me feel disgusted with myself,” Jane texted Mr. Combs in September 2023, adding that “I don’t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.”</p><p>“I don’t feel like performing loveless, cold sex,” she texted Mr. Combs the next month.</p><p>“I’m not a porn star,” she went on. “I’m not an animal. I need a break.”</p><p>At times, Mr. Combs responded to the texts by promising one-on-one time together; in other instances, he rejected her version of events or brought up the home where she lived with her son.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>As Jane recalled feeling mistreated in the relationship and aggrieved about seeing Mr. Combs’s romantic gestures to other girlfriends, the mogul, sitting in the courtroom between his lawyers, pushed back in his chair, shook his head sharply and rubbed his palm over his face.</p><p>The texts in which Jane expressed an aversion to the sex nights were often followed by a reconciliation — and then a return to their familiar pattern.</p><p>After she complained to Mr. Combs in September 2023 about the hotel nights, Jane testified, he calmed her down on a FaceTime call, and she flew from Los Angeles to see him in New York with the understanding that they would be spending quality time together, not engaging in their typical “debauchery.”</p><p>But when she was on the plane, Mr. Combs texted her that he had a “surprise” for her, making clear that he intended to have a hotel night, Jane testified. In New York, she said, she again voiced discomfort and Mr. Combs grew defensive, insisting that they did not have to go through with the plan.</p><p>But then, Jane testified, “We started riding back to the hotel and then he gives me a pill,” which turned out to be Ecstasy — a drug typically used during those encounters.</p><p>At the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan, the hotel night with the “surprise” male escort did not go well, Jane said, and she ended up flying in another man whom she was more accustomed to.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I felt that I needed to make up for it,” Jane testified.</p><p>In October of that year, Jane and Mr. Combs had an explosive series of communications in which she described herself as feeling sexually “violated” and he responded that she was threatening him. She told him that she felt he had been using the home he paid for as “leverage” for hotel nights, and he responded that she was “crazy” and wrote, “let’s just leave each other alone.”</p><p>At the time, Mr. Combs was enjoying success in his career, after he released his first solo studio album in 17 years and received a series of industry accolades. For his birthday in November 2023, Jane testified, she bought him a television that they could move around the room so they could watch pornography or explicit videos from their hotel nights, in an effort to eliminate the need to invite hired men over.</p><p>Then, as she was trying to rehabilitate their relationship, Ms. Ventura’s lawsuit was filed.</p><p>The jury heard recordings of a pair of phone calls between her and Mr. Combs from shortly after the suit was filed. In the first call, Jane, her voice breaking, tells him, “I was just saying all this.” He tells her, “Let’s get through this together.”</p><p>In the second call, Mr. Combs tells her, “I need your friendship,” and adds, “You know you ain’t got to worry about nothing else.” Asked by Maurene Comey, a prosecutor, to explain how she interpreted what Mr. Combs told her, Jane said she took it as a reference to him continuing to pay the $10,000 monthly rent on her home.</p><p>Jane said she did not know that either of the calls was being recorded.</p><p>In the weeks after, Jane said she continued to vent her feelings of trauma in text messages to Mr. Combs, telling him that she had turned down work opportunities and other relationships to “cater to his fetishes.” Jane testified that after Mr. Combs suggested in a FaceTime conversation that she “charge” him for her resentment, she suggested a price, causing the exchange to devolve into Mr. Combs calling her a “con artist” and threatening to call the police.</p><p>Jane testified that at the height of the argument, he threatened over the phone to show sexually explicit videos of her to her child’s father. She then sent a text to Mr. Combs’s chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, writing that Mr. Combs had threatened her with sex tapes, pleading with Ms. Khorram to “talk some sense into him.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Jane and Mr. Combs didn’t speak for some time, she said, but just over a month after the fight, Mr. Combs sent her an affectionate message, and she agreed to visit him in Miami for her birthday. Her birthday celebration at his home had candles, balloons, gifts and a five-course dinner — the kind of birthday she had always wanted, she testified.</p><p>They took Ecstasy and had sex, Jane testified, and as it became morning, Mr. Combs asked her, “Do you want to see Don?,” referring to a man they often hired for sex.</p><p>Sounding numb, she said she told him, “OK.” Asked by a prosecutor why she agreed, Jane testified that she was so used to the outcome that she just accepted it.</p><p>Olivia Bensimon<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
