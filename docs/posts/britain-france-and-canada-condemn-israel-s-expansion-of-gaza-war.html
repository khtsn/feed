The day before, Britain, France and Canada issued a rare public reprimand of Israel, demanding it cease the renewed military offensive.</p><p>“We have always supported Israel’s right to defend Israelis against terrorism,” a joint statement by the three countries said. “But this escalation is wholly disproportionate.”</p><p>The message made clear that Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza, the high Palestinian death toll and the abysmal humanitarian conditions in Gaza were pushing some of the country’s most powerful international supporters to the limits of what they would tolerate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel is threatening to take full control of Gaza in the next stage of the war and hem Gazans into even more limited zones. Israel has also been blocking humanitarian aid from Gaza for more than two months, even as the U.N. warns that the population is under threat of famine.</p><p>This weekend, Israel said it would begin allowing some humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza. But the authorities let only five trucks in on Monday.</p><p>A senior U.N. humanitarian official, Tom Fletcher, told the BBC on Tuesday that 14,000 babies in Gaza could die in the next 48 hours unless truckloads of aid could enter. He said thousands of trucks, some containing baby food, were ready to move in.</p><p>Britain, France and Canada called the expanded Israeli campaign against Hamas in Gaza and the withholding of aid “egregious actions” that cannot continue.</p><p>“If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response,” the statement said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Britain, France and Canada had handed a “huge prize” to Hamas. He accused them of tacitly encouraging a repeat of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, that killed some 1,200 people in Israel, with 250 taken as hostages to Gaza.</p><p>“This is a war of civilization over barbarism,” Mr. Netanyahu said on social media. “Israel will continue to defend itself by just means until total victory is achieved.”</p><p>The statements from allied countries were a distinct contrast from the early days after the 2023 attack, when governments rushed to back Israel. But as the death toll in Gaza grows and suffering deepens, diplomatic support is fading.</p><p>Israel has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gazan health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>The United States, Israel’s most powerful patron, has not publicly criticized the renewed Israeli offensive. But President Trump has increasingly bypassed Mr. Netanyahu, cutting a separate deal with Hamas to free the last living American hostage and skipping Israel on his trip to the Middle East last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Friday, Mr. Trump said “a lot of people are starving” in Gaza under the Israeli blockade and the United States wanted to help alleviate the suffering.</p><p>In Britain on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced in Parliament the suspension of free-trade talks with Israel, condemning what he said were Mr. Netanyahu’s plans to “drive Gazans from their homes into a corner of the strip to the south and permit them a fraction of the aid that they need.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians fleeing Beit Lahia in Gaza on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>European officials have privately expressed “increasing frustration and even anger with Israeli actions in Gaza,” said Hugh Lovatt, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. The statement on Monday by the allies was “a significant change in tone and message,” he added.</p><p>In March, Israel ended a two-month cease-fire with Hamas that would have freed the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal. Mr. Netanyahu has said Israel could not accept anything less than for Hamas to disarm and its leaders to go into exile.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It is far from clear whether a more intense Israeli assault would defeat Hamas. Israeli forces have reduced much of Gaza to rubble while Hamas has recruited thousands of new fighters.</p><p>Much of the international criticism has centered on the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, a direct consequence of the two-month Israeli blockade that barred food, medicine and other essential relief from entering.
