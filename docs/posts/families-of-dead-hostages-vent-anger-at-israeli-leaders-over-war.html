On Thursday, the Israeli military said forensic pathologists had tentatively assessed that the bodies of all six hostages showed signs of being hit by gunfire, but could not establish whether the shots were fatal. In a statement, an organization representing the families of hostages said the autopsies had revealed bullets in their bodies. </p><p>They were found next to four other bodies without any bullet wounds, who were presumed to be their captors, the Israeli military said. It added that only preliminary conclusions had been reached and that the investigation was still ongoing.</p><p>“They were very much alive. They were not abducted dead. I was with them, I slept next to them,” said Danielle Aloni, a freed hostage who spent time with five of the men while captive in Gaza. “They could have been saved, and they should have been saved.”</p><p>Hamas led a massive surprise assault on Israel on Oct. 7 that killed roughly 1,200 people. About 250 people were taken hostage during the attack. More than 100 of those kidnapped were released during a weeklong truce in November — many of them women and children, including Ms. Munder, Ms. Aloni and Mr. Buchshtab’s wife, Rimon.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Israel responded to the Oct. 7 attack with a ferocious bombing campaign and invasion that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, destroyed wide areas of the enclave and forced nearly all its residents to flee for their lives.</p><p>More than 100 of the captives remain in Gaza, including dozens who are presumed dead by Israeli authorities. There have been conflicting, unverified claims during the war that hostages were killed in Israeli bombardments or murdered by their guards.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has resisted intense and growing pressure from international allies, Israeli security chiefs and many ordinary Israelis to strike a cease-fire deal that would include the release of the remaining hostages. He has stiffened his conditions for a truce in recent weeks, and accused Hamas of doing the same.</p><p>Vowing “absolute victory” over Hamas, Mr. Netanyahu has called it the best way to free the captives. His critics call those goals contradictory.</p><p>“It is clear to all that the return of the hostages is only possible through a deal,” the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters, a support group, said in a statement on Thursday. “The recovery of the six bodies is no achievement; it is a testimony of the complete failure to reach a deal in time.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Israeli military rescue operations have freed just seven hostages so far, while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-rescue-gaza.html" title="">killing scores of Palestinians</a>. The Israeli military has said such operations cannot free all the captives, many of whom are believed to be scattered in Hamas’s extensive warren of tunnels.</p><p>On the winding road to Nir Oz on Wednesday, a handful of people in black T-shirts held up signs asking the Munder family for forgiveness that its patriarch was not rescued in time.</p><p>The Oct. 7 assault devastated Nir Oz, a quiet, tightly knit kibbutz less than two miles from the Gaza border, where more than a quarter of the 400 residents were killed or abducted.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Keren Munder and her son Ohad, both former hostages, survey the burned remains of the home of her brother Roy in April in Nir Oz.

Mr. Munder died in captivity and his son, Roy, was killed on Oct. 7. Three other family members were also kidnapped, and freed in November: Ruti, wife of the elder Mr. Munder; their daughter, Keren, and Keren’s son, Ohad, who was 9 years old.</p></div><div><div><p>Merav Mor Raviv, Abraham Munder’s niece, described him as a gentle, humble man devoted to his family. She said the family had been informed that he survived at least until the beginning of the March.</p><p>“They could have brought him back — there were enough possible deals on the table,” she said.</p><p>Addressing her father at his burial, Keren Munder accused the government of “sacrificing you and those like you. If only they had not searched for an illusory picture of victory.”</p><p>The funerals drew relatives, friends and neighbors, but also strangers who drove in from around the country to stand in solidarity with the survivors. With characteristic Israeli informality, some mourners stood beside the graves in T-shirts, jeans and flip-flops.</p><p>Larry Butler, 74, lost dozens of friends and extended family members in the Oct. 7 attack on Nir Oz. He said the kibbutz’s left-leaning residents felt profoundly abandoned by the right-wing government, for failing both to protect them and to bring home the hostages.</p></div></div><div><p>“It makes you wonder if there’s really a future in Israel,” said Mr. Butler, gazing at graves that had joined the cemetery’s silent ranks since the attack.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mourners lowering Mr. Munder’s coffin into his grave.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>All six of the hostages whose bodies were found on Monday were believed to have survived their ordeal for months, according to their families. The Israeli authorities had announced by last month that five of them — all save Mr. Munder — were presumed dead.</p><p>Among the last people to see the five of them alive were Ms. Aloni and her 6-year-old daughter, Emilia, who were captured in Nir Oz and held by Hamas for seven weeks. They were forcibly marched through the armed group’s tunnels, where they joined other captives from Nir Oz and Nirim, she said. </p><p>Mr. Metzger, who spoke Arabic, mediated with their captors. Mr. Dancyg, a Polish-born Israeli historian, gave impromptu lectures on Jewish history in an attempt to while away interminable days and nights underground, Ms. Aloni recalled.</p><p>Mr. Buchshtab was a kind, introverted man, a musician who also crafted his own instruments. His wife, Rimon, was held with him; the two were deeply devoted to one another, said Ms. Aloni.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“He was quiet, almost never spoke, and was deeply withdrawn into himself. He and his wife sought to just take care of each another,” said Ms. Aloni. “They were such a special couple.”</p><p>At times, the guards would kick him when he snored in his sleep, Ms. Aloni said.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rimon Buchshtab, center, at the funeral for her husband, Yagev Buchshtab, in Nirim, Israel, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Leo Correa/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>They were held in suffocating conditions underground without sunlight and little fresh air, Ms. Aloni said. The other captives, including the elderly, were forced to twist themselves into painful positions on the thin mattresses allotted to them in the tunnels.</p><p>“But they were strong people, they didn’t cry. They weren’t afraid,” Ms. Aloni said. “They were worried, we were all terrified — but they also had this amazing resilience.”</p><p>But she wondered in horror at how they could have borne their captivity as the weeks became months with no end in sight.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“I don’t know how anyone could endure for so long in those conditions,” she said. “I was there for 50 days, and it was a terrible, endless eternity.”</p><p>Their guards moved Ms. Aloni and her daughter several times within the labyrinthine network of Hamas-built tunnels zigzagging under Gaza. Sometimes, some of the male captives were with her, but at other times they were marched off to separate locations, she said.</p><p>In early November, she and Emilia were whisked away to another holding area.
