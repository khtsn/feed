    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The vehicle, bearing the word “Press” in red letters, was hit near the gates of Al Awda Hospital, according to a post on social media from Quds News Network, another Palestinian news outlet.</p><p>The Reuters news agency published a photo from Nuseirat of a charred white van bearing the word “Press” on its rear doors, with smoke coming out of it.</p><p>The local government and Al Quds Today <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEBfbZkoDiE/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">identified</a> the five killed as Faisal Abu Al-Qumsan, Fadi Hassouna, Ibrahim Al-Sheikh Ali, Ayman Al-Jadi, and Mohammed Al-Lada’a. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate condemned the strike and described it as a “war crime.”</p><p>The Israeli military and Shin Bet, the Israeli security agency, said in a joint statement later on Thursday that they had intelligence showing that those killed had been “masquerading as journalists.” They cited information including a list that the Israeli military had found in Gaza of Islamic Jihad fighters, which included the names of four of the five men.</p><p>The military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-hezbollah-journalists.html" title="">has previously said</a> that it has never deliberately targeted journalists but that it considers members of “an organized armed group,” such as the military wing of Hamas, or those who participate in hostilities, as lawful targets.</p></div></div>
