Disney, which licenses the series for Disney+ and cable networks, will release the movie in theaters in 2027.</p><p>Joe Brumm, who created the character, will write and direct the film. “I want this to be an experiential event,” he said in a statement. The voice actors from the series will reprise their roles. The film will be produced by Amber Naismith, whose credits include “The Lego Movie” and “Happy Feet.”</p><p>In a separate social media post, Mr. Brumm added that he would “take a break” from the series, which is heading into its fourth season. “To walk away from it while it’s at such a height will seem crazy to some,” he said. “But for now, I am finding it difficult to reach back genuinely into that four- to six-year-old world and write authentically.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He added, “To be clear, this is not an announcement about the end of the show, but it is an acknowledgment that my focus will be on the film.”</p><p>Disney rarely releases animated movies it does not own. The most recent example was “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/movies/hayao-miyazakis-film-the-wind-rises-gets-complaints.html" title="">The Wind Rises,</a>” a 2013 art film by Studio Ghibli in Japan.</p><p>But Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, co-chairmen of Disney Entertainment, wanted to keep the character in the Disney fold. Bluey is a phenomenon, with more than 50 billion minutes streamed in the United States in 2024, enough to make it the No. 1 streaming show, according to Nielsen.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Brooks Barnes covers all things Hollywood.
