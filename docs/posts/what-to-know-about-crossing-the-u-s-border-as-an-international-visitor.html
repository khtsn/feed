She had attempted to enter the United States from Canada, and questions arose at the land-border crossing whether she had the correct visa.</p><p>Her ordeal came shortly after two German tourists in separate incidents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/europe/german-tourists-detained-deported.html" title="">were deported</a> after trying to enter the United States from Mexico. Both had spent weeks in a detention center in San Diego, and both said they were unclear as to why they had been detained and deported.</p><p>The incidents have sparked international concern over what travelers can expect at U.S. border crossings. Most citizens of most European countries have for years enjoyed visa-free travel, for up to 90 days, to the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s what to know about travel visas and rights for international visitors entering the United States.</p><h2 id="link-7c9e209f">The basics of entering and exiting the U.S.</h2><p>People seeking to enter the United States who are not U.S. citizens must have a valid passport that is not set to expire within six months. Additionally, most people need either a visa or, for citizens of countries participating in the visa-free travel agreement, an <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electronic System for Travel Authorization</a>, known as an ESTA.</p><p>ESTAs are applied for online by submitting a photo (or computer scan) of a valid passport, as well as an email address, home address, phone number and emergency contact.</p><p>For citizens of countries that are not part of the visa-free program, most vetting for visas occurs at consulates in visitors’ home countries, said Jeff Joseph, an immigration lawyer in Denver. Consulate officials will look for signs that people plan to overstay their tourist visas, or intend to work, among other things.</p><p>The visa — or the authorization — is just an entry document to get people to the airport or a land border, Mr. Joseph said. It does not guarantee entry to the United States. Once a traveler arrives, they have to prove that they intend to use the visa as directed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Immigration officials will ask <a href="https://govassist.com/blog/customs-and-immigration-how-to-answer-questions-at-the-airport-when-you-arrive-in-the-us#:~:text=Common%20Questions%20Asked%20by%20CBP,your%20business%20in%20the%20US." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">routine questions</a>, usually regarding the purpose of the visit, the duration of the stay, where travelers plan to stay, and what they plan to do. Visitors can be taken for a second round of questioning, which is longer and more detailed.</p><h2 id="link-790e30f7">Most common visas for visitors</h2><p>The United States has <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html/visa#:~:text=Visitor%20visas%20are%20nonimmigrant%20visas,%2FB%2D2%20visa)." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three categories of visas for nonimmigrant visitors</a>: a visitor visa for those who want to enter temporarily for business purposes, known as a B-1; a tourism visa, known as a B-2; and then a combination visa for both purposes — a B-1/B-2.</p><p>While the visas themselves are <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/iso/visas/b-1-b-2/#:~:text=While%20B%2D1%20or%20B,for%20the%20Visa%20Waiver%20Program." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">valid for up to a decade</a>, visitors are only allowed to stay in the country for six months at most.</p><p>Travelers with these tourist visas are not allowed to study, work a permanent job, do any paid performances, arrive as a member of a crew on an aircraft or ship, work in foreign press or take up permanent residence, according to the State Department. </p><p>To obtain these visas, prospective visitors must complete an online application, provide required documents such as a passport and photo, and schedule a visa interview. The interviews cost $185.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html/visa#:~:text=Visitor%20visas%20are%20nonimmigrant%20visas,%2FB%2D2%20visa)." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to the State Department</a>, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, officials “have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.”</p><h2 id="link-43f172b">Countries with visa-waiver programs</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>When international visitors arrive at border crossings, immigration officials will ask routine questions, usually regarding the purpose of the visit, the duration of the stay, where travelers plan to stay, and what they plan to do. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Blake/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visa-waiver program</a>, which allows most citizens to travel to the United States for business or tourism purposes for up to 90 days, applies to 43 countries. In return, U.S. citizens can travel to those countries for a similar length of time without a visa.</p><p>The program began in 1986 and is seen as a “<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/visa-waiver-program#:~:text=In%20return%2C%20those%20countries%20must,many%20of%20America&#39;s%20closest%20allies." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">security partnership</a>” with U.S. allies.</p><p>Travelers still need a valid ESTA in order to enter the country. The applications cost $21 and the authorizations are active for two years.<span>  </span>The ESTA must be obtained at least 72 hours before boarding a flight.</p><p>There is fine print — for example, you cannot obtain an ESTA if you visited certain countries after certain times, such as Cuba on or after Jan. 12, 2021. If you are not eligible for the ESTA, you must obtain a tourist visa.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Those entering the United States with an ESTA are not allowed to study or work a permanent job.</p><p>In this process, visitors “waive” a lot of rights, Mr. Joseph said, including waiving the right to contest deportation. Because of that, people using this program can be subject to mandatory detention.</p><h2 id="link-5d8d796a">What rights do visitors have?</h2><p>U.S. federal law gives government agents the right to search people’s property, including their phones and laptops, at border entry points. They do not need to be suspected of wrongdoing in order to be searched, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.</p><p>All visitors have the right to remain silent. But the burden of proof rests with visa holders. For example, if an officer asks if someone plans to work on their tourist visa, and that person remains silent, the officer is likely to deny them entry, Mr. Joseph said.</p><p>If a person is found inadmissible during questioning, they can withdraw their intent to enter the country and may then be allowed to travel back to their home country. Their visa is canceled and they often get the next flight home. But an officer can deny the withdrawal, at which point the visitor is detained.</p><p>Because these confrontations occur technically outside the country, the rights outlined in the U.S. Constitution do not apply, Mr. Joseph said, and detainees are not necessarily entitled to a lawyer. The government has about 90 days to deport people. That period can be extended if detainees don’t cooperate by providing the correct travel documents, at which point they can be subject to criminal proceedings. Following an order of removal, people are barred from entering the U.S. for five years.</p><p><strong><em>Follow New York Times Travel </em></strong><em>on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/traveldispatch" title=""><em>sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter</em></a><em> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
