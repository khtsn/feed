At one point, he said, it “probably got within 25 yards of our boat.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>He put down his fishing rod, picked up his phone and started recording. Then the whale breached the water.</p><p>“It was pretty cool because you were seeing this at first light before sunrise,” he said, calling it “really beautiful.”</p><p>Mr. Gatof, a lawyer, said the two men fish as often as they can, using boats from the Freedom Boat Club. Pointing to a recent incident in New Hampshire where a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/whale-boat-capsize-new-hampshire.html" title="">breaching humpback whale capsized a vessel</a>, Mr. Gatof said it was important to give the whale distance and respect its space.</p><p>“We let it drift off, and fortunately it did this amazing breach just sort of right by the boat,” he said, calling it a “pretty special” experience to see it so close and with the skyline in the background.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/15xp-Whale-gclt/15xp-Whale-gclt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/15xp-Whale-gclt/15xp-Whale-gclt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/15xp-Whale-gclt/15xp-Whale-gclt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A whale’s dorsal fin breaches the water with a city skyline in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/15xp-Whale-gclt/15xp-Whale-gclt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/15xp-Whale-gclt/15xp-Whale-gclt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/15xp-Whale-gclt/15xp-Whale-gclt-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/15xp-Whale-gclt/15xp-Whale-gclt-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A juvenile humpback whale swims in Boston Harbor this past Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Faith Ninivaggi/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Both men expressed concern about the many vessels sharing the waters with the whale, but said the animal’s presence was a testament to the environmental success story that is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/us/helping-boston-harbor-a-big-job-begins-at-last.html" title="">cleanup of the Boston Harbor</a>.</p></div><div><div><p>“It really speaks to the health of just the general ecosystem and habitat within that region,” Mr. Mahr said. “The harbor is incredibly active, very clean<em>.”</em></p><p>Linnea Mayfield, the naturalist manager at Boston Harbor City Cruise, which operates ferries for the M.B.T.A., said in an interview that the young whale is believed to be about 2 years old and it was first spotted in the vicinity between July 28 and July 30. It has been seen almost every day since then.</p><p>“What we suspect is that the animal followed food into the harbor,” Ms. Mayfield said, explaining that there’s been an abundance of small schooling fish in the water — the whale’s preferred diet.</p><p>And because the whale has continued to find food, she said, it just hasn’t left.</p><p>“We don’t know if the whale’s necessarily lost,” she said. “I don’t know that we have enough data to support that this animal can’t navigate its way out, or if it just is favoring this area because there’s food around.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>But for all the whimsy and joy that comes with having a humpback in the harbor, there’s also concern. The whale is in a busy part of the harbor where many vessels, including recreational and commercial ones, are “moving at high speeds through this area all day every day.”</p><p>“We are most concerned about this animal becoming distressed or stressed, disoriented or overcrowded,” Ms. Mayfield said.</p><p>Ms. Mayfield said that while it’s not rare for whales to visit the harbor, the animals usually clear out pretty quickly.</p><p>“This is kind of the first time, I think, that we’ve had prolonged sightings of an animal so close to the busiest parts and busiest routes for the M.B.T.A.,” she said, adding that “as far as I know, this is the first time that we’ve really had to notify passengers that there might be some significant delays.”</p><p>Meghean Felling contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore the Animal Kingdom</h2><h3>A selection of quirky, intriguing and surprising discoveries about animal life.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Saving Australian Crocodiles:</strong> The aquatic reptiles cannot resist eating invasive toads that are toxic, so <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/science/crocodiles-cane-toads-bait-australia.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-animal-world&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">scientists gave the crocodiles a dose of nonlethal food poisoning</a> to adjust their behavior.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Whale of a Mystery</strong><strong>:</strong> Old Timer, the world’s oldest humpback whale, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/science/oldest-humpack-whale-old-timer.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-animal-world&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">endured in the Pacific Ocean</a>, while some other humpbacks have struggled in a changing environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>A </strong><strong>Frog’s Help in Sticky Situations:</strong> Sticky secretions, found among frogs as well as salamanders, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/science/frogs-glue-amphibians.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-animal-world&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">are used as natural super glue</a> to foil both predators and overcurious scientists.</p></li><li><p><strong>One </strong><strong>Animals’ Research Assistance</strong><strong>:</strong> With cameras placed on sea lions, scientists demonstrated how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/science/sea-lion-videos-cameras.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-animal-world&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">marine mammals</a> can help map the ocean floor.</p></li><li><p><strong>When Tigers Try to Sneak Up:</strong> Videos in India show that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/science/sloth-bears-tigers-india.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-animal-world&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">sloth bears seem unaware</a> of being stalked by the ferocious felines.
