Russian troops are now less than three miles from the region’s border, and they have been pushing forward in recent days.</p><p>Should the Russian Army cross from the eastern Donetsk region into Dnipropetrovsk, it would deal a big blow to morale in Ukraine — marking the fifth region to face partial Russian occupation and expanding Moscow’s control over the war-torn country. It could also complicate Kyiv’s position in territorial negotiations that might arise during peace talks.</p><p>The Russian advance has already reshaped the landscape of Dnipropetrovsk’s border area, once a quiet expanse of rolling fields and small villages. Now, trenches and anti-tank ditches line roads where convoys of armored vehicles pass. Tanks are concealed in tree lines. In villages closest to the front, soldiers have taken over buildings damaged by bombing or abandoned by locals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A soldier in camouflage inspecting his gun in dim lighting." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj/21ukraine-battlefield-02-tpkj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b1544a01-abf9-5459-bd4e-d9d862b72c49" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers of Ukraine’s Shkval Special Forces Assault Battalion readied weapons and ammunition as they prepared to launch an assault on Russian soldiers advancing toward the Dnipropetrovsk region of eastern Ukraine.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After preparing their weapons, the soldiers crowded into an armored vehicle.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Ukrainian backpedaling can be seen in the westward relocation of the aid station where medics of the 33rd Mechanized Brigade treat wounded soldiers. Late last year, they retreated three times in as many months, hauling medical beds and blood banks in trucks with them.</p><p>The medics never thought they would be forced to entirely abandon Donetsk, an area where their unit had fought for a year, and retreat over its western boundary into Dnipropetrovsk.</p><p>Earlier this year, that became a reality. Now, the medics fear Moscow’s troops will soon follow.</p><p>“It always happens this way,” said Lt. Vitalii Voitiuk, head of the brigade’s medical unit. “When medical units start moving into an area, it means the front line isn’t far behind.” He was speaking at his new aid station near the frontline where injured soldiers receive lifesaving care before being sent to a hospital farther behind the lines.</p><p>Outside the aid station, the distant rumble of outgoing artillery fire echoed through the night. “That alone tells you the war is getting closer,” said Mr. Voitiuk, a burly 34-year-old.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Civilians, too, are bracing for the fight. Some have already evacuated — including those who fled the war in the east earlier and do not want to be caught in the violence again — while others are making plans to relocate.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A woman visiting a roadside memorial to fallen soldiers at the border of the Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions of Ukraine.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“When we read the requests to evacuate people from Dnipropetrovsk, it felt terrifying,” said Bohdan Zahorulko, a worker at East SOS, a Ukrainian nongovernment organization helping internally displaced people. “But it was also a wake-up call about the reality of the fight.”</p><p>Russia’s push toward Dnipropetrovsk, an area of more than three million people with major steel mills, builds on six months of rapid advances in Donetsk. Since August, its troops have captured an average of about 180 square miles of territory each month in Ukraine, nearly four times the size of San Francisco, <a href="https://x.com/Inkvisiit/status/1886363591768428848" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Black Bird Group</a>, a Finland-based research company. Most of those gains were in Donetsk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In recent weeks, Russia’s advance has slowed. Franz-Stefan Gady, a Vienna-based military expert who recently returned from a research trip in eastern Ukraine, attributed the slowdown to bad weather hindering Russian mechanized assaults and airstrikes. He also noted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/magazine/drones-weapons-ukraine-war.html" title="">Ukraine’s effective use of drones</a> to hit troops and armored vehicles.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The 148th Separate Artillery Zhytomyr Brigade of Air Assault forces fired an M777 howitzer at Russian targets from the Kurakhove front line, last week.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers from the unit handling artillery shells.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“But drones can’t hold territory,” said Lt. Col. Vadim Balyuk, commander of the Shkval Special Forces Assault Battalion in Ukraine’s 59th Brigade. Speaking from a small wooden house in the border area, where he monitors live battlefield footage on screens, he said his unit’s job is to do what drones cannot: secure control of villages and clear a path for Ukrainian infantry to move in.</p><p>Colonel Balyuk said his unit had recently cleared two settlements of Russian forces, which could have been used to support their push toward Dnipropetrovsk. But he had no illusions that the fight was over. “The enemy is just regrouping now,” he said.</p><p>Soldiers returning from the Donetsk front said Ukraine’s biggest battlefield challenge remains unchanged: an enemy whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-soldiers.html" title="">overwhelming manpower advantage</a> allows for relentless assaults.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Dmytro, a 35-year-old infantryman with a concussion, was evacuated to the 33rd Mechanized Brigade’s aid point one recent night. He described a four-hour trench battle so fierce that he could not lift his head above the parapet to spot attacking Russian troops. But from the incoming fire, he said, he could tell they were advancing in small groups, methodically closing in.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Paramedics of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade stabilizing wounded soldiers who had just been evacuated from the front line of Kurakhove, as the line moved closer to the Dnipropetrovsk region.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A wounded Ukrainian soldier at a stabilization point manned by the 79th Air Assault Brigade.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“All the soldiers from my section of the trench were evacuated,” said Dmytro, who declined to give his last name per military rules.</p><p>One of the clearest indications of the approaching fighting is a blue and yellow roadside sign marking the entrance to Donetsk from Dnipropetrovsk. Over three years of war, the site has become a symbol of Ukraine’s resistance, with soldiers heading to battle signing and putting up Ukrainian flags around it. But now, with the front line just 12 miles away, the sign has been draped in a large net to protect it from drone strikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>In Mezhova, a small town in Dnipropetrovsk standing in the path of the Russian advance, the number of soldiers at times appears to outnumber civilians — they queue at the post office and crowd into cafes, and their olive-green pickups line the streets.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A soldier of the Shkval Special Forces Assault Battalion preparing to launch an assault on advancing Russian soldiers.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The new reality weighs heaviest on refugees who fled the Donetsk region earlier in the war and resettled in Mezhova and nearby settlements. Over the past three years, the population has surged from 14,000 to 21,000 with their arrival.</p><p>“For so long, we thought this place was safe,” said Nelia Seimova, who moved to Mezhova in August after escaping Novohrodivka, which is now under Russian occupation. “I had plans — buying a house, getting a job, sending my child to school. A normal life.”</p><p>Now, Ms. Seimova, 33, is planning to move again, farther west. She knows from experience not to wait for the town to be hit with regular bombardment. “We’ve been through this before,” she said, tears filling her eyes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Volodymyr Zrazhevsky, the mayor of Mezhova, is also worried about airstrikes, particularly glide bombs — powerful weapons carrying hundreds of pounds of explosives that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/europe/russia-glide-bombs-ukraine.html" title="">Russia often uses to level towns ahead of ground assaults</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The 148th Separate Artillery Zhytomyr Brigade of Air Assault forces on the Kurakhove front line.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers from the unit between missions.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Each day, Mr. Zrazhevsky studies a battlefield map marked with circles indicating which cities are within the range of the bombs as Russian forces advance. For now, Mezhova is safe. “But we understand that if it happens — and it will at some point — we’ll need to take drastic measures,” he said, possibly mandatory evacuations.</p><p>Lists from East SOS, the group assisting refugees, show that some Mezhova residents have already started evacuating. On a recent afternoon in Pavlohrad, a city in Dnipropetrovsk where the group has set up a transit center, refugees who had just been evacuated from towns and villages near the Dnipropetrovsk-Donetsk boundary streamed in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers of the Shkval Special Forces Assault Battalion gathering before an operation.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers from the unit gathering their weapons and ammunition before an operation.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>All were bleary-eyed and some had faces streaked with soot from weeks of burning firewood to keep warm after attacks knocked out the power grid. Among them were elderly women bundled in thick woolen scarves, children in puffer coats and their parents in tears, uncertain of what the future would hold.</p><p>Some in Ukraine believe the Trump administration’s push for peace talks might freeze the front line, stopping the Russian advance. Mr. Zrazhevsky, the mayor of Mezhova — which means “border line” in Ukrainian — clings to the hope that a cease-fire will spare his town from evacuation and turn it instead into the new “eastern capital of Ukraine.”</p><p>Mykhailo Afendikov, 52, who recently fled Komar, a village in Donetsk, after a glide bomb destroyed his home, struck a more somber tone. Even if the Russians do not capture Komar, he said, “Where can I go back to? There’s no house left.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A person walks past tank traps in Novopavlivka.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> </span></p></div><div><p>Tyler Hicks is a senior photographer for The Times.
