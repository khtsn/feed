		<p>The VCT EMEA Stage 1 groups have finally been <a href="https://x.com/valesports_emea/status/1892952431425933592" target="_blank">revealed</a> 12 days after the conclusion of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2276/champions-tour-2025-emea-kickoff" target="_blank">EMEA Kickoff</a>, dividing the 12 EMEA teams into two groups of six. A <a href="https://youtu.be/KeCyEmHj3js?si=rmakqIM4GoFBTCVO" target="_blank">video</a> of the draw show was posted to the league&#39;s YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Group Alpha:</p>



<p>Group Omega:</p>



<p>Vitality and Liquid were first assigned to separate groups as the region&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> representatives and top two performers at Kickoff. The rest of the teams were sorted into four pools based on Kickoff performances, with the bottom four teams being placed in Pool 1, the 7th-8th teams being placed in Pool 2, and so forth. All four Pool 1 teams were drawn before moving on to Pool 2, with drawn teams being sorted into groups in alternating fashion.</p>

<p>Stage 1 matches will be played within groups in a round-robin and the top four teams from each group will qualify to the stage playoffs. The top three finishers in playoffs will qualify to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/champions-tour-2025-masters-toronto" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>. Groups will be re-drawn ahead of Stage 2.</p>

		<p>have you guys just not watched emea since 2023 that group is so much weaker than omega lol</p>

	<div data-post-id="4590410">
		
		
		<div>
			
			<p>Exactly</p>
<p>Theyâ€™re kinda equal but a lot of the alpha teams are living off their names</p>		</div>

			<p>Vitality &gt; Liquid</p>
<p>BBL vs. Fnatic is tough to say, I think BBL looked better in kick off and have Chiwa coming in but Fnatic changed coaches so could be better as well. If Leo comes back at any point  (big if) it&#39;s an easy Fnatic diff though.</p>
<p>Overall I would say Alpha is the stronger group but not by miles.</p>		</div>

	<div data-post-id="4589583">
		
		
		<div>
			
			<p>These groups are pretty balanced </p>
<p>You guys just see big names like Navi and hereshits but in reality neither of those teams are as good as m8 or Karmine corp </p>		</div>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4589611">
		
		
		<p>mhh lets see kc got top 12 and m8 top 8 yeah TH still clears</p>

		

		
		
	</div>

	<div data-post-id="4589634">
		
		
		<p>So you think that Karmine corp is bottom 4 emea ?</p>

</div></div></div></div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4589591">
		
		
		<p>Group alpha more interesting to watch (im not saying they&#39;re stronger), it just that from my biased perspective and familiarity with some names on the team.</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div></div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4589721">
		
		
		<p>group Alpha is so stacked compared to Omega, omega is just a lot less competitive for who is going to be going to playoffs.</p>
