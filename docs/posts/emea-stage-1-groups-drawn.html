		<p>The VCT EMEA Stage 1 groups have finally been <a href="https://x.com/valesports_emea/status/1892952431425933592" target="_blank">revealed</a> 12 days after the conclusion of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2276/champions-tour-2025-emea-kickoff" target="_blank">EMEA Kickoff</a>, dividing the 12 EMEA teams into two groups of six. A <a href="https://youtu.be/KeCyEmHj3js?si=rmakqIM4GoFBTCVO" target="_blank">video</a> of the draw show was posted to the league&#39;s YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Group Alpha:</p>



<p>Group Omega:</p>



<p>Vitality and Liquid were first assigned to separate groups as the region&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> representatives and top two performers at Kickoff. The rest of the teams were sorted into four pools based on Kickoff performances, with the bottom four teams being placed in Pool 1, the 7th-8th teams being placed in Pool 2, and so forth. All four Pool 1 teams were drawn before moving on to Pool 2, with drawn teams being sorted into groups in alternating fashion.</p>

<p>Stage 1 matches will be played within groups in a round-robin and the top four teams from each group will qualify to the stage playoffs. The top three finishers in playoffs will qualify to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/champions-tour-2025-masters-toronto" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>. Groups will be re-drawn ahead of Stage 2.</p>
