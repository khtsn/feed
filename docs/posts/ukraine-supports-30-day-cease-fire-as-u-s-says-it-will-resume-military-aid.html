There was no immediate comment on the cease-fire discussion from Moscow, which had no officials at the talks.</p><p>“Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day cease-fire” if Russia did the same, the statement said. It added, “The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.”</p><p>At the conclusion of the meetings, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the agreement now puts the pressure on Russia to end the war.</p><p>“We’ll take this offer now to the Russians, and we hope that they’ll say yes, that they’ll say yes to peace,” Mr. Rubio said. “The ball is now in their court.”</p><p>The United States has been pursuing talks separately with Russia and Ukraine. There has been no public indication that Russia would accept an unconditional, monthlong cease-fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>And President Vladimir V.

That deal is intended to “expand Ukraine’s economy and guarantee Ukraine’s long-term prosperity and security,” the statement said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It added that the United States and Ukraine had also discussed humanitarian relief efforts that would take place during a cease-fire and the exchange of prisoners of war.</p><p>“Representatives of both nations praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people in defense of their nation and agreed that now is the time to begin a process toward lasting peace,” the statement said.</p><p>The U.S. delegation in Jeddah was led by Mr. Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser. They met with a delegation from Kyiv led by Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff; Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha; and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov.</p><p>Before the talks, Ukraine had insisted that any cease-fire include security guarantees, but there was no indication from the statement issued on Tuesday that any such guarantees would be provided before any interim cease-fire takes effect.</p><p>Mr. Waltz told reporters, however, that security guarantees had been part of the conversations in Jeddah.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“We also got into substantive details on how this war is going to permanently end, what type of guarantees they’re going to have for their long-term security and prosperity,” Mr. Waltz said.</p><p>The intelligence cutoff had already impaired Ukrainian soldiers in combat, particularly in the Kursk region of Russia, where Russian troops have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/europe/ukraine-russia-north-korea-kursk.html" title="">rapidly retaking territory seized by Ukraine last summer</a>, according to Ukrainian commanders in the field.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-11"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="ukraine-russia-kursk-map-wqm7-" data-id="100000010045603" data-source-id="100000010045603"><div slug="ukraine-russia-kursk-map-wqm7-" data-sourceid="100000010045603" id="embed-id-100000010045603">

On Tuesday, Mr. Rubio suggested that it was time to move on from the White House clash.</p><p>“What’s back on track here, hopefully, is peace,” ⁦Mr. Rubio said. “This is not ‘Mean Girls.’ This is not some episode of some television show.”</p><p>Mr. Yermak, the lead Ukrainian negotiator, thanked the United States for “constructive” talks. “A just peace is the most important for us,” he wrote on social media. “We want a lasting peace.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In his nightly video address to Ukrainians, Mr. Zelensky said the Ukrainian delegation had entered the talks on Tuesday with an offer for a partial truce, covering only aerial bombardments and combat on the Black Sea.</p><p>The American delegation, he said, had proposed the comprehensive cease-fire. Mr. Zelensky said an “important element” in the talks was the U.S. commitment to resume military and intelligence assistance, though he did not directly tie the issue to acceptance of a cease-fire.</p><p>Ukraine’s military adviser to the talks, Col. Pavlo Palisa, in a statement posted on Facebook, suggested that the offer to resume U.S. military and intelligence assistance had led to the acceptance of the cease-fire.</p><p>It was a suggestion, though not stated directly, that Mr. Trump’s strong-arm negotiating tactic of revoking aid had played a role in achieving the agreement. “We are ready for a full cease-fire,” Colonel Palisa wrote, “and in return the United States agrees to resume security assistance and intelligence sharing.”</p><p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain called the statement on Tuesday “an important moment for peace in Ukraine” and said he would convene leaders this weekend to discuss next steps.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>”I warmly welcome the agreement today in Jeddah and congratulate President Trump and President Zelensky for this remarkable breakthrough,” Mr. Starmer said, adding that “Russia must now agree to a cease-fire and an end to the fighting, too.”</p><p>The war in Ukraine has been raging along nearly 700 miles of trenches cut through fields, forests and towns in the country’s east. Longer-range weapons like howitzers and exploding drones have rendered all movement within 10 miles or so of the front lethally dangerous.</p><p>The communiqué offered no detail on how a cease-fire could be carried out; past agreements to halt fighting since Russia first intervened militarily in Ukraine in 2014 have proved devilishly complicated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ukrainian soldier on the front line in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Marc Santora<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nataliia Novosolova<!-- --> from Kyiv, Ukraine; <!-- -->Yurii Shyvala<!-- --> from Lviv, Ukraine; <!-- -->Anton Troianovski<!-- --> from Berlin; <!-- -->Ivan Nechepurenko<!-- --> from Tbilisi, Georgia; <!-- -->Maggie Haberman<!-- --> from Washington; <!-- -->Aurelien Breeden<!-- --> from Paris; <!-- -->Stephen Castle<!-- --> from London; and <!-- -->Adam Rasgon<!-- --> from Jerusalem.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew E.
