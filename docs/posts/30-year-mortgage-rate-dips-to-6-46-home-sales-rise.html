That was only a slight decline from the 6.49 percent average a week earlier, but was the lowest level since May 2023. </p><p>Mortgage rates, which stood at around 3 percent in late 2021, began climbing when the Federal Reserve started raising its benchmark rate to combat inflation, reaching levels not seen in two decades. The 30-year rate has been steadily easing since April, when it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/business/mortgage-rates.html" title="">rose above 7 percent</a>.</p><p>Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac, said mortgage rates hovering below 6.5 percent over the past two weeks had not been enough to prompt a significant uptick in home purchases.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“We expect rates likely will need to decline another percentage point to generate buyer demand,” Mr. Khater said in a statement.</p><p>More significant relief could be on the horizon. The Fed is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/business/economy/federal-interest-rates-inflation.html" title="">expected to start lowering interest rates</a> in September, after holding them at 5.3 percent for the past year. Although the Fed’s benchmark rate and mortgage rates aren’t directly connected, a Fed rate cut could indirectly put even more downward pressure on mortgages.</p><p>And while borrowing costs remain twice as high as three years ago, there is some evidence that home buyers are starting to respond to the small but steady decline. Existing-home sales rose above expectations in July after four consecutive monthly declines, according to <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-advanced-1-3-in-july-ending-four-month-skid" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data released on Thursday by the National Association of Realtors</a>. The 1.3 percent increase lifted sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.95 million units.</p><p>Consumers are “definitely seeing more choices” as affordability improves, Lawrence Yun, the association’s chief economist, said in a statement. But existing home sales are still down 2.5 percent from the prior year.</p><p>“Despite the modest gain, home sales are still sluggish,” Mr. Yun said.</p><p>Potential home sellers also continue to feel locked into lower rates on their existing loans, keeping their houses off the market. The median existing-home owner has a rate below 4 percent, said Chen Zhao, who leads the housing economics team at the real estate services company Redfin.</p></div></div><div><p>More homeowners are starting to list their properties for sale to keep up with demand, Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow, said in a statement. But the number of homes available at any given time is still lower than before the pandemic, she said.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
