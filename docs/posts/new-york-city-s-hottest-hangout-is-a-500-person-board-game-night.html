A martini can cost $25 in a bar that’s too noisy for conversation, and raucous nightclubs aren’t for everyone. So a free, monthly B.Y.O.B. (bring your own board game) night in an office building food court has become a big hit.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In addition to Werewolf, people were playing classics, like chess and mahjong, but also relatively newer games, including <a href="https://www.catan.com/explore-catan/catan-core-family-games" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Catan</a>, <a href="https://www.spacecowboys.fr/splendor-en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Splendor</a>, <a href="https://theop.games/products/hues-and-cues?srsltid=AfmBOorimGmfHf28h0f3EhjhLSFrrQkwAccHkUNlkg9ieFhicDTC2Cox" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hues and Clues</a>, <a href="https://www.amigo.games/product/saboteur/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Saboteur</a>, <a href="https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/nerts" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nertz</a>, <a href="https://www.cmyk.games/collections/games/products/wavelength" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wavelength</a>, <a href="https://shop.mattel.com/products/blokus-game-bjv44" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blokus</a> and <a href="https://www.lookout-spiele.de/en/games/camelup.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Camel Up</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/nyregion/ny-games.html" title="">Board game events</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/style/board-games-club.html" title="">clubs</a> have grown in popularity in recent years — in New York and across the country. This one is organized by Richard Ye, a 24-year-old who works in finance. He bills the event as New York City’s largest board game meet-up, and a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHZ21M9RYCq/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video of Mr. Ye celebrating his March</a> gathering — where 500 people were in attendance — was widely shared on social media.</p><p>Mr. Ye, who grew up in New Jersey and attended the University of Michigan, moved to New York City in 2022 and started hosting game nights for friends in his apartment.</p><p>“It just completely grew organically,” he said. “We went from 10 people to 25 people.

In 2023, Mr. Ye moved it to the Midtown site and slowly expanded the group. “I started inviting people that I thought were interesting or I wanted to get to know better,” he said.</p><p>Soon, through word of mouth, social media and friends of friends, attendance expanded into the hundreds. “The growth has been just so magical,” Mr. Ye said.</p><p>The food hall where Mr. Ye and his friends gather is open to anyone, but the after-work crowd filters out as the game players trickle in. By 8 p.m., the space is filled with board game fans.</p><p>The most recent evening included a mix of people, mostly between their 20s and 40s. Many, like Mr. Ye, were new to the city, but there were also born-and-bred New Yorkers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Attendees were drawn by the chance to make real connections, to have fun without alcohol, and to perhaps meet a romantic partner.

Mr. Kim, a 31-year-old software engineer, arrived by himself and didn’t know anyone. “Some people saw me kind of lost, and so they invited me to play Exploding Kittens with them,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>(<a href="https://www.explodingkittens.com/products/exploding-kittens-original-edition" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Exploding Kittens</a> is a card game similar to Russian roulette or Uno, in which players take turns drawing cards from the same deck. Drawing an “Exploding Kitten” card boots you out of the game.)</p><p>Mr. Kim, who coached some novice mahjong players on the basics, had jumped at the chance to venture out and mingle with strangers in a low-stakes setting. “Anything is better than just being at home stuck on my phone just rotting away.”</p><p>The event also drew some game designers.</p><p>Brittane Rowe, co-founder of the company Awkward Games, brought two card games she had created: <a href="https://www.awkwardgames.com/products/hella-awk-ward" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hella Awkward</a> (an icebreaker game that prompts players to answer awkward personal questions) and <a href="https://www.awkwardgames.com/products/build-a-bae" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Build-A-Bae</a> (a card game that involves mixing and matching traits to create the perfect partner). Ms. Rowe, 36, had seen Mr. Ye’s video on social media and reached out.</p><p>“Anyone that can build community like this, especially so quickly, it’s really kind of fascinating,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-14"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brittane Rowe, who co-founded a card game company, is fascinated by the huge community built through the monthly board game nights.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathan Bajar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syed Saud, one of the creators of The Lost Lands of Verne, a fantasy board game, showed attendees how to play.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathan Bajar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Syed Saud, who goes by the nickname Suede, was there too, teaching attendees how to play a game he had cocreated, <a href="https://lostlandsofverne.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Lost Lands of Verne</a>. He described it as a combination of Catan, Risk, Monopoly and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p>Mr. Saud, 28, said he saw a bright future for games that are played in person, pointing to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joustsociety/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joust Society</a>, an “upscale game night” in hotel lounges around the city. Plus, he said, he’s noticed that people are interested in gatherings that don’t center on alcohol. “We’ve had a really big spike in the sober movement,” he said.</p><p>Case in point: Yale Zhang, who doesn’t like to drink and is the founder of a company that makes animal health monitoring technology. He thinks of in-person games as a form of mindfulness: “You have to be present, because if you don’t pay attention, you’re not going to be able to win,” Mr. Zhang, 42, said. The other reason he attends Mr. Ye’s game nights? “It’s also a great networking opportunity, because you get to meet some of the smartest people in the city,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Richard Ye’s mother, father, grandparents and sister attended the most recent game night and played a few rounds of mahjong.

It was clear that he had tapped into something people are craving.</p><p>Ms. Yu, the Werewolf screamer, said she would come again, and bring friends. She explained that she considers herself an introvert, except when she’s playing games.</p><p>“Sometimes, if you go to other events, or like maybe a party, it’s hard to talk to people,” she said. “This is a great way to either meet up with friends or meet new ones.”</p><p>She added: “Everyone loves games, right?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Dodai Stewart is a Times reporter who writes about living in New York City, with a focus on how, and where, we gather.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
