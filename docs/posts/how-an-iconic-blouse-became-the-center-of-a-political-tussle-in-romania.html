Doina Isfanoni, an ethnologist at Romania’s village museum, has spent decades traveling the country to catalog what she said are uniquely Romanian blouses.</p><p>In 2022, UNESCO declared the blouse part of the “<a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/the-art-of-the-traditional-blouse-with-embroidery-on-the-shoulder-alti-an-element-of-cultural-identity-in-romania-and-the-republic-of-moldova-01861" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cultural identity</a>” of Romania and its neighbor Moldova, formerly part of Romania.</p><p>Dr. Isfanoni scoffed at what she saw as efforts by politicians to exploit the blouse for electoral purposes, noting that they often wore cheap, machine-made knockoffs rather than genuine articles embroidered by hand.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Nationalists like Mr. Simion and Ms. Sosoaca, she said, “want to show that they represent true Romania and its traditions” but “this is just a parody of tradition” aimed at “fooling people.”</p><p>In Romania, where a wealthy elite living in cities like Bucharest has long been disconnected from the majority of the population in the countryside, embracing the traditional blouse has provided an easy way to display a connection with the masses.</p><p>Dr. Isfanoni said that Romania’s last queen, Marie, who was born and raised mostly in Britain before being married off to the Romanian crown prince in 1892, and other foreign members of the royal family often wore traditional blouses “to show that they were real Romanians.”</p><p>One leader who shunned the embroidered blouse was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/27/world/upheaval-in-the-east-the-trial-for-an-unrepentant-ceausescu-summary-justice.html" title="">Nicolae Ceausescu</a>, Romania’s communist dictator from 1965 until 1989. Born into a poor village family, he had no need to establish his credentials as a son of the soil.</p><p>Though embraced by politicians as a marker of authenticity and of a connection to common folk, the blouse is in many ways highly elitist because of its price tag. A genuine, hand-embroidered example can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars, depending on the fabric and the intricacy of the embroidery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The high price of blouses embroidered by hand has opened the way for a flood of machine-made articles from China and elsewhere, making it difficult for traditional artisans to compete. Many of these are older women in the countryside who can spend months making a single top.</p><p>Nicoleta Uta, an ambulance nurse in Domnesti, a village northeast of Bucharest, is a devotee of the Romanian blouse. She said she realized that the craft risked dying out when the only person left in her village who knew how to make a blouse was an 87-year-old woman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Absorbing some embroidery tips in Domnesti.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A genuine, hand-embroidered blouse can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars, depending on the fabric and the intricacy of the embroidery.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>She asked the woman to help teach local youngsters embroidery and started a class at her home.
