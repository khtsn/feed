on Thursday, President Trump quickly offered the first U.S.-born pontiff a hearty congratulations.</p><p>“It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope,” Mr. Trump said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WhiteHouse/posts/congratulations-to-cardinal-robert-francis-prevost-who-was-just-named-pope-it-is/122132251598723345/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>. “What excitement.”</p><p>But some of Mr. Trump’s most fervent followers do not appear to be feeling the excitement.</p><p>Almost immediately after Cardinal Prevost, a native of the Chicago area who spent decades ministering in Peru, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/08/world/pope-conclave-news" title="">emerged from the conclave</a> as the new pope and took the name Leo XIV, leaders of the MAGA movement began to cast him as an enemy.</p><p>Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who holds significant sway with Mr. Trump, <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1920537118041854297" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Thursday on social media</a> that Leo’s style would be similar to that of his predecessor, Pope Francis, whom she described as “anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Catholics don’t have anything good to look forward to,” she wrote. “Just another Marxist puppet in the Vatican.”</p><p>And on Friday, guests on Steve Bannon’s popular right-wing <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-4473-what-the-new-pope-means-for-the-next-decade/id1485351658?i=1000706988122" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“War Room” podcast</a> piled on, casting Leo as a progressive figure and a continuation of Francis, an outspoken voice for migrants who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/trump-pope-francis.html" title="">often at odds with Mr. Trump</a>.</p><p>Mr. Bannon, one of the president’s top allies, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyglw20lg2o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the BBC</a> that the selection was “kind of jaw-dropping,” adding that there was “definitely going to be friction” between the new pope and Mr. Trump.</p><p>Few predicted that Cardinal Prevost would be chosen, but Mr. Bannon was perhaps less stunned than he let on. In April, he said on <a href="https://youtu.be/H49ro_IgBmU?si=I5f9V7veJCIYvKNN" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Piers Morgan Uncensored”</a> that he believed the cardinal “unfortunately” was more likely to become pope than observers realized. He cited Leo’s ideological proximity to Francis and his connections to Latin America.</p><p>Much of Leo’s personal politics are unclear. Over the years, he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/pope-leo-voting-record-illinois.html" title="">voted in Illinois</a> several times, casting an absentee ballot in last year’s presidential election and voting in three Republican primaries since 2012, according to records from Will County, which is outside Chicago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Records do not show him voting in Democratic primaries in that time frame. Illinois has open primaries, and voters there do not declare a party when they register to vote.</p><p>But the new pope had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/politics/jd-vance-pope-leo-xiv.html" title="">apparently expressed unease</a> with Mr. Trump’s immigration platform. A social media account under his name posted an article in February that said Vice President JD Vance had misinterpreted Christian doctrine to support Mr. Trump’s mass deportation effort. (The New York Times did not independently verify whether he ran the account.)</p><p>Leo’s brother John Prevost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/pope-leo-xiv-brother-john-prevost.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> on Thursday that he knew “for a fact” that the new pope was “not happy with what’s going on with immigration.”</p><p>On other issues, Leo has expressed positions that more neatly conform with those of many American social conservatives. In a 2012 address to bishops, he expressed concern about what he called the “homosexual lifestyle” and decried aspects of modern culture that stir “sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the Gospel.”</p><p>Francis, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-francis-dead.html" title="">died two weeks ago</a>, had a tense relationship with conservative American Catholics, who felt marginalized during his 12-year pontificate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Francis spoke out strongly against Mr. Trump at times. During Mr. Trump’s first term, Francis said a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/world/europe/pope-francis-trump-child-separation.html" title="">policy of separating migrant children</a> from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border was “immoral.” And he warned that those who shut borders “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/world/europe/pope-francis-trump-morocco.html" title="">become prisoners of the walls that they build</a>.”</p><p>Joan Francis Plum, a cousin of Leo’s, said in an interview Thursday that the new pope would “be like Francis.”</p><p>“I think that’s why Francis called him to the Vatican — because they were similar,” she said of her cousin, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/pope-leo-xiv-timeline.html" title="">elevated to an influential Vatican office</a> in 2023. “He was handpicked by him. He’s very open-minded, and just loving.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
