    <h1>Helicopters Pack N.Y. Skies, Despite Years of Noise and Air Pollution Complaints</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every year, tens of thousands of tourist helicopter flights depart from heliports in and around New York City. These tours, which generally cost several hundred dollars, advertise seeing many of the city’s iconic sights from above — Central Park, One World Trade Center, the Statue of Liberty — in as little as 15 minutes.</p><p>The helicopter crash on Thursday was the tourism sector’s third fatal one in the past two decades. In 2009, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/10/nyregion/10victims.html" title="">a sightseeing helicopter carrying Italian tourists</a> collided with a private plane over the Hudson River, killing nine people. In 2018, a helicopter flying with its doors off fell into the East River and flipped over. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/11/nyregion/new-york-city-helicopter-crash.html" title="">Five sightseers drowned</a>, and only the pilot survived.</p><p>Most of the helicopter activity in the New York City region is made up of tourist, charter and commuter flights, according to <a href="https://stopthechopnynj.org/frequently-asked-questions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stop the Chop</a>, an organization seeking to limit the flights around the city, citing noise complaints and climate concerns.</p><p>Tours often advertise a path flying up the Hudson River and back to the tip of Lower Manhattan, with views spanning many landmarks and the Manhattan skyline.</p></div></div>
