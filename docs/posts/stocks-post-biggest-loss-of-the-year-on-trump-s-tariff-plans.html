The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 2.6 percent, nearly crossing the threshold for the index to be in a “correction,” defined as a sell-off of more than 10 percent from a recent peak. The Nasdaq is now just over 9 percent below its high in mid-December.</p><p>The afternoon slump in the markets followed Mr. Trump’s statement at the White House on Monday that he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/economy/trump-tariffs-china-mexico-canada.html" title="">move forward</a> on Tuesday with broad 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the United States’ two biggest trading partners. Mr. Trump has also said he would impose an additional 10 percent tariff on goods from China, on top of the 10 percent that took effect last month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Investors fear that the tariffs will raise prices in the United States, pushing the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates elevated for longer and risking tipping the economy into a downturn.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Monday’s sell-off came after the stock market had already lost some of its shine in February. The S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/stock-market-trump-bump.html" title="">ended about 1.4 percent lower for the month</a>, as the Trump administration’s policy priorities and weak consumer sentiment made investors uneasy.</p><p>On Monday, the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are typically more exposed to the ebb and flow of the economy, fell 3.1 percent, pushing further into its own correction; the index is down more than 14 percent since it peaked in late November. The Vix volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” rose sharply to 24 points, before easing to around 22, still above its long-term average.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s comments on tariffs extended the stock market’s declines from earlier in the day, when a February reading for a key manufacturing index came in weaker than investors had expected, a sign of slower growth in the sector.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Trump and Zelensky: </strong>A meeting between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine turned into an angry shouting match at the Oval Office. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-transcript.html">Here are the key excerpts</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Student Loan Affordable Repayment Plans:</strong> The Education Department has pulled down all applications for borrowers seeking to enroll in income-driven repayment programs. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/student-loan-repayment-plans.html">Here’s what to know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>National Weather Service: </strong>Cuts at the government agency responsible for issuing warnings, generating daily forecasts, advising local authorities and collecting the weather data that make these functions possible provoked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/weather/national-weather-serivce-cuts-trump-impact.html">swift condemnation from people in the field, some lawmakers and the public</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Security Administration</strong><strong>: </strong>The Social Security Administration, a crucial program that keeps millions of older Americans out of poverty, said that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/social-security-administration-job-cuts.html">reduce its head count by more than 12 percent</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Homeland Security and I.R.S.: </strong>The Department of Homeland Security has pushed the Internal Revenue Service to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/irs-immigrants-addresses.html">turn over the addresses of roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants</a> it is seeking to deport, according to three people familiar with the matter.
