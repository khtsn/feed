This one was too dark; that one didn’t create a big enough silhouette.<strong> </strong>So they eventually decided to make one with enormous lapels, voluminous sleeves and an oversized fit.</p><p>And, most crucially, in a shade that would stop traffic a long way off.</p><p>“You see the sun everywhere, so the yellow coat you can see far away, also,” she said.</p><p>Her vision, Youchnovski said, was always for a decidedly masculine garment.</p><p>“When she’s distracted by age, she wraps herself in the coat,” said Youchnovski, who opted for virgin wool sourced from Italy. “She’s a woman in a masculine world, and this is a masculine coat with a big collar and cuffed sleeves.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><h2 id="link-3080b60b">Green: ‘Wicked’</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>More than a dozen shades of green went into the “Wicked” set.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The task of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/movies/wicked-review.html" title="">“Wicked”</a> production designer might at first appear simple: Make it green.</p><p>Well, it’s a little more complicated than that, said Nathan Crowley, who worked on Jon M. Chu’s “Wizard of Oz”-adjacent musical fantasy extravaganza. He built an Emerald City using more than a dozen shades of green, yes, but also rust reds, navy blues, bronzes and gun metals.</p><p>“We have to find the room — define it — without stepping on Elphaba’s green,” he said. “ We have to be in the background; she has to be in the foreground. So if you look at that set, it feels green, but it’s not if you actually look at it.”</p><p>Paul Tazewell, who designed more than 1,000 costumes for the “Wicked” films (Part Two arrives next November), including more than 500 for the Emerald City scenes alone, was up for the challenge.</p><p>“We’ve got emeralds and greens that are bluer, greens that are chartreuse. And then contrasting that with pops of fuchsia and magenta, and different kinds of blues, and some turquoise as well. So that creates a little bit of sparkle,” said Tazewell, who won a Tony Award in 2016 for his work on the Broadway musical “Hamilton.”</p><p>But perhaps most important: Finding the right green makeup for Elphaba (played by Cynthia Erivo).</p><p>“It had to look beautiful on Cynthia in every light, not look like face paint, not rub off on the costumes or Ari and last 12 hours,” the makeup designer, Frances Hannon, said, referring to Erivo’s co-star Ariana Grande.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The secret ingredient, she said, was a couple of drops of neon yellow fluorescent base in a small bottle of the green shade. The tactic — a formula she borrowed from a vivid eye shadow — gave the makeup a reflective quality and made it look like skin, not face paint.</p><p>“In some of the light, as she turns, the highlight on her cheekbones, the base of the green, catches the light differently, and that is why her skin looks so real,” she said. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Sarah Bahr writes about culture and style for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sarah-bahr">More about Sarah Bahr</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/pedro-almodovar">Pedro Almodovar</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/demi-moore">Demi Moore</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/30/arts/design/wicked-the-substance-the-room-next-door.html">8</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Vast World of Art and Design</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Buy, Donate, Repeat</strong><strong>: </strong>The cosmetics heir Leonard Lauder created the model for the headline-grabbing donation that museums dream of today. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/arts/design/leonard-lauder-philanthropy-metropolitan-museum-whitney.html">At 91, he has more to give</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Search for a Lost van Gogh</strong><strong>: </strong>Cast off by the Nazis, but heralded by curators, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/arts/design/van-gogh-lost-masterpiece.html">the artist’s painting of his doctor</a>, made just before van Gogh’s suicide, has not been seen in 34 years.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resurrecting a Radical Artist</strong><strong>: </strong>Forty years after his death, the Californian activist Peter Carr gets a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/design/peter-carr-unknown-artist.html">revival of his acerbic paintings and drawings</a>.
