<p>&#34;Team RA&#39;AD was unable to comply with team ownership policies and will not be participating in this year&#39;s VCT Ascension EMEA Tournament,&#34; Riot&#39;s statement read. &#34;Based on Ascension Points, the next eligible team, Joblife, will compete in their place.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;This outcome is the direct result of Riot Games&#39; policy framework, which restricts our participation despite our full operational readiness and ability to compete,&#34; RA&#39;AD said in a <a href="https://x.com/TEAMRAAD/status/1974210134508191883/photo/1" target="_blank">statement</a>. &#34;We firmly believe that these policies, while respected, would have required us to compromise the legal and professional rights of our players — something we don&#39;t accept under any circumstances. Protecting players remains our highest priority.&#34;</p>

<p>RA&#39;AD&#39;s road to qualifying for Ascension was a long one. In 2025, they captured wins at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2386/challengers-2025-mena-resilience-north-africa-and-levant-split-1/playoffs" target="_blank">MENA Resilience North Africa and Levant Split 1</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2468/challengers-2025-mena-resilience-north-africa-and-levant-split-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Split 2</a>, earning them enough points to qualify for Ascension despite missing out on qualification for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2521/challengers-2025-emea-stage-3/playoffs" target="_blank">EMEA Stage 3</a>. This year&#39;s tournament would have been the second time the Egyptian organization participated in an Ascension tournament, with their last coming in 2023.</p>

<p>Joblife&#39;s season was thought to have ended with its 5th-8th finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2521/challengers-2025-emea-stage-3/group-stage" target="_blank">EMEA Stage 3</a>. The French organization is made up five players with experience at the VCT level, with two players being on loan from VCT teams.</p>

<p>This year&#39;s EMEA Ascension tournament consists of eight teams split into two Champions-style groups consisting of four teams. Joblife will open play at EMEA Ascension in the group stage against Turkey&#39;s <span data-ref-id="2">

			<p>They are Czech, HQ in Prague and everything. But VLR considers them Polish for some reason, the closest thing to an explanation I have heard is that 3 of the 5 players are Polish, and it automatically classifies the org as Polish too because of that.
