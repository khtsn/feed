Trump’s golf course in Florida on Sunday never got off a shot, but appears to have remained undetected for nearly 12 hours before being spotted by a Secret Service agent who drove him off with a volley of gunfire, officials said on Monday.</p><p>The man, Ryan W. Routh, 58, a building contractor with an extensive criminal history, never had the former president in his line of sight but was able to hide in the bushes just outside the fence on the edge of the course until Mr. Trump was only hundreds of yards away.</p><p>Mr. Routh did not fire at “our agents” before they fired at him, Ronald Rowe Jr., the acting Secret Service director, said at a news conference in West Palm Beach, Fla.</p><p>Mr. Routh wore a blue inmate jumpsuit at his initial appearance in a federal courtroom in Florida on Monday. He faces two felony gun charges that allow the authorities to keep him in custody while they continue their investigation into what the F.B.I. has called an assassination attempt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The F.B.I.’s top agent in Miami, Jeffrey B. Veltri, speaking to reporters, said the bureau had no information that the suspect was working with anybody else. Agents in Hawaii and North Carolina — two states where the suspect lived — had fanned out to conduct interviews as part of a broad investigation into his travels, how he had acquired the rifle and what his motivations had been.</p><p>Among the unanswered questions is how Mr. Routh knew Mr. Trump would be on the course. While Mr. Trump frequently plays golf at his properties, his Sunday outing was not a publicly announced appearance, unlike the rally in July in Butler, Pa., where a gunman got off multiple shots, leaving Mr. Trump slightly wounded, one rally attendee dead and two others wounded.</p><p>“It was an off-the-record movement, meaning it was not on the former president’s official schedule,” Mr. Rowe said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ronald Rowe Jr., the acting director of the Secret Service, said at a news conference on Monday that the suspect had not fired before an agent shot at him.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saul Martinez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Cellphone data retrieved by the F.B.I. indicated that Mr. Routh’s phone was “in the vicinity of the area along the tree line” of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach beginning at 1:59 a.m. on Sunday, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/16/us/ryan-routh-gun-charges-trump-shooting.html" title="">a federal criminal complaint</a> unsealed on Monday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It remained there until 1:31 p.m., when a keen-eyed Secret Service agent walking one hole ahead of Mr. Trump spotted the barrel of a rifle and opened fire, the complaint said.</p><p>Mr. Routh, wearing a faded T-shirt, fled the scene, leaving behind a loaded SKS-style rifle — a semiautomatic developed by the Soviets in the 1940s — along with a scope, a GoPro digital camera, two bags and a black plastic bag containing food, prosecutors said.</p><p>The SKS rifle has appeared around the world in various conflicts and is popular in the United States, given its relatively low cost of around several hundred dollars.</p><p>Mr. Routh was identified by a witness near the golf club who saw him jump into a black Nissan SUV and speed away. He was arrested by local sheriff’s deputies after heading northbound on Interstate 95.</p><p>A brief segment of body camera video released by local officials shows his roadside arrest at 2:14 p.m. on Sunday. The video, less than a minute long, shows several law enforcement officers from the back, with their weapons drawn, shouting instructions for the driver to take two steps to his right and then to walk backward toward them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Routh, wearing sunglasses, dark pants and boots, is briefly seen in the video walking backward with his arms in the air, holding the hem of his shirt over his head, before officers handcuff him and take him into custody.</p><p>Mr. Routh has a significant criminal record, including a 2002 conviction in North Carolina for possessing a weapon of mass destruction after he barricaded himself at his place of business with a gun, according to the court filing. The F.B.I. said he had numerous felony convictions for stolen goods.</p><p>His criminal record bars him from legally possessing a firearm under federal law.</p><p>The F.B.I. disclosed at the news conference that someone had passed a tip to the F.B.I. in 2019 that he was in possession of a firearm despite being a felon. The F.B.I. interviewed the person who made the claim, but did not receive any more information and the case was closed.</p><p>The serial number on the semiautomatic rifle recovered by investigators, including a contingent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was scratched off, making it more difficult to trace its origins, according to officials familiar with the investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of Palm Beach County with an image showing items left where the suspect was hiding, including a rifle.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saul Martinez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The weapon has been sent to the F.B.I.’s laboratory in Quantico, Va., where experts will try to determine the serial number. If that does not work, it could be sent to the A.T.F.’s lab, the officials said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Routh was charged with possession of a weapon as a convicted felon and for obliterating the serial number of a firearm. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison or a $500,000 fine.</p><p>He could be charged with additional crimes as the investigation continues.</p><p>The Secret Service plans to conduct an internal review of the security episode at the Florida golf course similar to the review being conducted for the Butler shooting, said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the service.</p><p>At the news conference in Florida, Ric L. Bradshaw, the Palm Beach County sheriff, said that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and that the former president told him he felt “safe.”</p><p>Mr. Trump on Monday morning claimed that “inflammatory language” from Democrats had provoked what the authorities are investigating as an assassination attempt against him, urging his rivals to tone down their speech even as he called them the “enemy from within” and “the real threat.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>President Biden spoke with Mr. Trump on Monday, a White House official said, and conveyed relief that he was safe. The two shared a cordial conversation and Mr. Trump expressed his thanks for the call, the official said.</p><p>Mr. Biden told reporters on Monday that the Secret Service “needs more help.”</p><p>Mr. Routh was interviewed by The New York Times in 2023 for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/25/world/europe/volunteers-us-ukraine-lies.html" title="">an article about Americans volunteering to aid the war effort in Ukraine</a>. Mr. Routh, who had no military experience, said he had traveled there after Russia’s invasion in 2022 to recruit Afghan soldiers for the fight.</p><p>He told The Times he once visited Washington to meet with politicians to strengthen support for Ukraine, though the organization he claimed to be speaking with, known as the Helsinki Group, said it had no record of contact with him.</p><p>“I’m just a U.S. citizen that’s helping out,” he said at the time.</p><p>Patricia Mazzei<!-- -->, <!-- -->Zach Montague<!-- -->, <!-- -->Audra D.
