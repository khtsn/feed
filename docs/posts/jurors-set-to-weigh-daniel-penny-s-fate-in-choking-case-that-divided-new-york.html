A day earlier, the defense lawyers made their final appeal, trying to persuade the jury that their client should not be punished for the death of the man, Jordan Neely.</p><p>After the judge overseeing the case, Maxwell T. Wiley, gave the jurors instructions on Tuesday afternoon, they retreated behind closed doors to deliberate.</p><p>One of Mr. Penny’s lawyers tried to leave the jury with the image of his client as a protector. “The government is scapegoating the one man who was willing to stand up at the moment he was needed,” said the lawyer, Steven Raiser.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But Dafna Yoran, an assistant district attorney, said that Mr. Penny had killed Mr. Neely “recklessly and unjustifiably,” and asked the jury in the final minutes of her summation on Tuesday to “hold the defendant accountable.”</p><p>Mr. Penny “was given all of the signs he needed to stop,” Ms. Yoran said, referencing her step-by-step review of the medical examiner’s testimony about what happened to Mr. Neely’s body in his final moments.</p><p>“He ignored them,” she said of Mr. Penny. “He kept going until a man died. He must be held accountable for that.”</p><p>The case has engrossed New Yorkers since video of Mr. Penny with his arms wrapped around the neck of Mr. Neely, a 30-year-old man <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/nyregion/subway-choking-jordan-neely-relatives.html" title="">with a history of mental health struggles</a>, spread widely. The video lasted for several minutes as Mr. Neely tried desperately to stay alive: He clawed at Mr. Penny’s arm, tapped on the knee of a bystander, and, when that didn’t work, stretched his arms out to an empty subway bench.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Thomas Kenniff and his fellow defense lawyers argued that Mr. Penny had been protecting his fellow passengers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>To others, the killing showed the city’s inability or unwillingness to help its most vulnerable and marginalized residents. And Mr. Penny, they said, should be prosecuted.</p><p>The case garnered national attention, becoming a rallying cry for politicians on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/14/nyregion/daniel-penny-jordan-neely-conservative.html" title="">right who oppose progressive prosecutors</a>, particularly Alvin L. Bragg, Manhattan’s district attorney, who is a Democrat.</p><p>Mr. Bragg’s office also prosecuted President-elect Donald J. Trump, securing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/30/nyregion/trump-hush-money-verdict.html" title="">conviction against him on 34 felony counts</a> of falsifying business records. After his inauguration, Mr. Trump could grant pardons for federal convictions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/nyregion/donald-trump-pardon-himself.html" title="">but those powers do not extend to state cases</a>, like his own and Mr. Penny’s.</p><p>On Saturday, Mayor Eric Adams was asked about the case on a radio show. Rob Astorino, the host and a former <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/nyregion/for-astorino-a-conservative-career-since-day-1.html" title="">Republican candidate for New York governor</a>, said that some people could not understand why Mr. Penny, “who came to the rescue of others,” was on trial.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mayor Adams replied that the city’s mental health system was “a complete failure.”</p><p>“You have someone on that subway who was responding, doing what we should have done,” Mr. Adams said. “Those passengers were afraid.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/nyregion/daniel-penny-jury-subway-choking.html" title="">12 Manhattanites</a> in the jury box who will decide whether Mr. Penny, 26, is guilty of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide — and who are not allowed to listen to news about the trial — will not have heard Mr. Adams’s response.</p><p>Instead, they heard testimony from passengers, police officers, medical experts and relatives and friends of Mr. Penny. They watched hours of video and listened to recordings of 911 calls. If they find Mr. Penny guilty, he could face up to 15 years in prison. There is no minimum sentence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dafna Yoran, a prosecutor, said that Mr. Penny’s initial efforts to restrain Mr. Neely may have been “laudable,” but turned criminal.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>On that May afternoon, Mr. Penny, an architecture student, had left class and was on his way to the gym when he boarded an uptown F train in Manhattan. There, he encountered Mr. Neely.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Neely had boarded the train and begun yelling, throwing his jacket on the floor and striding through the car, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/nyregion/daniel-penny-trial-subway-chokehold-case.html" title="">according to witnesses</a>. As he approached other riders, he screamed that he was hungry, that he wanted to return to jail and that he did not care if he lived or died, they said.</p><p>Mr. Penny stepped in, according to witnesses and Mr. Penny himself. He approached Mr. Neely from behind and put him in a chokehold, taking the other man to the floor.</p><p>As they struggled, the train stopped at the Broadway-Lafayette Street station and passengers were able to leave the car. But, according to video taken by bystanders, Mr. Penny did not let go.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Raiser tried to impress on the jury, for a last time, that his client could not have released Mr. Neely without putting others in danger. And he argued that Mr. Penny did not use enough pressure to kill, asking the jurors to pay attention to how Mr. Neely had managed to move and struggle.</p><p>Mr. Penny had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/nyregion/daniel-penny-trial-jordan-neely.html" title="">trained in military chokeholds</a> that can render someone unconscious swiftly, but his lawyer said he had instead used a “civilian restraint.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Penny’s lawyers argued during the trial that it was impossible to know how much pressure Mr. Penny had exerted, and that it was in fact Mr. Neely’s schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana use and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/nyregion/daniel-penny-defense-jordan-neely.html" title="">sickle cell trait</a> that had led to his death. A person with the trait has one of the two genes required to cause sickle cell disease, a painful and sometimes life-threatening illness.</p><p>“He was not dying due to Danny squeezing him to death,” Mr. Raiser told jurors Monday. “He was dying because he was being deprived of oxygen internally due to his medical condition.”</p><p>But the medical examiner, Dr. Cynthia Harris, determined that Mr. Neely had died from compression of the neck. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/nyregion/daniel-penny-trial-jordan-neely.html" title="">She testified</a> that the defense’s hypothesis was “so improbable that it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with impossibility.”</p><p>Prosecutors did not contest the motivation behind Mr. Penny’s actions. Ms. Yoran even allowed earlier in the trial that his initial efforts to restrain Mr. Neely may have been “laudable.” She argued, however, that Mr. Penny had committed a crime when he continued choking Mr. Neely after he no longer presented an imminent threat.</p><p>In an interview with detectives on the night of May 1, Mr. Penny sat “relaxed and comfortable,” Ms. Yoran said.</p><p>“There’s something else that is glaringly missing from this statement: any regret, any remorse, any self-reflection,” she said, adding: “He never expresses any sorrow about the man’s death. He doesn’t care.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko">More about Hurubie Meko</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
