Under their bill, a wider range of aid recipients would be required to obtain work to qualify for federal help.</p><p>Republicans say the change aims to reduce waste and ensure that the federal government provides food stamps only to the truly needy. They have similarly looked to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/upshot/medicaid-republicans-work-requirement.html" title="">expand work requirements</a> to Medicaid, which provides health insurance to low-income Americans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Still, the work mandate could reduce participation in SNAP by more than three million people in an average month over the next decade, according to the budget office, which studied a version of the party’s recently approved legislative package.</p><p>Republicans also proposed to have states assume some of the costs for the federal food stamp program, an idea that has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/trump-republicans-tax-cuts-spending-states.html" title="">troubled some governors</a>, who say their budgets cannot afford to shoulder the responsibility.</p><p>As a result, congressional budget scorekeepers estimated the shift could result in an average of 1.3 million people losing access to SNAP. They attributed the reduction to the fact that some states may opt to “modify benefits or eligibility or possibly leave the program altogether because of the increased costs.”</p><p>Issuing its analysis, the budget office cautioned it could not produce one total, concise estimate of the number of people who could lose anti-hunger aid, given the possibility of overlap and the potential interactions with changes to other federal programs.</p><p>Still, the budget office estimated that many of Republicans’ proposed changes would reduce eligibility while cutting benefit amounts for those who do remain on the program. A small percentage of households could even see a roughly $100 reduction in their monthly allowance because of a provision that would change how some benefits are computed, according to the analysis.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tony Romm is a reporter covering economic policy and the Trump administration for The Times, based in Washington.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
