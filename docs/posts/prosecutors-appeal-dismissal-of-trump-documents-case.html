Trump on Monday, telling an appeals court in Atlanta that the trial judge had improperly thrown out the charges.</p><p>In a filing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, the prosecutors argued that the judge, Aileen M. Cannon, erred last month when she handed down <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/15/us/trump-documents-case-dismissed" title="">a bombshell ruling</a> that dismissed the case on the grounds that Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought it, had been appointed to his job illegally.</p><p>The ruling by Judge Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Mr. Trump, stunned many legal experts for the way that it upended 25 years of Justice Department practice and flew in the face of previous court decisions about the appointments of special prosecutors reaching back to the Watergate era.</p><p>Issued on the first day of the Republican National Convention, where Mr. Trump formally accepted his party’s presidential nomination, Judge Cannon’s ruling also gave him a major legal victory at an auspicious political moment.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Smith’s appellate brief was merely the start of a legal battle that may end up at the Supreme Court and is likely to drag on until well after the election in November.</p><p>Should Mr. Trump win the election, he would have the power to fire Mr. Smith and could order the Justice Department to drop the appeal. Should he lose, the appeals process will determine whether he could still go to trial on the charges.</p><p>In their filing, Mr. Smith’s deputies told a three-judge panel of the appeals court that Judge Cannon had committed an error when she ruled that no specific federal statute authorized the appointment of special counsels like Mr. Smith or gave them the “prosecutorial power” that they have wielded for 25 years. The prosecutors pointed to four current statutes that they believe give the attorney general the authority to name special counsels.</p><p>“The district court’s contrary view conflicts with an otherwise unbroken course of decisions, including by the Supreme Court, that the attorney general has such authority,” the prosecutors wrote, “and it is at odds with widespread and longstanding appointment practices in the Department of Justice and across the government.”</p><p>The classified documents case, which was being heard in Federal District Court in Fort Pierce, Fla., before Judge Cannon threw it out, had once seemed to be the most straightforward of the four criminal prosecutions Mr. Trump has faced in the past two years.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/08/us/trump-indictment-documents" title="">charged in June of last year</a> with illegally holding on to a trove of classified national security materials after leaving office and then obstructing government efforts to retrieve them along with two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, who worked for him at Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence in Florida.</p><p>Since 1999, the appointment of special counsels has been governed by internal Justice Department regulations traditionally believed to have been based on at least four federal laws laying out the structure of the department and the powers of the attorney general.</p><p>That practice was adopted after Congress permitted the Independent Counsel Act, a law that specifically authorized and governed a different type of independent prosecutor, to lapse after the Whitewater investigation into President Bill Clinton.</p><p>But Judge Cannon rejected that tradition, ruling that none of the statutes governing the conduct of attorneys general actually gave them the authority to appoint special prosecutors like Mr. Smith. She also found that Mr. Smith’s appointment was illegal because he had not been named by the president and confirmed by the Senate.</p><p>Prosecutors with some measure of independence from the federal officials who appoint them have been used to conduct sensitive political investigations reaching back to the days that the Confederate leader, Jefferson Davis, was charged with sedition after the Civil War.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr.<span>  </span></p><p>district court erroneously disregarded this history as “spotty” or “ad hoc,” giving undue emphasis to superficial differences in the appointment and roles of certain special and independent counsels.</p><p>*****The district court’s rationale could jeopardize the longstanding operation of the Justice Department and call into question hundreds of appointments throughout the Executive Branch.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
