It also captures a conundrum of the vice presidency, a prestigious if mostly ceremonial posting. So far, Ms. Harris has been able to take advantage of the trappings of the position — Air Force Two was parked behind her for one rally in Michigan — without being trapped by it.</p><p>Ms. Harris, long a risk-averse politician, has tried to both claim Mr. Biden’s accomplishments as her own while defining herself as the future and the 81-year-old president as the past. She barely mentions the president’s name in her campaign speeches and makes a middle-class pitch that aims to correct for the inflation and high prices voters blame on Mr. Biden’s economic stewardship. This week’s events thrust Ms. Harris’s balancing act — of being both the No. 2 to Mr. Biden and atop the ticket in her own right — back into the spotlight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The scenes of striking workers, hurricane devastation in the Southeast and missiles over Israel are unwelcome complications to her case to keep Democrats in power. And they were the backdrop of the vice-presidential debate between Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate, and Senator JD Vance, former President Donald J. Trump’s No. 2, on Tuesday night, when the senator argued that Republicans would usher in an era of stability.</p><p>The overlapping developments just as the calendar turned to October were a reminder that while Ms. Harris has framed her candidacy as a fresh start for the nation, she very much is part of the administration still in charge.</p><p>“The world right now is spiraling out of control,” Mr. Trump warned in Wisconsin on Tuesday.</p><p>On Wednesday, Ms. Harris skipped plans to join Mr. Walz for a bus tour in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, two days after canceling other planned appearances in Nevada. Instead, she rerouted to Augusta, Ga., to see the damage from Hurricane Helene, which swept across the Southeast last week, killing at least 175 people in six states. Thousands of troops and emergency workers have been deployed to clean up the damage.</p><p>In the Middle East, explosions were lighting the night skies as the nearly yearlong war in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel threatened to expand into a far wider conflict not only with Hezbollah in Lebanon but also with its chief sponsor, Iran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>And for the first time since 1977, a union representing 45,000 dockworkers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/business/economy/port-strike.html" title="">went on strike</a> at some of America’s busiest ports on the Gulf and East Coasts, freezing the flow of consumer and manufacturing goods and raising fears of a disruption in critical supply chains.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hurricane Helene left vast swaths of destruction in Asheville, N.C., and across the Southeast, killing at least 175 people in six states.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Loren Elliott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and close ally of Mr. Trump who helped prepare him for his debate last month, said that while voters typically didn’t cast ballots based on international affairs, the Trump team was weaving a broader narrative of Democratic failure.</p><p>“They break things,” he said. “And we fix things.”</p><p>For months, Mr. Trump and his allies have been making the case that first Mr. Biden and now Ms. Harris are weak leaders. They have been fanning fears about a mass wave of migrants across the southern border, the fallout from Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine and the rising death toll of Israel’s war in Gaza.</p><p>“If you were buying the vibes Harris was putting out in her debate, everything is awesome, and that doesn’t jibe with the lived experience of most Americans,” Mr. Gaetz said. “Biden and Harris aren’t showcasing the ability to use the levers of power to make things better. People feel like things are getting worse.”</p><p>Ian Sams, a spokesman for Ms. Harris, said now was a moment for “serious leadership” that Ms. Harris offers “in stark contrast to Trump’s lies, confusion, and self-obsession.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“When challenges arise, Americans want a leader who isn’t fanning the flames of division and chaos but is focused on solutions and delivering real results for people,” he said.</p><p>Jim Messina, who was the manager for Barack Obama’s re-election campaign in 2012, said that for the small universe of voters still undecided — about 4 percent of the electorate in the battleground states, he estimated — Ms. Harris’s performance of her official duties helped demonstrate her capacity to be the president. </p><p>“It goes right into what they want to know,” Mr. Messina said. “It allows her to audition for the job in real time.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Ms. Harris spent part of her day in the Situation Room at the White House with Mr. Biden monitoring the unfolding hostilities between Israel and Iran. She called Iran a “destabilizing, dangerous force” in a statement and supported Mr. Biden’s order for the American military to shoot down Iranian missiles aimed at Israel.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1841197927328596191" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The White House released a photograph</a> of Ms. Harris, her chin resting on her hand, sitting next to Mr. Biden during the briefing, that captured both the positives and the negatives of her role. The image showed Ms. Harris as a key player dealing with global affairs, yet her proximity to Mr. Biden could just as well have been part of the advertising campaign from Mr. Trump, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/trump-ad-harris-economy-bidenomics.html" title="">has actively sought to tie her and the president together</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“She’s balancing the profound responsibilities of governing and campaigning at the same time,” said Representative Haley Stevens, a Michigan Democrat and tireless surrogate for the Harris campaign in her state. “As Kamala Harris continues to serve as vice president, she remains a key part of an administration that has a whole heck of a lot to be proud of. She’s going to run on that record.”</p><p>Ms. Harris spent Wednesday conducting more of her official duties. She delivered updates on the federal emergency response from Georgia, which also happens to be among the battleground states that will determine the outcome of the election.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who traveled to Georgia to see the storm damage on Monday, is hoping to seize on all the disorder. Wearing a suit and a red “Make America Great Again” hat during his trip, he attacked the federal government for its disaster response, though the state’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/trump-georgia-hurricane-helene.html" title="">has said</a> Mr. Biden has been responsive.</p><p>“I have been in touch with the governor,” Ms. Harris <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/weve-got-boots-ground-harris-says-government-is-sending-supplies-ga-following-helene/FI5QKLWIIVA4BEK7VTBZQGJKCU/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in an interview with WSB-TV in Atlanta</a> about her conversations with Mr. Kemp. “I actually spoke with him. I’ve been getting regular briefings at FEMA.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Donald J. Trump visited Valdosta, Ga., on Monday, touring areas damaged by Hurricane Helene.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Representative Mike Waltz, a Florida Republican who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, said it would benefit Republicans for voters to contrast the state of affairs now with that under Mr. Trump.</p><p>“You have the largest ground war since World War II in Europe and now state-on-state ballistic missiles flying between Israel and Iran,” he said, citing the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began in 2022 and the current escalation in the Middle East. “Just four years ago, Trump was signing peace deals on the White House lawn.”</p><p>But the representative said it was the strike at the East and Gulf Coast ports that could prove the biggest “October surprise.” Even if the strike is short, it would be expected to be hugely disruptive. But if the impasse drags on it could cause <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/business/economy/port-dockworkers-strike-economy.html" title="">a multibillion-dollar fallout</a> across industries and disrupt the supply chain.</p><p>Mr. Biden has said he was not planning to invoke a nearly 80-year-old law to force the dockworkers with the International Longshoremen’s Association back to work. And politically it would be hard for Democrats to intervene to press the workers to get back to work.</p><p>The party is expected to rely heavily on organized labor for its get-out-the-vote efforts in the key battleground states in the coming weeks. In a statement on Wednesday, Ms. Harris said that foreign companies were making record profits and the longshoremen “deserve a fair share.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Both Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris were making separate trips to North Carolina and Georgia on Wednesday to assess storm damage and offer their administration’s support for relief efforts.</p><p>The political impact of natural disasters is often difficult to calculate until long after a recovery has taken place. Both Georgia and North Carolina are battlegrounds hard fought over by the Harris and Trump campaigns, and the states’ governors have praised Mr. Biden’s administration for its response and attentiveness.</p><p>The hardest-hit areas include Asheville, a Democratic city in western North Carolina, and rural areas where voters are more likely to vote for Republicans.</p><p>All the devastation was a backdrop for the lone vice-presidential debate on Tuesday.</p><p>“Tonight our country is facing several unfolding crises,” CBS’s Norah O’Donnell, one of the moderators, said in her introduction.</p><p>When his turn came, Mr. Vance flipped the script on the Democratic Party’s long-running talk that Mr. Trump is destabilizing the world order. “As much as Gov. Walz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
