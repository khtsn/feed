Citizens had shown “great responsibility,” he said, by “going out into the forest to collect dead wood” to burn at home.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/world/europe/russia-ukraine-natural-gas-europe.html" title="">crisis began on Jan. 1</a>, when Russia’s energy giant Gazprom stopped pumping natural gas through Ukraine, its remaining major export route to Europe, after Ukraine refused to a renew a five-year gas transit deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In most places once dependent on Russian gas, like Hungary, the shutdown’s consequences were softened by alternative suppliers from the West.

No free Russian gas, the whole thing collapses,” he said. “But I don’t think Russia will let this happen soon. It still needs them.”</p><p>Others see Transnistria’s travails less as a sign of Russian retreat than of its determination to divert Moldova from its pro-European course.</p><p>Also cut off from Russian gas, Moldova has over the past week shifted to more expensive alternatives, including electricity from Romania. This saved Moldova from going cold but doubled the price of electricity for consumers, which could carry a heavy political price for the pro-Western government in elections this year.</p><p>Russia’s goal, said Vladislav Kulminski, a former government official now with the Institute for Strategic Initiatives, a Moldovan research group, “is to keep us in a gray zone by getting an election result that will bring to power a different government.”</p><p>”Everything has been thrown up in the air,” he said. “We don’t know what shape it will take when all the pieces fall to the ground.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Friday evening in Chisinau, Moldova.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People from Transnistria waiting in line on Friday at a post office in Varnita.

Whispers that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia might also be to blame are taboo.</p><p>The media blitz seems to be working.</p><p>“Putin would never abandon us,” said Grigory Kravatenko, a resident of Bender, an industrial town bordering Moldovan-controlled territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Asked whether Transnistria might be better off less aligned with Moscow, he added: “We are not for Russia. We are not for Moldova. We are not for Ukraine. We are for ourselves and we are all suffering.”</p><p>Cooking stoves kept working for a while after the Jan. 1 cutoff, thanks to gas that was still in the pipes. But now they, too, are spluttering.</p><p>A Transnistria resident who gave only her first name, Yulia, walking on Friday with her infant daughter down an abandoned railway track, said she was sure that Russia would soon come to the rescue. “Of course they won’t let us die,” she said.</p><p>Victor Ceban, an Orthodox Christian priest responsible for parishes along the zigzagging border, said he avoided talking about who was responsible. “Whatever you say to one person you become somebody else’s enemy,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Victor Ceban, a priest, crossing the street in Varnita as he walked around the village to bless homes on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In some places, the border is marked with concrete barriers manned by Russians in fatigues. But it is so unclear in other places that it is easy to stray into Transnistria. Waved through a checkpoint this past week by a soldier with a Russian flag on his shoulder, journalists asked people at a bus stop if they knew of Transnistria’s problems.</p><p>“Of course we do. This is Transnistria,” an elderly woman said.</p><p>Mr. Ceban, the priest, walking from home to home on Friday through the Moldovan-controlled village of Varnita, offered blessings ahead of Orthodox Christmas and prayers that his mostly geriatric flock would not suffer long without heat.</p><p>When Transnistria, the most prosperous part of Moldova when both were part of the Soviet Union, first broke away to form a renegade state in the early 1990s, the region boasted it would become a Russian-speaking version of Switzerland — a proudly independent haven from the turmoil gripping Moldova, which was deeply impoverished.</p><p>The breakaway region became a template for what has since been a drive by Russia to keep its influence in former Soviet lands by supporting separatists: first in Moldova, then in Georgia and in eastern Ukraine. In all three countries, local militants backed by Russian muscle declared their own microstates.</p><p>The deployment of Russia troops in Transnistria, originally as peacekeepers but still there decades after the fighting stopped, ensured that Moldova could never retake the territory by force and doomed diplomatic efforts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Just as important to Transnistria’s survival, however, has been Russian gas, provided virtually free to keep a steel plant and other industries working — and to fuel the power station selling electricity to Moldova.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A group of friends listening to music while polishing their cars in the center of Tiraspol, Transnistria, in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cristian Movila for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Russian armed vehicle in Transnistria in 2022.

They faced disaster, he said, especially if the usual winter temperatures — typically many degrees below freezing — grip the country.</p><p>He said he did not blame Transnistria: “They can’t do anything. Moscow controls everything over there.”</p><p>Veronica Ostap, a mother in Varnita struggling to keep her family fed without a working stove, said she was waiting for her pay next week to buy an electric kettle.
