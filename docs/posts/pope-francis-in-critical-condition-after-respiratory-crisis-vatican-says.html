As a young man, Francis had part of a lung removed.</p><p>But the Vatican said on Saturday that Francis was alert and sitting up in an armchair, “though he was in more pain than yesterday.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The blood transfusion was necessary because tests showed low platelet counts, associated with anemia, the Vatican said.</p><p>On Friday, his doctors had said that Francis was in critical condition and would remain in the hospital for at least another week.</p><p>His surgeon Sergio Alfieri said that the pope understood the risk of death at his age and had told him, “all doors were open.”</p><p>Speaking to reporters gathered at Policlinico Agostino Gemelli, the hospital where Francis is being treated, Dr. Alfieri had described the difficulties the pope’s medical team was facing to calibrate the right treatment for the pontiff, who has pneumonia but also a complex infection.</p><p>The pope’s medical doctor at the Vatican, Luigi Carbone, said that as in the case of any fragile patient, it would take very little for a medical situation “to become unbalanced.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The doctors said that Francis was intermittently using oxygen.</p><p>This is the fourth time Francis has stayed at the Gemelli hospital. In 2021, he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/04/world/europe/pope-francis-surgery.html" title="">colon surgery</a> there. In 2023, he was admitted for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/world/europe/pope-francis-hospital-tests.html" title="">respiratory infection</a>, but went home after three days. He was hospitalized again a few months later to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/world/europe/pope-francis-hospital.html" title="">undergo abdominal surgery</a> for a hernia.</p><p>Dr. Alfieri, who performed both abdominal surgeries, said on Friday that when it came to those medical conditions, Francis was fine. The pope’s heart was strong, he added.</p><p>In recent years the pope has been prone to bouts of influenza and bronchitis during the cold winter months. Because of knee problems and sciatica, he often uses a wheelchair, walker or cane.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
