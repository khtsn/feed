Both were taken to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in stable condition. They were sent home early Saturday morning, according to Sean Darcy, a spokesman for Mr. Paterson.</p><p>A spokesman for the Police Department said the former governor was not believed to have been targeted in the assault. Mr. Paterson is legally blind but there was no indication that the attackers were aware of this.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Sliwa is the son of Curtis Sliwa, a former Republican mayoral candidate and the founder of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/07/nyregion/sliwa-guardian-angels-hannity.html" title="">Guardian Angels</a>, an anti-crime group.</p><p>In a news conference Saturday afternoon near the location of the assault, Mr. Paterson said that his stepson first encountered their attackers when he was walking the family dog.</p><p>Mr. Sliwa saw some of them going up the fire escape of a brick building on Second Avenue, Mr. Paterson said, and “yelled at them to come down or he was going to call the cops.”</p><p>“They came down and he got into it with one of them and that was kind of the end of it,” Mr. Paterson said.</p><p>Soon afterward, however, Mr. Sliwa brought the dog home and went back outside with Mr. Paterson, where they encountered the group again, the former governor said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Paterson said two adults had joined the fray, and that they physically assaulted him and his stepson.</p><p>“It was a bigger argument that ensued but interestingly enough, two adults intervened and actually started the fight,” Mr. Paterson said. “The kids didn’t start the fight.

He did not seek re-election after completing his term as governor.</p><p>On Saturday, Mr. Paterson said that he was confident the police would find his assailants and that he believed his stepson had done nothing wrong.</p><p>Mr. Paterson said that a neighbor happened to walk down the street during the fight and saw him and his stepson, who appeared to be hurt. The neighbor and Mr. Paterson then helped Mr. Sliwa back home and called 911.</p><p>Mr. Sliwa displayed “a lot of courage, a lot of bravery,” Mr. Paterson said.</p><p>Nate Schweber<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko">More about Hurubie Meko</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>23</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Former New York Governor Is Injured in Manhattan Street Squabble<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
