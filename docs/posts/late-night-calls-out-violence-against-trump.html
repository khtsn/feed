That sounds like an evil plot straight out of Looney Tunes.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Yo, again? Will you people stop trying to assassinate Donald Trump? Not only is it morally wrong, but you’re also just giving him more things to brag about: ‘They only tried to kill Abraham Lincoln once; that makes me twice as great as him.’” <em>— RONNY CHIENG</em></p><p>“Given that Trump’s campaign hadn’t announced any public plans for Sunday, many wondered did the suspect know the former president would be coming to play golf or was it a guess? Yes, how could he possibly have guessed that Trump would be golfing?” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“This guy managed to walk into Trump’s golf course and stay there undetected for 12 hours, OK? And I don’t know if you’ve thought about this, Trump, but maybe you should consider building, like, a wall?” <em>— RONNY CHIENG</em></p><p>“By the way, have you noticed that the news reports are all like ‘a harrowing near tragedy sending chills through our nation!’ and meanwhile, everyone you actually know is like, ‘Oh, yeah, yeah, I saw that, yeah.’ I mean, we have to act like it’s a big deal, but it doesn’t really have the same impact of the first one, you know? It’s kind of like ‘Black Panther 2.’ You’re like, ‘Yeah, I guess I’ll see it.’” <em>— RONNY CHIENG</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-5711d7e3">The Punchiest Punchlines (Swift Social Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“In a post to Truth Social over the weekend, former President Trump said, ‘I hate Taylor Swift!’ Sounds like he’s making a strong play for the 9-year-old brother vote.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“Donald tweeting ‘I hate Taylor Swift?’ That’s dangerous. I mean, I would rather buy one of those Hezbollah pagers than tweet ‘I hate Taylor Swift.’” <em>— RONNY CHIENG</em></p><p>“I think Trump needs to stick to racism — it’s less divisive.” <em>— RONNY CHIENG</em></p><p>“But the assassin this weekend was probably not a Swiftie, OK? He doesn’t fit the M.O. Swifties are nonviolent — they prefer to cyberbully you until you kill yourself.” <em>— RONNY CHIENG</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Oprah Winfrey made a surprise appearance to promote voter registration on Tuesday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h2 id="link-1f978490">What We’re Excited About on Wednesday Night</h2></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Rachel Maddow will appear on Wednesday’s “Late Show.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In “High Potential,” Olson’s character cleans the police station … and soon helps the officers solve cases.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Bukach/Disney</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
