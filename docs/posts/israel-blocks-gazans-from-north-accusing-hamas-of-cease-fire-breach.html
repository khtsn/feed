    <h1>Israel Blocks Gazans From North, Accusing Hamas of Cease-Fire Breach</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Israeli troops were preventing Palestinians from returning to their homes in the north of the Gaza Strip on Sunday as Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the terms of the cease-fire agreement that went into effect a week ago.</p><p>Under the terms of the initial phase of the deal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/17/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire" title="">agreed to this month</a>, Israel had been expected to withdraw some of its forces to allow hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans to head north after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostages-oct-7.html" title="">hostage and prisoner exchange</a> on Saturday.</p><p>But Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, accused Hamas on Saturday of violating the deal by not returning captive Israeli civilians first. Israeli officials said that under the agreement, Arbel Yehud, an Israeli held hostage in Gaza, was supposed to be one of the four women released on Saturday.</p><p>The hostages released were all soldiers who had been lookouts at a base on the Gaza border and were abducted from there on Oct. 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led attack on Israel that began <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">the war</a>.</p></div></div>
