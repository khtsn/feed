Much has changed in the neighborhood since the 1960s, when the couple first moved there, renting two floors for just $150 a month. The property value has gone up — the median rent for a property in SoHo these days is $7,750, according to Zumper — but inside, the home remains almost exactly as it was when they occupied it. The top-floor studio still has Christo’s sketches, art supplies neatly arranged in cookie tins and an unopened Coca-Cola bottle (their son, Cyril, loved Coke). Downstairs, where they ate and slept, trinkets and family photos surround the dining table and stools he built to furnish the space.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-1"><div><figcaption><span>Christo&#39;s studio on the top floor of the home is preserved almost exactly as it was when he worked there. </span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Soon after Christo and Jeanne-Claude arrived in the neighborhood, in 1971, SoHo was rezoned to allow certain artists to live and work in their industrial lofts, further solidifying its status as a bohemia. Jean-Michel Basquiat, Barbara Kruger, On Kawara and Richard Prince had all lived in SoHo. Now, more than five decades later, many of the artists from that era have died or left the neighborhood, and the question of what to do with their studios arises.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/arts/design/20jeanne-claude.html" title="">Jeanne-Claude</a> died in 2009, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/arts/christo-dead.html" title="">in 2020, so did Christo</a>. Since then, 48 Howard’s future has been uncertain. Their foundation uses the building as its office, but walls are deteriorating, paint is peeling and the facade has needed renovation. The possibility of opening the home up to the public is being explored, but that could mean having to make structural updates to get it up to code and make it accessible, an expensive undertaking possibly undermining its authenticity.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/multimedia/08re-christo-01-pzhb/08re-christo-01-pzhb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/multimedia/08re-christo-01-pzhb/08re-christo-01-pzhb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/multimedia/08re-christo-01-pzhb/08re-christo-01-pzhb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Sun shines on a row of buildings.

They never accepted money from sponsors, financing their own projects, no matter the scale, so as to remain independent and avoid commercial influence. In 1995, they famously wrapped the Reichstag, the German parliament building, in 100,000 square meters of fabric. A decade later in New York, the couple installed 7,503 saffron-colored, nylon “gates” in Central Park.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-7"><div><figcaption><span>Christo and Jeanne-Claude never accepted money from sponsors, financing their own projects, no matter the scale, so as to remain independent and avoid commercial influence.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Christo and Jeanne-Claude Foundation and Ugo Mulas Heirs</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>They created fleeting, monumental pieces that were feats of engineering and negotiation. Their installations often involved intense debates with governments and were met with protests from environmentalists. The resulting works were owned by no one but could be experienced by everyone, changing the way the public interacted with art altogether. “Our work is a scream of freedom,” Christo often said in interviews.</p><p>Earlier this year, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of The Gates, The Shed held a retrospective spotlighting the couple’s unrealized projects and, in Central Park, the public could view an augmented reality version of the work. It’s no surprise that their works still resonate — in today’s post-Covid New York, where many aspects of city life are largely unaffordable and public space feels increasingly threatened, the search for the kind of egalitarian wonder and excitement that Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s art provided continues.</p><p>At a moment when the creation of art at such a scale feels impossible without a corporate sponsor, when most visual stunts are shallow cries for publicity, the preservation of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s legacy feels urgent. And a crucial part of their oeuvre is that the inception of their grand, internationally known works happened humbly, in an unglamorous, gritty industrial building.</p><h2 id="link-20d4c9d8">Discovering SoHo</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“We want to find a way to keep their legacy alive, preserving the space where they lived and worked,” said Lorenza Giovanelli, the foundation’s collection and exhibition manager.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Christo, originally from Bulgaria, and Jeanne-Claude, originally from Morocco, met in Paris in the 1950s. In 1964, they came to New York via the SS France. They brought with them two mattresses, a chair by Gerrit Rietveld and a painting by Lucio Fontana. Those items don’t fit easily into suitcases, but Christo “was a master in terms of wrapping and packing,” Ms. Giovanelli said with a smile.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Like many artists of the time, the couple moved into the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/style/chelsea-hotel-chelsea-guitars.html" title="">Chelsea Hotel</a>. They were in search of a more permanent place to stay, and the sculptor Claes Oldenburg, who also lived at the Chelsea Hotel, suggested Christo and Jeanne-Claude check out 48 Howard. Mr. Oldenburg had a studio there and knew that several floors in the building were vacant.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Christo and Jeanne-Claude arrived in New York via the SS France. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The building was owned by two brothers, Max and Ben Rosenbaum, who ran a tin roofsmithing business.

They called in other artist friends, including Gordon Matta-Clark, to help build a bathroom and closets. Then, they had to furnish the place.</p><p>Having little money, the couple became “professional scavengers,” Ms. Giovanelli said. “They would literally walk up and down the streets of SoHo and Brooklyn and get furniture that other people discarded.” While Christo was shy, Jeanne-Claude “was known for being shameless,” Ms. Giovanelli said. He’d pretend not to know her as she picked up chairs and tables from the street.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-17"><div><figcaption><span>Christo and Jeanne-Claude had to “literally build the walls, paint everything and scrub all the filth,” Ms. Giovanelli said.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The objects in the home “have a patina of repeated use,” said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/nyregion/the-memory-keeper-of-soho.html" title="">Yukie Ohta</a>, an artist and <a href="https://sohomemory.org/48-howard-christo-and-jeanne-claude/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">archivist</a> in SoHo. “They aren’t quite dirty, but they are not as shiny as the Subzero refrigerators or as fresh as the Room and Board sofas that one might find in a renovated SoHo loft today.”</p><p>In 1973, the Rosenbaums told Christo and Jeanne-Claude that they were planning to sell the building and had found a buyer. Jeanne-Claude asked whether she and Christo could buy it instead if she could match the offer plus a symbolic $1. The owners said yes, but finances were again a problem for the couple.</p><p>“We tried everything possible to get the money,” Christo said in a 2014 <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/christo-interview/" title="">interview</a> with T Magazine. “At the time, we sometimes weren’t even able to pay the rent for a few months.

She also acted as his publicist and began hosting dinner parties, inviting influential dealers and gallerists. “She was notorious for being a terrible cook,” Ms. Giovanelli said. “They had no money at all, so she would cook flank steak and canned potatoes. That was it.”</p><p>The evenings were often the source of gossip in the art world, Ms. Giovanelli added.

A pivotal moment in the Nazi regime’s rise, the event would be used to rationalize mass arrests and the suspension of press freedom.</p><p>German authorities repeatedly denied Christo and Jeanne-Claude permission to wrap the building. But they had the support of Mr. Brandt, who had come to 48 Howard to urge them not to give up. In 1992, however, Mr. Brandt died.

Where the radiator used to be, she traced the words “I Love You” out of grime on the wall. In the living area, she also pasted pieces of paper with quotes she enjoyed around the space, one of which reads, “to be is to do (Descartes) / to do is to be (J-P. Sartre) / do be do be do (Sinatra).”</p><p>The public anger and institutional battles that came with every work were part of the art itself. “For me esthetics is everything involved in the process — the workers, the politics, the negotiations, the construction difficulty, the dealing with hundreds of people,” Christo <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/08/20/91341271.html?pageNumber=173" title="">told The Times</a> in 1972. “The whole process becomes an esthetic — that’s what I’m interested in, discovering the process. I put myself in dialogue with other people.”</p><p>And though there were many triumphs — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/arts/design/christo-wrap-arc-de-triomphe-paris.html" title="">L’Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped</a> in Paris and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/05/arts/design/christo-drapes-miami-isles-in-pink.html" title="">Surrounded Islands</a> in Florida — there were also several occasions in which the years of fighting didn’t lead to success.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I use my own money and my own work and my own plans because I like to be totally free,” Christo told The Times in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christo and Jeanne-Claude Foundation; Photo by Wolfgang Volz</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>Starting in the 1990s, the couple wanted to suspend nearly six miles of luminous fabric over the Arkansas River.

But then, environmentalists protested, a local opposition group called Rags Over the Arkansas River formed and students at Denver University’s Environmental Law Clinic filed a lawsuit to halt the project. But only in 2017, after President Trump was first sworn in, did Christo announce he wanted to step away from it, in an act of his own protest.</p><p>“The federal government is our landlord. They own the land,” Christo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/arts/design/christo-protest-donald-trump-colorado-artwork.html" title="">told The Times</a> following his decision. “I can’t do a project that benefits this landlord.”</p><p>Though the physical installation never came to fruition, in a way, the work still existed through the conversations it sparked.
