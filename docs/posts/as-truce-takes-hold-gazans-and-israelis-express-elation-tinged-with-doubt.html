How bad, he wondered, is the damage? And who will rebuild a decimated Gaza?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Weissglas worried about the condition of the hostages set to be freed gradually over the next few weeks from dank quarters in the territory. And he grimaced about exchanging them for hundreds of Palestinian detainees, many of whom are serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis. “There is relief,” he said, “wrapped in caution, fears and concern.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rally was held on Saturday night in Tel Aviv for the return of the hostages held in Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amit Elkayam for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It was an apt summary of the mood on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide on Sunday, as Israelis and Palestinians expressed feelings of elation tinged with doubt.</p><p>For Palestinians, the truce is theoretically expected to provide at least six weeks without strikes on Gaza. That offers a window for Gazans to take tentative first steps toward reconstruction; to find relatives still buried in the rubble; and to come to terms with the killing of more than 45,000 people, both civilians and combatants, whose bodies have already been counted by the Gazan health authorities.</p><p>For Israelis, the deal allows for the gradual release of at least 33 of the hostages captured during Hamas’s raid on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — an attack that killed up to 1,200 people and provoked Israel’s devastating 15-month response. For the hostages released alive, that means freedom after 470 days of captivity. For Israelis at large, many of them wracked by a form of survivors’ guilt, it offers qualified catharsis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>But the details of the deal between Israel and Hamas mean that both sides still face considerable uncertainty about how the next six weeks will play out, let alone about whether the tentative arrangement will later become permanent. Even the first phase started hours behind schedule on Sunday morning, amid disputes about which hostages would be released in the afternoon. In that time, according to the Gazan authorities, Israeli strikes killed and wounded yet more people.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced Palestinians trying to return home on Sunday in northern Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Al-Basos/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Palestinians remain unclear about the fates of several thousand Gazans detained incommunicado during the war and who may not be released during the upcoming exchanges. Reema Diab, a housewife in central Gaza, still has no way of locating her husband, a horse trainer, who she said was taken for interrogation in Israel in December 2023 and never heard from since.</p><p>“I’m relieved the bloodshed is coming to an end, but my heart aches,” Ms. Diab said. “His absence is unimaginable.”</p><p>A few dozen miles away, Mr. Weissglas feared for the fates of some 65 hostages who may not be released from Gaza if the deal collapses after six weeks. He worried that many of the initial 33 hostages set to be released over the next 42 days may be emotionally or physically scarred, or even dead. And he lamented the cost of their freedom, which will be obtained in exchange for Palestinian detainees, including those convicted of major terrorist attacks as well as teenagers who have never been charged.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Palestinians see the soon-to-be released prisoners as freedom fighters. For Israelis, it will be a psychological blow to see “this stream of murderers being released,” Mr. Weissglas said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israelis looking at the ruins of Beit Hanoun, Gaza, from a hill in Sderot, Israel, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Videos of Hamas fighters re-emerging in triumph from hiding was also a gut-punch for Israelis, who had hoped the war would completely destroy the group’s military abilities. For many Gazans, it was a sight to be celebrated, but for others, it was a reminder of lingering uncertainty about Gaza’s future governance.</p><p>Mr. Obeid works for the Palestinian Authority, which lost power to Hamas in Gaza 18 years ago but which still employs some civil servants there, including Mr. Obeid. He said he had been working with the authority’s leaders in the West Bank to plan potential cleanup and reconstruction operations in Gaza in the coming days. It is unclear, he said, whether that will be possible with Hamas still in charge over the next six weeks.</p><p>But that is tomorrow’s challenge, Mr. Obeid said.</p><p>For now, he said, “I can breathe oxygen again.”</p><p>Bilal Shbair<!-- --> contributed reporting from Deir al Balah, Gaza Strip, and <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> from Jerusalem.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
