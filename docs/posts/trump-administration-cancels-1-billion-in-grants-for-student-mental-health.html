    <h1>Trump Administration Cancels $1 Billion in Grants for Student Mental Health</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The grant cancellations were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/school-mental-health-grants-trump-biden-dei-00bec2d96371f023ac56fe3f32f3e92f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier by The Associated Press</a>.</p><p>Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who helped negotiate the legislation, said it was illegal for any president to halt funding approved by Congress and called on Republican supporters to stand up for the law. Three Republican senators, John Cornyn of Texas, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who <a href="https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/news/cornyn-tillis-collins-op-ed-the-bipartisan-safer-communities-act-is-cause-for-optimism/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote a column</a> in support of the law three years ago, did not return calls seeking comment.</p><p>“I’m raw about this because I sat in the room for a long time negotiating a really delicate compromise on a really tough issue,” Mr. Murphy said in an interview. “What’s the point of being in Congress and writing laws if the president can just ignore them? So, I’m angry that my Republican partners are not out there raising objections to what the president is doing.”</p><p>Christopher Rufo, the conservative activist who has spearheaded the assault on critical race theory and diversity, equity and inclusion programs, posted screenshots on social media this week of some grant applications, which he said was proof that the program was “being used to advance left-wing racialism and discrimination.”</p><p>“No more slush fund for activists under the guise of mental health,” Mr. Rufo <a href="https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1917314079406055660" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>.</p><p>But Mary Wall, a former deputy assistant secretary for education involved in setting up the process to solicit bids for the program under the Biden administration, said it was a “gross overstep” to equate mental health services with the radicalization of children.</p><p>The application process favored programs that reflected the communities they served, she said. Programs aimed at training mental health professionals for predominantly minority communities, for example, received extra consideration if they could show how the training would be aimed at professionals with similar backgrounds. Ms. Wall said this was “a common-sense practice” with proven results.</p><p>“One of the first questions after every single school shooting is whether the student had access to mental health support and services,” Ms. Wall said. “It is no stretch to say that taking away this support introduces the risk of harm to school communities and students.”</p></div></div>
