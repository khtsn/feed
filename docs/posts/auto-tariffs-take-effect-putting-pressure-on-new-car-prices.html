Starting May 3, the tariff will also apply to imported auto parts, which will add to the cost of cars assembled domestically as well as auto repairs.</p><p>There will be a partial exemption for cars made in Mexico or Canada that meet the terms of free trade agreements with those countries. Carmakers will not have to pay duties on parts like engines, transmissions or batteries that were made in the United States and later installed in cars in Mexican or Canadian factories.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>That provision will reduce the impact on vehicles like the Chevrolet Equinox electric vehicle, which is assembled in Mexico but includes a battery pack and other components made in the United States. General Motors will pay a tariff only on the portion of the car made abroad.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A worker on an assembly line at the General Motors plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., last year.

That is because most cars rolling out of U.S. factories contain components made abroad, often amounting to more than half the cost of the vehicle.</p><p>About 90 percent of the value of some Mercedes-Benz cars made in Alabama, for example, is in engines and transmissions that are imported from Europe, according to data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p><p>The impact of the tariffs on individual vehicles will vary widely. Cars like the Tesla Model Y, made in Texas and California, or Honda Passport, made in Alabama, have high percentages of U.S.-made parts and will pay lower tariffs.</p><p>Tariffs will be highest on cars manufactured abroad, like the Toyota Prius made in Japan or Porsche sports cars made in Germany.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Even people who don’t buy new cars will be hit by the tariffs because they will pay more for parts like tires, brake pads and oil filters.</p><p>Michael Holmes, co-chief executive of Virginia Tire and Auto, a chain of auto repair and maintenance shops, said he and his suppliers would initially try to absorb most of the increased cost.</p><p>“That’s not sustainable,” Mr. Holmes said. “It’s magical thinking to think businesses won’t pass this on.”</p><p>The auto tariffs could also push up prices for used cars over time, analysts said, by increasing demand for those vehicles as new ones become unaffordable for many buyers. Insurance premiums may also rise because repairs will cost more.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Ewing writes about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-ewing">More about Jack Ewing</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/general-motors">General Motors</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Renewable Energy: </strong>President Trump’s tariffs are likely to raise the costs of building renewable energy projects in the United States, analysts say, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/trump-renewable-energy-tariffs.html">adding to the challenges of an already struggling industry</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Small Violin Parts, Big Problems: </strong>A family business in Ottawa that makes special shoulder rests for violins is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/trump-tariffs-canada-us.html">imperiled by both Trump’s tariffs on Canada and potential Canadian retaliation</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Auto Sales Surged:</strong> Sales of cars picked up recently partly as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/business/auto-sales-trump-tariffs.html">buyers rushed to lock in deals</a> before Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on cars and auto parts go into effect.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israeli Duties on U.S. Imports:</strong> In an apparent bid to ensure that it is exempt from a new wave of levies that Trump is set to announce, Israel’s government has said it will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/israel-tariffs-us-imports-trump.html">cancel all remaining tariffs on American imports</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tariffs and Chinese Factories</strong>: Trump’s policies are straining trade ties and, as one factory owner’s struggles show, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/business/trump-tariffs-china-factory.html">challenging a long-held truth in China</a> about the centrality of the U.S. market.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Global Trade War Game: </strong>Two dozen trade experts gathered recently to simulate how a global trade war would play out. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/business/economy/trump-trade-war-game.html">The results were surprisingly optimistic</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
