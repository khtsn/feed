It’s like his whole cabinet was selected by a kid who was home sick with the flu.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“But is someone going to tell him that this isn’t actually a doctor’s job? This is running a vast insurance bureaucracy. If you have to pick someone from TV, at least pick the LiMu Emu.”<em>— DESI LYDIC</em></p><p>“And you might be saying, ‘Relax, Dr. Oz doesn’t have to know what he’s doing — he’ll have people around him who do.’ Sure, except that Dr. Oz’s boss will be R.F.K.
