That’s fairly typical for this time of year in this region.</p></li><li><p><strong>Heavy snow: </strong>Depending on what track the storm takes, six to 10 inches of new snow could fall across the upper Midwest on Friday night, followed by the Great Lakes into southern Canada and New England this weekend.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wintry mix: </strong>New York and other cities along the Northeast coast will see snow first on Saturday afternoon, before the warm air moves in, turning the precipitation to a mess of sleet, freezing rain and then rain. Some areas, especially close to the coast, will transition quickly from snow to rain. Some sleet and ice will fall as far south as the Central Appalachians.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-02-14-winterrisk" data-id="100000009991746" data-source-id="100000009991746"><div slug="2025-02-14-winterrisk" data-sourceid="100000009991746" id="embed-id-100000009991746">

This rare amount of moisture surging north is more intense than the rain that has already fallen. And some places, like Lexington, Ky., where three to five inches of rain is forecast, could break their February record for daily rainfall. (Over three inches of rain was measured there on Feb. 13, 1989.)</p><p>Forecasters like Mr. Lamers have remained confident that heavy rain and flash flooding will occur across the region Saturday into Saturday night. However, as of Friday morning, they were unsure where exactly the worst of the it would fall during the storm.</p><p>As of Friday morning, forecasters predicted that the heaviest rain was likely to fall in western or central Kentucky or northwestern Tennessee.

Forecasters in Charleston, W.Va., reminded residents who live on or at the base of hillsides to watch out for signs of potential ground movement: trees leaning in unusual orientations, or water and mud seeping in where they are not expected.</p><p>The warmer, springlike storm will be quick, and winter will return on Monday. Below-average temperatures will plunge across the eastern United States. Snow is likely to return on Tuesday and Wednesday, coating the same areas that may potentially flood this weekend in Tennessee and Kentucky — all as a coastal storm possibly returns heavy snow back to northeast coastal cities.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
