These are just some of the acts of vandalism on the wharves where lobster fishers have been locked in battle for more than three decades.</p><p>Lobstermen have a simple way of framing the dispute: Think of the ocean’s bounty like a pie. They are asking who should get a piece, and what is the fairest way to divide it between the white Canadians who built the commercial lobster industry and the Indigenous people who were historically left out.</p><p>The federal government, which regulates fisheries, has been reluctant to settle the politically fraught issue, alienating warring fishermen on both sides.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The conflict has created deep ruptures within fishing communities. Criminals have entered the equation, the authorities say, profiting from the illegal fishing and trading of lobsters.</p><p>The dispute raises thorny questions about Indigenous rights, economic equity, the conservation of resources and the future of Canada’s lobster industry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/30/multimedia/00canada-lobsters-wbvc/00canada-lobsters-wbvc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/30/multimedia/00canada-lobsters-wbvc/00canada-lobsters-wbvc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/30/multimedia/00canada-lobsters-wbvc/00canada-lobsters-wbvc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man in a tan coat and sneakers stands in snow.

For the seasonally nomadic Mi’kmaq, that meant hunting inland during the winter and moving to the coast to fish in the summer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Canada did not recognize those rights for decades as various fisheries and regulations were established, including the banning of lobster harvesting during the summer.</p><p>The summertime restrictions were successfully challenged in the 1990s in Canada’s highest court by a Mi’kmaq fisherman who had appealed illegal fishing charges.</p><p>The Canadian Supreme Court, in 1999, ruled that treaty rights allowed Indigenous people to fish during the summer and earn a moderate livelihood. But the court never defined what a moderate livelihood meant, leaving that up to the federal government.</p><p>The government, however, has only gone as far as granting individual lobster licenses to Indigenous groups allowing them to catch lobsters in the summer, while limiting commercial sales to lobsters harvested during the legally permitted fishing season from November to May.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Commercial fishing boats docked at the Meteghan Marina in Nova Scotia. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>The piecemeal approach angered Indigenous fisherman who cite ancestral rights to make a living selling summer lobsters, while the non-Indigenous were unhappy because they say that summer fishing was depleting lobster stocks and hurting their livelihood.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“The government of Canada has basically walked on tippy toes around Indigenous folks from the very beginning,” said Ken Coates, a historian who has studied Indigenous fishing rights. “They have been very, very cautious about enforcing much on the First Nations.”</p><p>The Sipekne’katik First Nation opened its commercial fishery in Clare in 2020, pointing to the treaties that predated the formation of Canada to claim a right to catch and sell lobster throughout the year.</p><p>Chaos ensued. Commercial fishermen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/world/canada/nova-scotia-lobster-war.html" title="">dumped lobster</a> caught by Sipekne’katik back into the ocean. Lobster pounds where they stored their catch were set on fire.
