Mission controllers were unable to solve a hydraulic issue with a clamp arm that holds onto the rocket until a few minutes before launch.</p><p>On Friday, the countdown proceeded smoothly with the rocket lifting off on time into the mostly clear skies. As typical, the booster of the Falcon 9 dropped off and landed on a pad near the launch site while the second stage continued to orbit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>A few minutes after the second stage completed its engine burn, the Crew Dragon spacecraft with the astronauts separated.

Because of propulsion problems, NASA officials decided that Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore would not return to Earth in Starliner. In early September, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/science/space/boeing-starliner-space-station-nasa.html" title="">the spacecraft undocked from the space station</a>, re-entered the atmosphere and landed in New Mexico without any problems.</p><p>Just as when an airline scrambles to rebook passengers after a flight is canceled, NASA had to find seats on a ride home for Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore.</p><p>The next spaceflight was Crew-9, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/science/spacex-launch-nasa.html" title="">lifted off a couple of weeks after Starliner left</a> the space station without anyone aboard. Two astronauts assigned to the flight were bumped off, leaving two seats in the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule for Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore on the return trip.</p><p>Thus, the Crew-9 capsule could have brought back the two astronauts any time after that, but that would have left the space station understaffed, affecting scientific experiments, operations and maintenance.</p><p>NASA and SpaceX could have rushed the Crew-10 mission to launch earlier, but NASA officials decided it was best for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/science/nasa-boeing-starliner-astronauts.html" title="">Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore to join the space station crew</a> and keep the planned schedule for Crew-10.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-34a5c1b4">When will Williams and Wilmore return to Earth?</h2><p>Crew-10 will arrive at space station 11:30 p.m. on Saturday.</p><p>The astronauts of Crew-9 and Crew-10 will overlap for a few days at the space station. About four days after Crew-10 launches, Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore — along with Nick Hague of NASA and Alexander Gorbunov, the two astronauts who arrived with Crew-9 — will climb aboard their spacecraft and head home, perhaps as soon as March 19.</p><p>Their stay could be extended again if there is bad weather at the possible splashdown sites off the coast of Florida.</p><h2 id="link-28119788">What have the astronauts said about their extended stay?</h2><p>In an interview last month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/podcasts/the-daily/nasa-spacex-astronauts-iss-launch.html" title="">published on Friday</a>, Michael Barbaro, the host of “The Daily,” asked the astronauts, “So, if not stuck, exactly how do you describe this scenario you find yourselves in?”</p><p>“That’s a great question,” Mr. Wilmore said. “I would say it’s work. It’s wonderful enjoyment. It’s been fun. It’s been trying at times, no doubt. But stranded? No. Stuck? No. Abandoned? No.”</p><p>This was the third trip to space for both Ms. Williams, 59, and Mr. Wilmore, 62, and they realize it might be their last one. “We’re heading home,” Ms. Williams said. “And it makes you really want to enjoy every bit of your time that you have up here.”</p><p>Michael Barbaro<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
