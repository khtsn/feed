If the S.E.C. confirms the proposed settlement, it would be a remarkable reversal by the agency after years of legal battles against crypto firms.</p><p>The S.E.C. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/business/sec-coinbase-lawsuit-cryptocurrency.html" title="">sued</a> Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto company, in 2023 on the grounds that the digital currencies sold on its platform constituted unregistered securities that put consumers at risk of financial harm.</p><p>Any settlement that results in a dismissal of the lawsuit would require S.E.C. approval. A spokesperson for the S.E.C. declined to comment on Coinbase’s announcement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The lawsuit was the most significant of several that the S.E.C. had filed against major crypto companies, arguing that they were operating outside the law. A victory for the government could have threatened the continued operation of Coinbase, a publicly traded company worth about $65 billion, and decimated the broader crypto market.</p><p>The dismissal would be biggest victory for the crypto industry since President Trump took office last month, promising to end the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/technology/cryptocurrency-stocks-bonds-courts-move-closer-to-an-answer.html" title="">regulatory crackdown</a> on crypto under the previous S.E.C. chair, Gary Gensler. And it illustrates the growing influence in Washington of billionaire technology executives, who wrote enormous checks to support Mr. Trump’s campaign, hoping to secure softer regulation.</p><p>Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, said in an interview that the agreement was a complete surrender by the S.E.C. — Coinbase would not have to admit to any wrongdoing or pay a fine. The agency agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice, he said, meaning that the lawsuit can’t be brought again.</p><p>“The resolution is nothing short of a complete win,” Mr. Grewal said. “The case goes away as if it had never been filed.”</p><p>He discussed the proposed resolution in a blog post entitled: “Righting a major wrong,” in which he called the lawsuit an “unlawful enforcement” action.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Coinbase operates as a marketplace for cryptocurrencies — a platform where investors can easily covert dollars into digital assets like Bitcoin or Ether. Every time a sales goes through, the company collects a fee.</p><p>Coinbase went public in 2021, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/14/business/stock-market-today" title="">landmark</a> for the crypto industry in the United States. Its founder and chief executive, Brian Armstrong, instantly became one of the wealthiest tech executives in the country.</p><p>But the next year, the collapse of FTX, one of Coinbase’s top rivals, sent crypto markets into a meltdown. Mr. Gensler accelerated a crackdown on the industry that he had started when he took over the agency in 2021.</p><p>His legal argument was simple: Virtually all cryptocurrencies are securities, just like stocks and bonds traded on Wall Street. Anyone offering them should have to register with the S.E.C. and follow strict rules to protect investors. He pointed to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/technology/cryptocurrency-stocks-bonds-courts-move-closer-to-an-answer.html" title="">century-old Supreme Court ruling</a> on what constituted an investment contract, arguing that it should govern digital assets.</p><p>As the top vendor for cryptocurrencies in the United States, Coinbase became one of Mr. Gensler’s primary targets. In the 2023 lawsuit, the S.E.C. argued that the company had “elevated its interest in increasing its profits over investors’ interests, and over compliance with the law.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Under Mr. Gensler, the agency filed similar suits against other top crypto marketplaces, like Binance and Kraken. (Those suits are still pending.) Crypto executives argued that Mr. Gensler was using enforcement actions and an old playbook to regulate the fast-growing industry. They lobbied for federal legislation that would have given oversight of the industry to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a much smaller and less aggressive regulator than the S.E.C.</p><p>A complex legal battled ensued, with judges in various jurisdictions issuing sometimes conflicting opinions about the legal status of cryptocurrencies. Last year, the judge overseeing the Coinbase case <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-03-27-2024/card/judge-denies-coinbase-s-motion-to-dismiss-sec-lawsuit-5FTvwbh6s9Flt4Fbjs82" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rejected</a> a motion by the company to dismiss the suit, setting the stage for a yearslong legal battle that could have reached the Supreme Court.</p><p>But while crypto firms were fighting the S.E.C. in court, the industry was also mobilizing to reshape the political landscape.</p><p>Crypto executives threw their support behind the candidacy of Mr. Trump, who started his own crypto business last year. Wealthy tech investors like Marc Andreessen, whose venture firm is a major investor in crypto, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/andreessen-horowitz-co-founders-explain-why-theyre-supporting-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cited</a> Mr. Trump’s support for digital currencies as a key reason they were backing him.</p><p>The crypto industry also sought to influence Congress: Coinbase was one of the top funders of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/technology/crypto-industry-spending-election.html" title="">Fairshake</a>, a crypto super PAC that donated more than $130 million to legislative candidates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Since his victory, Mr. Trump has taken a series of steps to advance the industry’s interests. He picked the venture investor David Sacks, a crypto enthusiast, as the White House’s “crypto and A.I. czar.” And he nominated Paul Atkins, a securities lawyer who has consulted for crypto companies, to lead the S.E.C.</p><p>While Mr. Atkins awaits confirmation, Mark T. Uyeda, a Republican S.E.C. commissioner, is leading the agency. This month, the S.E.C. scaled back its crypto enforcement efforts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/business/sec-crypto-task-force.html" title="">reassigning</a> lawyers who had worked on a 50-person team dedicated to crypto cases.</p><p>Mr. Grewal, a former federal judge, declined to name the S.E.C. officials who had negotiated the resolution of the case with Coinbase. But he said the deal had the “full support of leadership.” Next week, he said, the agency’s commissioners will vote to approve the deal, a process that he described as a formality.</p><p>“Our ending this case on such stark terms with the S.E.C. surrendering offers a model and template,” Mr. Grewal said. “I’m hopeful that ours will be not the last but rather the first of these cases to fall.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
