He began with an impromptu joke in English, thanking journalists for their applause but saying he hoped they would not fall asleep during his remarks.</p><p>The last five popes have held <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/12/world/pope-leo-news/the-last-5-pontiffs-have-held-audiences-with-the-news-media?smid=url-share" title="">audiences</a> with the media early in their papacies. Leo, the first American to lead the Roman Catholic Church and its 1.4 billion faithful, has spent his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/world/europe/pope-leo-xiv-address-peace.html" title="">first days</a> as pope pledging to align himself with “ordinary people” and decrying aggression and conflict. As Vatican observers watch for clues on how he plans to lead, Leo has already evoked Francis, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-francis-dead.html" title="">spoke out tirelessly</a> for the marginalized, several times. He did so again on Monday.</p><p>In the pope’s remarks, which lasted around 10 minutes, Leo called for the release of journalists who had been imprisoned for their work. At least 550 journalists were being held across the world as of December, according to <a href="https://rsf.org/sites/default/files/medias/file/2024/12/RSF%20Round-up%202024%20EN.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reporters Without Borders</a>, a nonpartisan organization that works to protect journalists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/12pope-ledeall-cljg/12pope-ledeall-cljg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/12pope-ledeall-cljg/12pope-ledeall-cljg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/12pope-ledeall-cljg/12pope-ledeall-cljg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Pope Leo surrounded by people in business attire who are facing him, some of them holding up cellphones to record." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/12pope-ledeall-cljg/12pope-ledeall-cljg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/12pope-ledeall-cljg/12pope-ledeall-cljg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/12pope-ledeall-cljg/12pope-ledeall-cljg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/12pope-ledeall-cljg/12pope-ledeall-cljg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ab79fba6-0ff3-5073-82e3-ff005b964c2e" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Leo shook hands with members of the news media after his address.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alberto Pizzoli/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Leo said that the church viewed imprisoned journalists as witnesses. “I am thinking of those who report on war even at the cost of their lives — the courage of those who defend dignity, justice and the right of people to be informed, because only informed individuals can make free choices,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The suffering of these imprisoned journalists challenges the conscience of nations and the international community, calling on all of us to safeguard the precious gift of free speech and of the press,” he said.</p><p>Leo also mentioned the challenges posed by social media and artificial intelligence, issues that he has previously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/world/europe/leo-xiv-pope-francis-catholic-church.html" title="">highlighted</a>.</p><p>After he had finished speaking, the pope descended the marble steps from the stage and shook hands with officials and some journalists, exchanging a few words and signing autographs.</p><p>Leo, who was born in Chicago, signed a baseball that someone held out to him. A woman in the line asked him for a selfie — a situation few of his predecessors would have faced in their first media outing. He politely declined, shook her hand and moved on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The early days of Leo’s papacy have contained clues for how closely he might align with the agenda set by his predecessor.

Putin of Russia and another senior Russian official for war crimes in connection with the deportations. Russia has defended moving the children on humanitarian grounds.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said he had informed the pope of Ukraine’s willingness to began a 30-day cease-fire immediately, reiterated that the government in Kyiv would engage in direct negotiations with Russia, and invited Leo to visit his country.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Pope Leo XIV</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Call for Peace: </strong>In his first audience with the press as pontiff, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/europe/pope-leo-vatican-journalists.html">Leo renewed his pleas for a more peaceful world</a> and quoted his predecessor, Pope Francis, who had called for communication that is free from aggression.</p></li><li><p><strong> Celebrating a Homegrown Pope: </strong>In Chicago, New Orleans and beyond, elated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/us/pope-leo-sunday-mass.html">worshipers and priests celebrated</a> their immediate sense of connection with Pope Leo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Echoing Francis in First Mass: </strong>In Pope Leo XIV’s advocacy of the poor, migrants and a more open church, many people see the new pope as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/pope-leo-mass-catholic-church.html">continuation of his predecessor</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seeing the First American Pope as Hardly American:</strong> Catholics around the world were skeptical at first about an American pope.
