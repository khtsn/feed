The projects, which the tribes say are allowed under an exception in federal law, have set off a fierce debate about tribal sovereignty and have turned tribes opposed to the projects against an administration that has championed Native American interests.</p><p>“The Department of the Interior has worked through a secretive, backdoor, fast-track process,” said Anthony Roberts, the chairman of another California tribe, the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, which opposes the Scotts Valley casino. “Unfortunately, Yocha Dehe’s been left out.”</p><p>Several opposing tribes have already sued to halt progress on two of the three proposed casinos. In one suit, a judge last week granted a temporary injunction that paused any plans for one of the casinos before a hearing next month. It is unclear whether the battle will be resolved before the end of the Biden administration, and what the Trump administration might do about it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Scotts Valley and the two other tribes seeking casinos — Koi Nation in Sonoma County, Calif., and the Coquille Indian Tribe in southwestern Oregon — lost their land in the 1950s and 1960s when the U.S. government terminated the federal recognition of many Native American tribes. In more recent decades the government reversed course and recognized the three tribes, but their federal land was never restored.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dino Beltran, vice chairman of the Koi Nation Tribal Council, on the site of a proposed casino in Santa Rosa. “We’ve had our presence in Sonoma County for 3,000 years,” Mr. Beltran said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian C.

The law, however, requires tribes to show modern and historical connections to the sites they propose to build on.</p><p><a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/kathryn-rl-rand" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kathryn R.L. Rand</a> and <a href="https://law.unlv.edu/faculty/steven-light" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Steven Light</a>, law professors at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in the <a href="https://law.unlv.edu/centers-programs/indian-nations-gaming-and-governance-program" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Indian nations gaming and governance program</a> said that it is clear the tribes are disadvantaged. Less clear are their connections to the land.</p><p>Neighboring tribes in California and Oregon accuse the three tribes of the equivalent of “reservation shopping” — choosing land in highly populated areas where casinos would be more profitable. Each tribe has selected land more than 50 miles away from its current base. The Scotts Valley casino would be built in Vallejo, in Solano County, nearly 100 miles from its base.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Yocha Dehe argues that the Scotts Valley land is squarely in its territory and that the plans would destroy archaeological finds, including prehistoric artifacts and most likely some remains of its tribal ancestors, for an eight-story structure complete with restaurants, bars and 3,500 slot machines.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tribes including the Koi Nation, the Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians and the Coquille Indian Tribe lost their land in the 1950s and 1960s when the U.S. government terminated the federal recognition of many Native American tribes. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian C.

State and local officials also say their concerns about big, new gambling sites in their communities have gone unrecognized by the federal government.</p><p>The Scotts Valley tribe and officials at the Interior Department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs declined to comment publicly. But the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in summaries this year for <a href="https://www.scottsvalleycasinoea.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Scotts_Valley_Casino_and_Tribal_Housing_Project_EA-508.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all</a> <a href="https://www.shilohresortenvironmental.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Koi-Nation-Shiloh-Resort-and-Casino-FEIS_508.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three</a> <a href="https://coquille-eis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/3_Coquille-FTT-and-Gaming-Facility-Final-EIS-Vol-II-Nov-2024-508C.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">projects</a>, said the purpose of the casinos was “to facilitate tribal self-sufficiency, self-determination and economic development.’’</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The tribe relies on federal funding to support tribal government functions and the needs of its members,” the bureau’s <a href="https://www.scottsvalleycasinoea.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Scotts_Valley_Casino_and_Tribal_Housing_Project_EA-508.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environmental assessment</a> said of Scotts Valley. “However, federal funding is insufficient to meet tribal member needs.”</p><p>Ms. Rand and Mr. Light said that while the Biden administration had taken steps to make it easier and faster for land to be restored to tribes, gambling was still their economic engine. “It would be impossible to overstate how significant gaming has been for hundreds of tribes across the U.S., including 75-plus tribes in California,” Mr. Light said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A casino operated by the Graton Rancheria in Rohnert Park, Calif. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian C.

Greg Sarris, the chairman of Graton Rancheria, said it was a slippery slope to permit tribes to claim lucrative land for gambling when they cannot prove strong historical ties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It’s not fair that some tribes, their aboriginal territory is closer to urban areas,” Mr. Sarris said. “It’s the luck of the draw. But you start playing that game and saying, ‘Well, this one should be closer’ — that’s a can of worms you cannot put the lid on. Where does this end?”</p><p>Dino Beltran, the vice chairman for the Koi Nation, countered that Graton Rancheria, which has a casino some 15 miles from the site where the Koi Nation seeks to build, was simply trying to protect its bottom line from a competitor.</p><p>“We’ve had our presence in Sonoma County for 3,000 years,” Mr. Beltran said, adding that Koi Nation’s casino proposal has the support of more than 80 other tribes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Greg Sarris, the chairman of the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, at his office this week. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian C.

Gavin Newsom of California and local officials have their own concerns about competition with other tribes as well as the impact on surrounding communities. Mr. Newsom’s office has sent letters to the Biden administration opposing the casinos in California and the casino in Oregon, which would be located less than 50 miles from the California border. In a follow-up letter this month his office said that the Interior Department had demonstrated “serious deficiencies in its decision-making process,” including a “puzzling refusal” to sufficiently consult with other tribes.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Officials in Solano County said they did not know how they would handle the demands of Scotts Valley’s 24/7 casino in Vallejo, which would have a capacity for several thousand people. The city already has a shortage of police officers, trouble maintaining roads and a large unhoused population, said Erin Hannigan, a county supervisor.</p><p>“They can’t manage,” Ms. Hannigan said of the city. “And then throw something in like a casino that could increase crime, could increase the disparities between those who have and those who have not.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some residents of Santa Rosa are opposed to the building of the casino. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian C.

Tina Kotek asked for an extension to the timeline for decision making on the casino for the Coquille Indian Tribe. Ms. Kotek previously said she <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/business/2023/04/13/kotek-tells-tribes-she-opposes-any-expansion-of-gambling-in-oregon/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was opposed</a> to the project. But the fight in Oregon is partly motivated by the fact that the Coquille tribe’s proposed casino would cut into the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/oregon-tribal-gambling-casinos.html" title="">state’s billions of dollars in gambling revenue</a>.</p><p>It is understandable that Oregon “would want to protect the status quo just like our other casino opponents,” Judy Farm, a spokeswoman for the Coquille Indian Tribe said in an email. Of those other opponents, she said that tribes with casinos were only fighting to preserve their “distinct competitive advantage.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The Biden administration is now facing a ticking clock. If both lawsuits move forward, the legal battles are likely to stretch beyond Inauguration Day, preventing the Biden administration from making a decision on the casinos.</p><p>Ideally, there would be continuity across administrations, Mr. Light said.
