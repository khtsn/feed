His mother, father, older brother and baby sister, along with dozens of other relatives, were all killed in an Israeli airstrike on their home.</p><p>In the months that followed, Khaled tried to be brave, his uncle, Mohammad Faris, recalled. He would comfort his younger brother Tamer, who, like Khaled, had survived the Oct. 22 strike that killed their family. But Tamer, 7, was left badly injured with a broken back and a broken leg, and was in constant pain.</p><p>“He would always quiet his brother when he cried,” Mr. Faris told The New York Times in a recent phone interview. “He would tell him: ‘Mama and Baba are in heaven. Mama and Baba would be sad if they knew we were crying because of them.’”</p></div></div><div><p>At night, when the unrelenting Israeli airstrikes on Gaza would start up again, Khaled would wake up shaking and screaming himself, sometimes running to his uncle to seek comfort.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/17/multimedia/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/17/multimedia/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/17/multimedia/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A man, seen from behind, carries a young child and a bicycle as smoke and fires burn around them." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/17/multimedia/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/17/multimedia/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/17/multimedia/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/17/multimedia/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz/17palestinians-khaled-photoedit-02-vlgz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians fled after an Israeli attack in the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haitham Imad/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Children searched through the rubble of their home after an operation by the Israeli army in central Gaza’s Nuseirat camp in June.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>It was a short and terrifying existence for the young brothers that ended when another airstrike hit the family home where they were sheltering on Jan. 9, killing Khaled, Tamer, their 2-year-old cousin, Nada, and three other relatives, according to two family members.</p><p>Their story epitomizes how the 10-month-old Israeli war in Gaza has taken an exceptional toll on children, who are caught in the middle of the conflict.</p><p>After the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, the Israeli military launched the war with the stated aim of eradicating Hamas, unleashing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-airstrikes.html" title="">one of the heaviest aerial bombardments</a> the world has seen in this century on densely populated Gaza.

Of the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in the war, an estimated 15,000 were under 18, according to Gazan health officials. The United Nations estimates that at least another <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/04/1148596" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">19,000 children</a> have been orphaned. And nearly one million children have been displaced, according to UNICEF, the U.N. children’s agency.</p></div><div><div><p>“Gaza remains the most dangerous place in the world for children,” said Jonathan Crickx, a spokesman for UNICEF.</p><p>Most children are living in overcrowded homes where multiple families shelter together, or in ramshackle tents that can feel like ovens in the summer heat, lacking both running water and sanitation.

Instead, he mostly saw them helping their families: carrying jugs of water from filling stations, trying to find food, and helping to move their few belongings when the family was displaced.</p><p>Mr. Crickx said he had seen a boy on the street who appeared to be no older than about 5, pushing a wheelchair with two jerrycans, which he had filled with water, resting on the seat. The handles of the wheelchair were higher than the top of the boy’s head and he could barely see where he was going.</p><p>“There is no childhood in Gaza,” Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the main U.N. agency that aids Palestinians, UNRWA, <a href="https://x.com/UNWateridge/status/1812892132656460267" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on social media last month. “Malnourished, exhausted. Sleeping in rubble or under plastic sheeting. Same clothing for 9 months. Education has been replaced by fear &amp; loss. Loss of life, home &amp; stability,” she added.</p><p>Throughout the war, parents have gone to extraordinary lengths to try to protect their children.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tents were set up by displaced Palestinians amid the devastation in Khan Younis in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians fled after an evacuation order by the Israeli army to leave parts of Khan Younis on Aug. 11.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>They scrawl their children’s names directly onto their skin to identify them if they are lost, orphaned or killed.
