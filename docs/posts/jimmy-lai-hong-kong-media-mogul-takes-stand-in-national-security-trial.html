Prosecutors in a landmark national security trial have charged him with conspiring and colluding with “foreign forces.” They say he led a campaign to get foreign governments to target Hong Kong and China with sanctions in response to moves by the authorities to crush dissent.</p><p>Mr. Lai, who has pleaded not guilty, faces up to life in prison if convicted.</p><p>Mr. Lai for decades ran a popular newspaper, Apple Daily, that championed pro-democracy voices. The paper, now shuttered, was at the forefront of the 2019 demonstrations, amplifying protest slogans and publishing editorials and cartoons urging people in Hong Kong to join the movement.</p><p>Taking the stand, Mr. Lai said Apple Daily reflected the values of the Hong Kong people when asked by his defense team why he got into the media business.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The more information you have, the more you’re in the know, the more you are free,” Mr. Lai said in a packed courtroom.</p><p>Steven Kwan, his defense attorney, asked Mr. Lai what Apple Daily’s core values were. Mr. Lai responded, “Rule of law, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly.”</p><p>China has accused Mr. Lai of advocating secession. During the trial, Mr. Lai said he did not agree with the Hong Kong and Taiwanese independence movements, describing them as “crazy.” He said none of his staff at Apple Daily would have supported independence in Hong Kong or Taiwan, the self-governed democracy China claims as its territory.</p><p>Mr. Lai’s testimony comes a day after a national security court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/asia/hong-kong-democrats-sentenced.html" title="">handed down prison sentences</a> ranging from just over four years to 10 years for 45 former pro-democracy lawmakers and activists who were the most prominent members of Hong Kong’s political opposition.</p><p>His case has captured worldwide attention as a symbol of Hong Kong’s political transformation since Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020 to bring an end to the social unrest. The authorities have used the law to crack down on rights that had long distinguished Hong Kong from mainland China, such as freedoms of speech and assembly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Prosecutors argued in his trial that Mr. Lai was a “radical political figure” who led a global effort to undermine Beijing’s authority over Hong Kong, a partially autonomous city of more than seven million. Mr. Lai also faces a colonial-era sedition charge over material published in his Apple tabloid.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong in 2019.

Among them is his son Sebastien Lai, who has led an international campaign from overseas to free his father.</p><p>“I know what he is doing is the right thing and I am very proud of him,” said Sebastien Lai, 30. “My father is a very strong person, mentally and spiritually. But he’s been in there for almost four years<em>.</em> It’s completely inhumane.”</p><p>Concern is growing for Mr. Lai’s health given his advanced age. Mr. Lai has diabetes and often spends 23 hours a day living in solitary confinement. The public was given a rare glimpse of Mr. Lai’s life in prison last year when The Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-prodemocracy-china-activist-publisher-jimmy-lai-8e03b4415b10754255487d0b0f7b0097" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published photographs</a> of the media tycoon, accompanied by guards while exercising alone in a small enclosure surrounded by high barbed wire fence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Hong Kong government said in a statement on Sunday that Mr. Lai was receiving “appropriate treatment and care” in custody. It also said that Mr. Lai had asked to be held in solitary confinement.</p><p>Western governments, including the United States and Britain, have condemned Mr. Lai’s arrest and called for his release. President-elect Donald J. Trump said last month in a podcast interview that he would “100 percent” get Mr. Lai out of prison, adding that it would be “easy.”</p><p>Mr. Lai is a British citizen and on Monday, the country’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, raised concerns about the “deterioration” of Mr. Lai’s health while speaking to China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Brazil. Seconds after the exchange, the Chinese delegation ejected journalists from the room where the meeting was being held before Mr. Starmer had finished talking.</p><p>The prosecution’s case relies partly on Mr. Lai’s public statements, some made in online posts and videos, and others made in interviews, appealing to foreign governments to pressure China to live up to its promise to grant Hong Kong greater democracy. That includes meetings Mr. Lai had with then-Vice President Mike Pence and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People waiting to enter the court ahead of Jimmy Lai’s national security trial on Wednesday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chan Long Hei/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>When Mr. Lai was brought into the courtroom and briefly held in a glass enclosure flanked by two officers, he waved at his wife and daughter. He wore a brown blazer and green sweater over a white dress shirt, and spoke in a gravelly voice.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Lai was not always thought of as a political firebrand. For years, he embodied Hong Kong’s rags-to-riches success; an immigrant from the mainland who worked at a factory and later made a fortune founding the clothing brand, Giordano.</p><p>His politics hardened after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown that killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of pro-democracy demonstrators. Shortly after, he turned to publishing by launching Next Magazine in 1990 and Apple Daily in 1995. </p><p>Sebastien Lai has considered the possibility that he may never hear from his father again once the trial ends.</p><p>“The case is very urgent,” he said. “Who knows how much time he has left.”</p><p>Berry Wang<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Pierson covers Chinese foreign policy and China’s economic and cultural engagement with the world.
