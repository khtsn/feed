The president, however, canceled the three-day trip to Italy to coordinate the federal response to raging wildfires in Los Angeles, according to a White House statement.</p><p>Rather than the usual award ceremony, in which the president places the award around the neck of the recipient, Mr. Biden <a href="https://x.com/potus/status/1878181517068836894?s=42" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on X</a> an image from the Oval Office in which a military aide presented the medal. The White House announced the honor after Mr. Biden spoke to Pope Francis on Saturday and informed him of the award.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>It was the first time during Mr. Biden’s term that he had awarded the medal <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47639" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“with distinction,”</a> a more prestigious version of the honor. Mr. Biden received the recognition from President Barack Obama in 2017. Other recipients include Pope John Paul II and Colin L. Powell.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden met with Pope Francis last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Louisa Gouliamaki/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Biden, a Catholic, has seen Pope Francis as an admired ally on the global stage and turned to him as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/us/politics/biden-regrets-reflection.html" title="">a sounding board,</a> and the pope has lobbied for Mr. Biden to use his presidential power during his final weeks in office.</p><p>Last month, Pope Francis called Mr. Biden and asked him to commute the sentences of those on federal death row. Days later, Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/us/politics/biden-commutes-37-death-sentences.html" title="">used his clemency power to soften their sentences</a> to life in prison without the possibility of parole, sparing their lives.</p><p>A citation included in the White House announcement for the award said that Pope Francis was “unlike any who came before.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“His mission of serving the poor has never ceased,” the statement read. “A loving pastor, he joyfully answers children’s questions about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to fight for peace and protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches out to different faiths.”</p><p>Mr. Biden awarded the honor days after bestowing the Presidential Medal of Freedom to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/us/politics/biden-medals-freedom.html" title="">18 leaders of the political, financial and celebrity establishment.</a></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Jan. 11, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated a past pontiff’s name. He was Pope John Paul II, not Jean Paul II. The article also misstated the terms of the clemency that President Biden bestowed to inmates on death row. The inmates remain in prison without the possibility of parole, not on parole for life.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
