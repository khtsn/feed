Folk in Trevethin “feel that the circus has come to town a little bit, that people have come in from outside,” and that Reform’s campaigners have been “upping the temperature,” he said. Certainly the contest has been full of incident.</p><p>David Thomas, a formerly Labour council member who now represents Reform, was the subject of news articles earlier this week after <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/politics/reform-uk-councillor-faces-calls-to-resign-after-degrading-and-misogynistic/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LBC, a radio station, identified him as “DJ Dowster,”</a> reporting that he had posted songs online with misogynistic and offensive lyrics.
