Any wildfires that start could spread rapidly in this region.</p><p>The winds are expected to be strongest and the fire risk highest in an area extending from north Texas across central Oklahoma into southeast Kansas and including a smidgen of Missouri. Wind speeds could top 90 miles per hour in the most extreme cases.</p><p>“A wildfire outbreak is possible in that corridor,” said Harry Weinman, a meteorologist at the Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Storm Prediction Center warned that conditions here would be <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/fwdy2.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“extremely critical,”</a> a rare designation that has been used on three other occasions this month in the southern Plains. It was most recently issued on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/weather/fire-dry-texas-new-mexico.html" title="">Wednesday</a>, but for a smaller area than the one on Friday. It’s typically used only once or twice a year in the southern Plains.</p><p>The agency also warned that isolated dry thunderstorms could bring heightened fire risk to eastern Kansas, northeast Oklahoma, western Missouri and far northwest Arkansas. Dry thunderstorms can generate thunder and lightning but produce little to no rain on the ground. Any lightning strike that hits the ground can easily start a wildfire, especially when it’s windy.</p><p>Separately, the National Weather Service has released fire weather watches and red-flag warnings across the Southwest and the southern Plains. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/weather/what-fire-warnings-mean.html" title="">Fire weather risk levels</a> describe how actively a fire may burn, and an “extremely critical” risk corresponds to weather that can make a fire extremely difficult to contain.)</p><p>The winds could also kick up dust and create conditions similar to those that occurred in early March, when Texas, New Mexico and parts of Mexico were shrouded by a thick curtain of dust.</p><p>“There will likely be a significant amount of blowing dust across the southern Plains tomorrow,” said Evan Bentley, a meteorologist with the Storm Prediction Center. “It’s unknown how much that will impact visibility on roads.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Thursday, Gov.
