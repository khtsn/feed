Older divers fret that they are being aged out and that a world of submerged history is being forgotten.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Returning to East Moriches, N.Y., after exploring the wreck of the S.S.

The waters around New York are regarded as more “hard-core” than somewhere like the Caribbean because of poor visibility, freezing temperatures and strong currents. Over the years, some divers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/12/nyregion/3-divers-lost-at-shipwreck-sites.html" title="">died</a> during or shortly after explorations of wrecks. One wreck, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/search?query=andrea+doria" title="">Andrea Doria</a>, off the coast of Nantucket, Mass., is nicknamed the “Mount Everest of Wreck Diving” because navigating it is so difficult — and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna14007111" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">often deadly</a>.</p></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Big Apple Divers’ annual introductory diving program, experienced divers help train newer, less experienced members.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Divers prepare their equipment for a dive at Willow Springs Park in Pennsylvania.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>Those who are up for the challenge of local wreck diving describe submerging into muddy darkness — a foreboding green netherworld, sometimes so murky that they can’t see their fingers extended in front of them.</p><p>“They’re terrible days, where you just start feeling the dive site more than seeing it,” Mr. Moore said.</p></div></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/13/00ny-diving-video-2-toned-fclv-cover/00ny-diving-video-2-toned-fclv-cover-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/13/00ny-diving-video-2-toned-fclv-cover/00ny-diving-video-2-toned-fclv-cover-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/08/13/122233_1_00ny-diving-video-2-toned-fclv_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Divers from the Big Apple Divers club conduct training dives at Willow Springs Park as part of an introductory diving course, filmed in Super 8.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><div><p>Jozef Koppelman, 66, who went to his first Big Apple Divers meeting when he was a teenager, said local divers have a sort of “selective amnesia”: One gleaming “postcard day” in New York’s waters overwrites nine where nothing could be seen at all.</p><p>“Part of the allure is the idea that it’s not consistent,” he said. “There’s a leap of faith with every trip.”</p><p>But Mr. Koppelman feared that things were changing.

She hosts regular underwater cleanups in Far Rockaway, near Kennedy International Airport in Queens. Divers spot horseshoe crabs, sea robins and vibrant coral colonies. “It’s magical that so much is going on beneath the surface,” she said.</p><p>But city beaches are also peppered with pollutants. Fishing lines trap crabs and other crustaceans. A shopping cart, an A.T.M. and a row of bus seats have even been found in the waters, Ms. Zelek said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“You see the impact of humans living next to the sea in a way that maybe you wouldn’t see in the Caribbean and a protected park,” she said. “It is a good place to remember our connection to the rest of the world.”</p><p>For Dr. Michael Rothschild, 62, a pediatric otolaryngologist and Big Apple Divers’ medical adviser, part of the magic of diving in New York is its equalizing effect. “There’s really no different calculations for nitrogen loading for people who are Democrats or Republicans,” he joked.</p><p>Underwater, where language is reduced to a handful of gestures, social and political barriers dissipate. “Most human beings have very similar wants and needs,” he said, “When you’re diving, everybody’s producing CO₂. Everybody’s using oxygen. Everybody needs to breathe.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>MB</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>8</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Beyond the Shore, There’s a Hidden World<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tragic End to an Instagram-Perfect Hamptons Life: </strong>A couple showed the public a world of glittering parties and vacations. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/nyregion/brandon-miller-suicide-debt.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">The money to sustain it did not exist</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brooklyn’s Great Goldfish Heist: </strong>In Bedford-Stuyvesant, an animal lover thought she was doing the right thing by freeing fish from a sidewalk pit. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/nyregion/goldfish-sidewalk-pond-brooklyn.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">But was it a rescue or a robbery</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Zombie Pharmacies: </strong>Over a million square feet of prime real estate is collecting dust across New York City. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/nyregion/pharmacies-vacant-drugstores-retail.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">It could stay that way for years</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Street Wars: </strong>New York City bus stops without trees or shelter are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/nyregion/street-wars-hot-bus-stops.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">leaving riders sweating</a> as they wait — and wait — for buses that a transportation group says do not come fast enough.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sunday Routine: </strong>Jackie Chang, a subway mosaic artist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/nyregion/jackie-chang-subway-mosaics.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">spends her Sundays</a> designing in her studio, making Taiwanese breakfast and practicing violin.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
