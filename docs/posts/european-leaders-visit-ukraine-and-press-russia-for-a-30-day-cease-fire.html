Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire.</p><p>Hours later, Mr. Putin brushed that demand aside and called instead for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to be held in Turkey.</p><p>Mr. Putin, speaking to reporters in an unusual statement after 1 a.m. on Sunday, said Russia was “prepared for serious negotiations with Ukraine” and “without any preconditions.” He proposed a meeting between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without specifying who would participate in the talks.</p><p>He did not directly address the European call for a 30-day cease-fire, but indicated Russia wouldn’t stop fighting before the negotiations on May 15, if they happen.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“The point is to eliminate the root causes of the conflict,” Mr. Putin said. “We don’t rule out that in the course of these negotiations, it will be possible to reach agreement on some new truces, on a new cease-fire, and a real one at that.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Putin gives a statement at the Kremlin on Sunday, in a photograph released by Russian state media.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain held a news conference with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p><p>“All of us are calling Putin out,” Mr. Starmer said. “If he’s serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it now.”</p><p>Mr. Starmer said the European effort, which calls for a truce to begin on Monday, had been coordinated closely with the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A senior U.S. official, speaking on background because of a lack of authorization to discuss the negotiations, said that President Trump had been in touch with European leaders throughout the week, in the lead-up to the announcement in Kyiv, and that he signaled to Mr. Starmer and Mr. Macron on Saturday morning that he supported their proposal for sanctions absent a cease-fire by Monday.</p><p>Mr. Trump is also not opposed to having the United States help monitor a cease-fire, but did not make firm commitments about what that would entail or require, the official said. White House officials stressed that Mr. Trump has left sanctions on the table repeatedly, including in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114474136794655068" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent Truth Social post</a>.</p><p>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-trump-peace-talks.html" title="">proposed the 30-day cease-fire</a>, to which Kyiv agreed, during talks this spring in Saudi Arabia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland and Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, calling the American president, Donald Trump, from Kyiv, Ukraine, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mstyslav Chernov/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The competing proposals from Kyiv and Moscow are the latest instance in which both Russia and Ukraine have sought to position themselves as seeking peace amid Mr. Trump’s efforts to end the war. Ukraine first agreed to a 30-day cease-fire in March, but Mr. Putin did not, instead setting onerous conditions such as a halt to Western military aid to Kyiv.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In recent weeks, Mr. Putin has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/world/europe/russia-ukraine-putin-zelensky.html" title="">repeatedly called for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine</a>, though Sunday’s comments were his most extensive on the matter. Ukraine has also said it is ready for negotiations, but no direct talks have taken place, as far as is known.</p><p>The last time that Ukraine and Russia publicly engaged in peace talks was in Istanbul in March 2022. Mr. Putin said Sunday that the proposed May 15 meeting could serve as a continuation of those Istanbul talks three years ago, in which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/15/world/europe/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-deal.html" title="">Russia sought to limit the size of Ukraine’s military</a> in addition to banning the country from ever joining NATO.</p><p>Earlier Saturday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, released a photograph of the five leaders huddled around a phone. Mr. Sybiha said they were talking with Mr. Trump.</p><p>“Ukraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on Monday,” Mr. Sybiha <a href="https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1921151272842830061" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>. “If Russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured, a durable ceasefire and confidence-building measures can pave the way to peace negotiations.”</p><p>Before the European leaders gave their news conference, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, dismissed the threat of new sanctions, telling <a href="https://ura.news/news/1052931170" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Russian broadcaster Rossiya-1</a> that the country was “accustomed to such pressure measures and knows how to minimize their consequences.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He had earlier said that Russia remained opposed to any cease-fire unless Western nations stopped providing military aid to Ukraine, according to the Russian news agency Tass.</p><p>The visit of the European leaders to Kyiv — which began with a solemn tribute to the thousands of Ukrainian soldiers killed in battle, as the men laid flowers at a makeshift memorial — came one day after Russia’s celebration of the 80th anniversary of the allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. At that celebration, Mr. Putin welcomed President Xi Jinping of China and other foreign dignitaries to Moscow for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/russia-victory-day-parade-red-square.html" title="">military parade</a> meant to project Russia’s power and Mr. Putin’s bid to reshape the global order on his terms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Vladimir V.

In only a few months, Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/world/europe/100-days-trump-us-foreign-policy.html" title="">reversed core tenets of U.S. foreign policy</a>, and is presiding over the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/europe-ve-day-trump.html" title="">weakening of the trans-Atlantic bond</a> that helped set Europe on the path to peace after the cataclysm of World War II.</p><p>At the moment, Ukraine is caught between an emboldened Russia, buoyed by China, North Korea and Iran, and a Europe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/world/europe/trump-europe-tariffs-defense.html" title="">struggling to fill the void</a> left by the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>It has been more than 120 days since the United States announced a new round of military assistance to Ukraine. It remains unclear if the Trump administration plans to spend the remaining $3.85 billion that Congress has authorized for additional withdrawals from the Defense Department’s stockpiles.</p><p>Ukraine is racing to build up its domestic arms production and its European allies have increased their military assistance. Even if Russia agrees to a cease-fire, Ukraine and its allies believe that the only way to ensure a lasting peace is through military strength.</p><p>But the coming weeks will test whether European resolve and resources can match the scale of the challenge as the war’s outcome increasingly becomes Europe’s problem to solve.</p><p>Most of the pressure Washington has brought to bear to end the fighting has been directed at Kyiv, though Mr. Trump has recently shown <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/russia-trump-putin-ukraine.html" title="">flashes of frustration</a> with Moscow.</p><p>Daniel Fried, a former top U.S. diplomat and fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said there was hope that the American and European policies on Ukraine are converging, but many tests remained.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“The moment of truth” will come, he said, if Mr. Putin refuses the 30-day cease-fire. And then, if there is a cease-fire, he said, the next test may come if Russia violates the truce.</p><p>“What, then, will be the U.S. response?” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian forces firing at Russian positions in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine in March.
