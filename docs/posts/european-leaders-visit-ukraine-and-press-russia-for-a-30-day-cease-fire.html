Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire.</p><p>“All of us are calling Putin out,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain said at a news conference in Kyiv, the capital, with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. “If he’s serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it now.”</p><p>Mr. Starmer said the European effort, which calls for a truce to begin on Monday, had been coordinated closely with the White House.</p><p>A senior U.S. official, speaking on background because of a lack of authorization to discuss the negotiations, said that President Trump had been in touch with European leaders throughout the week, in the lead-up to the announcement in Kyiv, and that he signaled to Mr. Starmer and Mr. Macron on Saturday morning that he supported their proposal for sanctions absent a ceasefire by Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump is also not opposed to having the United States help monitor a ceasefire, but did not make firm commitments about what that would entail or require, the official said. White House officials stressed that Mr. Trump has left sanctions on the table repeatedly, including in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114474136794655068" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent Truth Social post</a>.</p><p>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-trump-peace-talks.html" title="">proposed the 30-day cease-fire</a>, to which Kyiv agreed, during talks this spring in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Earlier in the day on Saturday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, released a photograph of the five leaders huddled around a phone. Mr. Sybiha said they were talking with Mr. Trump.</p><p>“Ukraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on Monday,” Mr. Sybiha <a href="https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1921151272842830061" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>. “If Russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured, a durable ceasefire and confidence-building measures can pave the way to peace negotiations.”</p><p>Before the European leaders gave their news conference, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, dismissed the threat of new sanctions, telling <a href="https://ura.news/news/1052931170" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Russian broadcaster Rossiya-1</a> that the country was “accustomed to such pressure measures and knows how to minimize their consequences.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>He had earlier said that Russia remained opposed to any cease-fire unless Western nations stopped providing military aid to Ukraine, according to the Russian news agency Tass.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Vladimir V.

At that celebration, Mr. Putin welcomed President Xi Jinping of China and other foreign dignitaries to Moscow for a military parade meant to project Russia’s power and Mr. Putin’s bid to reshape the global order on his terms.</p><p>The two events crystallized both the changing contours of the war in Ukraine and the broader geopolitical shift underway since Mr. Trump entered office. In only a few months, Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/world/europe/100-days-trump-us-foreign-policy.html" title="">reversed core tenets of U.S. foreign policy</a>, and is presiding over the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/europe-ve-day-trump.html" title="">weakening of the trans-Atlantic bond</a> that helped set Europe on the path to peace after the cataclysm of World War II.</p><p>At the moment, Ukraine is caught between an emboldened Russia, buoyed by China, North Korea and Iran, and a Europe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/world/europe/trump-europe-tariffs-defense.html" title="">scrambling to fill the void</a> left by the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It has been more than 120 days since the United States announced a new round of military assistance to Ukraine. It remains unclear if the Trump administration plans to spend the remaining $3.85 billion that Congress has authorized for additional withdrawals from the Defense Department’s stockpiles.</p><p>Ukraine is racing to build up its domestic arms production and its European allies have increased their military assistance. Even if Russia agrees to a cease-fire, Ukraine and its allies believe that the only way to ensure a lasting peace is through military strength.</p><p>But the coming weeks will test whether European resolve and resources can match the scale of the challenge as the war’s outcome increasingly becomes Europe’s problem to solve.</p><p>Most of the pressure Washington has brought to bear to end the fighting has been directed at Kyiv, though Mr. Trump has recently shown <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/russia-trump-putin-ukraine.html" title="">flashes of frustration</a> with Moscow.</p><p>Daniel Fried, a former top U.S. diplomat and fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said there was hope that the American and European policies on Ukraine are converging but many tests remained.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The moment of truth” will come, he said, if Mr. Putin refuses the 30-day cease-fire. And then, if there is a cease-fire, he said, the next test may come if Russia violates the truce.</p><p>“What, then, will be the U.S. response?” he said.</p><p>Maggie Haberman<!-- --> contributed reporting from New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian forces firing at Russian positions in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine in March.
