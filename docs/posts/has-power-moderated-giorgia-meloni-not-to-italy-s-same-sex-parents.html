The fathers-to-be cooed as she told them she was playing fairy tales close to her belly that they had recorded for their future daughter. “And she is kicking!” she said.</p><p>But the men, both civil servants, said they had not dared to share their excitement with almost anyone around them. They did not talk about the pregnancy with many friends, colleagues or neighbors or post about it on social media. They asked to remain anonymous for this article.</p><p>They have reason for caution. Surrogacy is already illegal if conducted in Italy. But the government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni wants to expand the prohibition. It has promoted a bill that would also punish Italians who make use of surrogacy even in places abroad where it is legal, like in parts of the United States. Those Italians who do could face up to two years in prison and be fined the equivalent of about a million dollars.</p><p>Italy’s lower chamber of Parliament approved the bill last summer, and the Senate’s justice committee greenlighted it last month. The Senate is expected to vote on it as soon as the fall.</p></div></div><div><div><p>On the international stage, Ms. Meloni has presented herself as a pragmatic partner for mainstream European leaders and aligned herself with Western democracies on the issues that matter to them, like support of Ukraine.</p><p>But at home, Ms. Meloni has asserted her conservative credentials on cultural issues such as abortion, gender, gay rights and surrogacy.</p><p>“No one can convince me that it is an act of freedom to rent one’s womb,” she said in the spring at an event in Rome. “No one can convince me that it is an act of love to consider children as an over-the-counter product in a supermarket.”</p><p>“Uterus renting is a shameful, inhuman practice,” she said. “It will become a universal crime.”</p><p>While Ms. Meloni’s stance may reflect her own deeply held convictions, analysts say such rhetoric also serves to please the right-wing base of her Brothers of Italy party. Polls show that her party’s voters are disproportionately more opposed to surrogacy and adoption by gay couples than the general population is.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy with the prime ministers of Britain, left, and Albania last month at a European Political Community meeting in England.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hollie Adams/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>“On the economy and foreign policy, she took completely mainstream positions,” said Roberto D’Alimonte, a political scientist at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. “And she compensates her mainstream positions with the fact that she still uses an old-right rhetoric on things that don’t matter to define her international profile.”</p></div><div><div><p>Issues like surrogacy and same-sex parenthood “still define her as a right-wing person sensitive to traditional values,” Mr. D’Alimonte said. “And she exploits this when she can.”</p><p>Many of those positions — for instance, against gay parenthood and favoring abortion prevention rather than access — place Ms. Meloni in much the same ranks as other social conservatives and the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p>But her Italian critics say that by pressing for further restrictions on gay families in a country that already <a href="https://rainbowmap.ilga-europe.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ranks near last in Europe</a> when it comes to such civil liberties, Ms. Meloni has taken a particularly hard line.</p><p>Her moves on the cultural front have often been subtle, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/world/europe/italy-abortion-law-meloni.html" title="">like her tinkering with Italy’s abortion law</a>. When it comes to surrogacy, many feminists also oppose it, and other European countries also outlaw it, though it is allowed in some, like Britain or Greece, under certain conditions.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But analysts and opponents say Italy’s proposed new law is especially perplexing because it is tailored to penalize a relatively small number of Italians and is so far-reaching that some experts are skeptical it could withstand legal challenges.</p><p>“It’s pure propaganda,” said Susanna Lollini, a lawyer for L.G.B.T.Q. families, “but it’s spreading absolute panic.”</p><p>Most Italian couples who use surrogacy are believed to be heterosexual, and they could also be affected by the proposed new law. But because same-sex couples need a third party to have children, many gay Italians feel that the change in the law would leave them vulnerable to special scrutiny. Also, adoption is allowed only for heterosexual couples, leaving gay Italians with few options.</p><p>“I can’t tell I am about to become a father,” one of the future fathers said. The other added, “We can’t tell our story, because my government is persecuting me and my family.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I can’t tell I am about to become a father,” one of the future fathers said.
