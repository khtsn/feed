From young professionals to medical residents to longtime visitors whose visas had lapsed, Haitians are bracing for the consequences of having a lifeline abruptly cut.</p><p>With its proximity to Florida, a long (often difficult) history with the United States, and grave political and social upheaval, Haiti has strong family and economic ties with its northern neighbor. People have businesses in both countries, and most middle-class Haitians have close relatives in South Florida or New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Little Haiti neighborhood in Miami.

She is unemployed, was forced to flee her home in Port-au-Prince, the capital, because of gang violence, and, with most hospitals in the capital closed, is out of any other options for her heart problem.</p><p>In announcing the ban, Mr. Trump said that he had decided to “fully restrict” people from Haiti because visitors from there overstayed their visas at least 25 percent of the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I cannot be mad at Donald Trump; he is building his country, and he has the right to do it the way he wants,” she said in a telephone interview. “I believe we have to fix our own country.”</p><p>Haiti is engulfed in an extraordinary political, humanitarian and security crisis. Its last elected president was assassinated nearly four years ago and the resulting power vacuum created an opening for gangs, long supported by the country’s political and economic elite, to thrive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tires burning during a protest against gang violence in Port-au-Prince in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fildor Pq Egeder/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The armed groups joined forces last year in an explosion of violence that forced more than 1 million people from their homes and killed more than 5,000 people last year.</p><p>The Trump administration recently declared the gangs terrorist organizations, a designation that helped land Haiti on the list of banned nations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Trump administration also rescinded an immigration designation known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/haitians-temporary-protected-status.html" title="">temporary protected status</a> that shielded more than 500,000 Haitians from deportation and revoked a program that had allowed more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/migrants-deportation-supreme-court-trump.html" title="">200,000 Haitians</a> to move to the United States.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s proclamation said the secretary of state could issue travel waivers in cases that were in the “national interest” of the United States. Asked to clarify if that could apply to children with medical conditions,<span>  </span>the U.S. Department of Homeland Security offered a statement that did not answer the question.</p><p>“President Trump’s action to limit the entry of foreign nationals from countries who have a significant terrorist presence, inadequate screening and vetting processes, and high visa overstay rates will help secure the American homeland and make our communities safer,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.</p><p>The State Department said in a statement that there could be case-by-case waivers but added that it would not “get into hypotheticals or specific cases about application” of the president’s order.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>In some ways, Haiti was already under a de facto travel ban: The main international airport in Port-au-Prince has been closed since November after gangs fired at several U.S. aircraft.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Internally displaced people, forced from their homes because of gang violence, living at a former school in Port-au-Prince, in September.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>With the main airport closed, the U.S. embassy on limited staffing, and roads to another airport too dangerous, travelers have had to spend thousands of dollars to first go by helicopter to Cap Haitien, in northern Haiti, and then fly to Barbados, Jamaica or other countries with functioning U.S. embassies to obtain or renew the visas they need to enter the United States.</p><p>The onerous and expensive journey means many Haitians have visas that have now expired.</p><p>That has left families and businesspeople with tough choices, said Pierre A. Noel, executive director of the Haiti Development Institute, a Boston-based nonprofit.</p><p>Many Haitian professionals who have remained in Haiti through the turmoil had sent their children to safety in the United States and now risk long separations, he said. With graduation season in full swing, Haitian parents are at a loss about what to do.</p><p>People working in Haiti and currently traveling in the United States are having to make decisions now on whether they should go back home and when, he said. “And if they do go back, when would they next be able to see their family,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>People with businesses that rely on unencumbered travel between the United States and Haiti are deciding whether to keep their companies afloat and retain their workers, he said.</p><p>Several Haitians interviewed expressed disappointment at the United States for, among other things, the well-known flow of illicit guns from Florida to Haitian gangs.</p><p>Still, many people also stressed that the travel ban underscores the need to strengthen the interim government ruling Haiti until a new presidential election can be held.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A police officer in Port-au-Prince during a clash with gangs in February.
