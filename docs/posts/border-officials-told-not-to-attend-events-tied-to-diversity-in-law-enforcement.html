Mr. Quinn worked at the agency for nearly 12 years until he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tim-quinn-31aa934b_friday-was-my-last-day-at-us-customs-and-activity-7334965621496975360-WjEv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAue0scBgjtzioozQCkahup9TZ38_2UiP2A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">retired on Friday as a result of the policy</a>.</p><p>In an interview on Monday, Mr. Quinn said the directive was included in a broader travel advisory issued on March 28 to senior officials at the agency, who were then expected to pass along the instruction to the rank and file. The memo, which invoked President Trump’s executive order banning diversity practices across the federal government, barred attendance at events or conferences “that have a gender basis, race basis or a culture basis,” Mr. Quinn said.</p><p>“I think that’s discrimination,” said Mr. Quinn, the former head of Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Intergovernmental Public Liaison. “I don’t understand why we wouldn’t engage with these organizations to share this kind of information.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection, said the agency’s “personnel are free to participate in outside groups on their own time.”</p><p>“However, C.B.P. will not use taxpayer dollars and official duty hours to fund identity-based events or programs,” Ms. McLaughlin said. “As a federal law enforcement agency, our focus is on the mission.”</p><p>The directive to an agency at the center of Mr. Trump’s favorite policy — immigration — is another effort by the administration to purge anything resembling steps for ensuring a more diverse work force.</p><p>In its rolling back of diversity efforts, the administration has sought to reshape the landscape of education, business, and federal and local government. The administration has shuttered diversity and inclusion initiatives in the federal government, and opened investigations into diversity efforts at schools and universities, as well as the city of Chicago to see whether its mayor, who is Black, engaged in a pattern of discrimination by hiring a number of Black people for senior positions. Mr. Trump has threatened companies that put a focus on diversity in their hiring practices.</p><p>Now, the administration is restricting a homeland security agency from meeting with organizations that aim to ensure a diverse work force and also develop professional training for law enforcement officers of all backgrounds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Prohibiting federal government agencies from engaging with policing groups because of race, gender, and culture is wrong, discriminatory, and makes America less safe,” Mr. Quinn said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7334965621496975360/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a social media statement announcing his retirement</a>. “This shortsighted and harmful ban should be reversed.”</p><p>Col. Jeffrey Glover, the director of the Arizona Department of Public Safety and the president of NOBLE, which has many white officers as members, said the administration’s prohibition on attending his organization’s events was “disappointing.”</p><p>“We are not D.E.I. organizations — we are law enforcement organizations,” Mr. Glover said. “It’s shortsighted but it does sort of lay out in a way a layer of discrimination against organizations that are there to support your staff and personnel so they can advance in their career field.”</p><p>With more than 60,000 employees, Customs and Border Protection is one of the world’s largest law enforcement organizations. It oversees the Border Patrol, Air and Marine Operations, and customs officers.</p><p>It is unclear whether other federal law enforcement agencies have received a similar directive. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether it had also directed federal agents not to attend events hosted by organizations that focus on minority groups in law enforcement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Former Customs and Border Protection officials said that collaborating with the different organizations was not only an opportunity to help improve the diversity in the rank and file of federal law enforcement, but it was also a means for getting a broad perspective on the best way to ensure public safety for a range of communities.</p><p>The events hosted by those organizations provided an opportunity to hear from Black, Latino and female law enforcement chiefs about the challenges they faced in their careers, said Gil Kerlikowske, a commissioner for Customs and Border Protection during the Obama administration.</p><p>Mr. Quinn said the memo also banned attendance at events hosted by the National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, Women in Aviation International, Blacks in Government and Federally Employed Women. But those were just some examples; Mr. Quinn said he interpreted the directive to mean officers were prohibited from attending events hosted by organizations supporting minority groups or women.</p><p>Mr. Kerlikowske said the Trump administration had sent a “very clear” message to law enforcement.</p><p>“Which is we’re more than willing to work with white male associations,” Mr. Kerlikowske said. “And we’re not willing to recognize the differences and challenges that people who are not white males have in commanding departments and being in leadership positions.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.</p></div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
