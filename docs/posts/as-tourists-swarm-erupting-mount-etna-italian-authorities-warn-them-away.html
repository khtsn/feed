She also cited the danger that occurs when hot lava meets frigid snow.</p><p>“In some deeper spots, this can cause an immediate (and literally EXPLOSIVE) evaporation of the snow, resulting in the projection of hot stones, like bullets everywhere,” she said. “Events like these can take even experts by surprise.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People hiking last week on Mount Etna.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Giuseppe Di Stefano/Etna Walk, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Stefano Branca, the director of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, called the activity a “typical summit eruption.” He added, “Only people who come within a few meters from the lava flow can be in danger as the heat of the lavas can cause small hydromagmatic explosions caused by the rapid melting of the snow.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Emergency services have had to traverse the crowded roads in recent days.
