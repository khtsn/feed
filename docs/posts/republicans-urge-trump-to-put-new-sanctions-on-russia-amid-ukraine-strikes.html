But it has been building for weeks as Senate Republicans and Democrats alike have signed on to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1241/text?s=1&amp;r=2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legislation that would impose sweeping sanctions on Moscow</a>. The bill now has 80 cosponsors, more than enough to override a veto in that chamber.</p><p>The same measure in the House has garnered little backing in either party, making a showdown with Mr. Trump on the issue unlikely, at least in the short term. But the movement in the Senate suggests an increasingly hawkish mood on Capitol Hill and a growing frustration with Russia’s intransigence among Republicans, who are ramping up their calls for decisive action.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of Mr. Trump’s, is leading the bipartisan push on the Russia sanctions bill, along with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. Last week, speaking from the Senate floor, Mr. Graham appeared to be aiming his remarks directly at the president in a bid to persuade him that any influence he may imagine he has over President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia does not appear to be having much impact.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Putin, in my view, is playing us all,” Mr. Graham warned. He laid out missed opportunities for diplomacy that he said proved Russia was not serious about peace. “President Trump called for a 30-day cease-fire. Ukraine said yes; Russia said no,” he said. “President Trump urged Zelensky and Putin to go to Istanbul — I was over there — and meet to have direct talks. Zelensky went; Putin didn’t.”</p><p>“We’ve given Russia plenty of opportunity to find an honorable and just end to this war,” Mr. Graham continued. “They’re not interested. And they’re not going to change until we up the ante. So we need moral clarity here. Putin is dragging this out.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has in recent days hinted at a change in posture. After Russia’s latest assault, he told reporters that he was “not happy” with Mr. Putin and was “considering more sanctions.” In a social media post on Tuesday, Mr. Trump accused the Russian president of “playing with fire,” saying that if it were not for Mr. Trump, “lots of really bad things would have already happened in Russia.” That prompted a bellicose response from one Russian official.</p><p>“I only know of one REALLY BAD thing — WWIII,” Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Kremlin’s security council, wrote in a social media post. “I hope Trump understands this!”</p><p>But it was not clear whether Mr. Trump’s heated rhetoric indicated any change in his broader view that it is time for the United States to wash its hands of involvement in the conflict in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has signaled a desire to move beyond the war, musing about a potential economic partnership with Russia after a peace deal. A White House adviser recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> that additional sanctions could hinder business opportunities, adding that the president instead wants to focus on maximizing economic opportunities with the Kremlin.</p><p>The White House did not reply on Tuesday to requests for an update on Mr. Trump’s stance on sanctions against Russia, and did not say whether he backed the Senate measure or was willing to send more aid or weapons to Ukraine.</p><p>In response to questions about Mr. Graham’s bill, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a statement: “The Russia-Ukraine war is Joe Biden’s fault, and President Trump has been clear he wants to see a negotiated peace deal. President Trump has also smartly kept all options on the table.”</p><p>So far, though, Mr. Trump’s desire to look past the current state of the war stands in stark contrast to the views of many Republicans in Congress, who maintain their party’s longstanding view of Russia as a bitter adversary that deserves to be treated as such.</p><p>In a social media post on Monday, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa declared that he had seen enough of Mr. Putin killing innocent civilians and publicly urged Mr. Trump to “take action,” urging him to consider “AT LEAST SANCTIONS.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Grassley wrote on social media that he thought Mr. Trump had been sincere in thinking his friendship with Mr. Putin would bring an end to the war, but that “ITS TIME FOR SANCTIONS STRONG ENUF SO PUTIN KNOWS ‘game over.’” And he suggested that Mr. Trump should be at least as harsh in trying to cut off Mr. Putin from the world financial system as he has been in seeking to cut off Harvard University from federal funds.</p><p>“Sanctions for Putin like no fed grants for Harvard,” he wrote in his post.</p><p>Even before the latest assault, other Republicans had called for a tougher stance against Mr. Putin.</p><p>“Obviously, he’s not been serious about the negotiations,” Senator John Cornyn of Texas said last week when discussing the Russian president’s reluctance to engage in peace talks. Mr. Cornyn praised Mr. Trump’s efforts to bring both countries to the table for negotiations, but said the Russian president would first “have to get serious.”</p><p>Both senators, like many Republicans on Capitol Hill, have tried to maintain deference to Mr. Trump’s leadership.</p><p>In an opinion essay published in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday morning, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-u-s-senate-wont-tolerate-putins-games-vladimir-russia-war-ukraine-sanctions-16780c2f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Graham wrote</a>: “President Trump has asked Vladimir Putin to provide a term sheet outlining the requirements for a cease-fire, bringing the roadblocks to peace to a head. Depending on how Russia responds, we will know which course to take.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But some in the party believe Russia’s weekend assault was the response — just not the one they were hoping for.</p><p>“I think we need to put the hurt on Putin,” Senator Todd Young of Indiana said bluntly when asked about the sanctions package.</p><p>Some proponents of ratcheting up the pressure on Mr. Putin regard Mr. Graham’s moves as complementing Mr. Trump’s strategy, not running counter to it. With a supermajority in the Senate backing sanctions, the president may have a stronger hand to play the good cop as Congress positions itself as the bad.</p><p>“You have to believe Lindsey Graham is in close touch with the White House on this and he wouldn’t be moving forward without tacit approval,” said William B. Taylor Jr., who served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009.</p><p>So far, however, Mr. Trump has not followed through on his occasional threats against Mr. Putin.</p><p>“This is not the first time he’s expressed frustration, irritation, he’s pissed off, Putin’s crazy — all those things — and threats to impose sanctions without actually following through,” Mr. Taylor said. “The threats to do that, unless followed up by action, indicate that he’s not resolved to do this.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>6</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>G.O.P.
