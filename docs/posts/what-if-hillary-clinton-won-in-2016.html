How do you think the founding mothers would feel if they heard the news?”</p><p>So began an essay by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gail-collins" title="">Gail Collins</a> for a special section of The New York Times that was to have been published Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016, two days after the election. Under the rubric “Shattering the Ceiling,” the 16-page section was a celebration of what Ms. Collins called the “amazing moment” in which a woman had been elected president.</p><p>Had all gone according to the editors’ preparations, the banner headline on Page A1 the previous day would have been “Madam President.” Times journalists were so persuaded of Mrs. Clinton’s impending victory that they were already writing as if it had happened.</p><p>It’s common for news organizations to prepare anticipatory coverage before major events. Even when events turn out much differently than expected, advance material offers a valuable glimpse into the editing process.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In 2016, no special section was readied in case Donald J.

(And never would be.) Images were in place on the inside pages, but the actual headlines weren’t yet written.</p><p>The articles were set. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/susan-dominus" title="">Susan Dominus</a> described the arc of Mrs. Clinton’s career. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/susan-chira" title="">Susan Chira</a> discussed the effects of a Clinton presidency on feminism. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-confessore" title="">Nicholas Confessore</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/megan-twohey" title="">Megan Twohey</a> wrote about the importance of political fund-raising among women. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/vanessa-friedman" title="">Vanessa Friedman</a> decoded the messages conveyed by a president’s choice of clothing. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julie-hirschfeld-davis" title="">Julie Hirschfeld Davis</a> wondered what America would call the <em>husband</em> of a president. (“First gentleman? First mate? First dude?”) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/amy-chozick" title="">Amy Chozick</a> untangled the relationship between Hillary and Bill Clinton. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jodi-kantor" title="">Jodi Kantor</a> asked whether Mrs. Clinton’s presidency would transform the lives of American women. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jennifer-szalai" title="">Jennifer Szalai</a> prepared a bibliography. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-cain-miller" title="">Claire Cain Miller</a> speculated about the style of governing that a woman would bring to the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pages within the special section that was set to be printed if Hillary Clinton had won.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sonny Figueroa/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In the end, “Trump Triumphs” replaced “Madam President” as the banner headline, and the special section was shelved. Times newsroom executives said last week that they were unable to discuss publicly whether they might recycle either headline in November, or reuse any material from “Shattering the Ceiling” if Kamala Harris wins. But it’s a safe bet that they are preparing for two possible outcomes. Not one.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>David W.
