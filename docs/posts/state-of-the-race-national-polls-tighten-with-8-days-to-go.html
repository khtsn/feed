Trump in the national polls is starting to get very slim.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Overall, she leads by less than one percentage point, according to The New York Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">polling average</a>. It’s her smallest lead since mid-August.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Even so, last week’s polls did offer a silver lining for her: The state polls didn’t seem to lurch toward Mr. Trump, even as the national polling did.</p><p>The battleground states remain extraordinarily tight, with no candidate holding any material lead in the seven states likeliest to decide the presidency. In a sense, that’s not surprising. What’s interesting is that Ms. Harris remains competitive in the battlegrounds even though her national lead has dwindled.</p><p>Usually, a tied national vote would not augur well for Democrats. In his first two races, Mr. Trump did much better in the battleground states than nationally, allowing him to defeat Hillary Clinton without winning the national popular vote and almost doing the same against Joe Biden.</p><p>In 2020, he lost the national popular vote by 4.5 points, but he lost the core seven battleground states by an average of only 0.9 points — a difference of more than three points.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the current polling averages, the gap between the national polls and the battleground average has fallen beneath one point.</p><p>The possibility that Mr. Trump’s Electoral College advantage might <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/upshot/trump-electoral-college-harris.html" title="">fade a bit</a> this November isn’t necessarily a surprise. Over the last few years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/11/upshot/electoral-college-trump-2024.html" title="">there have been</a> a lot of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/upshot/poll-trump-harris-election.html" title="">signs of it,</a> from the midterm results to the demographic patterns in national polls.</p><p>Still, these theories don’t necessarily explain why the polls have appeared to trend in different directions over the last few weeks.</p><h3 id="link-5f06f008"><span><strong>Two polling stories</strong></span></h3><p>There were nine national surveys from “select pollsters” (which means they meet certain criteria for reliability) released <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html#the-latest-harris-vs-trump-polls" title="">this past week</a>, and they couldn’t have shown a closer race. Three showed a tie, including the Times/Siena College <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/poll-harris-trump-times-siena.html" title="">poll</a>, and three showed Ms. Harris ahead. Her best, an ABC News/Ipsos survey, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-regains-slight-lead-nationally-electoral-college-holds/story?id=115083875&amp;mc_cid=b10c360678&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> her up by four points.</p><p>On the other hand, three of the polls showed Mr. Trump ahead — his best, the Wall Street Journal poll, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-leads-harris-wsj-poll-779f8516?mod=e2twp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> him up by three points.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>If you just take the simple average of those nine polls, you find Ms. Harris ahead by less than a point. The math behind the Times polling average is fancier than that, but it gives you the same answer.</p><p>In nearly every case, the national polls this past week showed Mr. Trump gaining compared with the last survey by the same firm.</p><p>In state polling, meanwhile, Marist showed a close race in Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona — ranging from a <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/marist-georgia-poll-u-s-presidential-contest-in-georgia-october-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tied race</a> in Georgia to a two-point Trump lead in North Carolina. In each of the three, the polls were close to the Times average and similar to the prior Marist polls of the same state.</p><p>The latest polls in the Northern battlegrounds stayed close as well. Quinnipiac <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3915" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> the race tied in Wisconsin, with Ms. Harris <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3915" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ahead</a> by four points in Michigan. Importantly, the two results were quite a bit better for her than the last Quinnipiac poll, which showed Mr. Trump ahead in both states.</p><h3 id="link-3a14eff7"><span><strong>Why has Harris stayed resilient in the battlegrounds?</strong></span></h3><p>One possibility is that she hasn’t. There were a lot of high-quality national polls last week from many different pollsters, but there weren’t many state polls — and most of the state polls came from just two firms. We expect many pollsters’ final state polls over the final stretch; perhaps they will belatedly show a shift toward Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Another possibility is that her resilience is the result of the intense campaign in the battlegrounds. Millions of dollars are being spent on advertisements there as the candidates barnstorm this small group of states. The rest of the country is not experiencing this barrage, and it’s possible that has contributed to the relative stability of the race there.</p><p>There’s a final possibility: One set of polls — the national polls or the state polls — could simply be more accurate than the other. Maybe Ms. Harris will ultimately win by a fairly comfortable margin nationwide, or, alternately, Mr. Trump could win easily in the battlegrounds. It certainly wouldn’t be the first time that the battleground state polls underestimated Mr. Trump.</p><h3 id="link-726d8894"><span>What if the polls are wrong?</span></h3><p>There is precedent for the state and national polls to err in different directions.</p><p>In 2012, the national polls underestimated Barack Obama, but were right about his clear lead in Ohio — and therefore in the Electoral College.</p><p>The story was flipped around in 2016 and in the 2022 midterms. In those two elections, the national polls were pretty good, while the core battleground state polls were off. And interestingly, they were off in different directions: In 2016, the battleground state polls badly underestimated Mr. Trump, while the polls of key states for Senate races underestimated Democrats in 2022.</p><p>If the polls err as they did in 2020 or 2022, the outcome could look completely different.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-12"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="poll-charts-polls-table-oct-27-rlmgr0" data-id="100000009786333" data-source-id="100000009786333"><div data-sourceid="100000009786333" id="embed-id-100000009786333">

It’s a long shot, but the answer might still be “yes,” according to this morning’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/nebraska-texas-senate-races.html" title="">latest Times/Siena polls</a> in Texas and Nebraska.</p><p>Republicans led both contests, but not by much.</p><p>Ted Cruz, the Republican incumbent, led the Democrat Colin Allred by four points in the Texas Senate race — same as the four-point lead Mr. Cruz held in our poll earlier this month.</p><p>In Nebraska, the Republican incumbent, Deb Fischer, led the independent candidate Dan Osborn by two points in the surprisingly competitive Senate race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Sweeping these two seats would most likely give Republicans Senate control, and while Republicans are ahead in each poll, neither lead is especially solid.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>Let’s start with Texas.</p><p>The Times/Siena poll found Mr. Trump leading Ms. Harris by 10 points — one of Mr. Trump’s largest leads in a Texas poll this cycle, up from seven points in the last Times/Siena poll. There are two basic possibilities here: One is that Mr. Trump is gaining, as he is nationwide, and this will help get Mr. Cruz over the finish line. The other possibility is that the poll is a bit favorable for Republicans, in which case Mr. Cruz’s lead could quickly start to look a little dicey.</p><p>Then there’s Nebraska. Needless to say, a race between a Republican and an independent is a lot more uncertain than a traditional partisan contest. The independent, Mr. Osborn, has a run a strong campaign — if you don’t believe me, watch an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZNycoL5ELM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ad</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7K23QTe5So" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two</a>.</p><p>Importantly, the race isn’t close merely because there a lot of Republican undecided voters, as I would have guessed before the poll: Only 4 percent of Republican-leaning voters are undecided, compared with 4 percent of Democratic-leaning voters. It’s not inevitable that the race will break toward Ms. Fischer as undecided voters make up their minds.</p><p>Mr. Osborn also led among all registered voters, even as he trailed with the likely electorate. Nebraska is not a state that’s accustomed to having a close race — at least outside of Nebraska’s Second Congressional District, where Ms. Harris held a commanding 12-point lead in our poll and where a potentially pivotal Electoral College vote is at stake.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nate Cohn is The Times’s chief political analyst.
