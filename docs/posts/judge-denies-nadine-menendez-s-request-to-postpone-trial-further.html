Stein, was apparently unpersuaded by her lawyer’s argument that Ms. Menendez, 57, would be unable to effectively participate in her own criminal defense while she is treated for breast cancer.</p><p>Judge Stein, of Federal District Court, said her trial would start, as planned, on Jan. 21 — eight days before her husband, Robert Menendez, and two of her onetime close friends are expected to be sentenced for participating in a vast international bribery scheme.</p><p>Ms. Menendez, according to an indictment and evidence introduced during her husband’s trial, was often the go-between for the men, shuttling messages and accepting bribes meant for the senator.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Menendez’s diagnosis with what her lawyers at the time described as a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/nyregion/nadine-menendez-trial-delay.html" title="">serious medical condition</a>” was first revealed in April, weeks before she was expected to stand trial alongside her husband and two other men, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana.</p><p>Judge Stein granted her springtime request for a delayed trial; Mr. Menendez, 70, later said that his wife would undergo a mastectomy as she was treated for what he described as an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/nyregion/nadine-menendez-cancer.html" title="">aggressive form</a> of breast cancer.</p><p>Her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/nyregion/robert-menendez-bribery-case.html" title="">absence from the trial</a> freed Mr. Menendez’s lawyers to depict Ms. Menendez as a greedy, conniving spouse who had duped the former senator, a lawyer by trade who once led the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p><p>But on Monday, Judge Stein ruled there was no need to delay her trial further.</p><p>Ms. Menendez said nothing during the public portion of the hearing and declined to comment as she walked out with her lawyer, Barry Coburn, who also declined to comment.</p><p>When the F.B.I. searched the couple’s home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., they discovered gold bars, nearly half a million dollars in cash and a Mercedes-Benz convertible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Jose Uribe, an insurance broker who nurtured a close friendship with Ms. Menendez, pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/nyregion/jose-uribe-menendez-trial-bribery.html" title="">testified at Mr. Menendez’s trial</a> that he had given Ms. Menendez the Mercedes as a bribe to win help from the senator, then her boyfriend, in dispatching unrelated criminal charges that had ensnared Mr. Uribe and his business associates.</p><p>Mr. Menendez, Mr. Daibes and Mr. Hana have each asked Judge Stein to vacate the jury’s verdict and grant a new trial in their case and have said that they plan to appeal if he does not.</p><p>Last month, prosecutors also disclosed that nine text messages introduced as evidence and uploaded to a computer for jurors to review during deliberations had been incompletely redacted. The revelation raised the possibility that jurors had reviewed messages that they should not have been able to see without redactions.</p><p>That led defense lawyers to expand their claims that the men should be granted a new trial.</p><p>“In light of this serious breach, a new trial is unavoidable, despite all of the hard work and resources that went into the first one,” Mr. Menendez’s lawyers, Adam Fee and Avi Weitzman, argued in a court filing. “Without doubting that the error was unintentional, the responsibility for it lies exclusively with the government, and the government must accept its consequences.”</p><p>Prosecutors have argued that in the unlikely event jurors did review the unredacted messages, which were among hundreds introduced during the two-month trial, viewing them would not have influenced the verdict.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Judge Stein is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether a new trial is warranted.</p><p>Mr. Menendez <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/nyregion/senator-bob-menendez-resignation.html" title="">resigned</a> from the Senate in August and did not run for re-election.</p><p>Representative Andy Kim, a Democrat, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/nyregion/nj-senate-kim-bradshaw.html" title="">won the race for Mr. Menendez’s seat</a> and was expected to be sworn in to the Senate at 5 p.m. on Monday.</p><p>Mr. Kim, who has represented a South Jersey district in the House since 2019, will be the first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/nyregion/andy-kim-senate-nj-korean-americans.html" title="">Korean American</a> to serve in the Senate. At 42, he will also be the Senate’s third-youngest member.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Dec. 9, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated Nadine Menendez’s age.
