A piece of paper haphazardly stuck to the door with packing tape spelled out the sad news in bright red letters: “WE ARE CLOSED.”</p><p>And lo did a cry of anguish rise from a stretch of Broadway between West 107th and 108th. It spread quickly to West Side Rag, the local news site that broke the <a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2024/12/12/absolute-bagels-iconic-uws-bagel-spot-possibly-closed-for-good-multiple-employees" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bombshell news</a> on Thursday morning, and then downtown, on to Brooklyn, to New Jersey, and to bagel lovers everywhere.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“This is, like, a cataclysmic event in the bagel world,” said Sam Silverman, a bagel maven.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">C.S. Muncy for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Nooooooooo!!!!!” someone with the username Joe posted in comments about the West Side Rag story. “No no no no no no no no no no no!!”</p><p>“This is, like, a cataclysmic event in the bagel world,” said Sam Silverman, a Brooklyn resident who organizes classes and events for bagel cognoscenti and is known in the business as the Bagel Ambassador. “It is insane,” said Mr. Silverman, whose favorite order from Absolute was the everything bagel, untoasted, with scallion cream cheese.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ray Lugo was sitting a few blocks away at another Upper West Side institution, the Hungarian Pastry Shop on Amsterdam, when a waitress told him the news. He went straight to Absolute to confirm the rumor. He found the metal gate partially lowered and the door ajar.</p><p>When he arrived, at about 2 p.m., an employee of the store stood stooped beneath the metal gate, handing out free bagels to a crowd of a dozen people. The employee was crying. Like the other workers inside the store, she declined to give her name or explain why the store had closed. It had been open on Wednesday, and somebody presumably made bagels on Thursday morning. It was a mystery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An employee of the store cried as she handed out free bagels to people who gathered outside the shop.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">C.S. Muncy for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Efforts to reach Mr. Thongkrieng by phone on Thursday were not successful, and it remained unclear whether the store was permanently shut.</p><p>Gale Brewer, a longtime city councilwoman from the Upper West Side and former Manhattan borough president, called 10 people on Thursday, including police leaders and members of the New York State Assembly, asking for information about Absolute Bagels. But her investigation left her unsatisfied.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“This bagel thing is weird!” she said. “Nobody knows why it closed.”</p><p>By Friday morning, a clearer picture of the puzzle had begun to emerge. According to the website of the New York City Department of Health, inspectors noted <a href="https://a816-health.nyc.gov/ABCEatsRestaurants/#!/Search/40392339" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a raft of violations</a> when they visited on Wednesday, including evidence of roaches and rats, and Absolute Bagels was ordered closed.</p><p>Other than the shop’s workers, few were as devastated by Absolute Bagel’s demise as Emily Code. When Ms. Code, 36, moved to the Upper West Side 14 years ago, her first meal was an Absolute bagel. She has lived in three different apartments since then, all within a block of the store, where she knew the workers by name.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The shop was founded in the early ’90s by a Thai immigrant, Samak Thongkrieng.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">C.S. Muncy for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In April 2020, as Covid forced much of New York to close, Ms. Code commissioned a friend to make a painting of Absolute Bagels. She features prominently in the picture, wearing a red top and a big smile, standing in a line of waiting customers that became as famous at Absolute as the bagels themselves.</p><p>The painting remains the centerpiece of her living room. “When we were going absolutely crazy, I was like, ‘What would give me joy?’” Ms. Code said. “It’s the one place I really love in the neighborhood.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Hazel Balaban last visited Absolute Bagels on Wednesday. There was no indication the shop was about to close, she said, although a worker did offer a free bagel to Ms. Balaban’s daughter.</p><p>“Looking back, that was probably a red flag,” said Ms. Balaban, 37. “They never did that.”</p><p>The bagels were good, of course. But Ms. Balaban also kind of liked Absolute Bagels’ line, especially in the early morning, before the TikTokers arrived. Between the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 a.m., the line was just people from the neighborhood. They stood together, waiting for bagels baked like the city itself: crisp exterior, warm and soft on the inside.</p><p>“I’m heartbroken,” she said, before catching herself and acknowledging, “Of all the wrongs in the world, a bagel store closing is pretty low on the list.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Criminal to Power Broker: </strong>John Chan was a Chinatown gangster before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/chan-china-nyc-influence.html">remaking himself into a powerful force in New York politics</a> — one closely aligned with the Chinese Communist Party.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Slowdown in Enforcement: </strong>For eight months, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/nyregion/new-jersey-state-police-slowdown.html">traffic enforcement on New Jersey’s highways plummeted</a>.
