Trump’s picks for the government’s top health posts have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html" title="">expressed skepticism</a> about the safety of childhood vaccines. It’s a sentiment shared by a growing number of parents, who are choosing <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to skip recommended shots for their children</a>.</p><p>But while everyone seems to be talking about the potential side effects of vaccines, few are discussing the diseases they prevent. </p><p>It has been half a century or more since many of the inoculations became routine in the United States, and the experience of having these illnesses has been largely erased from public memory. Questions today about <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4869767/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the risk-benefit ratio of vaccines</a> might just be a product of the vaccines’ own success.</p><p>Here is what people should know about six once-common illnesses that vaccines have contained for decades.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-4e19b89d">Measles</h2><p>Measles, a viral infection often spread by a cough or sneeze, is extraordinarily contagious: Nine out of 10 people around an infected person will catch measles if they have not been vaccinated. Measles can be contracted in a room up to two hours after a person with the disease has left it.</p><p>Measles is not a mild illness, particularly for children under 5. It can cause a high fever, coughing, conjunctivitis and rashes, and if it leads to pneumonia or encephalitis — brain swelling — it can quickly become lethal. Before the vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1963, almost every child had contracted measles by age 15. Tens of thousands of measles patients were <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hospitalized</a> each year, and between 400 and 500 of them died.</p><p>Two doses of the MMR vaccine together are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles. But epidemiologists say a 95 percent vaccine <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coverage rate</a> is necessary to prevent transmission of the virus in a community. Over the past four school years, the kindergarten vaccination rate has fallen below that threshold — in some communities, far below.</p><p>About <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">280,000</a> kindergarten students in the United States are now unprotected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and measles — which was eliminated from the United States in 2000 — has since seen a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10946219/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resurgence</a>. There have been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">16 measles outbreaks in 2024</a>, compared with four outbreaks in 2023. In communities where the spread is rampant, even a vaccinated child can occasionally contract the disease, though their symptoms are generally less severe.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-74076da6">Diphtheria</h2><p>The Greek word diphthera means leather — a fitting reference for a bacterial infection that creates a thick, gray membrane over the throat and tonsils, suffocating its victims. There was <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/science-diphtheria-plague-among-children-180978572/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a time in the United States</a> when up to <a href="https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/great-throat-distemper-1735/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eight children</a> in a single family suffered that fate — a burden so grave that a science historian called it “<a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/1291/childhoods-deadly-scourge" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">childhood’s deadly scourge</a>.”</p><p>The toxin driving the disease is produced by a strain of bacterium in respiratory droplets and works by killing healthy tissues, which can lead to difficulty breathing and swallowing, especially among young children with smaller airways. It can also gravely damage the cardiac and nervous systems, resulting in heart failure or <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17870-diphtheria" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paralysis</a>.</p><p>Even with treatment, one in 10 people who have respiratory diphtheria die from it, according to the C.D.C.</p><p>The infection is now preventable in young children through multiple DTaP vaccine doses, and preteens and adults get boosters called Tdap. Thanks to vaccinations, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/php/surveillance/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cases</a> in the United States have gone from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-7-diphtheria.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 100,000 per year</a> in the 1920s to — on average — less than one.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Doctors and nurses swarmed over patients in iron lung respirators in the emergency polio ward at Haynes Memorial Hospital in Boston, Mass., in 1955.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-4d161f46">Tetanus</h2><p>A fully developed tetanus infection can be an alarming sight: fists clenched, back arched, legs rigid from extreme, excruciating muscle spasms that last several minutes. Extreme fluctuations in blood pressure. A racing heart. Neck and stomach muscles tight enough to impair breathing.</p><p>Treatment for tetanus must be immediate, and <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/tetanus#:~:text=Severe%20tetanus%20can%20lead%20to,%3C1%25%20for%20localized%20tetanus." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">up to 20 percent</a> of people who become infected will die.</p><p>It all starts with a bacterium that <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetanus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351625#:~:text=The%20bacterium%20that%20causes%20tetanus,the%20cells%20are%20%22awakened.%22" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lies dormant in soil and animal feces</a> until it enters the body through broken skin like a cut. The microbe begins to grow, divide and release a toxin that impairs nerves.</p><p>Vaccines containing the tetanus toxoid began being administered to children in the U.S. <a href="https://history.nih.gov/display/history/Tetanus" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in the 1940s</a>, when there were more than 500 cases per year. Children are now protected through multiple doses of the DTaP vaccine, which also guards against diphtheria and pertussis (also known as whooping cough). Since 2000, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/php/surveillance/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual number of cases</a> has been below 50.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-36d69b">Mumps</h2><p>The mumps virus, spread through saliva and respiratory droplets triggers a fever and swollen salivary glands in the ears — which is why patients often have a puffy jaw and cheeks — and can, in severe cases, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28338374/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cause deafness</a>.</p><p>The disease is dangerously insidious: It can lie dormant for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/about/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">up to a month</a> before symptoms appear, and most people are infectious before their salivary glands begin to swell. Complications are <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/mumps-in-adults#:~:text" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more common in adults than children</a>, but they can include inflammation in the ovaries and testicles — which can cause infertility or sterility — or in the brain and spinal cord, which can put patients at risk of seizures and strokes.</p><p>The United States began vaccinating against mumps in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-15-mumps.html#:~:text=The%20live%2C%20attenuated%20mumps%20vaccine,and%20rubella%20(MMR)%20vaccine." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1967</a> and subsequently saw a 99 percent decrease in cases. But annual cases in the United States — which previously hovered between 200 and 400 — have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks/index.html#:~:text=U.S.%20mumps%20cases%20decreased%20significantly,they%20have%20increased%20since%202006." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surpassed</a> 1,000 nine times since 2006.

In 2004, the United States declared the disease eliminated. Infections are now mostly imported from other parts of the world; annual cases fell from about 47,000 <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8903938/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">before the vaccine</a> to just <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/rubella" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">six in 2020</a>.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-3417c3">Polio</h2><p>Parents in the early 1950s lived with a terror few could later imagine: the substantial prospect that their child could touch the wrong toy and end up in a wheelchair, an iron lung or a grave.</p><p>Polio epidemics, which had been occurring for decades, had gained new magnitude by the middle of the 20th century, killing or paralyzing <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-polio-vaccination#:~:text" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than half a million people</a> worldwide each year.

It is transmitted by exposure to fecal matter, such as on contaminated foods or objects. Most people who contract the virus have <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/poliomyelitis/facts#:~:text" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no visible symptoms</a>, though they can still pass it on. About a quarter develop <a href="http://ph.lacounty.gov/ip/diseases/polio/index.htm#:~:text=" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">common flu symptoms</a> such as a sore throat, fever and nausea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In severe cases, polio can affect the nerves and brain, causing <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/about/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">meningitis and paralysis</a>. When the muscles responsible for breathing are affected, the case can be lethal. And even decades after a resolved polio infection, people can experience muscle weakness and atrophy, which is referred to as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polio/symptoms-causes/syc-20376512" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post-polio syndrome</a>.</p><p>In the United States, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/polio-vaccine-placebo.html" title="">vaccines drove paralytic polio cases down</a> from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-18-poliomyelitis.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/polio.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 21,000</a> in 1952 to just one in 1993.
