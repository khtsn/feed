Unlike her opponents, she promised that she would run a campaign based on the issues, not on negative attacks.</p><p>The crowd jumped to its feet in a standing ovation, recounted Jim Stearns, a political consultant who had helped Ms. Harris in the race.</p><p>For Mr. Stearns, the moment has come to embody what he described more than two decades later as a hallmark of Ms. Harris’s political style: Prepare, and then punch. Hard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“She certainly understands there’s only one way to deal with someone who is attacking you, which is to hit them back harder than they’re hitting you,” Mr. Stearns said. “She’s a combination of very ferocious and very disciplined at the same time.”</p><p>That carefully combative approach will face its biggest test yet on Tuesday, when Ms. Harris confronts Donald J. Trump on the debate stage. Much of her performance will depend on whether she can successfully adapt to an opponent best known for his unpredictability. During the 2020 primary debates, Ms. Harris became <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4fjA0K2EeE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notably rattled</a> after being attacked by Tulsi Gabbard, who was then a congresswoman and trailing in the polls, over her record as a prosecutor — a line of questioning she had prepared for.</p><p>Ms. Harris has said that she expects Mr. Trump to lie about his record — and hers — and to deploy deeply personal attacks.</p><p>Some of her aides worry that an agreement between both sides to mute the microphones when a candidate is not speaking will hamper her ability to land an effective punch. But allies do not expect her to be shaken by the format or any wild accusations from Mr. Trump. Debating is one of her biggest strengths, a skill that has fueled her political ascent even amid notable public stumbles in interviews and shifting policy positions.</p><p>“She is very calm,” said Mazie Hirono, the Democratic senator from Hawaii, who spent four years sitting next to Ms. Harris on the Senate Judiciary Committee and watching as she questioned Trump administration officials. “I don’t think that Trump will be able to intimidate her or bully her, which is his usual tactics.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-508bfb04">‘It’s a Blood Sport’</h2><p>Ms. Harris forged her political rise through rhetorical combat, capturing attention with lacerating exchanges on debate stages and in congressional hearings. Her attacks are strategic and direct, with a controlled delivery — sometimes even a smile — and an instinctual sense for a news-making moment.</p><p>In 2010, she won a tough race for California attorney general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/us/politics/kamala-harris-2010-debate.html" title="">after twisting a pivotal</a> 47 seconds to her advantage in the contest’s only debate. Her piercing questioning of Trump administration appointees and officials from her perch on the Senate Judiciary Committee built her national profile. And a brutal exchange with President Biden during the 2020 primary over race and his warm remembrances of segregationist senators transformed her image into one of a presidential contender.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Many of those moments were carefully planned, another feature of how Ms. Harris debates. She is known to pore over policy briefs, devote days preparing for debates and workshop attack lines far in advance.</p><p>Given her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/kamala-harris-policy-change.html" title="">more cautious governing style</a> and personal demeanor, Ms. Harris’s more aggressive political instincts can seem surprising, some current and former aides said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“She is somebody who really is a warm, caring human who will call you and ask how your kids are doing by name,” said Brian Brokaw, who ran her campaign for attorney general. “At the same time, she also has the capacity to be ice-cold and do what it takes to win.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The vice-presidential debate between Ms. Harris and Mike Pence in 2020.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ms. Harris says her approach was developed during her years in politics in San Francisco, a densely packed peninsula stacked with ambitious would-be politicians and dominated by a single political party. It is a place where politics can feel like a cage match with an ocean view.</p><p>“I always start my campaigns early, and I run hard,” Ms. Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/us/politics/kamala-harris-californias-attorney-general-leaps-to-forefront-of-race-for-barbara-boxers-senate-seat.html" title="">told The New York Times in 2015</a>. “Maybe it comes from the rough-and-tumble world of San Francisco politics, where it’s not even a contact sport — it’s a blood sport. This is how I am as a candidate. This is how I run campaigns.”</p><p>Even before Ms. Harris ran for office, she was known among her colleagues in San Francisco for her assertive manner in the courtroom as a local prosecutor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>State Senator Scott Wiener recalled working with Ms. Harris in the city attorney’s office in the early 2000s. During his first solo jury trial, he stopped into Ms. Harris’s office to ask how to handle a judge who was hazing him. She walked him through her strategy.</p><p>At the end of the conversation, she looked Mr. Wiener in the eye and offered a final piece of advice. “Don’t let her bully you,” she told him. “Stand your ground.”</p><h2 id="link-44a6da47">‘That Really Takes the Breath Away’</h2><p>Ms. Harris quickly adopted her courtroom maxim to her emerging political career. The church has no video or audio of the 2003 event where she leveled the personal attacks in her first political campaign. Mr. Fazio does not remember the interaction, and Mr. Hallinan died in January 2020. Both men denied the personal allegations that Ms. Harris raised that day.</p><p>But Mr. Stearns vividly recalls the moment, in part because he spent time sketching out how she should respond to possible questions about her relationship with Mr. Brown before the event. Ms. Harris was particularly interested in understanding the implications of various tactics and how each man was likely to respond to certain lines, he said.</p><p>“We ‘war-gamed’ it out,” he recalled. “I realized that Kamala was not at all nervous about taking on these guys, but she was very careful.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In an interview, Mr. Fazio said Ms. Harris skillfully fought her way through the entire contest, including a runoff election against Mr. Hallinan, the incumbent district attorney who had hired Ms. Harris five years earlier to lead his career-criminal unit.</p><p>When in a debate Mr. Fazio correctly accused her of overstating the number of serious felony cases she had tried in campaign literature, she quickly — and effectively — pivoted, he said.</p><p>“Leadership is working with different communities as a career prosecutor. I’ve done that, which is why I — not you — have every law enforcement organization’s endorsement,” <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/harris-challenged-2003-district-attorney-debate-113231036" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she said</a> in that debate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bill Fazio, one of Ms. Harris’s first political opponents, at his campaign headquarters in 2001.  “As history goes, I’m glad she won,” Mr. Fazio said, “because I like where she is right now.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Liz Hafalia/San Francisco Chronicle, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>After the contest narrowed to the runoff, Mr. Hallinan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/us/politics/kamala-harris-san-francisco-da.html" title="">questioned whether she could be trusted to prosecute city corruption</a> because of her relationship with Mr. Brown. “He has an interest in having a friend in the district’s attorney office,” he said in the <a href="https://www.kqed.org/forum/312010900/district-attorneys-race" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">final debate</a> of the election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Ms. Harris fired back with her own promise to take on any potential bad actor, be they near or far.</p><p>“I will set up a public integrity desk,” she said, the pace of her speech accelerating, “that will be dedicated to dealing with investigating and prosecuting cases involving corruption by any public official — be it Terence Hallinan or anyone else.”</p><p>Mr. Hallinan sputtered slightly. “Best defense is a good offense, but that really takes the breath away for me,” he responded.</p><p>Eight days later, she defeated him by a double-digit margin. When she ran for re-election in 2007, after facing a steady drumbeat of criticism for declining to seek the death penalty for a man who had killed a police officer, she was unopposed.</p><p>Several years after their race, Ms. Harris called Mr. Fazio to express her condolences after his wife died <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/bill-fazio-s-wife-dies-in-american-samoa-3248170.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in American Samoa when she choked on a piece of gum</a>. Her mother had recently passed away, Ms. Harris told him, and the two former opponents bonded over their grieving, Mr. Fazio recounted.</p><p>“I never forgot that,” said Mr. Fazio, who is now a supporter of her presidential bid. He added, “As history goes, I’m glad she won, because I like where she is right now.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><h2 id="link-7f60b63d">‘A Clear Difference Between the Candidates’</h2><p>When it comes to politics, Ms. Harris is fond of moving with a boldness that can seem to contradict the more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/kamala-harris-policy-change.html" title="">granular policy-making she tends to favor</a>.</p><p>When Senator Barbara Boxer declared that she would be retiring in 2015, opening up a Senate seat in California for the first time in nearly a quarter-century, many in the state anticipated a sprawling primary contest, packed with a backlog of generational talent.</p><p>Ms. Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/california-kamala-harris-to-run-for-barbara-boxer-senate-seat.html" title="">entered the field</a> within days of Ms. Boxer’s announcement. She then proceeded to dispatch her rivals with striking force, rolling out a rapid-fire release of high-profile national and local endorsements.</p><p>One by one, possible contenders — from Antonio R.
