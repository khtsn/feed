She was 116.</p><p>In a statement released on Saturday, the mayor of Ashiya said Ms. Itooka passed away last Sunday. He did not give a cause, but local news media reports said she died peacefully of complications related to old age.</p><p>“I offer my deepest condolences,” said the mayor, Ryosuke Takashima. “Ms. Itooka gave us great courage and hope throughout her long life. I would like to express my gratitude once again.”</p><p>Ms. Itooka was <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/84549-oldest-person-living" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declared the oldest living person by Guinness World Records</a> in September after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/europe/worlds-oldest-person-maria-branyas-dead.html" title="">the death of Maria Branyas Morera</a> of Spain at age 117.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Itooka was born <a href="https://www.wilmina.ac.jp/foundation/infomation/982/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tomiko Yano</a> on May 23, 1908, in the city of Osaka, one of three children in a family that ran a clothing store. At that time, her country was a rising imperial power that had just defeated czarist Russia in war and was embarking on expansion into mainland Asia.</p><p>In the year of her birth, Japan signed an agreement with President Theodore Roosevelt’s secretary of state that averted conflict with the United States in exchange for Washington recognizing Japan’s annexation of the Korean Peninsula. During the span of her life, she saw her nation emerge as an Asian colonial empire, fall in fiery defeat in 1945 and rise again as an industrial giant and peaceful democracy.</p><p>Growing up in prewar Japan, she played volleyball in high school before marrying the owner of a textile company, Kenji Itooka, with whom she had two daughters and two sons. During World War II, she stayed in Japan to run the business while her husband went to Korea, then a Japanese colony, to oversee a factory there.</p><p>“She single-handedly managed a Japanese office and raised her children during this period,” <a href="https://www.grg-supercentenarians.org/2024/09/16/tomiko-itooka-worlds-oldest-living-person-receives-gwr-certificate-on-respect-for-the-aged-day/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Gerontology Research Group</a>, which keeps a database of the world’s oldest people.</p><p>In 1979, her husband died after 51 years of marriage. Ms. Itooka then moved to Ashiya, a city outside Osaka, where she remained an avid hiker into her 80s. At 100, she was said to be still ascending the stone steps of her local Shinto shrine without a cane.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When once asked by local news media for the secret of her longevity, she reportedly credited eating bananas and drinking Calpis, a Japanese dairy drink. Ms. Itooka is survived by one daughter, one son and an unknown number of her five grandchildren.</p><p>Miharu Nishiyama<!-- --> and <!-- -->Hisako Ueno<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Jan. 4, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the month of Tomiko Itooka’s 116th birthday celebrations. They were in May, not August.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
