In New York alone, the city’s heliports generate a “total economic impact” of $78 million a year, according to the <a href="https://edc.nyc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Economic Development Corporation</a>.</p><p>But sightseeing helicopters can operate under less rigorous safety requirements than other commercial aircraft such as airliners, charter planes and some private jets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The latest accident, which killed the pilot and a family of five visiting from Spain, comes after years of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/nyregion/helicopter-crash-nyc.html" title="">scrutiny</a> about how the Federal Aviation Administration should regulate these types of sightseeing tours and an attempt by Congress to tighten the rules.</p><h2 id="link-5c913204">How safe is flying in a helicopter compared with other forms of air travel?</h2><p>Flying on a commercial airliner is by far the safest form of air travel, with an average rate of fewer than 0.01 fatal accidents per 100,000 flight hours from 2019 to 2023, according to <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/StatisticalReviews/Pages/CivilAviationDashboard.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data from the National Transportation Safety Board</a>, the primary federal agency that investigates civil aviation accidents.</p><p>By contrast, the average fatal accident rate for all U.S. helicopters during this period was 0.69 per 100,000 flight hours, <a href="https://ushst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-USHST-Safety-Report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the U.S. Helicopter Safety Team</a>, a nonprofit group dedicated to civil helicopter safety.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Helicopters were also less safe than commuter and on-demand aircraft, a category that includes private charter flights (as well as a small number of helicopters), which had an average of 0.20 fatal accidents per 100,000 flight hours, according to the N.T.S.B. data.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But helicopters were more safe than the overall general aviation category, which includes privately owned noncommercial airplanes as well as recreational helicopters and had a rate of about 0.95 fatal accidents per 100,000 flight hours.</p><p>Helicopters are “complex mechanisms” that require a lot of care when it comes to maintenance and operations, said <a href="https://guzzettiaviation.com/about-us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jeff Guzzetti</a>, a former accident investigator for the F.A.A. and the N.T.S.B. They are also “more dependent on proper pilot action due to the complex aerodynamics, complex control systems and complex environment than fixed-wing aircraft,” said John Cox, a former airline pilot who runs a <a href="https://www.safeopsys.com/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">safety consulting firm</a>.</p><p>Pilots striving to give tourists an adventure, Mr. Guzzetti added, might attempt risky maneuvers. “They fly close to the ground and in proximity to things they’re touring over, whether it’s buildings or the cliffs of the Grand Canyon,” he said. “All of that combines to make it a more hazardous endeavor than riding an airliner from one city to another.”</p><h2 id="link-2ae405b3">Where else have helicopter tours crashed?</h2><p>Since 2008, there have been 80 commercial sightseeing helicopter accidents, with 72 deaths, in the United States, according to the N.T.S.B. Hawaii has had the most, with 20 accidents and 19 fatalities, followed by Florida, Nevada, Texas and Alaska. In New York, there have been two accidents and 11 deaths, including the April 10 crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Sightseeing helicopters represented a small fraction of the more than 2,200 civil aviation helicopter accidents in the United States in that same period.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The scene of an April 10 crash of a sightseeing helicopter in the Hudson River.

Regulations differ for aircraft maintenance, pilot qualifications and rest time, and acceptable conditions to fly.</p><p>Commercial airlines are authorized to operate under <a href="https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/air_carriers/operations/part_121#:~:text=In%20This%20Section,as%20training%20for%20all%20employees." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Part 121</a>, the most rigorous set of rules. Sightseeing helicopter operations can operate under the less demanding <a href="https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/air_carriers/operations/part_135" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Part 135</a>, which applies to unscheduled commuter and charter services, or they can fly under <a href="https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/air_carriers/operations/part_91" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Part 91</a>, the least restrictive, which covers general aviation.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/afx/afs/afs400/afs410/part91_loa_process" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">F.A.A. approval</a>, helicopter operators can be certified under Part 135 but still operate flights under Part 91 rules if the helicopter departs from and lands at the same location and stays within a 25-mile radius, as many sightseeing tours do.</p><p>New York Helicopter Charter, the company that operated the aircraft involved in the New York crash this month, had a Part 135 certificate, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/media/93311#:~:text=As%20a%20part%20135%20operator,a%20Bell%20206L%2D4%20LongRanger." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the F.A.A</a>. But the doomed helicopter was operating under Part 91 rules, <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/ERA25MA171.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the N.T.S.B</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-52eb3175">How important are the different rules?</h2><p>Since 2008, most helicopter accidents have involved flights operating under Part 91, according to N.T.S.B. data.</p><p>Part 91 flights operate under “much less stringent requirements than their 135 charter brethren,” Mr. Guzzetti said. <a href="https://www.faa.gov/faq/what-are-crewmember-flight-and-duty-time-and-rest-requirements" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Part 91 operations</a> do not have flight time limits or rest requirements for pilots. By comparison, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/media/11171" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Part 135 limits</a> their flight time to eight hours for every 24-hour period, and requires scheduled rest time. It also has stricter training mandates for pilots.</p><p>Pilot fatigue may have contributed to a deadly 2004 sightseeing helicopter accident on the island of Kauai, according to the N.T.S.B. That flight, operating under Part 91, crashed into a mountain, killing the pilot and all four passengers. The N.T.S.B. cited the pilot’s inexperience with local weather conditions and a lack of scheduled breaks, among other factors, in its report.</p><p>Existing federal rules don’t “adequately address the pilot fatigue issues associated with the continuous, repetitive, high-frequency flight operations that are unique to commercial air tour helicopter operations,” the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-recs/recletters/A07_18_26.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">N.T.S.B. said in the report</a>.</p><p>John Goglia, a former N.T.S.B. board member and an independent safety consultant, said pilots for these types of tours are “on the clock for a long time,” possibly making more than a dozen flights a day. “They just fly them all day long,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Christopher Young, the executive director of <a href="https://www.topssafety.org/site/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TOPS</a>, an independent helicopter tour safety organization, said in a statement that the group advocated higher standards in the air tour and sightseeing industry and encouraged all helicopter operators to adopt safety processes that go beyond federal requirements.</p><p>Four commercial helicopter tour operators did not return emails and phone calls requesting comment.</p><h2 id="link-46c66d2f">What has been done to make these flights safer?</h2><p>Notable accidents over the years have prompted the F.A.A. to tighten the rules for sightseeing helicopters.</p><p>After two accidents in Hawaii on the same day in July 1994, the N.T.S.B. <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-recs/recletters/A95_58_65.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called for</a> “improvements in F.A.A. oversight and new regulations” for the industry, including placing all commercial helicopter flights under Part 135. After the 2004 crash on Kauai, the N.T.S.B. <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/LAX04FA329.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">again cited</a> the “the lack of F.A.A. oversight of Part 91 air tour operators” and pushed the F.A.A. to require <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-recs/recletters/A07_18_26.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more training</a> and establish rest breaks for helicopter pilots. The F.A.A. did not follow these recommendations.</p><p>In 2018, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/nyregion/helicopter-crash-nyc.html" title="">sightseeing helicopter conducting a doorless tour crashed</a> into the East River in New York. Five passengers drowned when they were unable to escape from their safety harnesses. Several months after the accident, the F.A.A. <a href="https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/FAA_Order_8900.4.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned doors-off flights</a> unless passenger restraints could be quickly released during an emergency.</p><p>The F.A.A. has also enacted location-specific rules. At the Grand Canyon, the agency limits the number of tours and <a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/arc/SFRA_trail.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">where they can fly</a>. In Hawaii, where poor visibility has been a factor in previous crashes, tour operators must fly at least 1,500 feet above the surface. Flying below that level requires <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/statements/faa-outlines-hawaii-air-tour-safety-improvements" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">F.A.A. approval</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Guzzetti, the safety expert, said he thought there was enough supervision of Part 135 operations but that Part 91 oversight was “lacking.”</p><p>Legislation called <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1071" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Safe and Quiet Skies Act</a>, introduced in Congress in 2023, would have required all helicopter tours to fly under Part 135 rules. It did not receive a vote.</p><p>The F.A.A. <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/rotorcraft-safety-roundtable-media-readout" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently formed</a> a rule-making committee to improve the safety of commercial air tours, including helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, with plans to submit its recommendations by late September. This committee was a requirement of last year’s F.A.A. <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/BC96EBA2-77A1-401C-96A0-E9B990F4D3E4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reauthorization act</a>, which also directs the committee to consider pilot training and maintenance standards, in addition to flight data monitoring.</p><h2 id="link-2b20d2d">How do you know if a helicopter tour is safe?</h2><p>Before you book, Mr. Guzzetti recommends asking the tour company how many aircraft it has, which regulations (Part 91 or 135) your sightseeing flight would be operating under, and how it trains its pilots. You can also look up the company’s accident history on the <a href="https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-main-public/query-builder" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">N.T.S.B. database</a>. Finally, check to see if the operator is affiliated with a safety organization like <a href="https://www.topssafety.org/site/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TOPS</a>, whose members must adhere to rules that exceed F.A.A. requirements as well as pass an annual independent audit.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Follow New York Times Travel </em></strong><em>on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/traveldispatch" title=""><em>sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter</em></a><em> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
