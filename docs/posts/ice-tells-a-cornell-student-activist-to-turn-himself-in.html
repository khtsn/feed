As a result, the university had ordered him to study remotely for the spring semester.</p><p>Mr. Taal, a great-grandson of Gambia’s first president, Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara, is a citizen of both Gambia and the United Kingdom. According to court documents, Mr. Taal, who is here on a visa, said he feared deportation in part because his name had been circulated on social media and <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/23/us-news/zionist-org-preps-list-of-foreign-pro-hamas-students-hoping-trump-will-deport-them/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in media reports</a> as a potential ICE target.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The move to detain Mr. Taal comes as the Trump administration tries to deport other pro-Palestinian students and academics.</p><p>About two weeks ago, Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident of Palestinian descent who recently obtained a master’s degree from Columbia University, was detained in New York. On Monday, the government detained Badar Kahn Suri, an Indian citizen who was studying and teaching at Georgetown University, claiming he had violated terms of his academic visa. Other students have also been targeted. </p><p>ICE did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>Last weekend, Mr. Taal filed a pre-emptive lawsuit to block possible action against him. A hearing had been scheduled in that case for Tuesday in Syracuse, N.Y. A lawyer for Mr. Taal, Eric T. Lee, argued in the lawsuit that his client was exercising his right to free speech and that there were no legitimate grounds for his deportation.</p><p>The lawsuit also challenged the legality of Mr. Trump’s executive order to “combat antisemitism” that instructed federal agencies to deport immigrants whose actions could be regarded as “antisemitic or supportive of terrorism.”</p><p>Earlier this week, neighbors saw law enforcement agents near Mr. Taal’s apartment building by Cornell’s campus, according to affidavits filed in the lawsuit in the Northern District of New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This does not happen in a democracy. We are outraged, and every American should be too,” Mr. Lee said in a statement.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Taal are asking the court to delay his surrender to ICE, pending the outcome of the litigation. On Thursday, hundreds of Cornell students and supporters held a rally in support of Mr. Taal, who is also the host of a podcast called “The Malcolm Effect.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephanie Saul reports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephanie-saul">More about Stephanie Saul</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">U.S. Politics: News and Analysis</h2><h3>Here’s a look at the political landscape across America.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Progressive Politics’ Divergent Styles:</strong> Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont are touring Western cities with a similar message but a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/aoc-bernie-sanders-vegas-denver.html">key difference in how they sell it</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shooting Plot Targeting Democrats: </strong>A former Republican candidate for a state legislative seat in New Mexico was found guilty on federal charges in connection with drive-by shootings <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/solomon-pena-new-mexico-shootings-guilty.html">targeting the homes of four Democratic officials</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Sanders’ Idea for the Left:</strong> The Vermont senator has a message for his fellow progressives: Why don’t you shed the Democratic label and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/bernie-sanders-democrats-independents.html">run as an independent, the way he does</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Town Halls:</strong> As President Trump and Elon Musk continue their push to shrink the federal government at breathtaking speed, town halls in Republican districts have erupted with an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/republicans-town-halls.html">outpouring of anxiety, complaints and anger</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Starting the 2028 Chatter Early:</strong> Pete Buttigieg says he’s keeping his options open.
