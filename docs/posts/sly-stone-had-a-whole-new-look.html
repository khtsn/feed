The bride and groom (and the whole wedding party, band included) wore coordinated Halston looks. Mr. Stone wore a gleaming cape and jumpsuit, the waist cinched with a big gold belt buckle, so he looked like a cross between a disco superhero and a sci-fi lord come lightly down to earth. Behind them, a dozen models in black dresses carried gold palm fronds.</p><p>It was, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1974/08/26/the-biggest-event-this-year" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The New Yorker</a> declared, “the biggest event this year.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/10/multimedia/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/10/multimedia/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/10/multimedia/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/10/multimedia/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/10/multimedia/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/10/multimedia/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/10/multimedia/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc/10SLY-STONE-APPRECIATION-02-vzqc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/18540f32-a483-53dc-a40a-cda442048584" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sly Stone and Kathy Silva during their wedding in June 1974.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oscar Abolafia/TPLP, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-2"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Stone in a signature crochet cap in Los Angeles, circa 1970 ...</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>... and befringed at Woodstock, 1970.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Warner Bros/Kobal, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Stone in London, 1973.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Putland/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was also seven years after Mr. Stone arrived on the music scene promising “A Whole New Thing,” and boy, had he delivered. He introduced not just a whole new sound but a whole new kind of style to the stage. Like his music, it crossed genre, race, gender and audience, offering unity in a psychedelic stew of fringe, rhinestones and lamé that was sometimes celebratory and sometimes chaotic, often outrageous, but almost always impossible to forget — whether it was on “The Ed Sullivan Show” or the Woodstock stage.</p><p>“He had a look,” Questlove wrote in the introduction to Mr. Stone’s 2023 autobiography, “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).” He loved an accessory: a necklace, an arm band and, especially, a hat.</p><p>He wore giant, broad-brimmed fedoras long before Pharrell Williams stepped out in his 20-gallon <a href="https://www.latimes.com/fashion/alltherage/la-ar-grammys-2014-pharrell-vivienne-westwood-hat-20140127-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vivienne Westwood number</a> in 2014, as well as crocheted toppers and exaggerated newsboy caps — like the silver-sequined style he wore with his magenta-sequined shirt for a performance on “The Midnight Special” in 1974. He was his own “Spaced Cowboy” in Nudie suits, spangled vests and wigs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sly &amp; the Family Stone onstage, circa 1970.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Redfern/Redferns</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The band performs on “The Midnight Special” ...</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gary Null/NBCUniversal, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>... and in concert in 1973.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">ABC Photo Archives/Disney, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sly &amp; the Family Stone on “The Midnight Special.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“He challenged people’s perception of normalcy,” Mr. Williams wrote in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/16/arts/music-still-dancing-to-sly-s-music.html" title="">The New York Times</a>. “He wore seriously fly clothes, and to this day, I have no idea how he walked around in those platforms.”</p><p>And it wasn’t just him; it was the whole band. Mr. Stone had a theory of fashion just as he had a theory of rhythm, one that emphasized the individual within the group dynamic. He would pick the colors for the crew — his favorites were red, white and black, which were also the colors of his living room — but within that spectrum, they were free to go their own way. At a time when many Motown bands still wore matching suits and ties, the idea that band members should dress to express their own bliss was revolutionary.</p><p>“Sly had the idea that we should be in the same theme, but make it be your own personality,” Jerry Martini, the band’s saxophone player, said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy2aoUQ-cKg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video interview</a> posted on the band’s YouTube channel in 2013. (He also described a day when Mr. Stone, dissatisfied with whatever outfit Mr. Martini had planned, looked around, grabbed a razor and cut up a cow-skin rug for him to wear like a poncho.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The band, left to right, in 1970: Larry Graham, Jerry Martini, Gregg Errico, Sly Stone, Freddie Stone and Cynthia Robinson.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evening Standard/Hulton Archive, vai Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The band in performance, 1970. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ann Limongello/Disney, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Stone in a Sly and the Family Stone tribute at the Grammy Awards in 2006.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Timothy A.

Music is Technicolor.”</p><p>Mr. Stone understood the power that came from connecting the ears and eyes, and he stuck to that conviction through his struggles with drugs and the industry, as his appearance during a 2006 Grammys tribute in silver lamé and a giant blond mohawk attested. He didn’t just sing about embracing “the skin I’m in.” He offered everyone a bedazzled primer for how that might look.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vanessa Friedman has been the fashion director and chief fashion critic for The Times since 2014.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
