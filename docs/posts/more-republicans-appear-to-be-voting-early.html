    <h1>More Republicans Appear to be Voting Early</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>With two weeks until Election Day, well over 17 million people — roughly a tenth of all registered voters — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/us/politics/2024-early-voting.html" title="">have already cast their ballots</a>. Many states have set daily records for early voting, offering the clearest sign yet that voting habits were forever changed by the pandemic.</p><p>Last presidential election, Democrats dominated the early and mail votes in large part because Donald Trump convinced his supporters that anything but a vote cast in person on Election Day could not be trusted. But this year, the Republican Party has embarked on a multimillion effort to change voters’ minds. And so far, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/trump-republicans-early-voting.html" title="">it appears to be working</a>.</p><p>Democrats still have a large advantage in early votes in some states, like Pennsylvania, but Republicans are closing the gap. And in North Carolina, which is also a battleground, early voting totals are almost evenly split between the two parties. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/early-vote-tracker-2024.html" title="">Take a look at the early votes cast so far in your state</a>.</p><p>To be clear, surges in early voting do not necessarily translate into high turnout by Election Day. However, if campaigns know that a voter has already cast their ballot, they can spend their time and money appealing to others.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hashem Safieddine in a southern suburb of Beirut, in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Khaled Desouki/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-e6b622c">Israel said it killed a top Hezbollah leader</h2><p>Israel’s military announced today that it had killed Hashem Safieddine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/world/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah" title="">the presumed successor to Hezbollah’s recently assassinated leader</a>.
