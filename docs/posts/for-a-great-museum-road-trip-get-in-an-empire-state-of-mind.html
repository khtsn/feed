It has cultural institutions rivaling those in the five boroughs, and rambling Letchworth State Park may be the state’s most spectacular natural wonder.

Cornell’s art history students helped curate these shining saints, avenging angels and a fearsome quartet (lent from the Hispanic Society in Upper Manhattan) of seven-inch polychrome wood carvings depicting three possible fates for your soul — burning in hell, pleading in purgatory, chilling out in heaven — and a certain fourth, of your skeleton decomposing on Earth.</p><p>These stunning figurines were carved by an Indigenous Ecuadorean artist called Caspicara (“wooden face,” in Quechua), and elsewhere this show underscores the complex cross-pollination of European and Mesoamerican belief systems. There’s a painting here of an alien-looking Jesus with four eyes shared across his three faces: one of the most popular motifs in colonial Hispanic art, and one that was forbidden in Europe. A much older ceramic cone from Ecuador, topped by three startled gods, suggests this Trinity had roots on both sides of the Atlantic. <em>Herbert F.

And while you should stop in at a temporary exhibition of Nordic contemporary art, and another of the Pop artist Marisol (who left her estate to the museum), the main draw of this western acropolis remains its outstanding collection of postwar American art. It includes a prime-time Jackson Pollock, one of Frank Stella’s greatest Black Paintings and “<a href="https://buffaloakg.org/artworks/k19564-liver-cocks-comb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Liver Is the Cock’s Comb</a>,” a renowned clash of color from 1944 by the Abstract Expressionist forerunner Arshile Gorky.</p><p>The AKG is also home to what I’m comfortable calling the two greatest Gauguins in any American museum. First is his woozy, world-departing “<a href="https://buffaloakg.org/artworks/19464-le-christ-jaune-yellow-christ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yellow Christ</a>,” from 1889, which reimagined Calvary as a mystic golden hillside in a pokey Breton village, where peasant girls in white coifs mourn the dying son of God.</p><p>Gauguin would plunge more fully into fantasies three years later in “<a href="https://buffaloakg.org/artworks/19651-mana%C3%B2-tupapa%C3%BA-spirit-dead-watching" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Manao Tupapau</a>,” the most uncertain and haunting of all his Tahitian pictures. It depicts Teha’amana, whom earlier art historians politely called the painter’s “bride,” nude and sleepless and frightened in a room of fervid violet, watched over by a tutelary ghost. It is the painting that most fully captures the invention and danger of Gauguin’s wanderlust, and his escape to the other side of the globe.
