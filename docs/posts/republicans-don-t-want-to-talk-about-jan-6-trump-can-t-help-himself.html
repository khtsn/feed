A recording of jailed Jan. 6 defendants singing the national anthem no longer plays at his rallies. When some defendants, including a man whom federal prosecutors have described as a “white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer,” gathered at Mr. Trump’s Bedminster golf club for a fund-raiser, the former president, who has attended similar events, sent his support in a video message instead.</p><p>“Our hearts are with you,” Mr. Trump said in the video. “Our soul is with you.”</p><p>The former president’s close-but-not-too-close relationship with the Jan. 6 cause is a tacit acknowledgment of his personal attachment to an issue with questionable political benefits, and of the country’s stark partisan divide over the Capitol riot, a divide largely of Mr. Trump’s own making.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“They have made a conscious effort to pivot away from Jan. 6” before the general election, said Joseph McBride, a lawyer who has represented several Jan. 6 defendants in their criminal cases. “But I don’t know how he harmonizes those two positions.”</p><h2 id="link-7945fdef">The Rewrite</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump has maintained that those who entered the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were peaceful demonstrators.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jason Andrew for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The rewriting of Jan. 6 began with a collection of right-wing politicians, news media figures, activists and influencers immediately after the Capitol attack, when Mr. Trump himself was largely out of the spotlight. But as he returned to politics in the 2022 midterms, the former president seized on the narrative, and he eventually wove it into his presidential campaign as a base-building note.</p><p>Since then, Mr. Trump has maintained that he did nothing wrong that day, pointing out that he told supporters who rallied before the riot to assemble “peacefully and patriotically,” and that those who entered the Capitol were merely peaceful demonstrators.</p><p>Most frequently, he has denounced the treatment of the Jan. 6 defendants who are in jail awaiting trial or serving prison sentences, many of them for assaulting police officers. He has regularly described them as “hostages” and “political prisoners,” and occasionally as “warriors,” who have been unfairly prosecuted more severely than the left-wing activists who took part in protests and riots in cities like Minneapolis and Portland, Ore., in 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But federal judges, including some appointed by Mr. Trump, have repeatedly rejected that argument, pointing out that there were clear differences between even the most violent 2020 upheavals and the disruption of the democratic process that took place at the Capitol.</p><p>“The Portland rioters’ conduct, while obviously serious, did not target a proceeding prescribed by the Constitution and established to ensure a peaceful transition of power,” Carl J. Nichols, a Trump-appointed federal judge in the District of Columbia, wrote.</p><p>Mr. Trump has claimed that the rioters’ prosecutions and his own, by the special counsel Jack Smith, are part of a vast conspiracy by the Biden administration and the larger “deep state”: an effort to silence questions about the 2020 election and to disqualify him preemptively from taking office again in 2025.</p><p>It is a rhetorical move that encourages supporters to see themselves as partners in Mr. Trump’s persecution. And, legal experts worry, it has laid the ideological groundwork for Mr. Trump to feel validated in using the Justice Department against his enemies should he retake the White House.</p><p>“If he can convince people of the lie that our legitimate government institutions were all wielded in corrupt ways to persecute him, he can convince people that he’s justified in turning those same institutions back on those he claims are responsible for that,” said Ian Bassin, the executive director of Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that advocates legal protections against authoritarianism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>As recently as June, Mr. Trump called on the Biden administration to “release the hostages” and promised to pardon them if elected. “The moment we win, we will rapidly review the cases of every political prisoner unjustly victimized by the Harris regime, and I will sign their pardons on Day One,” he wrote on social media this month.</p><p>“President Trump remains committed to ensuring there is equal justice for all Americans when he returns to the White House,” a campaign spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said.</p><h2 id="link-795a83f">A Political Sleight of Hand</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Efforts by the Biden campaign to center the race on Mr. Trump’s attempts to subvert democracy did little to turn voters against the former president.

Even the televised hearings of the House of Representatives’ Jan. 6 committee, which drew an audience of as many as 20 million viewers, had almost no impact on Americans’ views on the episode, according to a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_080922/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Monmouth University poll</a> taken at the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>A CBS News/YouGov poll <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jan-6-opinion-poll-republican-disapproval-wanes-2024-01-06/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taken this year</a> found Republicans to be broadly supportive of pardoning the rioters, although most also disapproved of their actions at the Capitol.</p><p>But, importantly, Republican voters have told pollsters that they would prefer not to talk about the episode. Another CBS News/YouGov poll <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2024-presidential-primary-trump-v-trump-fatigue-poll-2023-05-01/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taken early in the Republican primary</a> contest last year found that a large majority of likely Republican primary voters — 60 percent — wanted a presidential candidate who would not comment on Jan. 6 at all, rather than either supporting or criticizing the rioters.</p><p>“Jan. 6 is an issue that excites the base, which is why they all keep bringing it up,” Julie Kelly, a journalist and activist who has long supported the defendants and their families, said of Republican politicians. “But in the end, no one wants to come on too strong supporting these people.”</p><p>Independents, like Democrats, are far more likely to view the Jan. 6 participants’ actions as serious and their legal consequences as justified. But efforts by President Biden’s campaign to center the race on Mr. Trump’s attempts to subvert democracy, including on Jan. 6, did little to turn voters against the former president. Vice President Kamala Harris has spent less time on that line of attack.</p><h2 id="link-2c8c0cfd">Inconvenient Allies</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, praying with Brandon Straka, who was sentenced for his actions on Jan. 6, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emil Lippe for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The most die-hard supporters of the Jan. 6 defendants remain a small but persistent constituency on the far right. They hold regular vigils outside the Washington, D.C., jail where some of the rioters are still awaiting trial, occasional protests outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn and panel events and fund-raisers elsewhere.</p><p>They have a handful of dedicated champions in Republican politics who continue to highlight their cause, most notably the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who hosted a hearing on the subject in Washington this week.</p><p>During the primaries, Mr. Trump, too, actively catered to this constituency. Last year, he invited family members of Jan. 6 defendants to <a href="https://x.com/patriottakes/status/1642909540487233536" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dinner at Mar-a-Lago</a>, his private club and residence in Palm Beach, Fla., and hosted an event for them at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club. He opened his first rally of the campaign in Waco, Texas, in March 2023, with “And Justice for All”: a recording of Jan. 6 defendants singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” over a prison phone line as Mr. Trump recites the Pledge of Allegiance, which was produced by operatives close to his campaign.</p><p>“You see the spirit from the hostages,” he said after playing the recording again at a rally in Dayton, Ohio, in March. “They’ve been treated terribly and very unfairly, and you know that, and everybody knows that. And we’re going to be working on that.”</p><p>But Mr. Trump has noticeably, if subtly, eased off such displays in the general election. He has dropped “And Justice for All” from the regular campaign program, and defendants came up less frequently in speeches this summer than they did last winter and spring.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In June, the Patriot Freedom Fund, a prominent Jan. 6 legal defense group, held an event at Mr. Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, where speeches were given by Jan. 6 defendants, including Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, a convicted riot participant who is known to wear a Hitler mustache and has posted antisemitic statements on social media. Mr. Trump sent a video message to the group but did not attend in person.</p><p>Two months later, Phyllis Schlafly’s Eagle Council hosted another event at Bedminster, again featuring Mr. Hale-Cusanelli and other Jan. 6 rioters and activists. Mr. Trump, who was on the premises for a news conference that day, did not meet with them.</p><p>Ultimately, his staff shooed the Jan. 6 participants out of the room to make way for Mr. Trump’s presentation on inflation.</p><p>Campaign staff said that in both cases, the groups had paid to rent the event space at Bedminster, and that Mr. Trump was not aware that Mr. Hale-Cusanelli was going to be attending when he made the video for the June event.</p><p>Regarding Mr. Hale-Cusanelli’s views, Ms. Leavitt, the campaign spokeswoman, said, “President Trump condemns hatred and bigotry of any kind, and does not agree with these statements.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>At the Republican National Convention in July, Jan. 6 was mentioned by only one speaker: the former Trump aide Peter Navarro, who had been released that morning after serving four months in prison for refusing a subpoena from the House Jan. 6 committee.</p><p>Mr. McBride, the lawyer, said that before the convention, he reached out to a group of people he described as being “one phone call away” from Mr. Trump, hoping to convince the former president to have a speaker at the convention who could talk about the plight of the rioters.</p><p>But that did not happen, Mr. McBride said, largely because Trump’s campaign advisers did not want too much focus on the Capitol attack at the event.</p><p>“Jan. 6 has always been an issue that more seasoned people in the Trump campaign have been gatekeepers on,” he said. “And they don’t want to draw more attention to the issue.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Charles Homans is a reporter for The Times and The Times Magazine, covering national politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/charles-homans">More about Charles Homans</a></span></p></div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
