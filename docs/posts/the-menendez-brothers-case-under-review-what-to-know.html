Given the brothers’ age when they committed the murders and their time served, they would be eligible for release under current law, Mr. Gascón said.</p><p>Mr. Gascón had <a href="https://vimeo.com/1015892224?share=copy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> earlier this month that his office was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/arts/menendez-brothers-district-attorney-los-angeles.html" title="">reviewing the case</a>.</p><p>The lawyers for the Menendez brothers have recently called them “exemplary” prisoners, highlighting that they had created programs, counseled and mentored others and pursued higher education even when they had no hope of being released.</p><p>The reconsideration of their life sentences comes at a time when the brothers have been thrust back into the media spotlight thanks to the revelation of new evidence, an army of social media defenders and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/arts/television/menendez-brothers-netflix-monsters.html" title="">recent television series</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/arts/television/menendez-brothers-netflix-takeaways.html" title="">documentary</a> examining their crime and trials.</p><p>Here’s what to know about the Menendez brothers’ case:</p><h2 id="link-637e7577">What happens next?</h2><p>Once Mr. Gascón makes his formal recommendation to the court, it will be up for a judge to decide whether a resentencing is warranted, and if so what it should be.</p><p>The prosecutor&#39;s recommendation is expected to carry some weight with the court.</p><p>While acknowledging that the brothers committed “horrible acts” and that “there is no excuse for murder,” Mr. Gascón said he believed that they engaged in “a journey of redemption and a journey of rehabilitation” while incarcerated even though they had no hope of ever getting out of prison. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It comes as Mr. Gascón, a Democrat, is trailing a conservative challenger running as an independent in next month’s election for Los Angeles County district attorney. He has said that his office’s interest in the case was <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/decision-menendez-brothers-case-not-influenced-politics-da-gascon-says/15461558/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not politically motivated</a> and had been in the works for more than a year.</p><p>When asked on Thursday whether a successor could undo his recommendation if he loses the November election, Mr. Gascón responded “I don’t think so.”</p><h2 id="link-232b8558">What were they convicted of?</h2><p>In 1996, the Menendez brothers were found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/21/us/menendez-brothers-guilty-of-killing-their-parents.html" title="">guilty of first-degree murder</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/us/menendez-brothers-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.html" title="">sentenced to life in prison without parole</a> for killing their parents, Jose, a music executive, and Mary Louise, a former beauty queen who went by the name Kitty.</p><p>It was their second trial. Two years prior, a mistrial was declared after two separate juries (one for each brother) deadlocked over a verdict.</p><p>The trials proceeded quite differently.</p><p>In the first trial, defense lawyers claimed that the brothers had killed their parents after years of sexual, physical and emotional abuse by their father and feared for their lives. Their mother, they said, knew about the abuse but didn’t stop it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Interviews with jurors after the mistrial revealed that some of them questioned how serious the abuse was and to what it extent it justified their actions.</p><p>In the second trial that led to their convictions, where the brothers were tried in front of a single jury, lawyers for the brothers were limited in what evidence and testimony could be presented.</p><p>The judge, Stanley M. Weisberg, prohibited their lawyers from using the “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-04-18-mn-55958-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abuse excuse</a>,” essentially leaving only two options for jurors: an acquittal or a murder conviction.

Milton Andersen, one of Kitty Menendez’s brothers, recently retained a lawyer to oppose the brothers’ release.
