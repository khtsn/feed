Gavin Newsom of California.</p><p>The new Los Angeles County district attorney, Nathan J. Hochman, who was elected on promises to take a tougher approach on crime, has said that he opposes releasing the brothers, and has asked a court to withdraw a resentencing petition put forward by his predecessor. But a similar effort initiated by a court is expected to go forward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A procedural hearing on their bid for resentencing is scheduled for Friday, with more substantive hearings on the issue likely to be held later this month.</p><p>Here’s what to know about the case:</p><h2 id="link-50bb445c">There are three active legal paths that could lead to the brothers regaining their freedom.</h2><p>The first, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/menendez-brothers-prison-sentence.html" title="">resentencing track</a>, was initiated by a court, and has hearings scheduled for later this month. The former Los Angeles County district attorney, George Gascón, had separately filed a petition to push for resentencing, but the new district attorney, Mr. Hochman, is asking the court to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/menendez-brothers-resentencing.html" title="">withdraw that petition</a>.</p><p>The second path is a clemency petition on the desk of Gov. Newsom, who has indicated that he is supportive of re-examining the case. He ordered the state’s parole board to assess whether the brothers would pose a threat to public safety if released.</p><p>The parole board hearings are scheduled for June 13.</p><p>The third path is a habeas corpus petition filed by the brothers’ lawyers, who claimed that newly unearthed evidence of sexual abuse by Jose Menendez, the father of Lyle and Erik, would have altered the outcome of their trial if it had been available at the time. This is considered the least likely path, and Mr. Hochman announced in February that he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/menendez-brothers-nathan-hochman-conviction.html" title="">opposed to a new trial</a>.</p><h2 id="link-5889efce">The new district attorney has said he will not support resentencing.</h2><p>In October, George Gascón, then the Los Angeles County district attorney, asked a judge to resentence the Menendez brothers in a way that would make them eligible for parole.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While acknowledging that the brothers committed “horrible acts,” Mr. Gascón said that he believed that they engaged in “a journey of redemption and a journey of rehabilitation” while incarcerated. A lawyer for the Menendez brothers recently said their rehabilitation had been “exemplary” and highlighted that they had created programs, counseled and mentored others and pursued higher education behind bars.</p><p>On April 9, the new district attorney, Mr. Hochman, a former federal prosecutor, said that prosecutors were prepared to proceed with the court-initiated hearings on resentencing, but his office was asking for Mr. Gascon’s motion to be withdrawn.</p><p>The brothers had also petitioned Gov. Gavin Newsom to grant them clemency, a bid that Mr. Gascón supported. But earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/menendez-brothers-newsom-clemency.html" title="">Mr. Newsom said he would defer</a> to Mr. Hochman’s review and analysis of the case before making any decisions.</p><p>As the brothers make their case to be released, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/us/lyle-erik-menendez-parole-prison-good-behavior.html" title="">portrait of their time in prison</a> has emerged of siblings who came to be regarded as model inmates.</p><h2 id="link-232b8558">What were they convicted of?</h2><p>In 1996, the Menendez brothers were found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/21/us/menendez-brothers-guilty-of-killing-their-parents.html" title="">guilty of first-degree murder</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/us/menendez-brothers-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.html" title="">sentenced to life in prison without parole</a> for killing their parents, Jose, a music executive, and Mary Louise, a former beauty queen who went by the name Kitty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It was their second trial. Two years prior, a mistrial was declared after two separate juries (one for each brother) deadlocked over a verdict.</p><p>The trials proceeded quite differently.</p><p>In the first trial, defense lawyers claimed that the brothers had killed their parents after years of sexual, physical and emotional abuse by their father and that they feared for their lives. Their mother, they said, knew about the abuse but didn’t stop it.</p><p>Interviews with jurors after the mistrial revealed that some of them questioned how serious the abuse was and to what extent it justified their actions.</p><p>In the second trial that led to their convictions, where the brothers were tried in front of a single jury, lawyers for the brothers were limited in what evidence and testimony could be presented.</p><p>The judge, Stanley M. Weisberg, prohibited their lawyers from using the “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-04-18-mn-55958-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abuse excuse</a>,” essentially leaving only two options for jurors: an acquittal or a murder conviction. They went with the latter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h2 id="link-3704c5aa">New evidence has emerged in recent years.</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Erik Menendez, left, in 2016, and Lyle Menendez in 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the past several years, new evidence has come to light.</p><p>Last year, Roy Rosselló, a former member of the boy band Menudo, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/arts/television/menendez-brothers-menudo-roy-rossello-documentary.html" title="">publicly revealed</a> in the Peacock documentary, “Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed” that Jose Menendez had sexually assaulted him at the Menendez family home in New Jersey when he was 14.</p><p>The journalist Robert Rand, who had written extensively about the brothers in his book “The Menendez Murders,” also brought forward a letter that Erik wrote when he was 17 to his cousin, detailing his father’s sexual abuse.</p><p>In the news conference on Oct. 24, Mr. Gascón said that he believed the brothers’ molestation claims.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p><h2 id="link-141fb48a">Where does the family stand?</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joan Andersen VanderMolen, the sister of Kitty Menendez, at a news conference this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damian Dovarganes/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In October, several members of the Menendez family were at the news conference when Mr. Gascón announced his decision to recommend a resentencing.</p><p>“Today is a day filled with hope for our family,” said Anamaria Baralt, a cousin of the brothers who supports their release.</p><p>Earlier this year, two dozen family members called for their resentencing in a letter submitted to the court, arguing that “time has provided perspective” and that “continued incarceration serves no rehabilitative purpose.”</p><p>But not everyone in their family agreed. Milton Andersen, one of Kitty Menendez’s brothers, retained a lawyer to oppose the brothers’ release.
