It can house as many as 1,000 detainees at a time and is expected to play a key role in President Trump’s mass deportation efforts.</p><p>It began housing migrants this month and has since become a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/nyregion/newark-migrants-ras-baraka-ice.html" title="">focal point of protest</a>.</p><p>It is rare for the Department of Justice to pursue federal criminal charges against a sitting member of Congress for matters other than corruption or campaign finance violations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Democrats cast the charges as a significant escalation of the Trump administration’s efforts to tamp down opposition of its immigration agenda, while some Republicans called for the censure of the lawmakers and the expulsion of Ms. McIver.</p><p>The saga is likely to force a broader political showdown in Congress over the separation of powers as Mr. Trump strives to greatly expand his executive authority and Democrats struggle to push back.</p><p>The May 9 clash occurred after Mr. Baraka, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/nyregion/new-jersey-democratic-candidates-for-governor.html" title="">Democrat running for governor</a> of New Jersey, had tried to accompany Ms. McIver and the two other lawmakers during their oversight tour of the facility.</p><p>Mr. Baraka was allowed within the center’s gated perimeter by a security guard who “was under the impression that the mayor was part of the congressional delegation,” according to the criminal complaint. But he was barred from joining them inside the building.</p><p>Mr. Baraka has said that he and several aides stood within the gate for more than an hour, waiting for the lawmakers to leave the facility, before being asked to leave.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the complaint, Robert Tansey, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security, said that “after numerous warnings to leave,” Mr. Baraka had been told that he was about to be placed under arrest.</p><p>Ms. McIver interjected, Mr. Tansey said, “yelling, ‘Hell no! Hell no! Hell no!’”</p><p>According to video footage, a guard opened the locked front gate and Mr. Baraka walked out.</p><p>Video footage and witness accounts depict a large scrum of people being jostled together as masked agents in camouflage uniforms, some carrying guns in holsters, come out from behind a gate to take Mr. Baraka into custody in a public area swarming with protesters.

The agency is considering language that would allow it to deny or terminate a congressional visit for a number of reasons, and to expressly bar visitors from coercing or intimidating agents or detainees.</p><p>Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, did not address the changes being considered, but said that ICE “respects Congress’s oversight authority.”</p><p>“However, they are not above the law,” she said. “All members and staff need to comply with facility rules, procedures and instructions from ICE personnel on site for their own safety, the safety of the detainees and the safety of ICE employees.”</p><p>The charges against Ms. McIver call into question a constitutional protection known as the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/lindsey-graham-speech-debate-clause-supreme-court.html" title="">speech or debate” clause</a>, which offers lawmakers a broad degree of protection from criminal penalties that stem from actions taken while performing legislative duties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Last week, after a spokeswoman for the Trump administration said that charges against Ms. McIver, Ms. Watson Coleman and Mr. Menendez were possible, the Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, said that any criminal charges represented a “red line.”</p><p>“There are clear lines that they just dare not cross,” he <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1449635406203558" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a>.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Jeffries said in a joint statement with other top House Democrats that the charges were “a blatant attempt by the Trump administration to intimidate Congress and interfere with our ability to serve as a check and balance on an out-of-control executive branch.”</p><p>Homeland Security officials welcomed the charges after days of arguing that the clash was emblematic of the broader threat its ICE agents faced as they ramped up immigration arrests and deportations.</p><p>“No one is above the law,” Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, <a href="https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1924617499384930494" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement. “If any person, regardless of political party, influence or status, assaults a law enforcement officer as we witnessed Congresswoman McIver do, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”</p><p>Mark Bonamo<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Luis Ferré-Sadurní is a Times reporter covering immigration, focused on the influx of migrants arriving in the New York region.</p></div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
