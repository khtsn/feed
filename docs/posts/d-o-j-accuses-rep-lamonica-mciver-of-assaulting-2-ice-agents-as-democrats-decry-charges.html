She likened the charges she faced to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/milwaukee-judge-hannah-dugan-immigration.html" title="">indictment of a Wisconsin judge</a> accused of helping an undocumented immigrant elude federal agents.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Newark detention center, known as Delaney Hall, is run by GEO Group, one of the country’s largest private prison companies that in February was awarded a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/nyregion/trump-deportation-facility-newark.html" title="">15-year, $1 billion contract</a> by the Trump administration to house migrants. It can hold as many as 1,000 detainees at a time and is expected to play a key role in President Trump’s mass deportation efforts.</p><p>Delaney began operating this month and has since become a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/nyregion/newark-migrants-ras-baraka-ice.html" title="">hub of protest</a>.</p><p>It is rare for the Department of Justice to pursue federal criminal charges against a sitting member of Congress for matters other than corruption or campaign finance violations.</p><p>Democrats cast the charges as a significant escalation of the administration’s efforts to tamp down opposition of its immigration agenda, while some Republicans called for the censure of the lawmakers and the expulsion of Ms. McIver.</p><p>The saga is likely to force a broader political showdown in Congress over the separation of powers as Mr. Trump strives to greatly expand his executive authority and Democrats struggle to push back.</p><p>Indeed, on Tuesday afternoon, Ms. McIver’s arrest became the centerpiece of an hourslong <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/v8_UzRqBYMI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">House Judiciary Committee</a> hearing led by Representative Jeff Van Drew, a Republican from South Jersey who said his three colleagues from New Jersey were trying “to score political points at the expense of our public safety.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The hearing featured dueling videos. Republicans played footage of Ms. McIver pushing toward Delaney Hall’s front gate as Mr. Baraka was being led away in handcuffs. Democrats contrasted that with images from the Jan. 6 insurrection, noting the deaths and injuries linked to the Capitol riot and that Mr. Trump had pardoned the attackers.</p><p>The May 9 clash occurred after Mr. Baraka, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/nyregion/new-jersey-democratic-candidates-for-governor.html" title="">Democrat running for governor</a> of New Jersey, had tried to accompany Ms. McIver and the two other lawmakers during an oversight tour of the facility.</p><p>Mr. Baraka was allowed within the center’s gated perimeter by a security guard who “was under the impression that the mayor was part of the congressional delegation,” according to the criminal complaint. But he was barred from joining them inside the building.</p><p>Mr. Baraka has said that he and several aides stood within the gate for more than an hour before being asked to leave.</p><p>In the criminal complaint, Robert Tansey, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security, said that “after numerous warnings to leave,” Mr. Baraka, who by then had been joined by the lawmakers, was told that he was about to be placed under arrest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. McIver interjected, Mr. Tansey said, “yelling, ‘Hell no! Hell no! Hell no!’”</p><p>A guard opened the locked front gate and Mr. Baraka walked out.</p><p>Minutes later, video footage shows a large scrum of people being jostled together as masked agents in camouflage uniforms, some carrying guns in holsters, come out from behind a gate to take Mr. Baraka into custody in a public area swarming with protesters. Ms. McIver and the two other members of Congress — Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez — <a href="https://x.com/NJSpotlightNews/status/1920926649777852742" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">can be seen</a> surrounding the mayor as the agents move in.</p><p>Ms. McIver, in an effort to use her body to prevent the mayor’s arrest, “slammed her forearm” into an agent and “tried to restrain” him by “forcibly grabbing him,” Mr. Tansey attested.</p><p>After Mr. Baraka was handcuffed, Ms. McIver pushed an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent and “used each of her forearms to forcibly strike” the officer, he wrote.</p><p>The three lawmakers then toured the facility, as planned — a detail that Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas said belied the government’s claim that Ms. McIver had assaulted officers just minutes beforehand.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“I’m not used to having law enforcement see a crime happen right in front of their faces and then say, ‘Nevermind, we’ll just go about our business. In fact, why don’t you go ahead and come on in,’” Ms. Crockett, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said at the hearing.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators chanted and marched during a protest outside the office of Alina Habba, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Anselm for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In a statement late Monday announcing the charges against Ms. McIver, Alina Habba, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, also revealed that the Justice Department had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/nyregion/new-jersey-congress-ice-charges.html" title="">dropped the trespassing charges</a> against the mayor.</p><p>Susan Vercheak, 74, of Maplewood, N.J., was one of about 30 protesters who gathered early Tuesday outside Ms. Habba’s office. She said she believed that prosecutors had recognized that they “had no case whatsoever” against Mr. Baraka.</p><p>“There was no basis for federal jurisdiction, so they chickened out,” said Ms. Vercheak, a lawyer.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers have pointedly questioned the government’s decision to charge Ms. McIver, noting that it calls into question a constitutional protection known as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/lindsey-graham-speech-debate-clause-supreme-court.html" title="">“speech or debate” clause</a>, which offers lawmakers a broad degree of protection from criminal penalties that stem from actions taken while performing legislative duties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Senator Andy Kim, Democrat of New Jersey, said the charges had “nothing to do with enforcing the law, and everything to do with this administration’s attempt to intimidate those who dare speak against them or expose the truth.”</p><p>The fallout has already led the Homeland Security Department, which houses the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, to draft changes to strengthen its rules on congressional visits to detention centers, according to an internal document obtained by The New York Times.</p><p>ICE is working to update <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/iceFacilityVisitationCongressional.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its guidance</a> to clarify that visitors, including members of Congress and their staff members, “may be subject to arrest or other legal action” if they fail to comply with the agency’s security rules, the document said. The agency is considering language that would allow it to deny or terminate a congressional visit for a number of reasons, and to expressly bar visitors from coercing or intimidating agents or detainees.</p><p>Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, did not address the changes being considered, but said that ICE “respects Congress’s oversight authority.”</p><p>“However, they are not above the law,” she said. “All members and staff need to comply with facility rules, procedures and instructions from ICE personnel on site for their own safety, the safety of the detainees and the safety of ICE employees.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Last week, after Ms. McLaughlin said that charges against the three lawmakers were possible, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House Democratic leader, said that criminal charges represented a “red line.”</p><p>“There are clear lines that they just dare not cross,” he <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1449635406203558" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a>.</p><p>On Monday, he and other top House Democrats called the charges “a blatant attempt by the Trump administration to intimidate Congress and interfere with our ability to serve as a check and balance on an out-of-control executive branch.”</p><p>Homeland Security officials, however, said they welcomed the charges after days of arguing that the clash was emblematic of the broader threat its ICE agents faced as they ramped up immigration arrests and deportations.</p><p>“No one is above the law,” Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, <a href="https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1924617499384930494" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement.</p><p>In Ms. McIver’s congressional district in northern New Jersey, constituent reactions were mixed.</p><p>Masani Barnwell, 62, an owner of the bookstore Source of Knowledge in Newark, said Ms. McIver was “being a protector.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“She could be pushing charges against the people who pushed her,” she said, noting that the congresswoman was also being shoved by agents attempting to detain Mr. Baraka, whose photograph hangs on a wall in the store.</p><p>Brian Melici, a Republican from Roselle Park, N.J., said he believed Ms. McIver should face a “sturdy fine,” but not prison time.</p><p>“You’re talking to federal agents here — you don’t push them around,” Mr. Melici, 70, said.</p><p>“She’s wrong, wrong, wrong, 100 percent wrong,” he added.</p><p>In the neighboring town of Cranford, Naomi Gelfand and Jerry Graff, both Democrats, said they considered the charges part of a campaign of retribution by the Trump administration against outspoken opponents.</p><p>“I think that ICE created a situation where she needed to defend herself, in a human instinct kind of way,” Ms. Gelfand said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“If someone pushes me, I’m not going to let them push me,” Ms. Gelfand, 82, added. “I’m going to push them back.”</p><p>Mark Bonamo<!-- --> and <!-- -->Alyce McFadden<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Luis Ferré-Sadurní is a Times reporter covering immigration, focused on the influx of migrants arriving in the New York region.</p></div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
