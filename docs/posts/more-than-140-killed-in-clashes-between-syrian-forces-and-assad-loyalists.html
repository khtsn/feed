The area has become a tinderbox since Mr. al-Assad was overthrown in early December by a coalition of rebel groups.</p><p>The clashes began on Thursday afternoon after Assad loyalists killed 16 security personnel for the government in the Latakia countryside, the deadliest attack yet on Syria’s new security forces, according to government officials and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has monitored the Syria civil war.</p><p>The government responded in force, deploying scores of security personnel in the countryside and directing thousands more from other cities to the coast as it tried to reestablish authority over a few towns and villages where armed gunmen had effectively seized control overnight. By Friday afternoon, the Syrian authorities still had not wrested back full control over some areas, raising the specter that the new government could lose control over the coast.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Armed Assad loyalists were also holding several security personnel hostage in Jableh, a coastal city in Latakia Province, where they had effectively seized control, according to Nour al-Din Primo, a spokesman for the government in Latakia.</p><p>Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, laid the blame for the violence of the last two days on people loyal to the former regime, saying they were trying to “test” the new Syria and fragment it. He called on them to lay down their weapons and surrender.</p><p>“I congratulate the army and security forces for their commitment to protecting and securing civilians while they were pursuing the remnants of the former regime,” he said in an address that aired on Syrian television.</p><p>He made a point of urging his security forces not to “allow anyone to exceed their limits or overreact,” as reports of some killings by his security forces surfaced throughout the day. (The New York Times could not verify those reports.) Anyone who violates the rights of innocent civilians will be held accountable, Mr. al-Shara added.</p><p>“What distinguishes us from our enemy is our commitment to our principles,” he said.</p><p>It was not immediately clear how many of those killed were fighters from one side or the other. The Syrian Network for Human Rights, which has documented the country’s civil war for years, said scores of civilians were killed in the violence over two days in Tartus and Latakia. But those deaths could not be independently verified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>One video, verified by Reuters and The Times, shows the bodies of at least 20 people who appear to have been shot in the Alawite village of Al-Mukhtaria, about 12 miles east of the provincial capital of Latakia. Blood can be seen around several bodies, as mourners wail over them.</p><p>The fighting on the coast has become a flashpoint for the fractious nation as it emerges from a nearly 14-year civil war and more than 50 years under Assad family dictatorships. The flaring tensions have become a critical test for the new leaders, whose rebel coalition <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/assad-syria.html" title="">toppled Mr. al-Assad</a> and installed an Islamist transitional government that has sought to consolidate control.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/multimedia/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/multimedia/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/multimedia/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Masked men wearing military uniforms walk on a street near a line of vehicles." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/multimedia/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/multimedia/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/multimedia/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/multimedia/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb/07syria-clashes-02-hpfb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/19da64ad-d307-529b-a770-78c7eff51622" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>By Friday, the government had deployed more security personnel to places like Tartus, Syria, as it tried to regain control over a few towns and villages that armed gunmen had effectively seized overnight.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“From the very first day, we have been and continue to face both a covert and open war aimed at breaking the will of the Syrian people,” Syria’s interim foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani, said in a post on X on Friday.</p><p>The war has been fought by “sowing chaos on one hand and attempting political isolation abroad on the other,” he added. “I reassure our people that Syria today has passed the test once again and is forging a way toward the future with strength and determination.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Most residents in Tartus and Latakia were sheltering in their homes on Friday, as military convoys patrolled the streets and security forces conducted “combing operations” to root out armed remnants of the Assad era, according to the state news media.</p><p>The clashes and security operations stoked panic across the coastal region. In several villages and towns, residents said that government security forces had attacked civilians as they swept through.</p><p>On Friday afternoon, dozens of security personnel poured into Basnada, a town in Tartus Province, to conduct a security sweep, according to Yamen, 31, a resident of Basnada who asked to be identified by his first name only for fear of retaliation.</p><p>He said he had been standing by the window of his fifth-floor apartment when one member of the security forces raised his rifle toward him and shot at the apartment complex. In the hours that followed, he saw security forces beating some of his neighbors.</p><p>Jad, an 18-year-old who lives in Baniyas, a suburb on the outskirts of the provincial capital of Latakia, said that he had been sheltering in his home with relatives when security forces broke down their front door on Friday afternoon.

But the ambush on Thursday afternoon appeared to be the most coordinated attack yet and came amid calls among some Assad loyalists to organize against the new government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A man handing in his firearms at a reconciliation center in Damascus in December.

A few hours later, the loudspeakers of some mosques broadcast a message calling on government forces to abandon their weapons and leave town.</p><p>Armed men surrounded the district center, where a few government security forces were stationed, according to Mr. Subh and other residents.</p><p>By dawn on Friday, the government forces had abandoned their posts in Draykish and gunmen had set up checkpoints along major roads in the town, residents said.</p><p>“No one knows how the events escalated so quickly,” Mr. Subh said. “Who coordinated it? Who attacked? No one is entirely sure.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The overnight skirmishes came hours after security personnel conducted an operation in the Latakia countryside to arrest an official from the Assad government, according to a government official who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.</p><p>As the security forces left one village, Beit Aana, gunmen ambushed their convoy, village residents and the official said. At least 16 security personnel were killed, according to the war monitor.</p><p>The Beit Aana ambush set off additional clashes between government forces and armed Assad loyalists in rural Latakia.</p><p>Artillery and machine-gun fire sounded across the area throughout the afternoon as hundreds of people from Beit Aana and nearby villages fled to the countryside,<em> </em>the residents said.
