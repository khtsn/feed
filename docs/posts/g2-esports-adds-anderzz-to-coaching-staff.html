<p>He was credited with being the creative mind behind a lot of FNATIC&#39;s successful team comps in 2023, including the Fade-centric Lotus comp that played a big role in the team lifting <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo" target="_blank">LOCK//IN São Paulo</a>.</p>

<p>While with FNATIC, Anderzz has helped the European giants in lifting LOCK//IN, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1494/champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo" target="_blank">Masters Tokyo</a>, and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2094/champions-tour-2024-emea-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">2024 Stage 2</a>. G2 is still in search of its first international trophy. Additionally, they are aiming to qualify for Champions 2025 to stay in VCT, and Anderzz, who has been to two straight Champions, may provide valuable experience.</p>

<p>With Anderzz&#39;s addition, G2&#39;s full roster is now:</p>

			<p>Yes. There are four classes, duelist, initiator, smoke and sentinel. If some guy wants to make up categories because Magic also has categories, fine. As we have seen in tournaments, it doesn&#39;t help teams. OP is asking why no one picked him up, it is simply that most teams realize very quickly it&#39;s vapor. Adding up points for playstyle? Classifying abilities? Where is the actual insight? </p>
<p>This game is not Overwatch. Abilities are not used at the same rate nor for the same reasons. A player in Valorant can completely ignore his/her/they abilities. They simply play the base counter-strike game and can be successful.</p>
<p>In Magic the Gathering, the cards are abilities. Each card does something.  </p>
<p>And of all the logical fallacies that the VLR discord is ready to attack without notice, you miss the authority bias? Statistical bias? Confirmation bias? Not to mention illusory correlation. </p>
<p>Also shoutout to the VLR fam that follows my posts and downvotes them!</p>		</div>

		<p>While in some sense you are correct that aim is a huge part of success. Saying you can not use abilities is just not true at all. Teams who can’t coordinate their comps but have amazing aim are struggling, for example paper rex. I don’t see many if any examples of players not using abilities who are on a team who is in contention to win a trophy.</p>

<p>I am not arguing that players never use abilities. I am arguing that when there are advantages to be had with abilities, professional players will often use their gun to solve the issue than try to approach the situation with an ability. Many players have been punished having their utility out so I understand why...</p>		</div>

		<p>They don&#39;t. This is demonstratable by watching any post-plant situation. If they are not in main trying to delay with abilities then they are lost. They push bad positions. They get caught out in 1v1s because they don&#39;t understand the angle or how to properly swing as two. I could go on and on.</p>

			<p>The style dynamics alone may not provide much insight directly in pro play, but it&#39;s a powerful starting point for higher Val theory.</p>
<p>The proof is in the flashless Lotus comp that became the default in 2023. If there&#39;s a clever way to approach an cringe Yoru, Tejo, Deadlock, Vyse comp, it&#39;s a reasonable bet that Anderzz can find it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A player can ignore their abilities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I wonder if this is bait. I won&#39;t even respond to that. </p>
<p>And as for all the logical fallacies... Do you think Val teams have the luxury of being able to logically deduce how good a player or coach is? Do you think any team has come even <em>close</em> to what an engine could come up with? We&#39;re not working with much info here, you have to guess and go on scraps of possibility. </p>		</div>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4701010">
		
		
		<div>
			
			<p>Do you know how teams come up with compositions? Do you know how Anderzz came to his conclusion prior to the video? We have to live in a world again where things can be demonstrated.</p>
<p>No one in this space tries new things because getting caught doing a new thing leads to unemployment. No one can explain why they are doing what they are doing. That&#39;s the part that makes me frustrated. And I take particular issue with Anderzz because he&#39;s flooding the community with information in these dense videos that are nothing more than him expanding on a classification that doesn&#39;t need to be subdivided more. There is no benefit. </p>
<p>An agent, by itself, is an expression of the category it belongs to. When you try to freeze these ideas that he is providing, we can already see it disintegrating in the video OP provided. He said that a Jett Dash is DEFINITELY aggro. But that&#39;s because he only sees how he wants to see it. During this period teams were using Jett Dash as an entry tool. But use is not definition. Jett Dash is not always AGGRO, Jett Dash can go backwards and side to side. Waylay is AGGRO. The dash only goes in one direction. Are these agents now the same because he has classified them as AGGRO? In order for his system to exist, everything must be static.</p>
<p>Everyone is copying each other&#39;s work. It rarely takes more than a professional team to win a game or two for a compositions to become meta. There is huge group think going on at this level because the risk is high.</p>		</div>
