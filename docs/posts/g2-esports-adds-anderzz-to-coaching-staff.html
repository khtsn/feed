			<p>Yes. There are four classes, duelist, initiator, smoke and sentinel. If some guy wants to make up categories because Magic also has categories, fine. As we have seen in tournaments, it doesn&#39;t help teams. OP is asking why no one picked him up, it is simply that most teams realize very quickly it&#39;s vapor. Adding up points for playstyle? Classifying abilities? Where is the actual insight? </p>
<p>This game is not Overwatch. Abilities are not used at the same rate nor for the same reasons. A player in Valorant can completely ignore his/her/they abilities. They simply play the base counter-strike game and can be successful.</p>
<p>In Magic the Gathering, the cards are abilities. Each card does something.  </p>
<p>And of all the logical fallacies that the VLR discord is ready to attack without notice, you miss the authority bias? Statistical bias? Confirmation bias? Not to mention illusory correlation. </p>
<p>Also shoutout to the VLR fam that follows my posts and downvotes them!</p>		</div></div>
