<p>He was credited with being the creative mind behind a lot of FNATIC&#39;s successful team comps in 2023, including the Fade-centric Lotus comp that played a big role in the team lifting <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo" target="_blank">LOCK//IN São Paulo</a>.</p>

<p>While with FNATIC, Anderzz has helped the European giants in lifting LOCK//IN, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1494/champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo" target="_blank">Masters Tokyo</a>, and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2094/champions-tour-2024-emea-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">2024 Stage 2</a>. G2 is still in search of its first international trophy. Additionally, they are aiming to qualify for Champions 2025 to stay in VCT, and Anderzz, who has been to two straight Champions, may provide valuable experience.</p>

<p>With Anderzz&#39;s addition, G2&#39;s full roster is now:</p>

			<p>Yes. There are four classes, duelist, initiator, smoke and sentinel. If some guy wants to make up categories because Magic also has categories, fine. As we have seen in tournaments, it doesn&#39;t help teams. OP is asking why no one picked him up, it is simply that most teams realize very quickly it&#39;s vapor. Adding up points for playstyle? Classifying abilities? Where is the actual insight? </p>
<p>This game is not Overwatch. Abilities are not used at the same rate nor for the same reasons. A player in Valorant can completely ignore his/her/they abilities. They simply play the base counter-strike game and can be successful.</p>
<p>In Magic the Gathering, the cards are abilities. Each card does something.  </p>
<p>And of all the logical fallacies that the VLR discord is ready to attack without notice, you miss the authority bias? Statistical bias? Confirmation bias? Not to mention illusory correlation. </p>
<p>Also shoutout to the VLR fam that follows my posts and downvotes them!</p>		</div>

		<p>While in some sense you are correct that aim is a huge part of success. Saying you can not use abilities is just not true at all. Teams who can’t coordinate their comps but have amazing aim are struggling, for example paper rex. I don’t see many if any examples of players not using abilities who are on a team who is in contention to win a trophy.</p>
