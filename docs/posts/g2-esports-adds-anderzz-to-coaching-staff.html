<p>He was credited with being the creative mind behind a lot of FNATIC&#39;s successful team comps in 2023, including the Fade-centric Lotus comp that played a big role in the team lifting <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo" target="_blank">LOCK//IN São Paulo</a>.</p>

<p>While with FNATIC, Anderzz has helped the European giants in lifting LOCK//IN, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1494/champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo" target="_blank">Masters Tokyo</a>, and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2094/champions-tour-2024-emea-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">2024 Stage 2</a>. G2 is still in search of its first international trophy. Additionally, they are aiming to qualify for Champions 2025 to stay in VCT, and Anderzz, who has been to two straight Champions, may provide valuable experience.</p>

			<p>Yes. There are four classes, duelist, initiator, smoke and sentinel. If some guy wants to make up categories because Magic also has categories, fine. As we have seen in tournaments, it doesn&#39;t help teams. OP is asking why no one picked him up, it is simply that most teams realize very quickly it&#39;s vapor. Adding up points for playstyle? Classifying abilities? Where is the actual insight? </p>
<p>This game is not Overwatch. Abilities are not used at the same rate nor for the same reasons. A player in Valorant can completely ignore his/her/they abilities. They simply play the base counter-strike game and can be successful.</p>
<p>In Magic the Gathering, the cards are abilities. Each card does something.  </p>
<p>And of all the logical fallacies that the VLR discord is ready to attack without notice, you miss the authority bias? Statistical bias? Confirmation bias? Not to mention illusory correlation. </p>
<p>Also shoutout to the VLR fam that follows my posts and downvotes them!</p>		</div>

		<p>While in some sense you are correct that aim is a huge part of success. Saying you can not use abilities is just not true at all. Teams who can’t coordinate their comps but have amazing aim are struggling, for example paper rex. I don’t see many if any examples of players not using abilities who are on a team who is in contention to win a trophy.</p>

<p>I am not arguing that players never use abilities. I am arguing that when there are advantages to be had with abilities, professional players will often use their gun to solve the issue than try to approach the situation with an ability. Many players have been punished having their utility out so I understand why...</p>		</div>

		<p>They don&#39;t. This is demonstratable by watching any post-plant situation. If they are not in main trying to delay with abilities then they are lost. They push bad positions. They get caught out in 1v1s because they don&#39;t understand the angle or how to properly swing as two. I could go on and on.</p>

			<p>The style dynamics alone may not provide much insight directly in pro play, but it&#39;s a powerful starting point for higher Val theory.</p>
<p>The proof is in the flashless Lotus comp that became the default in 2023. If there&#39;s a clever way to approach an cringe Yoru, Tejo, Deadlock, Vyse comp, it&#39;s a reasonable bet that Anderzz can find it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A player can ignore their abilities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I wonder if this is bait. I won&#39;t even respond to that. </p>
<p>And as for all the logical fallacies... Do you think Val teams have the luxury of being able to logically deduce how good a player or coach is? Do you think any team has come even <em>close</em> to what an engine could come up with? We&#39;re not working with much info here, you have to guess and go on scraps of possibility. </p>		</div>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4701010">
		
		
		<div>
			
			<p>Do you know how teams come up with compositions? Do you know how Anderzz came to his conclusion prior to the video? We have to live in a world again where things can be demonstrated.</p>
<p>No one in this space tries new things because getting caught doing a new thing leads to unemployment. No one can explain why they are doing what they are doing. That&#39;s the part that makes me frustrated. And I take particular issue with Anderzz because he&#39;s flooding the community with information in these dense videos that are nothing more than him expanding on a classification that doesn&#39;t need to be subdivided more. There is no benefit. </p>
<p>An agent, by itself, is an expression of the category it belongs to. When you try to freeze these ideas that he is providing, we can already see it disintegrating in the video OP provided. He said that a Jett Dash is DEFINITELY aggro. But that&#39;s because he only sees how he wants to see it. During this period teams were using Jett Dash as an entry tool. But use is not definition. Jett Dash is not always AGGRO, Jett Dash can go backwards and side to side. Waylay is AGGRO. The dash only goes in one direction. Are these agents now the same because he has classified them as AGGRO? In order for his system to exist, everything must be static.</p>
<p>Everyone is copying each other&#39;s work. It rarely takes more than a professional team to win a game or two for a compositions to become meta. There is huge group think going on at this level because the risk is high.</p>		</div>

			<p>I believe your perspective on Valorant—describing it as &#39;CQB problems with anime solutions&#39;—may not resonate with the broader competitive community. While you have shared your interview experience, it&#39;s important to recognize that these opportunities don’t necessarily equate to deeper expertise.</p>
<p>Regarding your role within your Tier 3 Premier team, it seems there are concerns about leadership and communication following your initial team meeting. If there are issues within the team, it may be worth reflecting on how to foster a more constructive and collaborative environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, engaging in debates with younger people (many of whom are still in their early teens) on public forums like VLR may not be the most effective way to discuss competitive strategy. If you&#39;re truly interested in high-level discussions, it might be more beneficial to connect with respected coaches and analysts within the scene but thats the thing, i dont think anyone with any standing does respect you</p>
<p>If you’re open to a direct conversation, I’d be happy to continue this discussion on Discord in a more professional and productive setting.</p>		</div>

			<p>Oh yes, I forgot. I was given many opportunities by people in this community who commented on my document to discuss it with them. I must of blacked out from the exhaustion during my moments with VCTEsports Tiktok, Platchat, numerous pro players, semi-pro coaches and the countless people, like yourself, the true intellectuals. </p>
<p>Yeah and I figured the nice thing I did would come back to bite me.</p>
<p>And the assumptions you&#39;re making about me not having conversations with respected people is unfounded. Just like your confidence in attacking me. </p>
<p>Also I debate for fun and to watch performative displays of people who think they can just HAVE knowledge and for that untested knowledge to be correct. The confidence is awe inspiring. </p>		</div>

			<p>Your approach to discussion and analysis often comes across as excessive, and many in the community feel that you overestimate your own insights. While you may be confident in your understanding, that does not necessarily place you above others, including respected figures at the highest levels of competition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I must of blacked out from the exhaustion during my moments with VCTEsports Tiktok, Platchat, numerous pro players, semi-pro coaches</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your past interactions with platforms like VCTEsports TikTok, Platchat, and various professional and semi-professional players and coaches do not necessarily equate to influence or credibility. Simply being present in those spaces does not mean your contributions were valued or impactful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also I debate for fun and to watch performative displays of people who think they can just HAVE knowledge and for that untested knowledge to be correct. The confidence is awe inspiring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, your own words suggest a contradiction in your perspective. You claim to debate for entertainment and to challenge those who assume knowledge without proper validation. However, by your own logic, what have you personally accomplished to substantiate your views? You acknowledge preferring unconventional strategies over established fundamentals, which is a respectable stance. However, advocating for close-quarters combat (CQB) over core fundamentals in a tactical shooter raises questions about the validity of your approach.</p>
<p>Ultimately, regardless of any success you might achieve, your reputation will be shaped not just by your results but by how you engage with the community and how your ideas align with the broader competitive landscape.</p>		</div>
