Putin had ordered a three-day cease-fire in Ukraine next month, the second time in two weeks that Russia’s leader has promised a temporary pause in the fighting as President Trump shows growing impatience with his refusal to stop the war.</p><p>The Kremlin said that Russian forces would stop fighting on May 8 for 72 hours to mark the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/09/world/europe/russia-victory-day-may-9.html" title="">May 9</a> celebration of the Soviet Union’s victory in World War II, a major holiday in Russia. </p><p>“During this period, all hostilities will cease,” the Kremlin said in a statement. “Russia believes that the Ukrainian side should follow this example.”</p><p>Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the declaration “underlines our willingness to get on the path toward a peaceful resolution.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>However, Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, responded to the Kremlin statement by saying that “if Russia truly wants peace, it must cease fire immediately.” He added that Ukraine remained ready for a 30-day halt in the fighting, something that Mr. Putin has thus far rejected.</p><p>“Why wait until May 8th?” Mr. Sybiha <a href="https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1916836168110399883" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X. He continued, “Ukraine is ready to support a lasting, durable, and full ceasefire.”</p><p>The Kremlin’s announcement came just days after Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/russia-trump-putin-ukraine.html" title="">urged Mr. Putin, in a social media post, to “STOP!”</a> bombarding Ukraine amid U.S.-backed efforts to broker a truce. After meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Saturday, Mr. Trump said that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/27/us/trump-news/trump-says-putin-may-not-want-peace-and-may-need-to-be-dealt-with-differently?smid=url-share" title="">questioned</a> whether Mr. Putin truly wanted peace.</p><p>“Maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently,” Mr. Trump wrote in a social media <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114404524335638236" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>.</p><p>Russia has refused to abide by a 30-day unconditional cease-fire that Ukraine previously agreed to at the urging of the Trump administration. A one-day truce announced by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/world/europe/ukraine-russia-easter-truce.html" title="">Mr. Putin for Easter</a> did not hold, though both sides said it brought a reduction in hostilities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Putin’s declaration on Monday appeared to be his latest attempt to placate Mr. Trump’s oft-stated desire to end the war in Ukraine while holding out for an agreement that would allow the Russian leader to do so on his terms.</p><p>When asked about the Kremlin’s announcement, Karoline Leavitt, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, told reporters that the U.S. president “has made it clear he wants to see a permanent cease-fire.”</p><p>“While he remains optimistic he can strike a deal, he’s also being realistic as well, and both leaders need to come to the table to negotiate their way out of this,” Ms. Leavitt added.</p><p>The Kremlin’s statement announcing the cease-fire said that Russia was ready “for peace negotiations without preconditions.” But it added that those talks should be “directed at eliminating the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis,” a reference to Mr. Putin’s sweeping demands for change in Russia’s favor in Ukraine and in Europe.</p><p>Mr. Putin appears convinced that he would give up negotiating leverage if he were to stop fighting without securing major concessions first, Russian analysts and people close to the Kremlin say. His demands go well beyond claims on Ukraine’s territory, extending to limits on its future military capability and a ban on admitting it to the NATO alliance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Trump administration has largely gone along with Mr. Putin’s narrative, dangling the possibility of lifting sanctions on Russia while blaming Ukraine for a war that Russia started in 2022. It has been pushing Ukraine to accept a peace plan that would force it to abandon its aspirations of joining NATO, provide it with only vague security guarantees and have the United States officially recognize Crimea as Russian. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/europe/ukraine-peace-counterproposal.html" title="">Ukraine</a> has rejected that deal, which the Trump administration described as its final offer.</p><p>But Mr. Putin appears to be holding out for even more. In the meantime, his refusal to make a quick deal — accompanied by recent Russian missile strikes on civilian targets — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/europe/russia-ukraine-trump.html" title="">has increasingly frustrated the Trump administration</a>.</p><p>On Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/us/politics/trump-ukraine-rubio-zelensky-putin.html" title="">would decide this week whether to continue pursuing a settlement</a>.</p><p>“We have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” “or if it’s time to sort of focus on some other issues that are equally if not more important in some cases.”</p><p>Maria Varenikova<!-- --> and <!-- -->Luke Broadwater<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anton Troianovski is the Moscow bureau chief for The Times.
