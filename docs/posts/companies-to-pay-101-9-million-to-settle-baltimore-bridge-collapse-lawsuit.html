Mizer said in a statement.</p><p>A spokesman for Grace Ocean Private Ltd., which owns the Dali ship, and Synergy Marine Private Ltd., which operates the vessel, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The companies are based in Singapore.</p><p>In its suit, filed in September, the Justice Department laid out in detail what investigators had learned about the ship’s short and catastrophic journey on March 26, describing a cascade of failures onboard and multiple points during which when the disaster could have been prevented.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Because of poor maintenance or “jury-rigged” fixes to serious problems aboard the ship, “none of the four means available to help control the Dali — her propeller, rudder, anchor, or bow thruster — worked when they were needed to avert or even mitigate this disaster,” the suit asserted.</p><p>Instead, just before dawn, the Dali, which was bound for Sri Lanka, lost power as it pulled out of the port, regained power and then lost power again before striking the bridge, which collapsed and plunged into the water, killing six people working on the bridge. The ship and the fallen bridge blocked the channel and severed a transportation artery, bringing maritime business to a halt.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
