Mizer, the principal deputy associate attorney general, said in a statement.</p><p>A spokesman for Grace Ocean Private Ltd., which owns the Dali ship, and Synergy Marine Private Ltd., which operates the vessel, did not immediately provide comment. The companies are based in Singapore.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/justice-department-suit-baltimore-bridge-collapse.html" title="">In its suit, filed in September</a>, the Justice Department laid out in detail what investigators had learned about the ship’s short and catastrophic journey on March 26, describing a cascade of failures onboard and multiple points during which when the disaster could have been prevented.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Because of poor maintenance or “jury-rigged” fixes to serious problems aboard the ship, “none of the four means available to help control the Dali — her propeller, rudder, anchor, or bow thruster — worked when they were needed to avert or even mitigate this disaster,” the suit asserted.</p><p>Instead, just before dawn, the Dali, which was bound for Sri Lanka, lost power as it pulled out of the port, regained power and then lost power again before striking the bridge, which collapsed and plunged into the water, killing six people working on the bridge. The ship and the fallen bridge blocked the channel and severed a transportation artery, bringing maritime business at one of the nation’s busiest ports to a halt.</p><p>The Justice Department’s suit arose from the companies’ effort to limit their liability to $44 million. Under federal law, shipowners can cap their legal responsibility if they can prove that they did not know about serious problems with a vessel beforehand. But the government argued that the owners knew that the Dali was unseaworthy before it left port.</p><p>A separate criminal investigation by the Justice Department is continuing. In September, federal agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/us/fbi-dali-ship-baltimore-bridge-collapse.html" title="">boarded a container ship</a> in the Baltimore harbor that is also managed by Synergy, though the authorities have not said why agents boarded the vessel.</p><p>The settlement announced on Thursday, which will cover the costs that the federal government bore in responding to the disaster, is far from a final legal resolution, given a lengthy list of claims against the companies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The state of Maryland, which is responsible for rebuilding the bridge, has also sued the companies. The new bridge is expected to take four years to build and cost $1.9 billion.</p><p>The families of three of the men who were killed announced in September that they were suing. The construction firm that employed the men also filed a lawsuit, as have several other companies that depend on port traffic for commerce. The city of Baltimore filed a lawsuit against Grace Ocean and Synergy in the spring.</p><p>The ship was carrying around 4,700 containers, as well as 1.5 million gallons of fuel and lubricant oil. There was a 21-person crew on board, most of whom were Indian citizens. One crew member sustained minor injuries in the crash.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Campbell Robertson reports on Delaware, the District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/campbell-robertson">More about Campbell Robertson</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-justice-department">U.S. Justice Department</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Defining the Midwest: </strong>From the geographic boundaries to the values and friendliness, people have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/us/midwest-states-harris-trump.html">debated what defines the Midwest for 200 years</a>.
