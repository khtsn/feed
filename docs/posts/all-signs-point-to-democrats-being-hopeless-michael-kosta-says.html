Michael Kosta was unimpressed with how Democratic lawmakers chose to express their opposition.</p><p>On “The Daily Show,” Kosta said the speech was “a theatrical production where everybody has a role, and they slip right into it.”</p><blockquote><p>“Democrats showed up in full wardrobe, dressed in pink as a symbolic protest against people who wanted them to do something meaningful.” <em>— MICHAEL KOSTA</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fb6oHu5A4Ak" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><blockquote><p>“They came with props, too, holding up little paddles like they were ready to give Mike Johnson a naughty little spanking, huh? Either that or a pickleball match.” <em>— MICHAEL KOSTA</em></p><p>“Trump was confused by the paddles. He was, like, ‘We’re not auctioning off Greenland until later.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“What turned out to be an amazing night for America coincided with the worst night for Democrats since Republicans canceled slavery.” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Luckily, Democrats stood up to him the only way they know how: by writing about it later in their diaries.” <em>— TAYLOR TOMLINSON</em></p><p>”I really love that while Trump was saying the wildest <em>[expletive]</em> on earth, Democrats just sat there with their little paddles.
