But just in case, a small notebook where she has carefully written out the ingredients is propped up at the back of the steel counter: 18 lemons; 420 grams of butter; 900 grams of sugar; 24 eggs.</p><p>The recipe is from <a href="https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/chefs/adam-simmonds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adam Simmonds,</a> a celebrated Michelin star-winning chef. Novices like Ms. Mohamed are not usually found in his kitchens, but this new, upscale dining venture is not usual. Almost every member of the 19-person team has been homeless.</p><p>“The crew downstairs in the kitchen, they make so many mistakes, but that’s OK,” Mr. Simmonds said with a laugh. “We accept that and we learn from it.”</p><p>He is sitting upstairs in the front dining room. A large window overlooks the main commercial street in Primrose Hill, a neighborhood in north London that oozes British charm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The idea was hatched four years ago by Alex Brown, director of Soup Kitchen London, where Mr. Simmonds took a turn cooking at the start of the pandemic. The most common question from those who lined up for food was “Do you know of any jobs?”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Home Kitchen is aimed at breaking the cycle of homelessness and joblessness by training people for a career in the restaurant industry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In cities across Britain and the world, homelessness and joblessness feed upon each other. Most employers won’t hire someone who does not have a stable address, which means the homeless can’t earn the money to afford a place to live.</p><p>Home Kitchen aims to break that cycle by training people for a career in the restaurant industry. Before opening day, recruits took a three-week culinary crash course and then spent two weeks in a kitchen at the Megaro, the five-star hotel where Mr. Simmonds was recently appointed <a href="https://www.themegaro.co.uk/insight/adam-simmonds-appointed-chef-patron-at-the-megaro-hotel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chef patron</a>.</p><p>They are on full-time contracts earning London’s living wage — 13.15 pounds ($17.58) an hour — plus a travel allowance for their commute. Meals are provided during a shift.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This day, dinner was toad-in-the-hole, a traditional British dish of sausages in Yorkshire pudding batter, macaroni and cheese and gorgeously crisped roast potatoes. It was prepared by the head chef, one of four professionals who oversee operations.</p><p>If workers pass a 90-day probationary period, they are eligible for a fully paid, yearlong certification course in culinary skills from Westminster Kingsway College.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“We need to build their confidence,” Michelin-star winning chef Adam Simmonds said of his crew. “We need to allow them to make mistakes.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The founders were able to crowd fund £350,000 (about $468,000) in cash and in-kind donations. Another £210,000 was borrowed from a philanthropic social-impact fund. They also partnered with several other charities and organizations to help support the staff. The aim of this nonprofit is to become self-sustaining.</p><p>The kitchen has little resemblance to the grueling, high-pressure atmosphere depicted in fictional series like “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/dining/the-bear-season-3.html" title="">The Bear</a>” or “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/arts/television/boiling-point-netflix.html" title="">Boiling Point</a>,” where the head chef collapsed from a heart attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“We need to build their confidence,” Mr. Simmonds said. “We need to allow them to make mistakes” — like handing him dill when he asked for chervil. The veteran managers have to have empathy, he said, to “understand and teach and nurture.”</p><p>Mr. Simmonds repeatedly revised the menu before opening to ensure dishes could be successfully executed by inexperienced workers. A goat cheese mousse with figs, for instance, was dropped. He realized that the techniques, including poaching a fig and artfully placing its leaf, were too complicated.</p><p>Now, there is a single prix fixe £35 ($47) menu for lunch and dinner with a choice of three appetizers and entrees. Most of the preparation can be done in advance. The lamb and chicken are cooked with a sous vide machine, which is precise and consistent. A £65 tasting menu is also offered.</p><p>Everyone is figuring things out as they go along.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The evening service.

(The first is a turnip-like root; the second, a fish from the turbot family.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ms. Mohamed had to learn how to test whether the lemon tart mixture was heated to the right consistency. (Dip the spatula in the filling and swipe a finger down the middle to check if it cleanly separates.)</p><p>Illia Kovalenko, a 20-year-old Ukrainian refugee, needed lessons in cocktail making.</p><p>At the moment, Mr. Simmonds’ hours are long. Between here and the Megaro, where he is launching a second restaurant, he is putting in 17-hour days. “I can’t continue to do that,” he acknowledged.</p><p>But problems pop up. Last week, the temporary housing for two staff members fell through and they spent a few nights on the street. The team helped find a hostel placement and they are continuing to work.</p><p>Mr. Simmonds knows how easy it is to teeter into homelessness. A recovering cocaine addict, the star chef remembers when he couldn’t pay his rent. His family took him in.</p><p>People wind up on the streets for all kinds of reasons, he said. “We’re giving them that second opportunity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Simmonds, who has struggled with relapses, has had a few second chances himself. “I’m 30-something days clean and sober,” he said, sipping a glass of sparkling water.</p><p>Roughly the same amount of time that Home Kitchen has been open.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>If workers pass a 90-day probationary period, they are eligible for a fully paid, yearlong certification course in culinary skills from Westminster Kingsway College.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Patricia Cohen writes about global economics and is based in London.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patricia-cohen">More about Patricia Cohen</a></span></p></div></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/01/world/europe/restaurant-london-homeless.html">92</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
