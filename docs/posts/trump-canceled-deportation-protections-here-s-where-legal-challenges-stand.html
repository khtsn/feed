In response to the administration’s emergency application, the Supreme Court on Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/politics/supreme-court-protected-status-venezuelans.html" title="">allowed the government to move forward</a> with plans to lift those protections — at least for now.</p><p>But other cases involving immigrants with protected status are moving forward, as well, with thousands of people in limbo.

It aimed to halt the immediate suspension of several temporary status programs, as well as Trump administration efforts to block people already granted humanitarian parole from applying for other, more permanent pathways to stay in the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This lawsuit challenges the steps the Trump administration has taken to radically limit what had up to this point been a broad power granted by Congress to allow the executive to respond to migration challenges, address global humanitarian crises, and further important foreign policy objectives in a flexible and adaptive way,” the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.281389/gov.uscourts.mad.281389.1.0_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initial complaint</a> said.</p><p>Despite the Supreme Court considering one aspect of this case, it is far from over, and could affect people from other nations.
