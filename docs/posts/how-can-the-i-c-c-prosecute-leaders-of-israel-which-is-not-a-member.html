The court, based in The Hague, in the Netherlands, was created more than two decades ago to prosecute crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide and the crime of aggression.</p><p>The court has accused Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gallant of using starvation as a weapon of war, among other charges, in the conflict with Hamas in Gaza. And it accused Muhammad Deif, a key plotter of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel, of crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, sexual violence and hostage taking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/middleeast/us-icc-member-countries.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">Powerful countries, including Russia, the United States and China, do not recognize</a> the authority of the court. They have not ratified the Rome Statute, do not honor international warrants issued by the court and would not turn over their own citizens for prosecution.</p><p>Neither Israel nor Gaza are members of the court. But while many nations do not recognize a <a href="https://asp.icc-cpi.int/states-parties/asian-states/Palestine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">State of Palestine</a>, the court has done so <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-rejects-state-israels-challenges#:~:text=On%202%20January%202015%2C%20The,Palestine%20on%201%20April%202015.." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">since 2015</a>, when leaders of the Palestinian Authority, which controls much of the West Bank, signed on.</p><p>Although Gaza has been controlled by Hamas since 2007 and the militant group does not recognize its subjugation to a Palestine state, the court ruled that it has jurisdiction over the Palestinian territories of Gaza, the occupied-West Bank and East Jerusalem.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant  of Israel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Abir Sultan</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“I would argue it makes Hamas actions even more susceptible to I.C.C. jurisdiction because Hamas has demonstrated its role as the governing authority of that part of the State of Palestine, and, thus, with such authority comes responsibility, including for the commission of atrocity crimes,” said David Scheffer, a former U.S. ambassador and a chief negotiator of the statute that established the court.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Critical to the court’s power, its jurisdiction can extend beyond member states. The Rome Statute empowers the U.N. Security Council, acting under U.N. Charter, to refer crimes of atrocity committed in any country — member of the international court or not — to the legal body for investigation.</p><p>The Security Council referred Sudan to the court in 2005 over the humanitarian situation in Darfur, and Libya in 2011 though neither country is a member of the court.</p><p>Experts said that, given the current tensions among the Council’s five permanent members (Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States), it was unlikely that the Council would unanimously refer an individual to the court for prosecution anytime soon.</p><p>“Given the dysfunctional character of the U.N.S.C. in recent years, it is unlikely any such proposed referral of any particular situation in the world would survive a veto,” Mr. Scheffer said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-69fe1fa0">Has the court sought to prosecute leaders from nonmember countries?</h2><p>Yes. Russia is not a member of the court, but in 2023 it issued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/03/17/world/russia-ukraine-putin-news/the-international-criminal-court-issues-an-arrest-warrant-for-putin?smid=url-share" title="">an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir V.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, the former leader of Libya. Neither country is a member of the court.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/world/asia/international-criminal-court-afghanistan-united-states.html" title="">2017</a>, the court’s prosecutor began to investigate allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan, including any that might have been committed by Americans. In response, Washington imposed sanctions on and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/world/europe/us-icc-prosecutor-afghanistan.html" title="">revoked</a> the visa of Fatou Bensouda, the court’s chief prosecutor at the time. The court later dropped its investigation.</p><h2 id="link-23db78aa">Can the court enforce arrest warrants?</h2><p>While the court’s reach may be virtually universal in theory, its power is ultimately in the hands of its members.</p><p>The court cannot try in absentia those accused of crimes and has no mechanism to make defendants stand trial. It relies on member states to act as enforcers and to detain suspects before they can stand trial in The Hague. Not all member states, however, abide by the agreement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary said on Friday that he had invited Mr. Netanyahu to visit his country, which is a member of the court, and that he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/world/middleeast/netanyahu-orban-icc-hungary-israel.html" title="">overlook</a> his formal obligation to act on the court’s arrest warrant.</p><p>In September, Mr. Putin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/europe/putin-mongolia.html" title="">visited</a> Mongolia, another member, without being arrested.</p><p>Mr. al-Bashir visited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/world/africa/icc-south-africa-sudan-bashir.html" title="">South Africa</a>, which is also a member, to attend the 2015 African Union summit.
