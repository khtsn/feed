However, the jump was less than the overall increase in settlement grants for all nationalities, which rose by 37 percent in the same period.</p><p>Mr. Paramesvaran believes that the rate of settlement applications will accelerate further in the coming months after the British government recently announced that most people would have to live in the country for 10 years, rather than the current five, before they can apply for permanent settlement.</p><p>“People are worried about what may be on the horizon in terms of potential changes to qualification periods,” he said. “It’s a case of people wanting to take advantage of the rules and guidance as they exist today.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said in Parliament on May 12 that some people might qualify <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-05-12/debates/28890B56-B3B5-4F1D-A5D2-19BA7B139E55/ImmigrationSystem" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“more swiftly”</a> for permanent settlement in Britain depending on the “contribution” they made, but that the exact details would not finalized until later this year.</p><p>Marley Morris, associate director for migration at the London-based Institute for Public Policy Research, said there were likely a “few things going on” behind the overall increase in settlement applications from around the world, with “political motivations” being among several factors.</p><p>“There are a whole load of people who are becoming eligible for settlement and that is filtering through the system,” Mr. Morris added.</p><p>Successive British governments have been seeking to cut net migration, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/world/europe/uk-net-migration-data.html" title="">which halved in 2024 according to figures released on Thursday</a>. That decline followed a tightening of restrictions by the previous Conservative administration.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
