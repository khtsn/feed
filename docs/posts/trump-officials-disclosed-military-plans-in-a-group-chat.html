    <h1>Trump Officials Disclosed Military Plans in a Group Chat</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The White House confirmed today that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had revealed secret war plans in an encrypted chat group that included a journalist, two hours before U.S. troops launched attacks against the Houthi militia in Yemen. It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/hegseth-classified-war-plans-group-chat.html" title="">an extraordinary breach of American national-security intelligence</a> that shocked several Defense Department officials.</p><p>The chat included some of the most influential figures in President Trump’s inner circle, among them Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser. Waltz mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the group. Goldberg, who was included in the highly sensitive conversation for the two days leading up to the strikes, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published an article today about the exchange</a>.</p><p>Hegseth described the war plans on the commercial messaging app Signal, rather than the secure government channels that would normally be used for classified and highly sensitive war planning. That in itself could be a violation of the Espionage Act, Pentagon officials said.</p><p>In addition, the officials said that revealing operational war plans before planned strikes could also put American troops directly into harm’s way.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Trump denied knowing anything about the chat, but the incident provided a stark reminder of an earlier Washington controversy: Both the president and many of his allies suggested Hillary Clinton should have been imprisoned for using a private email server while she was secretary of state.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An oil refining plant in Venezuela, pictured last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Federico Parra/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-4fd2c002">Trump threatened to use tariffs to punish Venezuela</h2><p>Trump said today that he would impose a 25 percent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/trump-tariffs-venezuela-oil.html" title="">tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from any country that purchased oil from Venezuela</a>. The president described the move as punishment, claiming that Venezuela had “purposefully and deceitfully” sent criminals into America.</p><p>The unconventional use of tariffs could further disrupt the global oil trade as buyers of Venezuelan oil seek alternatives. The U.S. and China have been the top recent buyers, and India and Spain buy a small amount. But some trade and sanctions experts questioned how effectively the U.S. could enforce the tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian houses damaged in Russian strikes last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-4e9948d0">U.S. officials discussed cease-fire steps with Russians</h2><p>Russian officials met today with U.S. envoys in Saudi Arabia, after a similar meeting a day earlier between American and Ukrainian delegations. The talks were expected to focus on details of a partial cease-fire to halt attacks on energy facilities and ships in the Black Sea. Ukraine has said that it is ready for a full truce, while the Kremlin has made it clear that it will seek a wide range of concessions first. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/world/europe/russia-ukraine-truce-talks.html" title="">Here’s what we know about the negotiations</a>.</p><p>As our Moscow bureau chief, Anton Troianovski, explained, Vladimir Putin appears determined to squeeze as many benefits as possible from Trump’s desire for a Ukraine peace deal. Moscow believes that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/europe/trump-russia-putin-ukraine.html" title="">better ties with Washington are an economic and geopolitical boon</a> that could be achieved even as Russian missiles pound Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photo Illustration by Tony Cenicola/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-54a9cbf0">Paper bags might not be as green as you think</h2><p>Brown paper bags have become a popular choice at the grocery checkout, as more cities and states have banned single-use plastic bags. They are supposed to be more environmentally friendly, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/climate/shopping-bags-paper-plastic-grocery-totes.html" title="">but it’s complicated</a>.</p><p>They tend to require more energy to make than plastic ones and they produce potent greenhouse gases as they break down. Reusable totes, too, require more resources to make. But the more you use any bag, the greener it will be.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Angelina Jolie at Atelier Jolie in Manhattan, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Clement Pascal for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-1077150">Angelina Jolie wants to pick up where Basquiat left off</h2><p>In a two-story Manhattan building once owned by Andy Warhol and inhabited by Jean-Michel Basquiat, the actress Angelina Jolie is trying to build a hub for artists and makers.

Is it any good?</h2><p>Weeks before its official opening date, a star-studded revival of the Shakespeare tragedy “Othello” was already the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/theater/othello-broadway-tickets-denzel-washington-gyllenhaal.html" title="">hottest ticket in New York</a>. During one week of previews, the play, which stars Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, earned more than any nonmusical has ever made in a single week on Broadway.</p><p>Last night, after Joe Biden, Jennifer Lopez, Samuel L. Jackson and other celebrities showed up for the premiere, our critic, Jesse Green, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/theater/othello-broadway-review-washington-gyllenhaal.html" title="">published his review</a>. He found a fascinating change from most other versions of the play: This time, Jesse writes, Gyllenhaal’s Iago is “far more legible than his master,” Washington’s Othello — who, like the actor in his movies, leads with action.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jennifer Tilly at her home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sinna Nasseri for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emma Fishman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Terry Graham; Top left: David Chow</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><h2 id="link-3de014c6">Is British food still a joke?</h2><p>It’s hard to describe classic British dishes without reinforcing the stereotype that English food is bland, beige and soggy. Perhaps it was the Puritans’ self-deprivation, or the rationing during World War II.</p><p>But London has developed a world-class restaurant scene, with flavors from around the world. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/t-magazine/british-food-london.html" title="">traditional British fare is improving, too</a> — thanks to an online fascination with British grimness and a new generation of chefs. Sure, British food might still be mostly brown. “But we love brown food,” one chef said.</p><p>Have a simple evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
