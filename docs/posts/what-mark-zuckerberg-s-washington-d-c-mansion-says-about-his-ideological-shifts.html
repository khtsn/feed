Over the years, he’s evolved from a critic of President Trump to MAGA ally. He’s abandoned his hoodie and gray T-shirt for a shearling jacket and a gold chain. Following the assassination attempt on Mr. Trump last year, Mr. Zuckerberg called the former and soon-to-be president’s reaction “badass” and visited his Mar-a-Lago estate. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/18/multimedia/18re-zuckerberg-kbcv/18re-zuckerberg-kbcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/18/multimedia/18re-zuckerberg-kbcv/18re-zuckerberg-kbcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/18/multimedia/18re-zuckerberg-kbcv/18re-zuckerberg-kbcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Mark Zuckerberg looks to the corner wearing a red tie.
