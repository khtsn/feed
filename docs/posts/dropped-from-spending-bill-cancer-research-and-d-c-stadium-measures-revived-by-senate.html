It had lost provisions targeting hidden fees on concert tickets and criminalizing the publication of some deepfake pornography.</p><p>But two of the measures that had been dropped from the final bill, which continued most government spending at the same level and included funding for disaster relief and aid to farmers, were salvaged as separate bills and passed by the Senate.</p><p>The bills, which include funding for pediatric cancer research and changes in the terms of the lease of a Washington, D.C., stadium, passed the House in the spring, allowing them to quickly clear the Senate without amendments and through a voice vote that required unanimous consent.</p><p>Here’s a rundown of how those two bills were revived at the last minute.</p><h2 id="link-2dbf91b8">Funding for pediatric cancer research</h2><p>When Speaker Mike Johnson jettisoned a bipartisan deal to avert a government shutdown after facing fierce criticism from the billionaire Elon Musk, right-wing Republicans and President-elect Donald J.
