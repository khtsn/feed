Together, they worked to return Trump to the White House and radically reshape the federal government. Less than a week ago, they sang each other’s praises.</p><p>Then, today, over the course of just a few hours, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/05/us/trump-elon-musk" title="">the alliance between Trump and Musk dissolved into open acrimony</a>. The two men hurled personal attacks at each other over matters both significant and petty. Even by the Trump administration’s standards, it was a remarkable moment.</p><p>The dispute ostensibly centered on the president’s signature domestic policy bill, which Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/trump-elon-musk-relationship-fallout.html" title="">has attacked as a “disgusting abomination,”</a> but the mudslinging quickly escalated. During a White House meeting with Germany’s leader, Friedrich Merz, Trump criticized Musk: “I’m very disappointed in Elon,” the president said. “I’ve helped Elon a lot.”</p><p>Musk shot back at Trump: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” he wrote on X. “Such ingratitude.” In follow-up posts, Musk suggested that he would leave the Republican Party, accused Trump of involvement with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and backed a call for the president’s impeachment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Marlean Ames.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Megan Jelinger/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-5485f9b0">Justices backed a straight woman in a discrimination case</h2><p>The Supreme Court today unanimously ruled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/politics/supreme-court-straight-woman-workplace-discrimination.html" title="">in favor of a straight woman who twice lost positions to gay workers</a>. The justices said that a lower court had been wrong to require her to meet a higher burden in proving workplace discrimination because she was a member of a majority group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A port in Shanghai.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-21bcf29a">The U.S. and China agreed to revive trade talks</h2><p>Xi Jinping, China’s leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/world/asia/xi-trump-talks-china-us-trade.html" title="">spoke to Trump over the phone this morning</a> about the souring trade relationship between the two countries. It was the first time the leaders were known to have spoken directly since Trump returned to office in January. After the call, China and the U.S. said they would meet again in hopes of breaking an impasse over tariffs and global supplies of rare earth minerals.</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>U.S. imports of foreign made goods <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/business/economy/us-trade-data-deficit.html" title="">fell sharply in April compared with the previous month</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Near Kruger National Park in South Africa. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kim Ludbrook/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-5b063163">A study suggested an effective way to deter rhino poachers</h2><p>Vast sums have been poured into militarized efforts to combat rhinoceros poaching, but it has produced little results. Instead, according to a study published today, a relatively affordable and straightforward tactic seems to be most effective at preventing their killing: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/climate/rhinos-dehorned-poaching-kruger-park.html" title="">removing their horns</a>.</p><p>It takes about 18 months for the horns to grow back.

He was diagnosed with a brain disorder that forced him to cancel all of his events. But Joel sent a message to the gathered audience: “Getting old sucks, but it’s still preferable to getting cremated.” The crowd roared with laughter.</p><p>Only the first half of the documentary was screened, but it still ran nearly two and a half hours, with stories about the robust Long Island rock scene and a starring role for his first wife (and later manager), Elizabeth Weber. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/arts/music/billy-joel-documentary-and-so-it-goes.html" title="">Here’s what we learned about the early days of Joel’s career</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jillian Freyer for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linda Xiao for The New York Times.
