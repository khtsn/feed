Paduch, a fertility specialist, molested boys and young men for years at two prominent New York hospitals, prosecutors said. Hundreds of other young men and boys have also accused Dr. Paduch, 57, of abuse spanning more than 15 years in scores of civil suits.</p><p>Dr. Paduch “was a sexual predator who preyed on patients seeking treatment for sensitive medical issues,” Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-urologist-prominent-medical-institutions-sentenced-life-prison-sexual-abuse" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> on Wednesday. “He used his position as a renowned urologist at prestigious hospitals to sexually assault vulnerable patients, including children, to gratify his own sexual desires.”</p><p>In May, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/nyregion/doctor-sex-abuse-paduch.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">a jury found him guilty</a> of five counts of inducing a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity and six counts of enticing people to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity. The trial lasted just two weeks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Wednesday, his sentence was handed down by Judge Ronnie Abrams in federal court in Manhattan.</p><p>Dr. Paduch, of North Bergen, N.J., was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/nyregion/doctor-sexual-abuse-minors.html?smid=nytcore-android-share" title="">arrested last April</a>. He has been barred from practicing in New York. Through the trial, he maintained his innocence. A lawyer who represented him, Michael Baldassare, said on Wednesday that “we are confident that one day he will be vindicated.”</p><p>Once a urologist who specialized in treating patients with a genetic condition, Dr. Paduch worked at hospitals including NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan and Northwell Health on Long Island. According to prosecutors, he used his position at prominent hospitals “to make the victims believe that the sexual abuse he inflicted on them was medically necessary and appropriate, when, in fact, it was not.”</p><p>The abuse continued over several years in some cases, as Dr. Paduch instructed the patients to return for follow-up appointments, where he continued to assault them. During appointments, the indictment said, Dr. Paduch told patients to masturbate in front of him, sometimes groping them or showing them pornography.</p><p>During the course of the trial, 11 victims testified about abuse they had suffered under Dr. Paduch’s care, and dozens more wrote impact statements before he was sentenced Wednesday.</p><p>Mallory Allen, a lawyer for a firm that represents 140 former patients who have filed civil suits against him, said in a statement that the sentence affirms that “heinous sexual abuse will not be overlooked.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Survivors of the abuse have also sued the hospitals where he worked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/nyregion/adult-survivors-act-lawsuits.html" title="">under the Adult Survivors Act</a>, which opened a yearlong window between 2022 and 2023 during which adult victims of abuse could file claims even after the statute of limitations had passed.</p><p>“While no sentence can ever undo the pain and suffering endured by each and every survivor who experienced abuse at the hands of Dr. Darius Paduch, the sentencing closes an important chapter for these survivors,” Ms. Allen said in the statement.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
