was captured on Friday, less than two miles from a high-security prison from which he escaped on May 25, the authorities said.</p><p>The fugitive, Grant Hardin, was caught about 3:45 p.m. not far from the Calico Rock North Central Unit, ending an intense manhunt that began nearly two weeks ago when he slipped out of the prison dressed in a fake law enforcement uniform.</p><p>Mr. Hardin, 56, who had previously served as the police chief in Gateway, Ark., for a short time, disappeared about 15 to 20 minutes before an inmate count.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media"

dangerous.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In 2017, he was arrested in connection with the shooting death of James Appleton just outside Gateway, where Mr. Appleton had worked in the water department.</p><p>Mr. Hardin was sentenced to 30 years in the murder of Mr. Appleton, who was shot in the head at point-blank range with a shotgun while pulled over in a pickup truck and talking on the phone.</p><p>On Friday, the Izard County Sheriff’s Department said on <a

law enforcement officers had used fingerprint analysis to verify Mr. Hardin’s identity after he was captured.</p><p>Officials released few other details about how Mr. Hardin had been caught.</p><p>Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas said in a statement on Friday night that the people in her state could “breathe a sigh of relief” now that Mr. Hardin was in custody. She said that a federal Border Patrol team had played an instrumental role in the manhunt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Arkansas State Police and the Arkansas Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Hardin escaped from the prison while it was raining heavily, making it difficult for officers and tracking dogs to pursue him. Video from the prison showed him leaving the high-security facility through a controlled gate, officials said at the time.</p><p>It was not clear when he had changed out of his prison clothes or how he had obtained the uniform, which corrections officials said had resembled those worn by law enforcement officers.</p><p>While he was in prison, investigators looking into an unsolved rape case from more than 20 years earlier matched Mr. Hardin’s DNA to genetic evidence collected from the victim, Amy Harrison, an elementary schoolteacher in Rogers, Ark.</p><p>On Nov. 9, 1997, Mr. Hardin pointed a gun at Ms. Harrison and raped her while she was leaving a teachers’ restroom, the authorities said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 2018, he pleaded guilty to rape and kidnapping, resulting in an additional 50 years being added to his prison sentence.</p><p>Mr. Hardin drew widespread attention in 2023 with the release of a television documentary titled “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33000060/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Devil in the Ozarks</a>.”</p><p>He held several law enforcement positions in Arkansas beginning in the 1990s, but repeatedly faced complaints about misconduct and poor performance, including using excessive force and <a href="https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/local/outreach/back-to-school/rogers-police-release-new-information-in-20-year-old-rape-case/527-c4fe124d-e336-46f5-9c8a-7715d2b08d4a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">falsifying a police report</a>, according to local news media.</p><p>Emily Cochrane<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ali Watkins<!-- --> and <!-- -->Mark Walker<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Neil Vigdor covers breaking news for The Times, with a focus on politics.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
