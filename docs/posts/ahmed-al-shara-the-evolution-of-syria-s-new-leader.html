He broke with Al Qaeda years ago and now goes by his real name, Ahmed al-Shara. He has swapped his military fatigues for suits and has embarked on a charm offensive to convince foreign leaders and his fellow Syrians that he can repair his shattered country and lead it toward democracy — or something like it.</p><p>“If democracy means that the people decide who will rule them and who represents them in the Parliament, then, yes, Syria is going in this direction,” he told The Economist in <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2025/02/03/an-interview-with-ahmed-al-sharaa-syrias-president" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview</a> published this month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The sharp contrast between Mr. al-Shara’s jihadist past and his pragmatic, nationalistic present has left Syrians and foreign officials wondering what he actually believes and how he will govern a critical country in the heart of the Middle East.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/27/multimedia/25syria-president-assad/27Israel-Iranproxy-explainer03-bfgp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/27/multimedia/25syria-president-assad/27Israel-Iranproxy-explainer03-bfgp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/27/multimedia/25syria-president-assad/27Israel-Iranproxy-explainer03-bfgp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A poster showing a waving Bashar al-Assad hangs on the facade of a blackened multistory building." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/27/multimedia/25syria-president-assad/27Israel-Iranproxy-explainer03-bfgp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/27/multimedia/25syria-president-assad/27Israel-Iranproxy-explainer03-bfgp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/27/multimedia/25syria-president-assad/27Israel-Iranproxy-explainer03-bfgp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/27/multimedia/25syria-president-assad/27Israel-Iranproxy-explainer03-bfgp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/93d217af-27ff-59d1-9693-33385f24adbf" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An image of Bashar al-Assad hanging in the war-ravaged city of Homs, Syria, in 2014.

But some key groups, like the U.S.-backed Kurdish militia that controls the country’s northeast, were not invited.</p><p>Many Syrians, exhausted after 13 years of civil war, say that whatever he does will be better than the misery and destruction wrought by Mr. al-Assad. Syrian critics who distrust his Islamist approach charge that beyond his conciliatory rhetoric lies a sinister past that he has not clearly renounced.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Since he emerged as Syria’s new leader, senior Arab and Western officials have visited him in Damascus or hosted him in their capitals to press him on issues they care about, including combating Iranian influence, limiting Russia’s military presence, shutting down <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/world/middleeast/syria-drugs-captagon-assad.html" title="">illegal drug</a> exports, cracking down on violent jihadists and ensuring the rights of women and religious minorities.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Al Arin, a predominantly Alawite neighborhood of Damascus, in December.

But few have promised what he needs most: financial aid to bolster Syria’s economy and kick-start reconstruction, and the lifting of harsh sanctions imposed to punish Mr. al-Assad. On Monday, the European Union agreed to suspend restrictions on Syrian banks and energy and transport sectors, as well as to extend measures to facilitate humanitarian aid.</p><p>One factor hindering foreign engagement with his government is that the United States and other countries, along with the United Nations, still classify the rebel group he led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or H.T.S., as a terrorist organization. Some countries still classify him as a terrorist, too.</p><p>Barbara A. Leaf, a senior State Department official for the Middle East during the Biden administration, was among the first U.S. officials to meet Mr. al-Shara in Damascus, the Syrian capital, in December. She said in an interview that he had clearly come prepared to hear what the United States had to say — and to respond.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A convoy of Russian military vehicles west of Homs in December.

The war killed more than 500,000 people, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/syria-civil-war-death-toll.html#:~:text=Death%20toll%20estimates%20from%20the,and%20calculated%20in%20varying%20ways." title="">most estimates</a>, forced millions more to flee abroad and decimated entire communities, leaving many refugees with no homes to return to.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Collecting the remains of dozens of people from a field in the Damascus area.

To salvage what he can of the state, Mr. al-Shara has called on civil servants to keep working, but salaries are meager, the economy is feeble, and electricity is limited in many homes.</p><p>Even before he was named president last month during a closed-door meeting with allied rebel leaders, Mr. al-Shara was working at home and abroad to rebrand both Syria and himself.</p><p>He has toured Syrian provinces and met with representatives from the Christian, Alawite and Druse minorities.

On a subsequent trip to Turkey, Ms. al-Droubi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/middleeast/Latifa%20al-Droubi" title="">met with Mr. Erdogan’s wife</a>, Emine.</p><p>He has spoken cautiously of Israel, which has occupied territory in southern Syria, calling on it to adhere to a decades-old truce along the countries’ shared frontier, and of Russia, even though its military backed Mr. al-Assad and heavily bombed rebel communities. He has lashed out at Iran, which also backed the former regime, but has said that Syria will pose no threat to its neighbors.</p><p>His contact with the Trump administration appears to have been limited. But in a recent interview for the podcast “<a href="https://therestispolitics.supportingcast.fm/listen/leading/120-the-new-president-of-syria-trump-palestine-and-having-a-10-million-bounty-on-your-head-ahmed-al-sharaa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Rest Is Politics — Leading</a>,” he praised President Trump for his interest in “peace building” and his “positive approach to both the Middle East and future U.S. policy in the region.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. al-Shara, front left, next to his wife, Latifa al-Droubi, during a pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Mr. al-Shara’s critics accuse him of telling whoever he is meeting what they want to hear while eliding his extremist background and some of his associates’ violent records.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>One of the rebels who appointed him president, Ahmad al-Hayes, was a commander <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0292" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused</a> by the United States of overseeing the torture and killing of detainees, the trafficking of women and children, and ransom and extortion schemes.</p><p>Another supporter, Mohammad al-Jasim, <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1699" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stands accused</a> by the United States of commanding forces who displaced residents to seize their property and kidnapped people for ransom, “likely generating tens of millions of dollars a year.”</p><p>In 2017, Mr. al-Shara’s rebel group set up a “Salvation Government” to administer territory it controlled in northwestern Syria. After Mr. al-Assad’s fall, Mr. al-Shara brought that administration to Damascus to serve as the country’s interim government until March 1, when a new government is supposed to take over. Elections cannot be held for three or four years, he has said, because Syria is in such disarray.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrian Christians protesting in Damascus in December.

Ultraconservative clerics accused the participants of worshiping fire, a sin in Islam, and the local government suspended the games, citing “transgressions” that “violate our culture, customs and traditions.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><p>Fuad Sayed Issa, the founder of <a href="https://violetsyria.org/en/about-us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Violet</a>, the group that organized the games, said in an interview that officials in the government had apologized for the cancellation but that they were afraid of what the extremists would do if they went forward.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Mr. Issa was optimistic now that the government was in Damascus and Mr. al-Shara was expressing more openness.</p><p>“We now feel that things are going better,” he said. “The leader has an open mind-set and they are taking Syria to a better place.”</p><p>Mr. al-Shara’s allegiances changed repeatedly during the war. He came to Syria from Iraq with the support of the Islamic State, but later broke with the group. He pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda before announcing a break with it, too, in 2016.</p><p>His original group, the Nusra Front, battled and allied with other rebels over the years and rebranded itself twice, becoming H.T.S. in 2017. In the years since, Mr. al-Shara has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/world/middleeast/idlib-syria-life-rebel-rule.html" title="">focused on governing the country’s northwest</a> and has cracked down on extremists believed to be plotting attacks outside Syria.</p><p>Orwa Ajjoub, a doctoral candidate at Malmo University in Sweden who studies H.T.S., said Mr. al-Shara’s history suggested he was guided less by rigid convictions than by a quest for power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><p>“He has changed a lot, and he is genuine in this change,” Mr. Ajjoub said. “On one hand, there is a pragmatism that is encouraging and it gives you some hope.
