On Monday, the European Union agreed to suspend restrictions on Syrian banks and energy and transport sectors, as well as to extend measures to facilitate humanitarian aid.</p><p>One factor hindering foreign engagement with his government is that the United States and other countries, along with the United Nations, still classify the rebel group he led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or H.T.S., as a terrorist organization. Some countries still classify him as a terrorist, too.</p><p>Barbara A.
