    <h1>Trump to Name Michael Waltz as His National Security Adviser</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump has chosen Representative Michael Waltz of Florida to be his national security adviser, two people familiar with the decision said on Monday, turning to a former Green Beret who has taken a tough line on China to oversee foreign and national security policy in the White House.</p><p>Mr. Waltz is the second Republican House member to be selected by Mr. Trump for a high-level job in his next administration, after his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-stefanik-un-ambassador.html" title="">choice of Representative Elise Stefanik</a> of New York for ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p>Mr. Waltz, 50, has been a member of the Armed Services, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees in the House and would join the Trump administration as it addresses Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East and confronts an increasingly aggressive China. His wife, Julia Nesheiwat, was homeland security adviser in the first Trump administration.</p><p>Even as a congressional freshman, Mr. Waltz caught the eye of the Trump White House with his national security credentials. In 2020, in the days after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/world/middleeast/qassem-soleimani-iraq-iran-attack.html" title="">Mr. Trump authorized the drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani</a> of Iran, Mr. Waltz was included in a small group of Republicans invited to the White House who received a briefing on the strike.</p></div></div>
