President Trump has said China has too much control over Panama, and the deal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/blackrock-panama-canal-ports-hutchison.html" title="">was seen by some policy analysts as mitigating to some of his concerns</a>. China, which has exercised tight control of Hong Kong since 2020, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/business/panama-canal-ck-hutchison-blackrock.html" title="">strongly criticized the transaction</a>.</p><p>In the latest twist, Panama’s controller general, an independent government official who audits public finances, said CK Hutchison had not properly renewed its contract to operate the ports in 2021 and owed the government $300 million in fees.</p><p>The controller, Anel Flores, said he would file a complaint with the prosecutor’s office and added that it was up to the government agency that awards port concessions to determine whether the contract with CK Hutchison was illegal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Flores’s actions could delay the deal for the two ports significantly.</p><p>“The longer you drag this out, the greater the opportunity for China to meddle in the transaction,” said Benjamin Gedan, a Latin America expert who lectures at Johns Hopkins.</p><p>Panama’s government could ultimately decide to take the ports away from CK Hutchison, Mr. Gedan said, and invite bids for the rights to operate them.</p><p>BlackRock declined to comment on the controller’s actions. At a meeting held by the Economic Club of New York on Monday, Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive, was asked whether he would do the deal without the Panamanian ports. “It’s going to be reviewed as one transaction,” he said, “as of the moment.”</p><p>CK Hutchison did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Trump hailed the deal when he told Congress in March that his administration would be “reclaiming the Panama Canal.”</p><p>CK Hutchison obtained the port concessions in1997 and renewed the contract in 2021 for 25 years. Mr. Flores, the controller, said his office, then led by someone else, had not approved the renewal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Flores announced in January that he was auditing the agreement with CK Hutchison as Mr. Trump took office. Panama’s government has pushed back against Mr. Trump’s assertions that the Panama Canal belongs to the United States or that it is controlled by China.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Eavis reports on the business of moving stuff around the world.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/blackrock-inc">BlackRock Inc.</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/larry-fink">Larry Fink</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Gun Control </strong><strong>Roll Back</strong><strong>: </strong>The Trump administration is expected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-gun-control-measures.html">roll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures</a>, according to two people briefed on the move.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.-Iran Talks:</strong> Expected talks between Iran and the United States would be a late, and perhaps last, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html">opportunity to control Tehran’s nuclear ambitions</a> and avoid war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drilling and Mining on Public Land:</strong> The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/climate/trump-new-mexico-nevada-mining-drilling.html">opened thousands of acres of land in Nevada and New Mexico</a> to oil and gas drilling, geothermal development and hard-rock mining, reversing protections that former President Biden enacted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Harriet Tubman:</strong> A National Park Service web page about the Underground Railroad appeared to have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/national-park-service-harriet-tubman-underground-railroad-dei.html">restored to prominently show the abolitionist leader</a>, after it had been changed to remove a large photo and quotations from her.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tech C.E.O.s and Trump: </strong>With inauguration donations and Mar-a-Lago visits, leaders of the biggest tech companies sought favor with the president in an attempt to steer regulation and tariffs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/technology/tech-ceos-lobbying-trump.html">to little avail</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Female Military Leader Fired:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-us-military-nato-official-fired-chatfield.html">fired Vice Adm.
