Sales were led by deliveries of Tesla’s newly revamped version of its most popular vehicle, the Model Y.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In neighboring Sweden, Volkswagen sold nearly twice as many of its latest electric model, the ID.7, as the new Model Y from Tesla, whose overall sales in the country dropped 53 percent.</p><p>Mr. Musk has tried to downplay the extent of Tesla’s losses in Europe, telling Bloomberg News in an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum that although it was the region where the brand faces its greatest challenges, “the European car market is quite weak.”</p><p>But data from European markets does not support that claim. In Germany, sales of battery-powered cars grew nearly 45 percent in May, compared with a year earlier. In Spain, overall sales of electric cars grew 72 percent, while Tesla sales slid 19 percent.</p><p>In Germany, demand for BYD, Tesla’s main E.V. rival, rose ninefold, the strongest showing of an electric vehicle producer from China. The company, which overtook Tesla as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/business/china-byd-tesla-sales-ev-europe.html" title="">world’s top seller of electric cars</a> this year, has been making inroads in Europe, despite facing tariffs of 17 percent imposed by the European Union in 2024.</p><p>Although Mr. Musk has left his role at the White House, Tesla sales have been affected by his foray into politics. In April, the company reported that its vehicle sales fell 13 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, as profit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html" title="">plunged to its lowest level in four years</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Rise of Electric Vehicles</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Death of Electric Cars ...
