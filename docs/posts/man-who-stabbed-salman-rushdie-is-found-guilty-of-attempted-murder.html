He told the jury that at first he felt he was being punched, but then he realized he had “a very large quantity of blood pouring out” onto his clothes.</p><p>Mr. Rushdie had been scheduled to deliver a talk at the Chautauqua Institution amphitheater on Aug. 12, 2022, about how the United States has been a safe haven for writers and other artists in exile.</p><p>Shortly before the talk was set to begin, a man wearing dark clothing and a face mask rushed onstage and stabbed Mr. Rushdie repeatedly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Matar was also found guilty of assault on Friday for injuring Ralph Henry Reese, one of the founders of a project that offers refuge for writers.

Afterward, Mr. Rushdie <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000008486804/salman-rushdie-stabbing-ny.html?searchResultPosition=6" title="">was airlifted to a hospital</a> with a trauma clinic in Erie, Pa.

He lifted the distinctive eyeglasses he has worn in public since the attack, which have one clear lens and one black one, to shield his damaged eye.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I am not as energetic as I used to be,” Mr. Rushdie said. “I am not as physically strong as I used to be.”</p><p>The trial began on Feb. 10 at the Chautauqua County Courthouse in Mayville, N.Y., a village about an hour south of Buffalo. Mr. Matar declined to testify during the trial, and the defense team did not call any witnesses.</p><p>During closing arguments, Andrew Brautigam, a defense lawyer, told the jury that “Mr. Matar did not and didn’t ever intend to kill Salman Rushdie.” He said that they did not know what Mr. Matar’s “conscious objective was, what his goal was, what motivated him.”</p><p>Mr. Matar was living in New Jersey at the time of the attack and worked at a Marshall’s clothing store. He had moved to the United States from Lebanon with his family <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/nyregion/salman-rushdie-stabbing-terrorism.html?searchResultPosition=9" title="">when he was a child</a>. In the years leading up to the attack, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/nyregion/salman-rushdie-stabbing-terrorism.html" title="">he became increasingly isolated</a> and intently focused on Islam.</p><p>Mr. Rushdie had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/nyregion/salman-rushdie-fatwa-satanic-verses.html?searchResultPosition=41" title="">lived under an Iranian death sentence</a> since 1989 following the publication of his novel “The Satanic Verses,” which fictionalized parts of the life of the Prophet Muhammad. Many Muslims found some of the depictions offensive and even blasphemous. The Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/nyregion/salman-rushdie-fatwa-satanic-verses.html?searchResultPosition=41" title="">issued a fatwa</a> ordering Muslims to kill Mr. Rushdie and put a price on his head of several million dollars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Rushdie rises to accept an award at the PEN America Literary Gala in New York City in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca Smeyne for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Matar spent most of the trial with his head down, scribbling on a yellow notepad. Mr. Rushdie’s wife, the poet and novelist Rachel Eliza Griffiths, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/nyregion/salman-rushdie-testimony-assault-trial.html" title="">sat in the second row</a> of the courtroom when her husband testified. At the prosecutor’s request, the space in front of her was left empty, giving her a direct line of sight to the witness stand.</p><p>Gregory Beard, a trauma surgeon, testified that the lacerations to Mr. Rushdie’s neck area were close to major blood vessels and that he had been at risk of bleeding to death. There were also lacerations to Mr. Rushdie’s liver, areas of his small intestine and his colon.</p><p>Jason Schmidt, the district attorney, asked the jury during his closing argument whether it was foreseeable to “stab someone 15 or so times about the face and neck, and that maybe that might result in a fatality here.”</p><p>“We can’t read Mr. Matar’s mind, but we can watch his actions,” Mr. Schmidt said.</p><p>Mr. Schmidt said Mr. Matar came “dangerously close to completing the act” of murder.</p><p>The attack changed Mr. Rushdie’s life and led him to write <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/books/review/salman-rushdie-knife.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">a memoir</a>, called “Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder.” The book <a href="https://www.nationalbook.org/books/knife-meditations-after-an-attempted-murder/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was a finalist for the National Book Award</a> for nonfiction last year.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
