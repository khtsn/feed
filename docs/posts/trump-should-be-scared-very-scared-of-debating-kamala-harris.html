    <h1>Trump Should Be Scared — Very Scared — of Debating Kamala Harris</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>It’s easy to find examples of Vice President Kamala Harris answering questions in a vacuous, speciously thoughtful manner that borders on caricature, and it’s easy to conclude from that oratorical oatmeal that she has delayed a one-on-one sit-down with a serious journalist because she’s not nimble in unscripted situations or fluent in the necessary facts. Those are the Republican talking points, anyway.</p><p>But that assessment ignores her performance in a 2020 debate with the vice president at that time, Mike Pence. Remember it? A high-stakes encounter as risky as any interview with any network heavyweight, she did fine. Better than fine, in fact. Several post-debate surveys of viewers, including <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/harris-pence-vp-debate-poll/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one published by 538</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/07/politics/mike-pence-kamala-harris-vice-presidential-debate-poll/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another by CNN</a>, found that Harris won it. Granted, Pence was contending with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/10/08/mike-pence-fly-on-head-debate-sot-vpx.cnn" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a fly’s decision</a> to claim a time-share on his head, but still. He had been on the national political stage longer than she had, and she wasn’t buggy in the least.</p><p>Which is why Donald Trump’s recent complaints about and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/us/politics/trump-harris-debate-abc.html" title="">threats to back out of</a> the planned ABC News debate on Sept. 10 make total sense. He should be hesitant. In fact, he should be scared.</p><p>For all his ludicrous boasting about his past debate performances, many of them have been laughable — some combination of puerile taunting, nonpareil lying, sulking, steaming, glaring and gloating. You know those cartoonish dances that football players do when they’ve breached the end zone in the fourth quarter of a close game? That’s Trump at the debate lectern, only he hasn’t scored a touchdown. Or even moved the ball so much as a millimeter downfield.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>I’m referring to his antics amid his rivals for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, in three face-offs with Hillary Clinton in the general election that year and in two face-offs with Joe Biden in the general election of 2020. (He skipped the 2024 Republican primary debates — wisely, given his lead over the other aspirants.)</p><p>Now imagine Trump against Harris. Imagine his insult and upset over having a lectern no bigger, a standing no taller and an invitation no more gleamingly embossed than a Black woman’s.</p><p>Actually, you don’t have to imagine it. His insistence that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lmm2wwlyo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she’s inventing her crowd sizes</a>, that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/g-s1-15174/harris-mixed-race-trump-black-indian" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she’s not really Black</a>, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/style/trump-harris-style.html" title="">he’s prettier than she is</a> and that she deposed Biden in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/19/trump-stolen-election-coup-overthrow/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some sort of coup</a> — projection, anyone? — tells you all you need to know. So does his determined, sustained <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-grandnieces-dnc-pronounce-name-trump-b2600701.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mispronunciation of her name</a>, the phonetic equivalent of stomping his feet. All of that affirms that Harris rattles him in a particular and powerful way.</p><p>Which gives her a debating edge over him, assuming she can maintain the discipline and poise that she has demonstrated during her crash-course presidential campaign so far. The more she keeps her cool, the more he’ll lose his. His and her advisers know that: It’s why the Harris camp has pressed for each candidate’s microphone to be unmuted when the other is talking and the Trump camp has pushed for the opposite. Everyone involved (except maybe Trump) recognizes his combustibility; it’s just that one side wants to light a match while the other is looking for a fire extinguisher.</p><p>Harris is catching Trump at the perfect moment — for her — because he at times seems to be flaming out. He’s certainly committing odd flubs and making strange choices. You don’t win the news cycle by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/us/politics/trump-helicopter-crash-willie-brown.html" title="">inventing helicopter rides and hush-hush conversations that never happened</a>, and you don’t repel the “weird” label by linking arms with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/politics/rfk-jr-whale-head.html" title="">animal-carcass fetishist</a> Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who would apparently be part of any Trump transition team along with … Tulsi Gabbard, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#tulsi-gabbard-trump-transition" title="">autocrat-loving former member of Congress</a>. Trump, Kennedy, Gabbard: It’s the dinner party from Hell. Or maybe the Donner party, given Trump’s frequent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/opinion/donald-trump-hannibal-lecter.html" title="">mooning over Hannibal Lecter</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He caught a break in his June 27 debate against Biden, whose shocking unsteadiness eclipsed Trump’s galling mendacity. But he’s unlikely to get that lucky again. Harris may well provide inadequate or unconvincing explanations of her many changed positions, and she may retreat to the comfort of gauzy platitudes. During the Democratic primary debates in 2019, she had both <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-debate-history-biden-tulsi-gabbard-trump-09741696abe9d4217e51d94ac0af553e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strong moments and weak ones</a> — and by early 2020, before the Iowa caucuses, she was out of the race.</p><p>But none of her recent appearances augur a showing as confused as Biden’s two months ago. And they foretell a bearing more presidential than Trump’s.</p><p>That’s a low bar, admittedly. But that’s my point. Trump did himself no favors <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/29/politics/2020-debate-trump-biden-2016/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">against Clinton in 2016</a> or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/25/nx-s1-5018602/trump-biden-debate-2020-recap" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Biden in 2020</a>. Why would he fare any better against Harris? She has vulnerabilities and shortcomings that a focused, fierce debater could take advantage of, but Trump has never been such a debater, and it’s impossible to believe that he’ll transform into one now. He’s older. He’s meaner, to the extent that that’s possible. He’s angrier (ditto).</p><p>And he’s harrumphing toward a humbling. Should be a riveting moment in an election year with no shortage of those.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h2 id="link-52714da7">For the Love of Sentences</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">H.

When he is scrutinized for signs of aging or compared unfavorably to handsome movie stars? Never. It’s almost as if Governor Walz is absorbing and wearing the very gendered traits and judgments that the vice president has managed to shrug off or deflect.” (Ilona Frieden, Oakland, Calif.)</p><p>Also in The Times, in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/opinion/letters/joyful-democratic-convention.html" title="">a letter to the editor</a>, Madeleine Berenson described her emotions — and optimism — after all the oratory and testimonials at the Democrats’ convention: “I felt like the lab beagle in one of those videos who sees grass and sunshine for the first time. Leaving the cage cautiously, confusedly at first, testing the unfamiliar surface under her feet, trying to understand the beauty of what was around her and then finally trusting it all and romping with unbridled joy.” (Susan Casey, Palm City, Fla.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>And David Firestone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/20/opinion/thepoint#doug-emhoff-american-jews" title="">processed</a> the prospect of Doug Emhoff as presidential spouse: “The idea that the country’s first first gentleman will be a schlubby and fundamentally decent guy they know so well, the guy behind them in the drop-off line at Jewish summer camp, is astonishing enough to make even secular Jews believe in a higher power with an enormous sense of humor.” (Peter Schmolka, Ottawa)</p><p>In The New Yorker, Helen Rosner <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-food-scene/le-veau-dor-makes-a-thrillingly-old-fashioned-comeback" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sampled</a> the classic fare at a nearly 90-year-old French restaurant in Manhattan that received a recent sprucing-up: “You can hardly go wrong, though it would be the height of tragedy if not one person at the table ordered the frogs’ legs persillade, a cancan line of amphibian gams in an audibly sizzling bath of butter and garlic that a server oomphs up, upon presentation, with a squeeze of lemon.” (Maryka Martin, Prevessin, France)</p><p>Also in The New Yorker, Patricia Marx <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/09/02/real-estate-shopping-for-the-apocalypse" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">went on the hunt</a> for fabulous subterranean refuges for the apocalypse-minded: “After weeks of scrolling, I found a handful of dream hideaways on the market whose sellers were willing to let me take a tour. There were two bunkers in Montana, one of which sleeps at least 90; a prepper bunker in Missouri that features an inconspicuous entrance and a conspicuous arsenal of guns (not included in sale, but makes you think twice before criticizing the kitchen-countertop choice); a defunct missile-silo site in North Dakota; and a 20,000-square-foot cave in Arkansas used by its previous owner to raise earthworms. (Favorite bit of real-estate marketing copy: ‘The worm room speaks for itself.’)” (Nancy Chek, Silver Spring, Md.)</p><p><em>To nominate favorite bits of recent writing from The Times or other publications to be mentioned in “For the Love of Sentences,” please email me </em><a href="mailto:bruni-newsletter@nytimes.com?subject=For%20the%20Love%20of%20Sentences" title=""><em>here</em></a><em> and include your name and place of residence.</em></p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Frank Bruni</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>She never lasts more than 15 minutes, not in that fur coat of hers. But almost every cloudless day, sometime between our long, vigorous morning walk and our short, lazy afternoon one, Regan picks a spot in front of the house for a bit of sunbathing. Her limbs crumple. Her coat glistens. Drowsiness half-masts her eyes. I have half a mind to bring her an iced tea and some Coppertone. But then she’s back at the door, insistent on air-conditioning and angling for reacquaintance with it. Such a delicate princess.

So why use the language of slumber?</p><p>As Robyn Schanzenbach of Missoula, Mont., wrote to me a while back, “I could scream every time I read that Trump slept with Stormy Daniels. No, I don’t think he did.”</p><p>We can be such prudes. Such children.</p><p>On the prudish side, we trot out simpering euphemisms like “they’re sleeping together” or “they’re intimate” when we’re referring to fornication, erotic play, grinding, s<em>ex. </em>I sleep nightly with Regan. I’ve slept with extra pillows, with earplugs, with my sister on vacations when beds were scarce. None of those nighttime or nap-time companions were objects of my lust. I’ve been intimate (“marked by a warm friendship developing through long association,” according to the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intimate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first definition of the word</a> in Merriam-Webster’s online dictionary) with many people I’ve never even kissed.</p><p>On the childish side, there are musty locutions like “bumping uglies” (one of my favorites) and modern ones like “hooking up.” People treat saying “sex” as some hex. Or as some terrible breach of etiquette that will cause listeners to cough up their cucumber sandwiches.</p><p>Please. We’re adults here. We <em>have sex — </em>with the right people, with the wrong people, clumsily, efficiently, often, rarely, to procreate, to recreate. Even when it’s a snooze, it’s not really a snooze.</p><p><em>“Retire These Words!” is an occasional feature about overused, oddly used, erroneously used or just plain annoying locutions.
