But in interviews across the territory, many said they were skeptical that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/world/middleeast/trump-harris-israel-gaza.html" title="">either Ms. Harris or former President Donald J. Trump</a> would do much to improve their situation.</p><p>“I am fearful that both candidates are for the same thing, which is no end in sight for the war in Gaza,” said Abdul Kareem al-Kahlout, 35, a math teacher in Deir al Balah.</p><p>The war began after the militant group Hamas led the Oct. 7 terror attack that Israeli authorities say killed about 1,200 people in Israel. Since then, the Israeli military’s bombardment and ground operations in Gaza have killed more than 43,000 people, according to local authorities, a figure that includes Hamas fighters. The war has pushed the remaining population to the brink of famine and left much of the territory in ruins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many people interviewed in Gaza said they were more focused on keeping themselves and their loved ones alive after more than a year of war. They have had little access to electricity or the internet, or to adequate food and medicine, so they have not had much time to follow American politics.</p><p>“I have no preference,” said Mohammed Owaida, 33, who is from Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. “We only need one thing: for this war to come to an end. We are exhausted. Whoever wins and can do that, I support.”</p><p>Across the border, <a href="https://en.idi.org.il/articles/56992" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polls show</a> that Israelis overwhelmingly view Mr. Trump as the candidate who best serves their country’s interests, an opinion based largely on the sense that his first term in office brought benefits to Israel. While a Harris win would offer a sense of continuity at a turbulent time, many Israelis assume it would come with more criticism of Israeli policies toward Palestinians.</p><p>Mr. Trump took staunch pro-Israel stances during his term, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/middleeast/peace-plan.html" title="">a proposed peace plan</a> that strongly favored Israeli demands over Palestinian ones. But he has also called on Israel to wind down the war. Ms. Harris has mostly stuck to President Biden’s views: backing Israel’s right to self-defense while pressing for a deal to end the war and release the hostages held in Gaza.</p><p>Israelis generally believe that whoever wins, there won’t be a serious change in relations with the United States, their most important ally. And many in Gaza agreed, saying it was unlikely that the United States would waver in its support for Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Lina Rabah, 36, said she thought American leaders viewed the people of the Gaza Strip as little more than “a chess piece on their board.”</p><p>“All I want is for the United States to see us as humans, not just as numbers in a long conflict,” said Ms. Rabah, who has three children.</p><p>“If either Trump or Harris truly values human life and human rights, then they must use their power — not remarks or speeches to the media — to press for an immediate cease-fire,” she said.</p><p>Rima Swaisi, a journalist from Gaza City who works for Wafa, the official news agency of the Palestinian Authority, said she thought Ms. Harris was more likely to pursue an end to the war than Mr. Trump, who has been a strong supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. She called Ms. Harris the “less worse” option, and said she would never forget that Mr. Trump “gave Jerusalem to Israel” by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html" title="">moving the U.S. Embassy to that city from Tel Aviv in 2017</a>, in a break with decades of American policy.</p><p>“If we have to choose between the two devils, then anyone but Trump,” she said. Of Ms. Harris, she said: “I just hope she wins and most importantly does something differently toward the Palestinian people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But some in Gaza said the election did not present Palestinians with a less bad option.</p><p>Hanin Ashour, 33, said she had lost four family members since the war began, including two young children: Mariam, 8 months, and Omar, 2. American officials have often talked about human rights, she said, but now she blames them for the deaths of her loved ones.</p><p>She has become so disgusted by U.S. policies, she said, that she will not even use humanitarian aid from American organizations. To her, the idea of pinning her hopes on an American politician is absurd.</p><p>“I cannot even eat anything that comes from the country that killed my innocent family members,” she said. “So what — am I supposed to wait to hear from U.S. presidents who support Israel with missiles? How am I supposed to listen to them?”</p><p>Isabel Kershner<!-- --> contributed reporting from Jerusalem.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
