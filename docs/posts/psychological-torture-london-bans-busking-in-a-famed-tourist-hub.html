Some see whimsy in a cover band in subway stations; others would rather keep it out of public spaces. In one London square, at least, the critics seem to have won out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Thursday morning in Leicester Square (pronounced “Lester”), the yellow circles where buskers had performed were empty. News of the ban provoked joy, indignation and relief.</p><p>“Oh, thank God,” said Abu Khan, 28, after a reporter told him about the ban.</p><p>Mr. Khan, who works 12 hours a day at a convenience store in Leicester Square, said the music was sometimes so loud he couldn’t hear customers.</p><p>“I have to scream loud, and my customer thinks I’m fighting with him,” he said. “I’m losing my customers because of my voice.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Street performers are part of “the culture of Leicester Square,” one worker in the area said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The shows also drew crowds of tourists who blocked the entrance to the shop, he said. The blaring tunes also stressed him out.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I have family problems, doctor problems, job problems, girlfriend problems,” he said. “They give me more headaches.”</p><p>For others, the music has been part of the square’s charm.</p><p>Dorian Ronne, a pub manager, noted that people had been performing in the square longer than some of the nearby businesses had existed. </p><p>“It’s like people going to the countryside and complaining about the hogs and cows,” Mr. Ronne, 27, said. </p><p>Sandy Malai, a 22-year-old deputy manager at a fast-food restaurant, said the buskers’ soundtrack lightened her workdays and delighted her customers. A picture of a singer with a guitar and microphone, surrounded by silhouetted figures carrying shopping bags, hangs inside the restaurant.</p><p>“It’s the culture of Leicester Square,” she said, pointing to the image. “They’ve been here for years and years.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Chris Jones, 35, a bartender at a nearby pub, was of two minds. Great performances felt like “fresh air,” he said.

They offer a moment, in a chaotic city, he said, “to take yourself away, suspend your disbelief and woes for a while — and have a laugh.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jonathan Wolfe is a Times reporter based in London, covering breaking news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Santa’s Neighbors Are Annoyed: </strong>A tourist season in Rovaniemi, Finland that stretches from October to March has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/asia/santa-finland-rovaniemi.html">anything but jolly for some residents</a> of the “Official Hometown of Santa Claus.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Orange Skies in Iraq: </strong>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/middleeast/iraq-sandstorm.html">severe sandstorm swept across Iraq</a>, turning the sky a strange orange, reducing visibility and sending several thousand people to emergency rooms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Van Gogh’s Last Painting: </strong>The artist painted his final work, “Tree Roots,” in Auvers-sur-Oise, France.
