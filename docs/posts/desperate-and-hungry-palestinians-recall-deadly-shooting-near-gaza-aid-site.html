After nearly three months without any aid entering Gaza, Palestinians had learned that an Israeli-backed aid site would open in Rafah.</p><p>Israel promised an orderly system that would improve on the United Nations’ efforts to distribute much-needed food to Gazans. Almost from the beginning, things went horribly wrong.</p><p>On Saturday night, Mohammed Abdulal, 30, traveled 18 miles and joined thousands of people aggressively pushing their way forward, trying to reach the aid site. Israeli forces formed a wide perimeter around the site, which was overseen by U.S. private security contractors.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a hail of gunfire, forcing people to flee in every direction, their terrified screams filling the night sky. A bullet ripped through Mr. Abdulal’s face, leaving him writhing in pain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I only took two steps before I felt a bullet tear into my right cheek and neck,” he said. “I started shouting: ‘People, I’m wounded. Help me.’”</p><p>The rollout of the new aid effort over the past week by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an effort conceived in Israel and endorsed by the United States, was supposed to help Palestinians get aid while keeping it out of the hands of Hamas.</p><p>Instead the effort, criticized by multiple aid groups and the United Nations, has devolved into scenes of chaos and death. The New York Times spoke to eight witnesses who described how attempting to reach the sites had become a life-threatening endeavor.</p><p>The exact details of the deadly incidents remain murky. The Israeli military has acknowledged firing “warning shots” toward Palestinians, but has not taken responsibility for killing them. Multiple witnesses blamed Israeli forces for the deadly fire, which Gaza health officials say killed dozens of Palestinians trying to secure aid.</p><p>The procedures for getting the new aid have often been unclear for Palestinians facing widespread hunger after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/middleeast/israel-aid-halt-gaza.html" title="">Israel blocked food</a> from entering Gaza. Many have sought to beat the huge crowds flooding the distribution sites by arriving as early as possible, often after walking long distances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While the U.N. relied on hundreds of distribution sites across Gaza, the Israeli-backed effort has only four, creating a bottleneck.</p><p>Some Palestinians have tried to advance in the line by taking shortcuts to the aid sites outside the officially marked path, but people both on and off that path appeared to have come under fire, according to three of the witnesses. And people arriving early have been told to come back later by Israeli drones, but many have ignored those calls worried that they will lose their spot in line, the witnesses said.</p><p>Mohammad Saqar, 43, said he had braved the shooting on Sunday by crouching low to the ground to avoid getting shot at, even as people were struck nearby. When he finally reached the site, he described a mad scramble as crowds rushed to grab the cardboard boxes of aid strewed in piles on the ground.</p><p>“It’s like a race for food,” said Mr. Saqar. “Those who win the race get the aid.”</p><p>Two days later, on Tuesday, a similar scene unfolded. Amid the crowd, Walid Abdeen, 16, was shot in his upper body when gunfire erupted as he and thousands of other people approached the aid site. He suffered damage to his spleen and kidneys.</p><p>“We want food,” he said, struggling to speak after undergoing emergency surgery. “I had to try to help my family.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Despite the violence, Israeli officials have argued that the new system, run by American security contractors, enables food to reach Palestinians without benefiting Hamas. In contrast, many Palestinians say the United Nations — which governed the aid distribution process for most of the war — was far more humane with its approach, despite its imperfections. The U.N. and other prominent aid groups have boycotted the new distribution system, accusing Israel of using aid as a part of its military strategy.</p><p>“The people are desperate and hungry,” Mr. Abdulal said. “That’s why they came.”</p><p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is spearheading the latest aid effort, has sought to downplay the significance of the shootings, saying it has provided more than 100,000 cardboard boxes of food “without a single incident.” But the group temporarily shut down all its sites on Wednesday, in an apparent acknowledgment that it had faced challenges in distributing aid, before reopening them the following day.</p><p>The Israeli military has offered mixed messages. It has both denied shooting civilians in the vicinity of the distribution site and acknowledged firing warning shots toward “suspects” who were approaching soldiers nearby.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/02gaza-shooting-new3/01int-gaza-shooting01a-gwbz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/02gaza-shooting-new3/01int-gaza-shooting01a-gwbz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/02gaza-shooting-new3/01int-gaza-shooting01a-gwbz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Men pushing a cart bearing bodies." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/02gaza-shooting-new3/01int-gaza-shooting01a-gwbz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/02gaza-shooting-new3/01int-gaza-shooting01a-gwbz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/02gaza-shooting-new3/01int-gaza-shooting01a-gwbz-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/02gaza-shooting-new3/01int-gaza-shooting01a-gwbz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/a1bed43f-611a-5486-9679-42222d7b081c" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians taking away the dead after people came under fire near the an aid distribution center in Rafah on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>It was still unclear whether there were other sources of gunfire in the area. Asked who shot the Palestinians on Sunday, a military spokeswoman referred to an earlier statement that did not answer the question.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>From a hospital bed in southern Gaza, Mr. Abdulal recalled the moments after being shot.</p><p>He forced himself to stand up and run to a nearby donkey cart and persuaded its owner to transport him to a field hospital run by the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p><p>The Red Cross said its 60-bed field hospital in Rafah, in southern Gaza, had collectively received 40 bodies on Sunday and Tuesday and 323 patients, most of whom had gunshot and shrapnel wounds and some of whom later died. On Tuesday, the hospital received the highest number of people wounded by weapons in a single episode since it was established over a year ago, the Red Cross said.</p><p>A field hospital operated by UK-Med in southern Gaza received 65 patients on Sunday and Tuesday, mostly with gunshot wounds and blast injuries, according to Mandy Blackman, a nurse overseeing the hospital’s operations.</p><p>Victoria Rose, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who was volunteering at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, said dead and wounded people had streamed into the emergency room.</p><p>“It was so absolutely packed that people were being nursed on the floor,” she said.</p><p>Israel’s chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, urged people on Sunday to disregard what he said were Hamas rumors about the new aid site. The military, he said, would investigate every incident and allegation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Even though Israel has said the new system will prevent Hamas from accessing aid, the Israeli military and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation have largely not checked the identifications of people arriving at the distribution site in Rafah, according to Palestinians who received aid there.</p><p>The Israeli military said the foundation was responsible for inspecting people entering the aid site. A spokesman for the organization emphasized that “trying to meter aid is going to get people hurt or killed” and said the group had not noticed an organized effort by Hamas to take its aid.</p><p>U.N. officials say there is little evidence that Hamas has systematically diverted relief. Critics in Israel have warned that the G.H.F. effort could be the first step toward establishing formal Israeli rule over Gaza.</p><p>A U.N. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-us-israel.html" title="">briefing paper</a> circulated before the G.H.F. initiative was launched last week warned of “overcrowded distribution sites” and said that Israeli forces or American contractors might “use force to control crowds.” The memo also cautioned about the potential for “organized and opportunistic looting” near the hubs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gazans returning from the food distribution center in Rafah on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Jalal al-Homs, 35, said he left a tent in southern Gaza where his family was sheltering around 1:30 a.m. Sunday.

Israeli military vehicles, he said, could be seen in the distance, and drones could be heard hovering in the sky.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>It was Mr. al-Homs’s fourth attempt this week to get a box, he said. On previous trips, he said, all the aid had been taken by the time he made it into the distribution site.</p><p>Mr. al-Homs said people were trying to push their way to the front of the crowd before the shooting began around 4:30 a.m. “It felt like it came from all over,” he said.</p><p>His brother was shot in the leg, he said, and taken to a hospital, where he underwent surgery.</p><p>Despite the danger, Mr. al-Homs said, he had few options other than returning to the distribution site so that he could feed his two sons and two daughters.</p><p>“This system isn’t just at all — it requires me risking my life for food,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.</p></div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
