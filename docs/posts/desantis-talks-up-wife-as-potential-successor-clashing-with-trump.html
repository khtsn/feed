Ron DeSantis of Florida said on Monday that his wife, Casey DeSantis, would be a formidable candidate if she chose to run for governor next year, a provocative suggestion that came days after President Trump endorsed Representative Byron Donalds as his preferred Republican candidate for the 2026 governor’s race.</p><p>Mr. DeSantis did not outright propose that Ms. DeSantis, a former local TV anchor and breast cancer survivor who has never sought public office, enter the race. But his remarks made clear that the ambitious couple, as has long been rumored, considered her a real possibility to succeed him.</p><p>“She’s never angled for anything,” Mr. DeSantis told reporters in Tampa. “But I will tell you this: You’re talking about somebody like her. I won by the biggest margin that any Republican’s won a governor’s race here in Florida. She would do better than me.”</p><p>Last week, Mr. Trump announced that he would back Mr. Donalds, a longtime ally, for governor. Mr. Donalds, a Republican from Naples, has not yet said whether he is running — no major candidate has — but has been widely expected to do so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Run, Byron, run!” Mr. Trump wrote on social media last Thursday, adding that Mr. Donalds would be “a truly great and powerful governor for Florida.” Mr. Donalds <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2025/02/21/at-cpac-byron-donalds-says-stay-tuned-following-trump-endorsement-for-governor/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland on Friday to “stay tuned” regarding his plans.</p><p>By offering endorsements or near-endorsements of two Republicans who are not yet in the governor’s race, Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis have set up a new proxy fight after the two were rivals in the presidential primary. Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/desantis-drops-out.html" title="">crushed</a> Mr. DeSantis in that contest and remains such a force that on Monday, Mr. DeSantis announced “DOGE” teams in his administration, modeled after the new federal Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p>Mr. DeSantis, who is 46, could make another White House run in 2028. Fund-raising and media attention for such a campaign could be easier if the term-limited governor, or his wife, were holding some sort of public office.</p><p>To guarantee a bully pulpit, Mr. DeSantis could have appointed himself to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy left by Marco Rubio when he became secretary of state. But Mr. DeSantis chose not to, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/desantis-ashley-moody-senate.html" title="">naming Ashley Moody</a>, the Florida attorney general, instead. Ms. Moody, a DeSantis ally, had previously been seen as a possible contender to succeed him.</p><p>Mr. DeSantis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/desantis-republicans-immigration-florida.html" title="">said last month</a> that he would raise and spend money from his powerful political committee — which he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/desantis-is-going-all-out-to-defeat-floridas-abortion-ballot-question.html" title="">used last year</a> to help defeat ballot measures protecting abortion rights and legalizing marijuana — to back a candidate in the governor’s race. Then, Ms. DeSantis’s name began circulating among Republican donors at a gathering in Palm Beach, Fla., NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/casey-desantis-considers-running-florida-governor-push-top-donors-rcna191075" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A public opinion survey <a href="https://www.unfporl.org/uploads/1/4/4/5/144559024/unf_porl_-_spring_2025_statewide_press_release.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published last week</a> by the Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida found that respondents had a more favorable view of Ms. DeSantis, who is 44, than of any other potential Republican contender.</p><p>Mr. DeSantis was once quite close with Mr. Donalds: The Florida representative helped Mr. DeSantis with debate preparation when he first ran for governor in 2018. But their relationship cooled after Mr. Donalds backed Mr. Trump in the presidential primary.</p><p>Mr. Donalds, who is Black, later criticized the DeSantis administration for proposing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/21/us/desantis-florida-black-history-standards.html" title="">African American history standards</a> stating that “slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.”</p><p>Mr. Donalds was among Mr. Trump’s choices for running mate last year, and he frequently campaigned on Mr. Trump’s behalf. On Monday, Mr. DeSantis, a former congressman who is often dismissive of what members of Congress do, cast Mr. Donalds as ineffective.</p><p>“You’ve got a guy like Byron — he just hasn’t been a part of any of the victories that we’ve had here” defeating the left in the past few years, Mr. DeSantis said, adding that Mr. Donalds had “been in other states” campaigning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“And that’s fine,” he added, “but, OK, well, then deliver results” in Washington.</p><p>Ms. DeSantis, on the other hand, “has the intestinal fortitude, the conservative principles,” Mr. DeSantis said.</p><p>Ms. DeSantis was a top surrogate for her husband during his political campaigns. As first lady, she has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/06/us/casey-desantis-ron-desantis-florida.html" title="">played a high-profile role</a> in hurricane recovery efforts.</p><p>“Everything we’ve accomplished, she’d be able to take it to the next level,” Mr. DeSantis said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Hero Runaway Dog:</strong> For months, Scrim ran wild around New Orleans, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/runaway-dog-scrim-new-orleans-hero.html">eluding capture and developing a giant fan base</a>.
