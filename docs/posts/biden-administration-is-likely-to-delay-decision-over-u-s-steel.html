Trump, have been in agreement that Nippon’s $15 billion bid to take over U.S. Steel should not move forward and that the company should remain American owned and operated.</p><p>However, the prospect that the deal would be blocked before the election <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/us/politics/us-steel-nippon-steel-biden-cfius.html" title="">drew backlash</a> from business groups and legal experts who feared that political interests were tainting a process that is intended to be focused on national security.</p><p>A White House spokeswoman said in a statement that a decision to block the deal was never “imminent” because the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which has been reviewing the transaction, has not provided Mr. Biden with a recommendation. She emphasized that he continued to want U.S. Steel to remain American owned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The president’s position is that it is vital for U.S. Steel to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated,” said Saloni Sharma, the spokeswoman. “The president told our steelworkers he has their backs, and he meant it.”</p><p>The transaction was announced in December and set off a public battle between the steelworkers union, which opposes the deal, and U.S. Steel, which said the bid was a financial lifeline for the company. U.S. Steel executives have warned that if the deal is blocked, it might have to cut jobs and move its headquarters out of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Administration officials signaled last week that the interagency panel was preparing to advise that Mr. Biden block the deal because it posed a threat to the U.S. steel industry and supply chains. The committee also expressed concerns that Nippon would not side with the United States in international trade cases related to American tariffs on steel imports.</p><p>Legal experts said that those arguments would be hard to justify because Japan is a close U.S. ally and that blocking the deal on such pretenses could lead to litigation. Japanese officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/business/nippon-steel-us-steel-japan.html" title="">have bristled at the idea</a> that the United States could cite national security as a reason to block the deal.</p><p>But the powerful steelworkers union has been adamantly opposed to Nippon’s bid, arguing that the company would not honor pension agreements and expressing concerns that it would not keep its promises to invest in facilities in Pennsylvania. And Democratic lawmakers, including senators from Ohio and Pennsylvania, have encouraged Mr. Biden to block the transaction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a statement on Friday, the United Steelworkers union simply noted that the White House has expressed support for its cause.</p><p>“President Biden and Vice President Harris have been clear and consistent in their support for USW members and in their call for U.S. Steel to remain domestically owned and operated,” said David McCall, the union’s president.</p><p>Top executives from Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel met this week with Biden administration officials involved in the review process in a last-ditch effort to salvage the agreement.</p><p>According to people familiar with the process, the companies had requested to withdraw their applications with the panel, known as CFIUS, in hopes that they could buy more time for a review and try to mitigate the government’s concerns. CFIUS had not granted that request, but doing so would allow the review process to continue until later in the year.</p><p>Officials from the State and Defense Departments had expressed reservations about blocking the agreement, according to two people familiar with the matter. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of CFIUS, had avoided speaking publicly about the review process but emphasized during an event last week the importance of foreign direct investment to the economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In cases where the committee is divided over a deal, it is up to the president to make a determination.</p><p>The politics of any decision are complicated by the fact that it is unclear how U.S. Steel would proceed if the deal was blocked and if workers would end up losing jobs.</p><p>Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, has criticized U.S. Steel for threatening to lay off workers and said that he supported the steelworkers union but that his priority was preserving jobs in the state.</p><p>“The federal government will ultimately make the final decision as to whether or not the U.S. Steel/Nippon deal goes forward,” Mr. Shapiro said at an event in Pittsburgh last week. “My focus has been and will continue to be on protecting and growing jobs in the Mon Valley and all across Western Pennsylvania.”</p><p>Representatives for U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel declined to comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/13/biden-nippon-steel-deal-election/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Washington Post reported</a> earlier that the Biden administration intended to delay a decision on the case.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter, based in Washington.
