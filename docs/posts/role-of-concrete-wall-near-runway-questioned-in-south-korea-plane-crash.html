When they do, they are typically made of softer materials designed to break apart or absorb impact with minimal damage to a plane that overruns a runway.</p><p>Details about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/asia/plane-crash-video-south-korea.html" title="">the cause of the crash</a> on Sunday of Jeju Air Flight 7C2216, the worst ever on South Korean soil, will likely remain unclear until investigators release their preliminary findings, expected in the coming month. Experts cautioned against drawing conclusions, including about the possible role of airport infrastructure, until a full review of evidence is complete.</p><p>But in the days ahead, “investigators will be looking at that wall,” said Hassan Shahidi, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, a nonprofit that provides safety guidance to the aviation industry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Barriers near runways “should break easily in the case of a runway overrun so the impact isn’t catastrophic,” Mr. Shahidi said. “What we saw here was a head-on collision with a concrete wall that appears very thick,” he added.</p><p>The plane involved in Sunday’s crash, a Boeing 737-800, had taken off from Bangkok and was landing at Muan International Airport in South Korea’s southwest. As the plane was preparing to land, the airport warned the pilot about a potential bird strike. They aborted their first attempt at landing and descended from the opposite direction, which local officials said they were allowed to do.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/29/multimedia/29skorea-crash-ledeall-pwlf/29skorea-crash-ledeall-pwlf-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Only two people survived when a Jeju Air plane crashed at Muan Airport in South Korea on Sunday, the country’s worst aviation disaster in decades.

It skidded down the tarmac on its belly and rammed into a mound of earth surrounding a concrete barrier past the end of the runway. The plane then exploded into a fireball.</p><p>The regions of an airport near runways, known as runway safety areas, are meant to provide unobstructed space for aircraft in the event they run past, undershoot, or veer off a runway during landing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/runway-safety-fact-sheet#:~:text=Runway%20Safety%20Areas%20(RSA),the%20runway%20(runway%20excursion)." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> that standard runway safety areas extend 1,000 feet beyond the runway’s end and 500 feet on the sides. Any structures within these zones should be “frangible,” F.A.A. rules say, able to break or give way to prevent catastrophic damage.</p><p>The International Civil Aviation Organization recommends a standard buffer zone of about 180 to 300 meters, or 591 feet to 984 feet, from the end of the runway. At Muan airport, the concrete structure surrounded by a mound of dirt sits roughly 250 meters from the end of the runway, according to local officials.</p><p>Determining whether a runway safety area meets regulatory requirements involves evaluating a number of factors, including local geography. Some airport runways were constructed before runway buffer zone rules took effect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A relative of the victims waiting at the airport on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

The structures tore through the plane, which caught fire, killing 11 people and injuring 80.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At Muan airport, the concrete structure that Flight 7C2216 smashed into housed a device called a localizer, an antenna array that is used to guide aircraft during their approach and landing, local officials said. These antennas are normally located beyond the departure end of the runway, and they must be placed according to specific guidelines to function correctly.</p><p>Immediately following the crash, attention was drawn to the length of the runway at Muan airport. South Korea’s deputy transport minister, Joo Jong-wan, said that the runway’s 2,800-meter length did not contribute to the accident.</p><p>Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of engineering at the University of Southern California who studies aviation safety, said he believes investigators will instead focus on the fact that the localizer antenna was mounted on a base made of a hard concrete rather than a more standard metal tower or pylon installation.</p><p>“This rigid structure proved catastrophic when the skidding aircraft made impact,” Dr. Meshkati said. The crash underscores the need to implement “soft barriers” at runway ends at airports worldwide, “to dampen and minimize the impact of runway excursions, which occur with concerning frequency,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The structure at the end of the runway that the plane hit, causing it to burst into flames.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

Concrete structures are used to house localizer antennas at other airports in South Korea and elsewhere, he added.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At airports such as New York’s LaGuardia, where space is limited, a barrier known as an “engineering materials arresting system” is designed to stop a plane without significant damage. At LaGuardia, “if you go off the end of the runway, the structure gets mired in this soft concrete and it stops immediately,” said Jeff Guzzetti, founder of Guzzetti Aviation, a safety consulting firm.</p><p>“Absent that, a runway should have clear safety zones,” Mr. Guzzetti said.</p><p>In the weeks ahead, beyond examining the size of Muan airport’s runway safety area, investigators are likely to focus on the material used in the structure that held the localizer antenna and other factors, like how firmly it was anchored to the ground, Mr. Shahidi and other experts said.</p><p>Choe Sang-Hun<!-- --> and <!-- -->Lee Su-Hyun<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Dec. 30, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the type of plane that crashed in South Korea on Sunday.
