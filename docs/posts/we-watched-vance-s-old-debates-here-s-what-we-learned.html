Trump’s presidential ticket in a matchup against his Democratic rival, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota.</p><p>It’s a moment he has been anticipating for months.</p><p>Mr. Vance spoke eagerly about the vice-presidential debate shortly after being named to Mr. Trump’s ticket in July. When President Biden dropped out of the race, Mr. Vance reacted with disappointment — because now he would no longer debate Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>“Talk about take-backs,” Mr. Vance said at his first solo campaign event. “I was told I was going to get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump’s going to get to debate her. I’m kind of pissed off about that if I’m being honest with you.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For his face-off with Mr. Walz, Mr. Vance has been busy with debate prep, including semiregular “murder board” sessions in which his top advisers pummel him with pointed questions and heated attacks.</p><p>But his biggest advantage may be his recent experience. While Mr. Vance, 40, assumed his first public office just last year, to win that job he had to survive a gantlet of about a dozen primary and general-election debates.</p><p>A review of those events shows that Mr. Vance, a best-selling author with a rebellious streak, brings a similarly distinct style to his debates. He is aggressive and bold in his assertions. His pugnacity often leads to over-the-top claims, but he is also careful to present as more polite and thoughtful than the caricature of him portrayed by opponents.</p><p>Here’s a look at Mr. Vance’s debating style — and what it may tell us about his upcoming matchup against Mr. Walz.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-b8c4262">He’s quick on his feet.</h2><p>Mr. Vance was a first-time candidate when he ran for the Senate in 2022, but no amount of experience could have prepared him for the extraordinary moment that unfolded in front of him as two Republican primary opponents nearly came to blows on a debate stage in Columbus, Ohio.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>0:13</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Mr. Vance was quick to comment on a confrontation between his Republican opponents in a race for U.S. Senate during a debate hosted by FreedomWorks Media in 2022.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Two tours in Iraq.

He laughed and reached for his microphone but reconsidered and placed it beside his lap.</p><p>Mr. Vance grew agitated as the confrontation continued. He leaned back in his chair. He examined the back of his tie. “Goddamn, this is ridiculous,” he blurted out as the moderator tried to restore order.</p><p>When it was his turn for a question a few minutes later, Mr. Vance, who, like Mr. Mandel, had served in the Marines, appeared ready to unload on Mr. Gibbons. Instead, Mr. Vance berated Mr. Mandel, who was ahead in the polls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“This guy wants to be a U.S. senator, and he’s up here, ‘Hold me back, hold me back, I got two tours in the Marine Corps,’” Mr. Vance said, using an exaggerated voice to mimic Mr. Mandel. “What a joke. Answer the question, stop playing around.”</p><p>The moment was noted at Mar-a-Lago, where Mr. Trump would clinch the Senate race for Mr. Vance with an endorsement a few weeks later. It also showed Mr. Vance’s ability to react quickly and not overthink the response to even the most unexpected of debate moments.</p><h2 id="link-7e382f61">He has faced a folksy Democrat before.</h2><p>Mr. Vance’s opponent in the general election for the Senate seat two years ago, Tim Ryan, campaigned as a folksy, bipartisan Everyman similar to Mr. Walz.</p><p>Mr. Ryan, a Democrat who at the time was an Ohio congressman, favored Cleveland sports jerseys on the trail and often stood behind the debate lectern with his hand tucked casually into the pocket of his suit pants as he leveled attacks at Mr. Vance while referring to him as “buddy.”</p><p>“My turn, pal — my turn,” Mr. Ryan said, holding up his open palm as Mr. Vance tried to interrupt during one of their debates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Oh, buddy, your turn,” a frustrated Mr. Vance shot back while waving off Mr. Ryan with his hand.</p><p>In one attack, Mr. Ryan referred to old neighborhood friends as a way to attack Mr. Vance as too much of a supplicant to Mr. Trump.</p><p>“I don’t know anybody I grew up with, I don’t know anybody I went to high school with that would allow somebody to take their dignity like that,” Mr. Ryan <a href="https://x.com/ccadelago/status/1579626628963241984?s=20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><p>To better prepare for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/tim-walz-debate-history.html" title="">Mr. Walz’s Minnesota version of “Midwestern nice,”</a> the Vance team recruited Representative Tom Emmer to play the role of the governor in a mock debate.</p><p>Mr. Emmer is a fellow Minnesotan with a similarly reliable love of sports — Mr. Walz coached high school football, while Mr. Emmer played college hockey before coaching youth teams. Mr. Emmer is deeply familiar with Mr. Walz after having served with him for several terms in Congress.</p><p>Before his mock debate with Mr. Vance on Friday in Cincinnati, Mr. Emmer studied for the role and even held a mock debate of the mock debate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“He’s going to do a great job,” Mr. Emmer said on Sunday on ABC. “Once he understands that Tim Walz is just going to try and deflect and go into this folksy whatever, he’ll hold him accountable.”</p><h2 id="link-2c48c0fe">There is almost no question he hasn’t heard.</h2><p>Mr. Vance has had a strong sense of self-confidence when speaking to reporters since his days working in media relations for the Marines. “The experience taught me a valuable lesson: that I could do it,” Mr. Vance wrote in his memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.” “I could work 20-hour days when I had to. I could speak clearly and confidently with TV cameras shoved in my face.”</p><p>He has brought that assurance to the campaign trail, where he has been interviewed dozens of times on cable networks and Sunday morning news broadcasts, and by local TV, radio and print reporters. An unusual twist during his campaign rallies is a regular Q. and A. session with reporters.</p><p>Those interactions have also doubled as debate prep. Mr. Vance’s team says there is probably no issue he’ll be asked about on Tuesday that he hasn’t already fielded.</p><p>A key has been his willingness to wade far beyond the friendly terrain of conservative news media and to face more confrontational questions. Those appearances have helped him sharpen his skills.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Vance can laugh off questions, quickly pivot to turn almost any issue into an attack on Ms. Harris and rarely strays far from the campaign message. His interview with Dana Bash that aired two weeks ago on CNN showed he could get frustrated in the moment but also quickly recover.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-15"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>0:30</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>In an interview with Dana Bash, a CNN anchor, Mr. Vance tried to recover after being asked about his unfounded claim that Haitian migrants in Ohio were eating people’s pets.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“If I have to … ” “But it wasn’t just a meme.” “ … create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do, Dana, because you guys are completely letting Kamala Harris coast.” “You just said that this is a story that you created.” “Yes.” “So the, the eating dogs and cats thing is not accurate.” “We are creating, we are - Dana, it comes from firsthand accounts from my constituents.
