Trump’s presidential ticket in a matchup against his Democratic rival, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota.</p><p>It’s a moment he has been anticipating for months.</p><p>Mr. Vance spoke eagerly about the vice-presidential debate shortly after being named to Mr. Trump’s ticket in July. When President Biden dropped out of the race, Mr. Vance reacted with disappointment — because now he would no longer debate Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>“Talk about take-backs,” Mr. Vance said at his first solo campaign event. “I was told I was going to get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump’s going to get to debate her. I’m kind of pissed off about that if I’m being honest with you.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For his face-off with Mr. Walz, Mr. Vance has been busy with debate prep, including semiregular “murder board” sessions in which his top advisers pummel him with pointed questions and heated attacks.</p><p>But his biggest advantage may be his recent experience. While Mr. Vance, 40, assumed his first public office just last year, to win that job he had to survive a gantlet of about a dozen primary and general-election debates.</p><p>A review of those events shows that Mr. Vance, a best-selling author with a rebellious streak, brings a similarly distinct style to his debates. He is aggressive and bold in his assertions. His pugnacity often leads to over-the-top claims, but he is also careful to present as more polite and thoughtful than the caricature of him portrayed by opponents.</p><p>Here’s a look at Mr. Vance’s debating style — and what it may tell us about his upcoming matchup against Mr. Walz.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-b8c4262">He’s quick on his feet.</h2><p>Mr. Vance was a first-time candidate when he ran for the Senate in 2022, but no amount of experience could have prepared him for the extraordinary moment that unfolded in front of him as two Republican primary opponents nearly came to blows on a debate stage in Columbus, Ohio.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Mr. Vance was quick to comment on a confrontation between his Republican opponents in a race for U.S. Senate during a debate hosted by FreedomWorks Media in 2022.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Two tours in Iraq. Don’t tell me I haven’t worked. Don’t tell me I haven’t worked.” “Think about, think about what we just saw. This guy wants to be a U.S. Senator, and he’s up here, ‘Hold me back. Hold me back. I got two tours in the Marine Corps.’ What a joke. Answer the question. Stop playing around.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/29/29vid-Vance-debate-quickonfeet-80642-cover/29vid-Vance-debate-quickonfeet-80642-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Mr. Vance was quick to comment on a confrontation between his Republican opponents in a race for U.S. Senate during a debate hosted by FreedomWorks Media in 2022.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mike Gibbons, an investment banker, had mocked Josh Mandel, a former state treasurer, for having “never spent a day in the private sector.” Mr. Mandel, a veteran, stood up and pointed a finger back at Mr. Gibbons, saying, “Two tours in Iraq — don’t tell me I haven’t worked.”</p><p>They stood chest to chest, trading taunts as Mr. Vance watched wide-eyed. He laughed and reached for his microphone but reconsidered and placed it beside his lap.</p><p>Mr. Vance grew agitated as the confrontation continued. He leaned back in his chair. He examined the back of his tie. “Goddamn, this is ridiculous,” he blurted out as the moderator tried to restore order.</p><p>When it was his turn for a question a few minutes later, Mr. Vance, who, like Mr. Mandel, had served in the Marines, appeared ready to unload on Mr. Gibbons. Instead, Mr. Vance berated Mr. Mandel, who was ahead in the polls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“This guy wants to be a U.S. senator, and he’s up here, ‘Hold me back, hold me back, I got two tours in the Marine Corps,’” Mr. Vance said, using an exaggerated voice to mimic Mr. Mandel. “What a joke. Answer the question, stop playing around.”</p><p>The moment was noted at Mar-a-Lago, where Mr. Trump would clinch the Senate race for Mr. Vance with an endorsement a few weeks later. It also showed Mr. Vance’s ability to react quickly and not overthink the response to even the most unexpected of debate moments.</p><h2 id="link-7e382f61">He has faced a folksy Democrat before.</h2><p>Mr. Vance’s opponent in the general election for the Senate seat two years ago, Tim Ryan, campaigned as a folksy, bipartisan Everyman similar to Mr. Walz.</p><p>Mr. Ryan, a Democrat who at the time was an Ohio congressman, favored Cleveland sports jerseys on the trail and often stood behind the debate lectern with his hand tucked casually into the pocket of his suit pants as he leveled attacks at Mr. Vance while referring to him as “buddy.”</p><p>“My turn, pal — my turn,” Mr. Ryan said, holding up his open palm as Mr. Vance tried to interrupt during one of their debates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Oh, buddy, your turn,” a frustrated Mr. Vance shot back while waving off Mr. Ryan with his hand.</p><p>In one attack, Mr. Ryan referred to old neighborhood friends as a way to attack Mr. Vance as too much of a supplicant to Mr. Trump.</p><p>“I don’t know anybody I grew up with, I don’t know anybody I went to high school with that would allow somebody to take their dignity like that,” Mr. Ryan <a href="https://x.com/ccadelago/status/1579626628963241984?s=20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><p>To better prepare for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/tim-walz-debate-history.html" title="">Mr. Walz’s Minnesota version of “Midwestern nice,”</a> the Vance team recruited Representative Tom Emmer to play the role of the governor in a mock debate.</p><p>Mr. Emmer is a fellow Minnesotan with a similarly reliable love of sports — Mr. Walz coached high school football, while Mr. Emmer played college hockey before coaching youth teams. Mr. Emmer is deeply familiar with Mr. Walz after having served with him for several terms in Congress.</p><p>Before his mock debate with Mr. Vance on Friday in Cincinnati, Mr. Emmer studied for the role and even held a mock debate of the mock debate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“He’s going to do a great job,” Mr. Emmer said on Sunday on ABC. “Once he understands that Tim Walz is just going to try and deflect and go into this folksy whatever, he’ll hold him accountable.”</p><h2 id="link-2c48c0fe">There is almost no question he hasn’t heard.</h2><p>Mr. Vance has had a strong sense of self-confidence when speaking to reporters since his days working in media relations for the Marines. “The experience taught me a valuable lesson: that I could do it,” Mr. Vance wrote in his memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.” “I could work 20-hour days when I had to. I could speak clearly and confidently with TV cameras shoved in my face.”</p><p>He has brought that assurance to the campaign trail, where he has been interviewed dozens of times on cable networks and Sunday morning news broadcasts, and by local TV, radio and print reporters. An unusual twist during his campaign rallies is a regular Q. and A. session with reporters.</p><p>Those interactions have also doubled as debate prep. Mr. Vance’s team says there is probably no issue he’ll be asked about on Tuesday that he hasn’t already fielded.</p><p>A key has been his willingness to wade far beyond the friendly terrain of conservative news media and to face more confrontational questions. Those appearances have helped him sharpen his skills.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Vance can laugh off questions, quickly pivot to turn almost any issue into an attack on Ms. Harris and rarely strays far from the campaign message. His interview with Dana Bash that aired two weeks ago on CNN showed he could get frustrated in the moment but also quickly recover.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-15"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>In an interview with Dana Bash, a CNN anchor, Mr. Vance tried to recover after being asked about his unfounded claim that Haitian migrants in Ohio were eating people’s pets.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“If I have to … ” “But it wasn’t just a meme.” “ … create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do, Dana, because you guys are completely letting Kamala Harris coast.” “You just said that this is a story that you created.” “Yes.” “So the, the eating dogs and cats thing is not accurate.” “We are creating, we are - Dana, it comes from firsthand accounts from my constituents.

Ms. Bash seized on those words.</p><p>“So, the eating dogs and cats thing is not accurate?” she asked.</p><p>Mr. Vance tilted his head and winced. The damage had been done, but Mr. Vance tried to clarify and dig himself out.</p><p>“Dana, it comes from firsthand accounts from my constituents,” he said. “I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Afterward, Democrats cheered the interview as exposing Mr. Vance’s duplicity. Conservatives, however, applauded Mr. Vance for aggressively pushing back on Ms. Bash.</p><h2 id="link-26db1964">He still hasn’t quite squared his position on abortion.</h2><p>Mr. Vance’s 2022 debates generated headlines when he supported a national abortion ban and again when he said he supported exceptions but refused to name them.</p><p>Now he’s running on a ticket with Mr. Trump, who has tried to avoid questions about a national abortion ban by saying that it was a question for the states.</p><p>The issue has created some awkward moments on the trail. Mr. Vance has resorted to answering the abortion questions by subtly distancing himself from the top of the ticket, framing his response as “President Trump’s position” or “President Trump’s view.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-19"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Multiple recordings of Mr. Vance in interviews and at campaign rallies show him sidestepping abortion questions and deferring to Mr. Trump.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“What do you want to see happen with abortion?” “Well, what I want to see happen with abortion is that each state — and this is President Trump’s view, to be clear — each state ought to make their own abortion policy.” “Donald Trump’s view is that we want the individual states and their individual cultures and their unique political sensibilities to make these decisions.” “The president thinks abortion should be decided by the states.” “But the president wants individual states to make these decisions because – look, Margaret – California’s going to have a different abortion policy from Ohio.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/29/29vid-Vance-debate-abortion-51903-cover/29vid-Vance-debate-abortion-51903-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Multiple recordings of Mr. Vance in interviews and at campaign rallies show him sidestepping abortion questions and deferring to Mr. Trump.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Even when asked to articulate his own position, he pivots.</p><p>“What do you want to see happen with abortion?” he was asked in DePere, Wis.</p><p>“Well,” Mr. Vance said, before adding, “this is President Trump’s view, to be clear: Each state ought to make their own abortion policy.”</p><p>Further complicating the issue was a public correction from Mr. Trump, who said that he never told Mr. Vance that he would veto a national ban.</p><p>When asked about the veto, Mr. Vance parroted Mr. Trump’s answer that it was a meaningless question because a ban was unlikely to pass a divided Senate.</p><p>“Let’s not engage in stupid hypotheticals that are never going to happen,” Mr. Vance said in Wisconsin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>But engaging in hypotheticals seems to be exactly what Mr. Vance has done — he has been a vocal supporter for a national ban proposed last year by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.</p><h2 id="link-1fda26">He has some Trumpy moves.</h2><p>Mr. Vance has several moves when it comes to political communications.</p><p>He has few qualms about sanding down facts to sharpen his attacks on an opponent, but he is careful not to appear out of control in front of a camera. He’s a policy wonk who was once a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. But he has also perfected one of Mr. Trump’s go-to moves — turning the tables and accusing his opponents of doing whatever it is they’re accusing him of doing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-24"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Mr. Vance took a page out of Mr. Trump’s playbook by turning an attack back on his opponent, Tim Ryan, two years ago.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Hold on, JD.” “No, this is, this is disgusting.
