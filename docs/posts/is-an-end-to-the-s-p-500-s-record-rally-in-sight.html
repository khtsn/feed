The cache would more than meet global demand, and is potentially huge news for Exxon Mobil, one of the companies investing in lithium development in the region.</p><h2 id="link-557fadaf">The state of the race to lead the House of Mouse</h2><p>The news that Disney plans to take its time in naming a successor to Bob Iger — the entertainment giant has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/business/disney-ceo-succession-james-gorman-chairman.html" title="">given itself until early 2026</a> to name a C.E.O. — may seem a little worrisome to company watchers used to bad news about the topic.</p><p>But the elevation of James Gorman, who ran a well-regarded process to find his successor as Morgan Stanley’s C.E.O., to chair suggests that Disney is seriously focused on the matter after struggling for years to find an acceptable replacement for Iger.</p><p><strong>What does the news say about the state of the succession process? </strong>Possibly that it’s not going well. There are four internal candidates being considered: Dana Walden, the company’s top TV executive; Josh D’Amaro, its theme parks chief; Alan Bergman, its movies leader; and Jimmy Pitaro, the chair of ESPN.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Taking longer to choose a leader suggests that the candidates have all failed to convince the board that they are the right choice, or that they need more time to gain the necessary experience to oversee the media giant, <a href="https://puck.news/newsletter_content/what-im-hearing-offshoring-blame-game-gormans-disney-anora-intrigue-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Puck’s Matt Belloni</a>.</p><p>Could that mean that the House of Mouse will look outside for its next chief? The company said such candidates were being “reviewed.”</p><p><strong>The stakes are high.</strong> A lack of a succession plan was one of the major gripes in Nelson Peltz’s unsuccessful campaign to win seats on Disney’s board this spring. Remember that Iger pushed his retirement back four times before handing the reins to Bob Chapek in 2020, only to come back to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/business/media/disney-bob-iger-chapek.html" title="">replace his handpicked successor</a>. And, according to a CNBC report from last year, the board had initially hoped to find a new leader <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/06/disney-succession-mess-iger-chapek.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by early 2025</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Disney has been busy trying to engineer a comeback at the box office, while shoring up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/media/disney-earnings-parks.html" title="">newfound weaknesses in its theme parks division</a>.</p><p><strong>Naming Gorman as chair could help shore up the process.</strong> He will assume the role in January, taking over for Mark Parker, who is expected to refocus on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/business/nike-elliott-hill-john-donahoe.html" title="">turnaround at Nike</a> as the sportswear giant’s executive chair.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Gorman had already been tasked with overseeing the succession process, drawing on his experience running one of the <a href="https://puck.news/james-gormans-goodbye-inside-a-ceo-succession-bake-off/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">smoothest handovers on Wall Street</a> in years.

That’s partly because details weren’t revealed on how many roles would go and how much money would be saved and some analysts want to know <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/hsbc-appoints-pam-kaur-first-female-cfo-2024-10-22/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">what other parts of the group</a> could be cut next.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-7c0fa6f">The next challenge for the W.N.B.A.</h2><p>The W.N.B.A just finished perhaps its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5858622/2024/10/21/lynx-liberty-wnba-finals-the-pulse-2/" title="">most prominent season yet</a>, bolstered by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5786906/2024/09/23/caitlin-clark-wnba-ratings-attendance-rookie/" title="">star power of Caitlin Clark</a>. Now players are seeking a new contract that will let them better cash in on the league’s soaring growth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The question is: How much will they be able to extract from a business that is only now starting to see major success, with a year to negotiate until there’s a potential lockout?</p><p><strong>The W.N.B.A. has exploded in popularity since the last collective bargaining agreement, </strong>or C.B.A.,<strong> </strong>which was signed ahead of the 2020 season. W.N.B.A. said it had its <a href="https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-delivers-record-setting-2024-season" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highest total attendance</a> in 22 years, up 48 percent from last season.</p><p>And this year, the league signed an 11-year media deal worth about $2.2 billion, about six times as much as its previous deal.</p><p><strong>But is W.N.B.A.’s growth sustainable? </strong>The league <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/business/dealbook/wnba-womens-basketball-money.html" title="">has long lost money</a> — a trend that is likely <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/18/sports/wnba-will-lose-40-million-this-season-with-nba-investors-growing-impatient/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to continue this year</a> — and it’s unclear whether Clark’s surging popularity will permanently extend to the league more broadly.</p><p>There’s one sign that it might: A <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2024/1021/WNBA-finals-record-breaking-New-York-Liberty" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">record number of viewers</a> tuned into the New York Liberty’s championship win against the Minnesota Lynx, a game in which Clark did not play.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>A key negotiating point will be over players’ share of league revenue. </strong>Players <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wnba-players-only-get-9-3-of-league-revenue-heres-how-much-nba-nfl-and-nhl-players-get-0abef80c#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">split 9.3 percent</a> of the league’s revenue. (By contrast, N.B.A. players get about half of their league’s topline.) But unlike many other leagues, the W.N.B.A. has multiple equity holders: the N.B.A., which owns about 42 percent; W.N.B.A. team owners, who collectively hold 42 percent; and private equity, which controls nearly 16 percent. That makes splitting the cash much more complicated.</p><p>Still, Clara Wu Tsai, who owns the Liberty with her husband, the tech mogul Joe Tsai, told DealBook that she thought players would get a bigger share of revenue in the end.</p><p>“I can’t talk about the C.B.A. publicly, but I think there’s so much pressure — and there’s also a great disparity right now among the percentage of revenue shared between the W.N.B.A., and what it is versus the N.B.A.,” she said. “I’m sure there will be something in between.”</p><h3 id="link-7c091e00"><span>THE SPEED READ </span></h3><p><strong>Deals</strong></p><ul><li><p>JCP Investment Management, an activist investor, is reportedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/activist-urges-cheesecake-factory-to-consider-breakup-c805ddf9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pushing the Cheesecake Factory</a> to consider selling off its three smaller restaurant brands.
