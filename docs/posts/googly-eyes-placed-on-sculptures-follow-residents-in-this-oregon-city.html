a six-foot sphere that was brought to life and given a touch of whimsy; and a red phoenix, one of the oldest installations, which took on an air of bewilderment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Big Ears,” by the artist Joe Halko, was installed in 2001.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">City of Bend, Oregon, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“While the googly eyes placed on the various art pieces around town might give you a chuckle, it costs money to remove them with care to not damage the art,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CityofBendOregon/posts/pfbid0FEtRowEtEA5Q2jLwPia14CAxPwNL9Eripj728DWGxsaiLPc6csLBEwuDJPoTZafWl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the city wrote this month on social media</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some residents viewed Bend’s statement as dampening a bit of entertainment in the city of more than 100,000 people.</p><p>“My daughter and I went past the flaming chicken today and shared the biggest laugh,” one person commented on Bend’s social media post, using the nickname for the phoenix installation. “We love the googly eyes. This town is getting to be so stuffy. Let’s have fun!”</p><p>Other commenters cited homelessness and education as a better use of the city’s budget.</p><p>The city has spent $1,500 removing the googly eyes from the installations, René Mitchell, Bend’s communications director, said in an email. She added that one piece, “Crossroads,” a circular steel sculpture depicting a set of crossing logs, was also marked with graffiti and would require $5,000 to repair.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The sculpture “Orb I” with pieces of cardboard in place of the googly eyes that were removed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">City of Bend, Oregon, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Adhesives can pull off the paint, wax or other protective coatings on the metals,” Ms. Mitchell said. “If paint on steel is chipped, scratched or removed with adhesives, the steel will rust.”</p><p>Without those coatings, some metals are susceptible to corrosion, she said, adding that “each metal requires a trained conservator and a different process to remove.”</p><p>Pamela Pakker-Kozicki, co-owner and manager of Ulrich Pakker Studios, whose husband’s “Three Rising” sculpture had been googly-eyed, according to <a href="https://www.centraloregondaily.com/news/local/colbert-bend-googly-eye-bandit/article_e7f57428-b994-11ef-b2ee-2b4ff6ac1de1.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Central Oregon Daily News</a>, had not known about the prank until Saturday.</p><p>“Our first reaction is that it’s silly, it’s playful,” she said in an interview on Saturday. “It is vastly preferable for a piece of public art to have interactions with the public than be ignored.”</p><p>She added, though, that was “with the caveat that these googly eyes can be easily removed and it doesn’t damage the sculpture.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Local businesses took the opportunity to create their own eye art.</p><p>The Pine Tavern Restaurant in Bend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PineTavern/posts/1156940269773921?ref=embed_post" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a photo</a> with googly eyes above the building’s front door, and the Unofficial Logging Co., an indoor ax-throwing facility, posted an image of the eyes (possibly frightened) above several axes <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ULCOaxes/posts/pfbid02Ap2LYoZhS6gwqgMkrNgint99TTyTRC7C4e2b3oJgcTwxGeK3hbLESPbA6USPFayjl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wedged into a target</a>.</p><p>“I think slightly harmless fun is good to do, and a little bit of light civil disobedience is always healthy for a community,” said John Heylin, co-owner and manager of the ax-throwing business.</p><p>The prank received national attention this week when it was featured during a segment on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlQdyLr6WJY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</a>,” in which the host took lighthearted aim at the city’s reaction.</p><p>“You’re gonna get mad about that? It’s fun!” Mr. Colbert said.</p><p>In the past, the Roundabout sculptures have been adorned during the holidays with Santa hats and wreaths, which the city has said on social media it does not condone, adding that residents should “stay away from adhesives, graffiti and all things that can damage the art.”</p><p>Bend is not the first city to be overtaken by googly eyes. This year, a band of Boston residents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/30/us/boston-t-train-googly-eyes.html" title="">successfully campaigned</a> to have the eyes affixed to the T trains in the city.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Although the googly eyes in Bend did not last — they remain on only the phoenix sculpture — Ms. Mitchell emphasized that the city was not trying to squash a little cheer.</p><p>Law enforcement has not been involved, and the city was not pursuing an investigation.</p><p>“We, too, think the googly eyes are funny and appreciate the admiration and interest our community has taken with them and our public art collection,” Ms. Mitchell said. “We just want to make sure the art lasts and is not damaged.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emmett Lindner writes about breaking and trending news.
