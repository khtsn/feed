Also notable was that the strikes targeted airfields in or near Russia’s Kursk region, where Kyiv’s troops <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion-war.html" title="">punched across the border in a surprise attack</a> last week and have been advancing ever since.</p></div></div><div><p>Russia’s Defense Ministry <a href="https://t.me/mod_russia/42135" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Wednesday</a> that Ukraine had launched 117 drones on multiple Russian regions, including those housing the airfields.

</div></section></div><div><div><p>Satellite imagery showed that the strikes destroyed at least two hangars and damaged a warehouse. It was unclear if any aircraft were hit. Images from the two other airfields that Ukraine’s military claimed it had hit did not show major damage.</p><p>Ukraine has taken to targeting Russian airfields in hopes of crippling Moscow’s ability to launch devastating airstrikes against Ukrainian troops and cities. The four airfields targeted by the Ukrainian military on Wednesday housed Su-34 fighter-bombers, which launch powerful glide bombs, and Su-35 fighter jets, which Russia uses to carry out missile strikes.</p><p>Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow for air power at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said the latest attacks were “part of a much longer running Ukrainian campaign to hold Russian air bases at threat and cause incremental damage to air assets on the ground.”</p><p>They also could have been an effort to limit the risks to Ukrainian troops conducting the assault in the Kursk region: Two of the airfields that were hit in the past week were to the immediate east of Kursk. The Ukrainian military appears intent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion-troops.html" title="">on holding on to the territory</a> it has captured, and analysts say that fixed Ukrainian positions would be vulnerable to Russian airstrikes.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The attacks on Wednesday were carried out with Ukrainian drones: Western allies have placed restrictions on using their weapons inside Russia amid fears that doing so would escalate the war.</p><p>But Ukraine has continuously appealed for those restrictions to be lifted, saying that missiles would be more effective — a point President Volodymyr Zelensky has raised at least four times in his <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/ukrayina-dovodit-sho-dijsno-vmiye-povertati-spravedlivist-zv-92565" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nightly addresses</a> over the past five days.</p><p>“Our Ukrainian drones work exactly as they should. But there are things that cannot be done with drones alone,” Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prodovzhuyemo-pracyuvati-z-partnerami-shodo-dalekobijnih-ris-92625" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in his nightly address on Wednesday</a>. “We need other weapons — missile weapons,” he added.</p><p>Ukraine’s long-range strike abilities consist of a mix of domestically produced drones that can fly long distances and powerful missiles supplied by partners. Ukraine has used the drones to strike inside Russia and the missiles to attack military installations in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.</p><p>While Ukraine’s attacks inside Russia were initially largely aimed at oil infrastructure and Russian air defense systems, military airfields appear to be increasingly targeted.</p></div></div><div><p>Last week, Ukraine struck a Russian airfield <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-lipetsk.html" title="">in the Lipetsk region</a>, which borders Kursk. Satellite imagery reviewed by The Times showed damage to an apparent ammunition depot. Ukraine’s military said warehouses at the Lipetsk airfield contained over 700 glide bombs, a claim that could not be independently confirmed.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destroyed and burned buildings at a military airfield in Lipetsk, Russia, on Aug. 9.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Planet Labs</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Analysts say that Russia will most likely be better able to rely on air power now that the Ukrainian cross-border assault has entered its second week and lost its element of surprise — especially since it is easier to hit stationary positions Kyiv’s forces might set up as they dig in and hold territory.</p><p>That prospect appeared increasingly likely.</p><p>Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine’s top commander, <a href="https://t.me/osirskiy/808" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Thursday</a> that a military command office had been set up in a part of the Kursk region controlled by Ukraine. He added that his troops were continuing to advance and now controlled an area of about 450 square miles. His claims could not be independently verified.</p><p>“Enemy aviation, particularly the presence of glide bombs and ballistic missiles, remains a serious threat,” said Serhii Kuzan, the chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, a nongovernmental research group.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ukraine recently received its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/world/europe/ukraine-f-16-fighter-jets.html" title="">first batch of long-awaited F-16 fighter jets</a>, which are capable of shooting down incoming Russian missiles and engaging in air combat.</p><p>Whether F-16s could be used to provide air support for the Kursk offensive, though, remains to be seen. Russia’s border area is heavily protected by air defense systems, according to Nico Lange, a military expert and former German official. That, he said, makes it “really difficult to fly close if you’re the Ukrainian Air Force.”</p><p>Malachy Browne<!-- --> and <!-- -->Christoph Koettl<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><p><strong>News and Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p>Russia has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion-troops.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">begun withdrawing some troops from Ukraine</a> in an effort to repel Kyiv’s cross-border assault, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.</p></li><li><p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/europe/russia-ukraine-incursion-war-east.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">lashed out at the West</a> over Ukraine’s incursion into Russian territory, a sign of how the surprise attack has unsettled the Kremlin.</p></li><li><p>Ukraine’s attack signified a shift in tactics for Kyiv after more than two years of war with Russia. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion-war.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Here’s what to know about the operation</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Read More</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Summer Camps During War: </strong>As the once carefree summers of Ukrainian childhood and young adulthood are forever altered by war, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/world/europe/ukraine-summer-camps-war.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">traditional camps have taken on a more patriotic tone</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ukraine’s </strong><strong>Sports in Tatters</strong><strong>: </strong>Facilities have been battered.
