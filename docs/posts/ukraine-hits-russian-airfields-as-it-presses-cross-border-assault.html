It did not mention any damage. However, satellite imagery verified by The New York Times showed that Russian air bases in Savasleyka and Borisoglebsk, located 400 and 150 miles from the border with Ukraine, respectively, sustained damage.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Satellite imagery showed that the strikes destroyed at least two hangars and damaged a warehouse.

Ukraine continues to appeal for those restrictions to be lifted.</p><p>“Our Ukrainian drones work exactly as they should. But there are things that cannot be done with drones alone,” President Volodymyr Zelensky <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prodovzhuyemo-pracyuvati-z-partnerami-shodo-dalekobijnih-ris-92625" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in his nightly address on Wednesday</a>. “We need other weapons — missile weapons.”</p><p>Ukraine’s long-range strike capabilities consist of a mix of domestically produced drones that can fly long distances and powerful missiles supplied by partners. Ukraine has used the drones to strike inside Russia and the missiles to attack military bases in Russian-occupied territory.</p><p>Last week, Ukraine said it struck a Russian airfield in Lipetsk, in western Russia. Satellite imagery reviewed by The New York Times and the <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-3-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Institute for the Study of War</a>, a Washington-based think tank, showed damage to apparent ammunition depots. The Ukrainian military said warehouses at the Lipetsk airfield contained over 700 glide bombs, a claim that could not be independently confirmed.</p><p>Malachy Browne<!-- --> and <!-- -->Christoph Koettl<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
