It also underscored how difficult it will be for Mr. Johnson’s conference to find Medicaid cuts that hit the spending targets Republicans set for themselves and also win enough votes to pass.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ultraconservative Republicans quickly vented their opposition, in a public reminder that Mr. Johnson’s efforts to stave off a revolt of mainstream lawmakers could cost him crucial support from his right flank. That could doom Mr. Trump’s vast <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/republicans-trump-tax-cuts.html" title="">tax and spending cut plan</a> in the House, where the speaker can afford to lose fewer than a handful of votes.</p><p>“Well - I haven’t ruled it out,” Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, declared on social media after Mr. Johnson’s comments on Tuesday night about abandoning the idea of cutting back on federal payments for some Medicaid beneficiaries. “It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied.”</p><p>House Republicans are laboring to identify roughly $2 trillion in spending cuts to help offset both the 2017 tax cuts they want to extend and the new tax cuts they want to pass in their reconciliation bill. The biggest challenge so far has centered on the Medicaid program, which provides health insurance to 72 million poor and disabled Americans.</p><p>The House budget plan calls for $880 billion in cuts from the committee that oversees the program, a target that would be difficult to achieve without substantial changes. If House Republicans cannot agree on policies that comply with the instructions, the entire package could be doomed.</p><p>Abruptly reducing federal funding for the program by paying less in the 40 states and the District of Columbia that have expanded Medicaid under Obamacare <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/upshot/medicaid-cbo-options.html" title="">would have saved</a> an estimated $710 billion over a decade, according to <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/050725_wyden-pallone_letter.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new estimates</a> released by the Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That would have cut funding to state governments, which would have been left with difficult choices. <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-expansion-is-a-red-and-blue-state-issue/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nine states</a> have passed laws that would cause them to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/medicaid-cuts-republican-budget.html" title="">automatically drop coverage</a> for the expansion population if federal funding declines, and three others have provisions that would force an immediate legislative review.</p><p>Other states would need to make up the money in some other way — by cutting benefits or payments to medical providers, raising taxes or cutting other state functions. As a result of those changes, the budget office estimated that the policy would cause 5.5 million Americans to lose their Medicaid coverage and 2.4 million Americans to become uninsured.</p><p>The Obamacare expansion extended health benefits to poor, childless adults without disabilities, a population that many Republican lawmakers consider less worthy of resources than other populations Medicaid serves, such as poor children, pregnant women and Americans who live in nursing homes. But other Republicans see this population as a core constituency, as working-class voters have become a growing component of the party’s electoral coalition.</p><p>Some conservatives like Mr. Roy have argued that uniting around cutting the Affordable Care Act, a program their party detests, should be the bare minimum for Republicans looking to raise revenue for Mr. Trump’s agenda.</p><p>“I’ve got a bunch of my colleagues running around saying, ‘Well, we can’t touch Medicaid,’” Mr. Roy said in a speech on the House floor. “Why can’t we? Medicaid was expanded under Obamacare, which we all opposed, and the Medicaid expansion was a big reason why we opposed it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But many of Mr. Roy’s colleagues, especially those in politically competitive seats, do not agree. The cuts would be particularly damaging in wealthier <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/eliminating-the-medicaid-expansion-federal-match-rate-state-by-state-estimates/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Democratic-led states</a>, such as California and New York, where Republicans have been elected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/medicaid-enrollment.html" title="">in districts</a> where many constituents use Medicaid.</p><p>“I will never support cuts to Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security that are not specifically aimed at reducing waste, fraud or abuse,” said Representative Jeff Van Drew, Republican of New Jersey.</p><p>But without any such cuts, Republicans are left with a dwindling set of options that would allow them to meet their $880 billion target. Medicaid reforms with broad support across the caucus, such as requiring beneficiaries to prove they are employed in order to keep their benefits, would not reduce spending by nearly <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-04/59109-Pallone.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as much</a>.</p><p>Another option under consideration, limiting taxes on hospitals and other complex financing maneuvers that states use to increase federal spending on the program, would tend to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/upshot/medicaid-hospitals-republicans-cuts.html" title="">disadvantage states led by Republicans</a>. The budget office estimated it would reduce the deficit by around $668 billion and cause 3.9 million more people to become uninsured.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also recently expressed a reluctance to make any major cuts to Medicaid, and has repeated several times that the program <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/upshot/trump-medicaid-tax-cuts.html" title="">should not be “touched.”</a> A White House official said Mr. Trump was pushing for stronger discounts on prescription drugs used in Medicaid, an alternative that would avoid some of the political pitfalls but may not save enough to comply with the budget language.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Catie Edmondson covers Congress for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Margot Sanger-Katz is a reporter covering health care policy and public health for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot">Upshot</a> section of The Times.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/congressional-budget-office">Congressional Budget Office</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-house-of-representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/republican-party">Republican Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/mike-johnson">Mike Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/chip-roy">Chip Roy</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/05/07/us/politics/medicaid-cuts-house-republicans-johnson.html">65</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/05/07/us/politics/medicaid-cuts-house-republicans-johnson.html">65</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>States Sue Administration Over H.H.S.</strong><strong>:</strong> The lawsuit, led by New York, argues that the slashing of grants and staff at the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/states-lawsuit-trump-administration-hhs-cutbacks.html">amounts to the “illegal dismantling” of the agency.</a></p></li><li><p>‘<strong>Canada Is Not for Sale’</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>President Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada, in the first meeting between the two leaders, sparred over the president’s talk of making Canada the 51st state.
