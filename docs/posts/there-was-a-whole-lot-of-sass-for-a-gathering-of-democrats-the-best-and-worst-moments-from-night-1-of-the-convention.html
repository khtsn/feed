</div></section></div><div><div><p>Welcome to Opinion’s commentary for Night 1 of the Democratic National Convention. In this special feature, Times Opinion writers rate the evening on a scale of 0 to 10: 0 means the night was a disaster for Kamala Harris; 10 means it could lead to a big polling bump. Here’s what our columnists and contributors thought of the event, which included speeches by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Hillary Clinton, Raphael Warnock and Joe Biden.</p><h2 id="link-1e36b0fa">Best Moment</h2><p><strong>Kristen Soltis Anderson, contributing Opinion writer </strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In a night showcasing the party’s elders, A.O.C. demonstrated that she is their future. Republicans underestimate her at their peril.</p><p><strong>Binyamin Appelbaum, member of the editorial board </strong>The stark power of the personal testimonials from women denied access to pregnancy-related health care.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Charles M. Blow, Times columnist </strong>Hillary Clinton: fiery, impassioned, affecting.</p><p><strong>Frank Bruni, contributing Opinion writer </strong>The orgy of applause for Hillary Clinton. I’m a sap. I can’t imagine what that meant to her, someone put through the political grinder like few leaders in my lifetime, someone forever haunted by (and blamed for) losing to Donald Trump. She needed that. So did Democrats. It affirmed their unity, elevated graciousness and turned the page.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Jane Coaston, contributing Opinion writer </strong>If you could bottle whatever Clinton must have been feeling listening to a chanting crowd scream “Lock him up,” it would power a nation.</p><p><strong>Michelle Cottle, political writer for Opinion </strong>The three women (and one man) who shared their heart-wrenching abortion stories. In the midst of all the good vibes, it was a sharp reminder of the concrete stakes of this election.</p><p><strong>Liam Donovan, Republican strategist </strong>Prominent placement of union leaders was smart given the states that will decide this election. Organized labor is still critical to financing, mobilizing and ultimately electing Democrats where it matters.</p><p><strong>Michelle Goldberg, Times columnist </strong>I can’t decide if it was A.O.C.’s barnburner speech, Shawn Fain lambasting Trump as a scab or the women who spoke so bravely about the anguish Republican abortion bans inflicted on them.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Matt Labash, author of the newsletter Slack Tide </strong>Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas needs her own show. Not only is she a snazzy dresser, but she set the drapes on fire, material-wise. Sample line: “[Harris] became a career prosecutor, while [Trump] became a career criminal. With 34 felonies, two impeachments and one porn star to prove it.”</p><h2 id="link-551afe84">Worst Moment</h2><p><strong>Anderson </strong>President Biden being pushed out of prime time. It is understandable to want to make a break from the incumbent, but intentionally or not, it is just a brutal way to treat the incumbent president in your party.</p><p><strong>Appelbaum </strong>Clinton, still trying to convince Americans to vote against Trump, still playing “Fight Song.” I’d rather not relive that experience, thanks very much.</p><p><strong>Blow </strong>It dragged on too long — and the unfortunate image of delegates chanting “Lock him up” from the convention floor.</p><p><strong>Bruni </strong>Get it together, Democrats. Don’t honor an 81-year-old who’s usually best before dusk by making him speak close to midnight in the East and not, as advertised, in prime time.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Coaston </strong>Kathy Hochul does not inspire the imagination.</p><p><strong>Cottle </strong>When the clock struck 11 E.D.T. and we still had multiple speakers to get through. These are not the Oscars. Keep it tight, people.</p><p><strong>Donovan </strong>Night 1 was surprisingly Covid-heavy for a ticket ostensibly focused on looking forward. With the exception of a solid Jason Isbell tune, little here for anyone but the party faithful.</p><p><strong>Goldberg </strong>It was very moving to see Biden tear up after his daughter’s introduction, but his shouted speech left me so relieved that he’s not the candidate.</p><p><strong>Labash </strong>The first half of the evening was larded with lieutenant governors, a state senator and who-the-hell-is-that bureaucrats, boring us out of our skulls. Competent governance doesn’t make for compelling drama. Especially not after nine years of watching MAGA stick its fingers in electrical sockets. My adrenal glands were going through withdrawal.</p></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-1fcce74e">What Else Caught Your Eye?</h2><p><strong>Anderson </strong>I thought it was unfortunate when Representative Joyce Beatty said JD Vance had left Ohio “as soon as he could, he ran away to Yale.” As a matter of fact, his first stop upon leaving Ohio wasn’t Yale — it was the Marine Corps, which sent him to Iraq.</p><p><strong>Appelbaum </strong>Michigan State Senator Mallory McMorrow hauling an oversize copy of Project 2025 onto the stage was good theater — and McMorrow’s rollicking remarks sold the bit.</p><p><strong>Blow </strong>Biden’s speech was touching, as expected, although it was more a defense of his record than an endorsement of his potential successor. He didn’t so much pass the torch as set it ablaze and run a final lap. On some level, that is his prerogative. That is the least the party can give him: the option to finally bow with a bang.</p><p><strong>Bruni </strong>Democrats are assertively reclaiming from Republicans the ideas, iconography and language of patriotism and freedom. The convention’s first night gave us flags upon flags. Nods to the nation’s athletic and military glory. Country music: Mickey Guyton’s “All American,” Isbell’s “Something More Than Free.” No accident — those titles. Those details. That message.</p><p><strong>Coaston </strong>I think often about how, for much of my life, it has felt like being a Democrat in some swaths of the country (or on Twitter) was something you tried to avoid advertising too prominently for fear of being basic or embarrassingly gauche. This was an evening that made it clear: This is what the Democratic Party believes, and this is who the Democratic Party is, and they are proud of it.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Cottle </strong>There was a whole lot of sass for a gathering of Democrats — and you know I mean that in a good way. From Steve Kerr dropping a Steph Curry “night night” on Trump to the “Law &amp; Order” sendup starring Trump as the perp to Jamie Raskin’s entire speech. And Crockett? My, oh, my.</p><p><strong>Donovan </strong>Biden’s keynote slipping beyond prime time may not have been by design, but it was certainly conspicuous. Not since George W. Bush’s video message to the 2008 R.N.C. has a sitting president been so marginalized.</p><p><strong>Goldberg </strong>Kamala Harris and Tim Walz usually try to tamp down chants of “Lock him up,” not wanting to seem like part of a political prosecution. But when the crowd started up the refrain on Monday evening, Clinton, who Trump once promised to imprison, couldn’t hide her ironic delight.</p><p><strong>Labash </strong>Isbell singing “Something More Than Free” in front of an American flag on a barn? Suck on it, Lee Greenwood, and you Branson-comes-to-the-Republican-convention types. Republicans have been out-sung again. Don’t bother calling Ted Nugent to even up the score.</p><p>Charles M.
