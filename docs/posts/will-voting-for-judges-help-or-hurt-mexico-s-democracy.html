The other half will be elected in 2027.</p><p>Experts say it is the most significant judicial overhaul ever conducted by a large democracy.</p><p>The change was proposed by then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, after the Supreme Court and other courts blocked many of his initiatives, and the voting was also championed by his successor and the current president, Claudia Sheinbaum.</p><p>Mr. López Obrador and Ms. Sheinbaum argue that electing Mexico’s judges will improve governance and reduce corruption in a country that is plagued by organized crime and violent disorder. The public has little confidence in the existing judiciary: In one recent <a href="https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/saladeprensa/boletines/2024/ENVIPE/ENVIPE_24.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a>, two-thirds of respondents believe Mexico’s judges are corrupt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But many experts have warned that this particular overhaul is likely to have profoundly negative consequences — not only for Mexico’s criminal justice system, but for system of checks and balances that are required for a healthy democracy.</p><h2 id="link-5a0ae5f9">The pluses and minuses of elected judges</h2><p>There are some compelling arguments in favor of electing judges. Like presidents and legislators, they are powerful political actors. The foundational idea of democracy is that the public should be trusted to make choices about how to allocate political power, and that elections are an important way of holding officials accountable. Many judges in other countries are elected, including in <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/significant-figures-judicial-selection" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">39 U.S. states</a> where voters fill at least some judicial vacancies.</p><p>It may seem counterintuitive to say that more elections could hurt a democracy. But democracy as a system of government isn’t just about voting. Democracies must also offer enough predictability and protections that people are willing to buy into the system even if they lose. Courts are the institutions tasked with interpreting and enforcing the rules — and ensuring they apply, no matter who wins.</p><p>“In well-functioning democracies, you need an organ that isn’t subject to those democratic pressures,” said Maria Ballesteros, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace who grew up in Mexico and has written about the <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/09/16/mexico-judicial-reform-constitution-amendment-morena-amlo-sheinbaum/?utm_content=gifting&amp;tpcc=gifting_article&amp;gifting_article=bWV4aWNvLWp1ZGljaWFsLXJlZm9ybS1jb25zdGl0dXRpb24tYW1lbmRtZW50LW1vcmVuYS1hbWxvLXNoZWluYmF1bQ==&amp;pid=PNIIEQRnirhjrth" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dangers of its judicial overhaul</a>. “You need somebody to be able to look above what is popular at the time and say, ‘is this right or wrong based on the set of values that we have established for ourselves as a country?’”</p><p>The elections are expected to give the country’s current ruling party, Morena, substantial control over the judicial branch that has long served as a check on its power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Because Morena currently controls the presidency and has supermajorities in both houses of congress, it had substantial influence over the candidates who are nominated for the federal judicial elections.</p><p>Mexico is a relatively young democracy that emerged from single-party rule less than three decades ago. Under Mr. López Obrador’s presidency, analysts warned that it was moving back in the direction of competitive authoritarianism, in which the ruling party uses the power of the state to tilt the playing field in its favor.</p><p>Mr. López Obrador and Ms. Sheinbaum are extremely popular with the public, and last year’s election delivered a strong mandate for Morena’s agenda.</p><p>But that is precisely when it is most important for courts to serve as a check on power, said Ms. Ballesteros: “You need somebody to be able to act against those political pressures, and we trust the courts for that.”</p><h2 id="link-43b6d48f">Cartel-connected candidates</h2><p>The specifics of Mexico’s situation make this trade-off even more stark, experts say.</p><p>The first problem is simply the scale of the effort: replacing thousands of judges at once, on relatively short notice, makes it harder fill those jobs with qualified candidates. It is also difficult for voters to make an informed decision on so many unfamiliar candidates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And rather than reducing corruption, the judicial overhaul may offer new opportunities for Mexico’s powerful drug cartels and other criminal elements to protect their interests, as Amrit Singh and Adriana Garcia of Stanford University’s Rule of Law Impact Lab <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/opinion/mexico-judges-election-government.html" title="">wrote in a recent Times guest essay</a>. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/world/americas/mexico-judicial-election-candidates.html" title="">reported</a> this week that the people running for judgeships include at least one ex-convict and several who are suspected of committing serious crimes.</p><h2 id="link-7942bff">Democracies at risk</h2><p>Mexico’s judicial overhaul is only the latest example of populist elected leaders removing judges who stand in their way.</p><p>In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stacked courts with his political allies; those same courts recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/world/middleeast/turkey-ekrem-imamoglu-istanbul.html" title="">jailed the mayor of Istanbul</a> on corruption charges, days before he was set to be named the presidential candidate of Turkey’s political opposition.</p><p>In Hungary, similar changes allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orban to cement his hold on power and establish what he calls an “illiberal democracy.”</p><p>Many experts have warned of similarities between those countries and the United States, where President Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/politics/trump-judges-attacks-tariffs.html" title="">denounced judges who have blocked his plans</a>. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said this week that Americans are “living under a judicial tyranny.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“There are a lot of parallels about what Mexico is going through and what the United States is going through,” said Ms. Ballesteros. “We don’t have kings in democracies, and presidents shouldn’t have unchecked power.”</p><hr/><p><strong>Thank you for being a subscriber</strong></p><p>Read past editions of the newsletter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-interpreter" title="">here</a>.</p><p>If you’re enjoying what you’re reading, please consider recommending it to others.
