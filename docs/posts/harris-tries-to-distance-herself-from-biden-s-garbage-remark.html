    <h1>Harris Tries to Distance Herself From Biden’s ‘Garbage’ Remark</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Sunday, Tony Hinchcliffe, a comedian and Trump supporter who spoke at the Trump rally in New York, had made a joke onstage that disparaged Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” Mr. Biden tried to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/politics/biden-garbage-trump-supporters.html" title="">denounce</a> that racist language in a video call with Hispanic supporters on Tuesday night. But he garbled his words, saying: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”</p><p>The White House and Mr. Biden later argued that he was describing the racist language as “garbage,” not Trump supporters.</p><p>Mr. Trump and his allies unleashed a torrent of criticism.</p><p>Shortly after Mr. Biden’s remarks went viral on social media, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida came onstage at Mr. Trump’s rally in Allentown, Pa., on Tuesday night and relayed the president’s remarks to the crowd, amid a chorus of boos. The Trump campaign quickly tried to tie Mr. Biden’s comments <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/politics/biden-trump-supporters-garbage-reaction.html" title="">to Hillary Clinton calling some Trump supporters “deplorables”</a> in 2016 and sent out fund-raising messages referencing the controversy.</p><p>Mr. Trump, of course, has repeatedly demonized Democrats, describing them at times as “the enemy within,” “communists,” “these lunatics” and “radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country.” He has attacked his critics and threatened some with prosecution if he becomes president again.</p><p>With the election six days away, both Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump are campaigning across the battleground states and making frequent media appearances. On Wednesday, Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump will both head to North Carolina and Wisconsin to rally with their supporters. (The vice president will also hold a rally in Pennsylvania.) Their running mates are also fanning out across the swing states and airwaves.</p></div></div>
