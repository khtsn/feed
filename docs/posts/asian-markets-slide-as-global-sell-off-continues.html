Stock markets in South Korea and Taiwan also fell more than 1 percent in midday trading.</p><p>Equity markets in China were faring slightly better. Shares in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong ticked lower, down less than 1 percent in morning trading.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Investors have become increasingly cautious about the U.S. stock market in recent weeks as President Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/economy/trump-tariffs-exceptions.html" title="">flip-flopped on tariffs</a>, causing confusion and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/technology/trump-chips-act.html" title="">uncertainty</a>.</p><p>Growing unease about the inflationary effects of the tariffs, coupled with a broadly darkening mood about the economy, provided the catalyst for a sell-off in a market that investors have long worried was overvalued.</p><p>While current economic data has remained robust, surveys of consumers, business leaders and economists are growing pessimistic. Analysts at JPMorgan now say there is a 40 percent chance for a global recession.</p><p>The sell-off highlighted how carefully global markets are parsing the president’s public remarks about the economy.</p><p>Analysts pointed to Mr. Trump’s comments from an interview that aired on Sunday when he refused to rule out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/us/politics/trump-recession-lutnick.html?smid=url-share" title="">the possibility of a recession</a>, stating that the economy is undergoing “a period of transition.” The Trump administration has offered little to assuage investors’ fears, continuing to drive a hard line on tariffs on the major U.S. trading partners Canada, Mexico and China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a research note on Tuesday, Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, said financial markets were caught off-guard by Mr. Trump’s “unwavering” commitment to push ahead with tariffs despite the economic pain that it might cause.</p><p>“Even if the tariffs lead to inflation and economic deterioration, President Trump is likely to place the blame squarely on former President Biden rather than acknowledge any shortcomings in his own economic policies,” Mr. Kiuchi wrote.</p><p>Technology stocks tumbled in the United States on Monday. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/10/us/president-trump-news/0f7d0b6c-b01e-5ebc-b7e7-b6c28febec62?smid=url-share" title="">Tesla</a> shares plunged more than 15 percent, as investors assess falling sales and worry that the company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, has been distracted by his role in the Trump administration. Shares of Alphabet, Apple and Nvidia each fell more than 4 percent.</p><p>Technology shares also declined in Japan, with Sony, SoftBank, Hitachi and Fujitsu each falling more than 4 percent during trading early Tuesday morning. Other tech declines in Asia included the chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and the Apple supplier Foxconn in Taiwan, both down 2 percent.</p><p>Shares of the Japanese automakers Toyota Motor and Honda Motor, as well as the South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, dipped slightly. Nissan Motor, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/carmakers-nissan-stellantis-tariffs.html" title="">struggled more than others</a> with slumping sales and political headwinds, saw its stock price fall more than 4 percent on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Japanese and South Korean automakers are expected to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/japan-tariffs-yoji-muto.html" title="">particularly damaged</a> by a potential 25 percent tariff on foreign cars that Mr. Trump has indicated could take effect as soon as April 2.</p><p>In a note on Friday, Goldman Sachs said the stocks making up the main equity indexes in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan would be the most exposed in Asia if the Trump administration imposed a universal tariff on trading partners.</p><p>Bruce Pang, an adjunct associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong business school, said Chinese markets are moving out of step with the United States and other global counterparts. Chinese shares are getting a lift from the government’s ambitious target of around 5 percent growth and recent business-friendly comments about supporting the private sector and entrepreneurship from top leaders.</p><p>“These factors collectively help mitigate the headwinds arising from the Trump administration’s news flows,” he said.</p><p>In the year to date, shares of Chinese companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have risen nearly 20 percent, compared with a 4 percent slide on the S&amp;P 500.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Late on Monday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/10/us/president-trump-news/dec10218-b5d8-5315-b3b6-9a25a7d1ff0d?smid=url-share" title="">Delta Air Lines</a> issued another warning signal about a worsening economy. The airline announced that it had cut its profit forecast for the first three months of the year, saying that rising economic worries among consumers was denting demand for air travel.</p><p>In a statement, Delta blamed the decline in demand on a “recent reduction in consumer and corporate confidence caused by increased macro uncertainty.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div><div><p>River Akira Davis covers Japan, including its economy and businesses, and is based in Tokyo.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/river-akira-davis">More about River Akira Davis</a></span></p></div><div><p>Daisuke Wakabayashi is an Asia business correspondent for The Times based in Seoul, covering economic, corporate and geopolitical stories from the region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/daisuke-wakabayashi">More about Daisuke Wakabayashi</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on U.S.-China Relations</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>China Says It Offers Stability: </strong>China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, cast his country as a bulwark for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/asia/china-tariffs-us-trump.html">peace and stability in a world thrown into chaos by the Trump administration</a>, even as Beijing provokes its neighbors and fuels trade tensions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seeing a Cultural Revolution: </strong>People in China are expressing alarm at what looks like a familiar authoritarian turn in the United States, their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/business/china-donald-trump-cultural-revolution.html">longtime role model for democracy</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hacking Plot: </strong>The Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/china-hackers-justice-dept.html">unsealed charges against a dozen Chinese citizens</a> accused of being part of a sophisticated hacking ring that steals data from American businesses and people to sell to the Chinese government and others.</p></li><li><p><strong>China Puts Pacific on Notice: </strong>The country is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/world/asia/china-military-drills-pacific.html">flexing its military muscle in the region</a> to show that it will not wait for the Trump administration to decide how hard it wants to counter Beijing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Eyeing a New Trade Deal: </strong>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/business/economy/trump-china-trade-deal.html">is considering whether it can strike a deal with China</a> that would ramp up its purchases of American goods and U.S. investments.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
