			<p>DFM HIRO</p>
<p>actually good pickup no ?</p>
<p>he was quite the good sentinel but zeta turned him to a shitty initiator</p>		</div>

		<p>The real question now is why hasn&#39;t Zeta gotten rid of Carlao yet ðŸ˜‚?</p>

		<p>o7 hiroronn&#39;s roles got fucked up by ZETA&#39;s management, hopefully he bounces back soon</p>

		<p>Damn, I was starting to like hiroronn when Laz switched to initiator. o7 to the both of them. </p>

			<p>what.</p>
<p>with Laz gone surely we put hiroronn on sentinel now</p>		</div>

			<p>I&#39;m glad people here don&#39;t think Hiroronn is a shit player based on his performance this year.</p>
<p>I need to see what Yuran can do tho, hope he can finally show us why he got picked to academy in tier 2.</p>		</div>

			<p>Itâ€™s one of the only things I know about Japanese valorant</p>
<p>Hiro is good but zeta put him on initiator and he became one of the worst players in apac</p>		</div>

		<p>Bro Carlao better have very good explanation for doing that, he&#39;s potentially ruining a young player&#39;s career, but thank god the market&#39;s not that volatile</p>
