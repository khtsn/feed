At least not anymore.</p><p>In the early years of the Roman Catholic Church, most popes, starting with St. Peter, who is considered the first to hold the seat, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12272b.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were named saints</a> after they died. Of the first 50 popes, 48 got the honor. Over time, it became much rarer.</p><p>To date, 80 of the 266 popes to serve over nearly 2,000 years have been canonized. Another 11 are on a waiting list of sorts, having been beatified, the penultimate step to sainthood.</p><p>Getting there involves years of investigation and review by the church, particularly the <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/romancuria/en/dicasteri/dicastero-cause-santi/profilo.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dicastery for the Causes of Saints</a>. Vatican officials and consultants examine candidates’ goodness, holiness and devotion to God and carefully scrutinizes their writings. Those who pass muster are declared “venerable.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The next step is beatification, which requires the dicastery to accept the validity of a miracle brought about by the intercession of the candidate. After that, the Vatican must accept the validity of a second miracle attributed to the person’s intercession for them to be declared a saint. The pope makes the final decision on canonization.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A tapestry showing Pope John Paul II hanging from the facade of St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican.

That dropped to just over 100 years during the last three papacies, in part because John Paul II shortened the waiting period to begin a cause for sainthood, as the process is known, to five years after a person’s death.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a Times reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
