Students detained after voicing their opinions. Federal judges threatened with impeachment for ruling against the administration’s priorities.</p><p>In the Opinion video above, Marci Shore, Timothy Snyder and Jason Stanley, all professors at Yale and experts in authoritarianism, explain why America is especially vulnerable to a democratic backsliding — and why they are leaving the United States to take up positions at the University of Toronto.</p><p>Professor Stanley is leaving the United States as an act of protest against the Trump administration’s attacks on civil liberties. “I want Americans to realize that this is a democratic emergency,” he said.</p><p>Professor Shore, who has spent two decades writing about the history of authoritarianism in Central and Eastern Europe, is leaving because of what she sees as the sharp regression of American democracy. “We’re like people on the Titanic saying our ship can’t sink,” she said. “And what you know as a historian is that there is no such thing as a ship that can’t sink.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Professor Snyder’s reasons are more complicated. Primarily, he’s leaving to support his wife, Professor Shore, and their children, and to teach at a large public university in Toronto, a place he says can host conversations about freedom. At the same time, he shares the concerns expressed by his colleagues and worries that those kinds of conversations will become ever harder to have in the United States.</p><p>“I did not leave Yale because of Donald Trump or because of Columbia or because of threats to Yale — but that would be a reasonable thing to do, and that is a decision that people will make,” <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2025/04/04/snyder-on-leaving-yale/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote in a Yale Daily News article explaining his decision to leave.</a></p><p>Their motives differ but their analysis is the same: ignoring or downplaying attacks on the rule of law, the courts and universities spells trouble for our democracy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Marci Shore, a history professor at Yale, is the author of “The Ukrainian Night,” about the Ukrainian revolution.
