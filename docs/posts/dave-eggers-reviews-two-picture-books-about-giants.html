Three artists were credited — Julek Heller, Carolyn Scrace and Juan Wijngaard — and the accompanying text, by Sarah Teale, was pseudoscientific, treating the existence of giants as fact and the analysis of their culture and customs as a legitimate branch of anthropology. I studied it like scripture, and knew its pages better than those of any other book I owned.</p><p>I studied the pictures at least. For me, the point was the pictures, and the enchantment they conjured was total. With gorgeous draftsmanship, the artists portrayed Norse gods, medieval giants, Cyclopes and trolls, Pecos Bill and Paul Bunyan.</p><p>These giants emerged from mountains — they <em>were</em> mountains — and dallied with knights, but there was a melancholy about them. Giants, Teale wrote, “were often rather pensive beings who could spend hours pondering a seemingly insoluble problem such as their age, the reason for their large size, the origins of light and darkness (a source of fear for most giants).” Almost always the giants were alone. In the world below, there were bustling human towns and cozy human homes, while the giants, far fewer in number, walked the earth lonely and hungry — and, given the difficulty of finding stylish clothes in their size, probably very cold, too.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/books/review/16Giants-Kids1/16Giants-Kids1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/books/review/16Giants-Kids1/16Giants-Kids1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/books/review/16Giants-Kids1/16Giants-Kids1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A large shadow spreads over the lower right-hand corner of an earth-toned watercolor illustration showing an aerial view of orange-, brown- and reddish-roofed houses clustered together in a densely populated island city." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/books/review/16Giants-Kids1/16Giants-Kids1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/books/review/16Giants-Kids1/16Giants-Kids1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/books/review/16Giants-Kids1/16Giants-Kids1-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/books/review/16Giants-Kids1/16Giants-Kids1-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="413"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From “Giant on the Shore.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrés López</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p><strong>GIANT ON THE SHORE (Transit Children’s Editions, 32 pp., $19.95, ages 3 and up)</strong> — with text by Alfonso Ochoa, translated from the Spanish by Shook, and art by Andrés López — perfectly captures the ennui specific to the enormous. The story begins with the arrival of a giant to an unnamed island. He emerges from the ocean, towers over a cluster of boats in the harbor, approaches the beach and stops, unsure whether to come ashore. His shadow darkens a charming, densely populated city that “smells like bread,” where “you can hear the movie theater over the bustle of the cars.” But he’s still not convinced.</p></div><div><p>Ochoa’s narrator is a storyteller eager to celebrate the giant in prose and verse: “If the giant decided to come ashore/I could write a story/where the people welcome him the way they do the first rain,/with long poems and tiny bonfires./Very tiny bonfires. … A story where the city took his name./Giant’s Landing,/or something like that.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From “Giant on the Shore.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrés López</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Notably, the giant is never shown. We see his footprints and his shadow, and the gap he might make in a tropical forest if he were to push his way through. But we don’t see him. Instead, we see human endeavor from his lofty perspective, and though everything the humans do is indeed tiny, and perhaps inconsequential, in López’s witty and colorful paintings their world looks festive and bright — perhaps too much so for a sad and solitary colossus.</p><p>Marine Schneider’s <strong>HEKLA &amp; LAKI (Milky Way, 64 pp., $21.99, ages 6 to 9)</strong>, translated from the French by Nick Frost and Catherine Ostiguy, works on a similarly grand scale. This is an achingly beautiful book, unapologetically removed from its time. In real life, Hekla and Laki are two volcanoes in Iceland, and the landscapes Schneider depicts have strong Icelandic echoes, but she attaches these names to a bearded, blue silhouette of an old man (Laki) and a mysterious, orange child-being (Hekla). Laki lives in a simple red house at the bottom of a crater, very much alone, until Hekla descends from the clouds: “His small body whirled around over the crater, just like the samara of a sycamore tree. At first, Laki thought it might be an insect, or maybe a bird. But it was Hekla.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From “Hekla &amp; Laki.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marine Schneider</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Hekla brings new purpose, and a good deal of domestic chaos, to Laki’s life. He breaks objects all over the house, but is always careful to replace the broken things with flowers (not a bad idea, kids). Laki comes to love him, though it’s not clear if Hekla is human or mortal: “Seasons passed and Hekla didn’t grow any bigger, whereas Laki kept getting older and older.” Hekla is endlessly curious, and Laki is indulgent, to a point. Hekla wants to explore the lake in the middle of the crater, but Laki begs him to stay away. “Not the lake, Hekla.” Eventually, though, Laki has to let go, and the book ends with a breathtaking sequence as Hekla sets out into the vast world above and beyond the crater.</p><p>“Hekla &amp; Laki,” like “Giant on the Shore,” is more suggestion than story; neither book gives the reader a tidy narrative nor, thank God, a moral. These are dreams drawn from the subconscious, realized by gifted artists, suitable for study by children awake to the surreal and the sublime.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Page </p><!-- --><p>18</p><!-- --><p> of the Sunday Book Review</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Giants Among Us<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore More in Books</h2><h3>Want to know about the best books to read and the latest news?
