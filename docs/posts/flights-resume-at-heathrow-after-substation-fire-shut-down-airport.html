But the Metropolitan Police in London said later Friday, “After initial assessment, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/europe/heathrow-power-fire-investigation.html" title="">we are not treating this incident as suspicious</a>, although inquiries do remain ongoing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>It was too early on Friday to calculate the precise cost of the outage.

Minutes later, the airport said it was shutting down all air traffic, incoming flights were diverted, and passengers at Heathrow were sent home. Nearby residents were also evacuated.</p><p>By Friday morning, roads around the power station were cordoned off, and a helicopter hovered above. An odd stillness had descended on Heathrow. The runways were empty, the check-in desks quiet, digital flight information screens were blank, and passageways were dimly lit by emergency lighting. It was a lifeless calm not seen even during the early panicked weeks of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Britain’s National Grid said on Friday afternoon that it had reconfigured its network to partly restore power at Heathrow on an interim basis. The substation held 25,000 liters of cooling oil, which fueled the large blaze and made it to difficult to extinguish, the London Fire Brigade said on Friday. The brigade said about 5 percent of the fire was still burning by Friday evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The airport <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/europe/london-heathrow-airport-closed.html" title="">closure</a> resulted in dozens of flights from the United States landing far from their original destination. They were diverted to airports in Glasgow, Madrid and even <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL50" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Happy Valley-Goose Bay</a>, a tiny town in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers working Friday at the entrance to the electrical substation after a fire wiped out power at Heathrow.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carlos Jasso/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>John Connor, 22, sat at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on Friday, waiting in vain to get home to England after backpacking abroad for two years.</p><p>“We sat on the plane for about five hours before they said the flight was called off,” he said. “I’m trying to get a plane somewhere close — Paris, Dublin, anywhere else,” he added. “We’re being told straight up no.”</p><p>Frantic travelers swarmed social media to ask airlines about managing canceled flights and upcoming departures, <a href="https://x.com/pmeads262/status/1903057109153091906" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claiming</a> in posts on X that airline apps were lagging in notifying passengers about cancellations and that <a href="https://x.com/cloudedjetfuel/status/1903074388980744240" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">customer service could not be reached by phone</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Some travelers stuck in Europe were urged to consider traveling by rail. After finding out that his flight from Heathrow was canceled, Phillip Kizun, 58, of Chester County, Pa., had to improvise as he tried to get from London to Dublin for a work trip. He took a train to Wales and then a ferry from the coastal town of Holyhead to the Irish capital. He met several European and American travelers doing the same.</p><p>“It was an absolute real ‘Planes, Trains and Automobiles,’” Mr. Kizun said, minutes after arriving in Dublin, referring to the 1987 Steve Martin-John Candy comedy.</p><p>Some planes already in the air had to turn around. Jeannie LaChance, who was traveling to London from Los Angeles with her sister and 2-year-old niece, said that about four hours into the flight, the pilot announced they would have to return.</p><p>“Everyone was pretty calm, which I think was nice because we’re all trapped in a plane,” Ms. LaChance, 31, said.</p><p>Some airlines said they would issue waivers allowing free rebookings, including British Airways, <a href="https://www.delta.com/us/en/advisories/other-alerts/london-heathrow-power-outage" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Delta Air Lines</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/21/world/heathrow-airport-power-outage-fire#heathrow-flights-canceled-diverted-what-to-do" title="">American Airlines</a> and <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/travel/trip-planning/travel-alerts.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Airlines</a>. A Delta spokesperson said the airline would reimburse the cost of traveling to London by train for passengers who had their flights diverted to Amsterdam.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Cirium, an aviation data company, estimated that as many as 290,000 passengers could be affected by Heathrow’s closure.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Travelers checking for updates at Heathrow on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kin Cheung/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>By late Friday, several flights had landed at or departed from Heathrow, as the airport began to rumble back to life, about 16 hours after the fire. The first to touch down there was a British Airways plane that had traveled from Gatwick Airport in London after being diverted from its original destination, Singapore, according to the flight-tracking service FlightAware.</p><p>A Heathrow spokeswoman said the airport was working to first restore “repatriation flights and relocating aircraft.”</p><p>Britain’s Department of Transport said it was temporarily lifting restrictions on overnight flights to ease congestion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But the chief executive of British Airways, Sean Doyle, warned that Heathrow’s closure would have “a huge impact” on the airline’s customers over the coming days. British Airways had been set to operate more than 670 flights carrying about 107,000 customers on Friday, and similar numbers were planned over the weekend, he added.</p><p>“We have flight and cabin crew colleagues and planes that are currently at locations where we weren’t planning on them to be,” he said.</p><p>The Heathrow crisis was likely to upset not only the movement of people, but also the flow of goods. The closure of the crucial aviation hub, even for a short time, would cause delays and logistical headaches for many businesses that ship products through Heathrow, supply chain experts said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The airport’s silent runways and parked aircraft on Friday after it closed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Heathrow has two runways and four terminals that serve more than 230 destinations in 90 countries. Last year, about 83.9 million passengers and 1.7 million tons of cargo traversed the airport. It is the third-largest hub for air cargo in Western Europe, measured in metric tons shipped. Goods worth nearly 200 billion pounds ($258 billion) went through Heathrow in 2023, about a fifth of the value of the British goods trade.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“Goods move around the globe in a really precise, timed way on a daily basis,” said Ben Farrell, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, a global network of supply chain professionals based in London. “Any disruptions to any part of that leads to a knock-on effect elsewhere.”</p><p>British businesses will likely be most affected. Global trade can be handled by other large airports in Europe, said Eytan Buchman, chief marketing officer at Freightos, a digital shipping marketplace.</p><p>Mr. Woldbye, Heathrow’s chief executive, apologized to travelers for the shutdown and said the airport had done well to resume flights by Friday evening, given the scale of the outage.</p><p>The airport closure came 15 years after one of Europe’s most severe air travel disruptions, when a volcano eruption in Iceland sent ash miles into the sky and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/21/world/heathrow-airport-power-outage-fire/fridays-flight-disruptions-are-among-the-biggest-since-a-2010-volcanic-eruption-in-iceland?smid=url-share" title="">obstructed travel for millions</a>, including at Heathrow.</p><p>The ash grounded more than 100,000 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/travel/02prac.html" title="">flights</a> over nearly a week in April 2010 as it drifted across Northern Europe.
