Seven &amp; i sits atop a vast network of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/23/business/7-eleven-franchisee-court.html" title="">85,000 stores</a>, primarily in Asia and the United States. Couche-Tard’s takeover of Seven &amp; i would have positioned it as one of the world’s largest retail groups.</p><p>Couche-Tard had offered to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Seven &amp; i for $14.86 each, according to the letter, slightly below where the shares were trading on Friday morning. The price of Couche-Tard’s offer had not been previously disclosed.</p><p>Seven &amp; i said it believed the proposed buyout would trigger competition investigations from regulators in the United States, where Couche-Tard and Seven &amp; i are the two largest operators of convenience stores. Couche-Tard could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>In Japan, 7-Eleven is considered something of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/business/7-eleven-japan-couche-tard.html" title="">national treasure</a>, making any foreign-led takeover a long shot. Analysts questioned whether Couche-Tard would be capable of operating 7-Eleven stores better than their current owner.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Any acquisition could have also triggered opposition from government officials in Japan.</p><p>In recent years, a growing number of Japanese companies have faced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/japan-yen-nikkei-stocks.html" title="">pressure</a> from investors to bolster their market valuations.</p><p>The decision to reject the buyout offer could open Seven &amp; i to heightened provocation from investors who believe the company is worth more than its current market value.</p><p>Seven &amp; i operates a number of businesses, including a supermarket chain in Japan. The activist fund ValueAct Capital Management has been pushing Seven &amp; i to narrow its focus to 7-Eleven stores, arguing that they would be worth more as a stand-alone company.</p><p>In the weeks since Couche-Tard’s bid was disclosed, some Seven &amp; i shareholders have publicly called on the company to seriously evaluate the Canadian Group’s offer.</p><p>The Japanese company’s next steps will be closely watched, as it will work to convince shareholders that it is taking steps to improve corporate value on its own. In its letter on Friday, Seven &amp; i said it was “single-mindedly focused on delivering value for 7 and i shareholders and other stakeholders.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div></section><div><div><div><p>River Akira Davis covers Japan, including its economy and businesses, and is based in Tokyo.<span> </span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Has Tipping Reached Its Limit?: </strong>Americans are being asked to tip more often and in more places than ever before. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/business/economy/tipped-workers-taxes.html">It may soon get worse</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Coffee Wars: </strong>From Starbucks to specialty cafes, there is something of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/business/coffee-wars-arms-race-starbucks.html">an arms race going on in the coffee world</a>, as competitors battle to create the craziest, calorie-laden, not-really-coffee drink.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rise of ‘Retailtainment’: </strong>Mall owners are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/business/malls-experiences-hasbro-nerf.html">spending millions on fun, games and other experiential offerings</a> in hopes of drawing customers back to their properties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Changing a Chatbot’s Mind: </strong>When our tech columnist set out to improve his tainted reputation with chatbots, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/technology/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-manipulation.html">he discovered a new world of A.I. manipulation</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>College Sports’ Big Money Era: </strong>Some college athletes can expect to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars annually through name, image and likeness deals. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/31/business/nil-money-ncaa.html">Here’s where the money goes</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
