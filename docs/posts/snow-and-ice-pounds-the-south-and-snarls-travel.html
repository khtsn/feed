From Friday into Saturday, parts of the Mid-Atlantic, the Ohio Valley and the Northeast could receive between one and five inches of snow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The widespread mix of wintry precipitation led to the cancellation of more than 2,000 flights in and out of airports in Atlanta, Dallas, Nashville and Charlotte, N.C., on Friday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, where nearly 60 percent of outgoing flights had been canceled or delayed, a <a href="https://nasstatus.faa.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ground stop was issued</a> for all incoming Delta flights after an aborted takeoff led to passengers on a Delta plane <a href="https://x.com/stibsvfl/status/1877739666255884589?s=10" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">being evacuated onto the snowy runway</a>, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. A Delta spokeswoman said that four people were treated for minor injuries and that there was “no indication of weather being the cause of the engine issue.”</p><p>Spencer Reeve, 42, a board game marketer who had a 12:40 p.m. Delta flight to Los Angeles from Atlanta, said the situation at the airport had quickly turned from “relaxing” to “frustration” after the ground stop was issued. “It’s just rolling cancellations and delays right now,” he said.</p><p>Andrew Gobeil, an airport spokesman, later said that at least two runways were open.</p><p>The icy, snowy mix made streets and highways treacherous across a wide swath of the South. In northern Mississippi, multiple crashes were reported on roads that were coated in ice and snow, the state’s Emergency Management Agency said.</p><p>A 200-mile section of Interstate 22in Mississippi and Alabama was shut down because of a crash in Marshall County, in north-central Mississippi. In northern Alabama, many roads were ice covered and impassable, Jim Stefkovich, a meteorologist with the state’s Emergency Management Agency, <a href="https://ema.alabama.gov/2025/01/10/travel-is-dangerous-to-impossible-today/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“If you’re trying to get on the roads, don’t get on them,” Gov. Brian P. Kemp of Georgia said at a news conference on Friday, warning that, with temperatures remaining near the freezing mark, the mix of snow and icy rain would likely make roads hazardous through Sunday.</p><p>Snow and ice accumulation in North Georgia was making roads increasingly dangerous, he said.</p><p>In Atlanta, most shops and restaurants were shuttered. The city seemed to have learned its lesson after less than three inches of snow <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/us/mayor-unapologetic-in-eye-of-storm-that-brought-atlanta-to-a-halt.html" title="">led to chaos in 2014</a>, leaving motorists stranded, children stuck in buses and schools and government leaders scrambling to clean up the mess.</p><p>The governor at the time, Nathan Deal, apologized for the response, and his emergency management chief resigned. When forecasters predicted a similar storm a few weeks later, Mr. Deal shut down the government and urged businesses to follow suit.</p><p>Andre Dickens, then a council member and now Atlanta’s mayor, said he was confident in the city’s ability to weather the storm this time around. “The only 911 calls we’re getting are from people who are trying to drive on hilly back roads,” he said. “They are running into mailboxes and poles and parked vehicles, because Atlanta is hilly and we don’t have snow tires.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The city and state seemed better prepared this time. Officials urged people to stay indoors, and highways and city streets were salted before the storm. The roads were virtually empty on Friday — save the occasional skier or sledder — as the morning’s powder melted into slush around noon.</p><p>One exception to the closures was Waffle House. Benji Waugh, a customer, knew the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/us/hurricane-season-terms.html" title="">famously resilient breakfast joint</a> would be open for business.</p><p>“Living in the South, anytime there’s a hurricane or a tornado or some kind of storm, everywhere shuts down,” he said in an interview at the Waffle House across from Centennial Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta. “But it’s just easy to go to Waffle House, because they’re always open.”</p><p>Governor Kemp declared a state of emergency on Thursday in anticipation of the storm, as did his counterparts in Tennessee and Arkansas. While Tennessee is familiar with winter storms, some areas, like Memphis, could receive their largest two-day snow totals in 40 years. Parts of the state are still recovering from Hurricane Helene, which moved through the state as a tropical storm in September. Six inches of snow was reported in Memphis as of 11 a.m. Eastern, the Weather Service said.</p><p>Across North Carolina, a similar scenario was expected to last into Saturday, with snow and ice accumulations that could lead to widespread power outages, <a href="https://myemail.constantcontact.com/NCEM-Hazardous-Weather-Update--January-10--2025--.html?soid=1137130023998&amp;aid=lol8l-4ucd0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emergency management authorities</a> said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Accumulations of up to two inches are currently expected in the Mid-Atlantic east of the Allegheny Mountains. The storm is then expected to move off the coast, where it will strengthen but not pose a major hazard for the Northeast.</p><p>Unusual cold across the East Coast is expected to continue into next week, and areas where the snow has melted during the day may refreeze at night, creating ongoing hazards.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
