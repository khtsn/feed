                  <p><strong>Congratulations, Aleksi, on making it to the playoffs here at PGL Cluj-Napoca. A big one for iM, of course, and he was feeling it on Dust2 and even at the closing on Ancient. Tell me about it, a couple of pretty big comebacks.</strong></p>
                  <p>It was very nice to see Mihai act in this way. It&#39;s been a while since. I got some flashbacks from the Copenhagen Major. In the semis, finals, Mihai was always vocal. Here we were listening to his comrade, lauNX, just before, they were sitting next to us and the loudness that comes from that guy and even dziugss at times, it was very nice to hear and it gave us the strength to do it ourselves. Kudos to him.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Tell me about the comebacks. Down 3-7 on the first map, iM came up with a couple of big plays and then also in the second half, and the Ancient, coming back from 1-8.</strong></p>
                  <p>I just think that, nowadays, all those last rounds of the half matter so much, because if you win the pistol or lose the pistol and win the forcebuy, you can always make a comeback in MR12. I feel like it tends to be a bit easier to make the big comebacks.</p>
                  <p>When it&#39;s super-stressful moments, a 2-2 game and you need to call a good T side in order to go to the third map, it&#39;s also not easy for anyone to do it. We were reading them well on CT side because they didn&#39;t have enough room to make tough calls anymore, and we kinda knew they had to fight for Mid control at some point and that they needed to do this round at some point because they don&#39;t wanna go out here and not try the most basic rounds. That ended up being our key to success here.</p>
                  <p><strong>Does it also feel like they crumbled under the pressure? I think b1t came up with a couple of 1v2s, and there was that 2v4 with iM against the pistols that looked really out of.</strong></p>
                  <p>Yeah, we had a lot of individual brilliance in moments where we really needed it. That&#39;s a very good sign going into the playoffs because you know that all the top teams do it constantly, and people expect to see that when you spectate them, so it&#39;s very nice to see that our individuals are coming alive here in the last group stage game. We just played together very well as a team, and we had proper communication, as you probably heard.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>We still need to step up a notch against the top-five teams</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>How are you looking forward to the playoffs? Of course, NAVI is a popular team pretty much anywhere you go, but I assume with iM here, it&#39;s probably going to be a pretty good support in the arena.</strong></p>
                  <p>Yeah, I&#39;m looking forward to it. I think walking here every day and looking inside the stadium, they&#39;ve been building it up the whole week, so we&#39;re just very eager to play there and not be on the sidelines. I&#39;m just happy that we took the game home, and no matter what happened in the group stages, we&#39;re just gonna do our best, work as hard as we can to play good in the playoffs.</p>
                  <p><strong>How are you feeling about your chances? It was a tough run through the group stage, but you did grab a couple of pretty big wins, can you tell me about how far you can take it here?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think we ended up on a good note and we have a lot of key details from this game that we can bring to the stage. I think that, no matter the opponent, we still need to step up a notch against the top-five teams, and I do think that whether it comes down to the teams outside of those, we are gonna be going to the server very confident. Other than that, we just need to fire up like we did here, have everyone chime in with the screaming and really wanting to win, and I think there has to be a turning point at some point, you know?</p>
