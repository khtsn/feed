After famously declaring that “government is the problem,” Mr. Reagan instructed agencies to begin “reductions in force.” In 1993, President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, issued <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-12839-reduction-100000-federal-positions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an executive order</a> calling for the elimination of 100,000 federal jobs — albeit slowly, over three years.</p><p>But the Trump-Musk plan is something else entirely — an extraordinary moment of reckoning for how the United States is governed, and a direct challenge to the decades-old effort to build a civil service stocked with experts on a wide range of topics.</p><p>It is being carried out by an administration that views much of the government as a bastion of anti-Trump liberalism. Russell T. Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and a Project 2025 architect, said in a <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/latest-memos/guidance-on-agency-rif-and-reorganization-plans-requested-by-implementing-the-president-s-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">memo</a> issued last month on the job cuts that “tax dollars are being siphoned off to fund unproductive and unnecessary programs that benefit radical interest groups while hurting hardworking American citizens.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for the federal Office of Personnel Management, McLaurine Pinover, said in an email that the Trump administration had “created a thoughtful, phased process” that “will reduce unnecessary waste and bloat while continuing to deliver high-quality services.” Mr. Trump, in ordering the force reductions, has carved out exceptions for jobs related to public safety and immigration enforcement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-8"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But Anthony Mills, director of the Center for Technology, Science and Energy at the libertarian-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said the firings do not appear part of a considered policy agenda driven by a “well articulated set of principles” about the appropriate role of government.</p><p>“It seems to me that the motivating factor here is punishment,” he said. “It’s a form of assertive action designed to bring a set of institutions ideologically to heel.” He added that a federal brain drain could hurt Mr. Trump’s ability to govern, saying, “You don’t want to lose the most competent people.”</p><p>So far, more than 20,000 employees have been fired from dozens of federal departments and agencies, according to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-federal-workers.html" title="">New York Times database</a>. Many others have left of their own volition, either by quitting in protest or by accepting Mr. Musk’s “fork in the road” offer, as did more than 700 National Park Service employees, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/national-park-service-federal-workers-quit.html" title="">according to an internal memo</a> sent Tuesday.

But her promotion put her in “probationary” status, which made her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/economy/probationary-federal-workers-trump-cuts.html" title="">vulnerable to dismissal</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lindsey Nielsen, at her home in Wood River, Neb., on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Terry Ratzlaff for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I am very concerned that we’re going to be having a huge scientific gap,” she said.</p><p>Cara Pugliese, a clinical psychologist and program officer at the National Institute of Mental Health, oversaw research on treatments for children on the autism spectrum — a high priority for Robert F.

She was recruited a year ago from Children’s National Medical Center in Washington and fired 344 days into her yearlong probationary period.</p><p>“Life as a woman in science and academia is brutal, but I was part of a mission-driven community — one that fights for fundamental human rights and values differences as assets, not liabilities,” she wrote on Facebook, in a post that has been shared 33,000 times.</p><p>Dr. Joshua Gordon, the former director of the mental health institute, said that Dr. Pugliese worked with scientists to identify research gaps and steer tax dollars toward unmet needs.

She hopes to “pick up teaching gigs,” and already has an offer to work with a nursery.
