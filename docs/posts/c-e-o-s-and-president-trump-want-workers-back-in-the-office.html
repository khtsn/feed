Their bosses make return-to-office plans, which then get shelved. And then shelved again.</p><p>In recent weeks, the calls to end remote work have come back with gusto, and with authority.</p><p>On Monday, President Trump signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/return-to-in-person-work/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> requiring federal department heads to “terminate remote work arrangements” and require all federal workers to return to in-person work five days a week. He previewed the move in December when he said those federal workers who refused to go into the office were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/business/economy/trump-remote-work-federal-workers.html" title="">“going to be dismissed.”</a></p><p>Some chief executives, who have long been enthusiastic about ditching remote work, have also announced full return-to-office plans. Amazon, JPMorgan and AT&amp;T told many employees they would have to be back in the office five days a week this year. Even in popular culture, the office is making a comeback, with “Babygirl” glamorizing the blouse wearing C.E.O., “Severance” returning for a new season probing corporate psychological drama, and buzzy newsletters like “Feed Me” declaring remote work “out.”</p><p>And some workers, who have come back to in-person work of their own volition, are eager to pick up their prepandemic work routines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Two years ago, Ellen Harwick would have said she wanted to work remotely forever. Last fall, a switch flipped.</p><p>A marketing manager for an apparel brand in Bellingham, Wash., Ms. Harwick worked remotely for two weeks in Portugal while still working on Pacific time.
