If you clicked on this essay, you probably are. You’re no doubt aware that your role is quite important for various health and well-being outcomes, and perhaps you spend time wondering if you are doing it right.</p><p>That’s just the sort of thing a good mother worries about, along with a bazillion other things. You probably wonder if your child is sleeping too much or maybe too little. Or growing too slowly or maybe too quickly. And if you are a new parent, you have probably started to worry about teaching your child how to chew. (Please, take this one off your list.)</p><p>Are you a perfect mother? I certainly hope not. Being a perfect mother is actually quite harmful. What would a perfect mother even be? Infinitely available or infinitely responsive to their child? Good grief! If that were even possible, it would be a terrible idea. (And thinking you are a perfect mother probably makes you suspect.)</p><p>A child’s caregivers are the template for their future relationships, and relationships are not one-way. Do you want to raise a child who believes that the people around them exist primarily to meet their needs? Better that they learn, in an age-appropriate way, that give and take is important in all close relationships.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Being flawed is actually part of a mother’s job. Maybe even the most important part. How else would the children in your world learn that flaws are OK and to accept their own?</p><p>And yet, mothers are constantly getting the message that they might not be doing quite enough. It comes from everywhere — books, influencers, their own children. And don’t get me started on mothers-in-law. But an important part of the problem comes from the history of my own field.</p><p>Psychiatrists have had a tendency over the years to blame mothers for their kids’ problems. This is a holdover from a time when there were few women practicing in the field. Are mothers hugely important? Obviously, yes. But too often we have overlooked all the credit that mothers deserve, too.</p><p>This can end up harming children. I work with young people who are living on their own for the first time, and often I am the first mental health professional they encounter. These include young people who have had serious symptoms for years. When I ask if their parents knew, and whether they considered mental health treatment, and why they didn’t pursue it, a number of expected reasons come up. These include cost, access to care and cultural factors. But too often, I hear that parents did not seek mental health treatment for their teenager because they thought a mental health professional would blame them for their child’s problems. I have heard this explanation as recently as last month.</p><p>If you’re still wondering if you’re good enough, please take this quiz:</p><p>Have you ever gone to the gym just to take a shower and lie on the floor for a while? No one needs to know. That’s what women’s locker rooms are for!</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Have you ever thrown away a toy because it was just too loud and pretended it was lost?</p><p>Have you ever recycled some of their artwork because there is just too much and pretended you gave it to Grandma?</p><p>Have you ever disappointed your child, or let them push your buttons? I hope you’re human and come with buttons.</p><p>Have you ever considered bribery? Like offering to pay your child a dollar to stop picking on their sister, or maybe to let you sleep for another hour? It works surprisingly well in some cases.</p><p>If you answered yes to any of these questions, don’t be afraid to join me in admitting that you are not perfect. Good for you.</p><p>So this Mother’s Day, I’d like to give the gift of cutting all mothers some slack. Stop wondering if you’re good enough. You are.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>SR</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>9</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>The Flaws Of Being A Perfect Mom<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
