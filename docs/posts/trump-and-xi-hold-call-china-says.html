Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi were last known to have spoken to each other on Jan. 17, days before Mr. Trump was inaugurated as president.</p><p>The call comes as tensions between China and the United States have ratcheted up again nearly a month after the two sides met in Geneva and agreed to a pause in the trade war.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Trump wrote on social media that Mr. Xi was “VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Trump administration has accused Beijing of breaking the truce by restricting exports of critical rare earth minerals used by a range of American manufacturers, including carmakers and semiconductor producers. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/business/china-rare-earths-united-states-supplies.html" title="">Shortages of the minerals</a>, which are used to make powerful industrial magnets, could bring some American factories to a standstill. China dominates the global market for the minerals and views it as a choke point over the United States.</p><p>In response, the Trump administration has proposed a plan to revoke visas for some Chinese students and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/business/economy/jet-engine-chip-software-exports-to-china.html" title="">suspended some sales to China</a> of components and software used in jet engines and semiconductors, as well as certain types of chemicals and machinery.</p><p>China has denied breaking the terms of the Geneva deal and has accused the United States of escalating tensions.</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The meeting in Geneva in May between top economic officials from the two countries had been the first such talks since Mr. Trump raised U.S. levies on Chinese goods to an eye-watering minimum rate of 145 percent and China retaliated by increasing duties on American imports to 125 percent. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/china-us-tariffs.html" title="">tit-for-tat moves</a> had effectively cut off trade between the countries and raised concerns about a broader global economic slowdown.</p><p>The truce that resulted from the talks saw both sides temporarily<strong> </strong>reducing the punishing tariffs they imposed on each other for 90 days while negotiators sought a longer-term resolution. China also pledged to suspend or remove what it called “non-tariff countermeasures,” though its public statement did not go into specifics. Trump administration officials said that they had expected China to lift restrictions on some rare earth exports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>China has said that the rare earth export controls apply to all countries, not just to the United States. The distinction means that China can argue that its controls should not be regarded as a countermeasure taken against the United States.</p><p>“The Chinese are reluctant to give up their leverage so easily,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington. “They want to wait and see how things go” with trade negotiations.</p><p>Mr. Trump has suggested on several occasions since returning to the White House that a call or a meeting with Mr. Xi was imminent. While Mr. Trump would rather speak directly with Mr. Xi, Chinese officials generally favor hammering out details in advance of any such call or meeting. And Beijing had been concerned about the possibility that Mr. Trump would embarrass Mr. Xi during talks, analysts said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Pierson covers Chinese foreign policy and China’s economic and cultural engagement with the world.
