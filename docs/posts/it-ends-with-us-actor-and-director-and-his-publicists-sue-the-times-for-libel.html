It asserts that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/business/media/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us.html" title="">Dec. 21 article</a> deliberately omitted portions of text exchanges and other information that contradicted the actress’s version of events.</p><p>“The article’s central thesis, encapsulated in a defamatory headline designed to immediately mislead the reader, is that plaintiffs orchestrated a retaliatory public relations campaign against Lively for speaking out about sexual harassment — a premise that is categorically false and easily disproven,” the lawsuit said.</p><p>The suit was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court by Bryan Freedman, an attorney representing Mr. Baldoni and five others, including Melissa Nathan, a crisis management expert whom Ms. Lively accused of helping orchestrate a campaign to manipulate news coverage and social media against her. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In addition to alleging libel by The Times, Mr. Freedman asserted a counternarrative that Ms. Lively wrested control of the film from Mr. Baldoni and that her publicist later tried to plant stories to damage his reputation.</p><p>In a statement, The Times said: “We plan to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.”</p><p>“The role of an independent news organization is to follow the facts where they lead,” the statement said. “Our story was meticulously and responsibly reported. It was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article.”</p><p>In the article, The Times reported that Ms. Lively had filed a legal complaint with the California Civil Rights Department against Mr. Baldoni and his business partner, Jamey Heath; their studio, Wayfarer, and one of its co-founders, Steve Sarowitz; Ms. Nathan and a communications consultant she brought on, Jed Wallace; and Jennifer Abel, another public relations executive. </p><p>The complaint, which claimed sexual harassment and retaliation, included excerpts from thousands of pages of text messages and emails obtained through a subpoena, which were reviewed by The Times.</p><p>Ms. Lively had complained that the men had repeatedly violated physical boundaries and made sexual and other inappropriate comments to her during the shooting of the film. Their studio, Wayfarer, agreed to install safeguards on set, her legal complaint said. In a side letter to Ms. Lively’s contract, signed by Mr. Heath, the studio also agreed not to retaliate against the actress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>She alleged that as the release of the film approached in August 2024, fearful that her allegations would become public and taint them, Mr. Baldoni and Mr. Heath hired Ms. Nathan, a crisis public relations expert, and then Mr. Wallace, to smear Ms. Lively’s reputation instead.</p><p>The actress in her complaint cited text messages that show Ms. Nathan pushing to prevent print articles about Mr. Baldoni’s behavior from being published and reinforce negative ones about Ms. Lively. Other texts, she said, included references to Mr. Wallace, a self-described “hired gun,” leading a digital strategy that included boosting social media posts that could help their cause. For example, one of Ms. Nathan’s employees wrote in a group text message, “We’ve started to see shift on social, due largely to Jed and his team’s efforts to shift the narrative.”</p><p>Ms. Lively’s California complaint was a precursor to a lawsuit she filed on Tuesday in federal court in the Southern District of New York.<strong> </strong><em> </em>“Now, the defendants will answer for their conduct in federal court,” her attorneys said in a statement.</p><p>Last week, Stephanie Jones, a former publicist for Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer, filed a lawsuit against them and others, alleging breach of contract and other claims.<span>  </span>According to the lawsuit, the text messages and emails that Ms. Lively obtained through a subpoena came from a company phone used by Ms. Abel, one of Ms. Jones’s employees, that was returned when she was fired.<span>  </span></p><p>Since The Times article was published, the talent agency William Morris Endeavor dropped Mr. Baldoni as a client. Liz Plank, who has co-hosted the “Man Enough” podcast with Mr. Baldoni and Mr. Heath, announced she would no longer be appearing on the show. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Colleen Hoover, author of the book “It Ends With Us”; Jenny Slate and Brandon Sklenar, cast members of the movie; and Alex Saks, one of the producers, are among those who have publicly supported Ms. Lively.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Megan Twohey is an investigative reporter at The Times.
