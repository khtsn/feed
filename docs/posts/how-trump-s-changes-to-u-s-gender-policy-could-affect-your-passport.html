For trans, intersex and gender-nonconforming Americans applying for or renewing passports, that change has caused anxiety and confusion.</p><p>Since June 2021, the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/passport-help/sex-marker.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">State Department</a> had allowed trans people to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/us/politics/gender-passports.html" title="">declare their gender</a> on U.S. passports without providing medical certification. The agency also recently said it would stop issuing passports with the gender-neutral X marker that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/us/politics/passports-gender-nonbinary.html" title="">had been available since April 2022</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The American Civil Liberties Union filed a suit on Feb. 7 against Mr. Trump and the State Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/transgender-americans-lawsuit-trump-passports.html" title="">on behalf of seven transgender Americans</a>. With that suit pending, here’s what we know about how the policy is affecting passport applications.</p><h3 id="link-5cd9b057"><span><strong>Who exactly is affected by the order?</strong></span></h3><p>It applies to anyone whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.</p><p>According to U.C.L.A.’s Williams Institute, there are <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/subpopulations/transgender-people/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 1.6 million transgender people</a> in the United States. Though there’s not a clear count of people who use X gender markers in America, there are <a href="https://dol.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-54-million-investment-lgbtq-community#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 5,200 people</a> in New York State using the marker on IDs, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles recently <a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/california-dmv-trump-executive-order-gender-real-id/63608792#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the TV station KCRA</a> that there were 21,140 Californians using X markers on their state IDs. A <a href="https://interactadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/intersex-health-equity-report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Jan. 16 also estimates that the United States has more than five million intersex people, an umbrella term for people born with anatomic or genetic characteristics that don’t match the typical definition of male or female.</p><p>The executive order requires that “government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas and Global Entry cards” reflect a person’s sex at birth, though currently valid documents remain valid, regardless of gender marker, until they expire.</p><p>The A.C.L.U. said as of Tuesday that it had been contacted by more than 1,800 transgender, intersex and gender-nonconforming people with passport applications that are suspended or pending. The L.G.B.T.Q. civil rights organization Lambda Legal had received more than 800 inquiries regarding passports since Jan. 20.</p><h3 id="link-3d407068"><span><strong>If you applied for a passport with an X, what’s happening?</strong></span></h3><p>The State Department removed <a href="https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds11_pdf.PDF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the X marker option</a>, which had been available without any need for supporting documentation since 2022, from its passport applications soon after the executive order. Its website’s <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/passport-help/sex-marker.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Sex Marker in Passports” tab</a> now says that “if you submit a passport application requesting an X marker or requesting a sex marker that differs from the sex marker at your birth, you may experience delays getting your passport.” It adds that the State Department will ultimately “issue you a new passport that matches your biological sex at birth, based on your supporting documents and our records about your previous passports.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Though the State Department has not issued more specific guidance for people who applied using a form with the X designation, Laurie Lee, a co-founder of <a href="https://www.swiftpassportservices.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Swift Passport &amp; Visa Services</a> in Chicago, said that their applications would most likely be suspended.</p><p>“My guess is that they’re going to make the people who are caught in the middle redo an application and mark ‘male’ or ‘female,’ and then once that new application is submitted, they’ll get their new passport,” Ms. Lee said. “I don’t have any hope that they would issue a passport with an ‘X’ at this point.”</p><h3 id="link-7ebea9a9"><span><strong>What if you applied for a passport with a marker that differs from your birth sex?</strong></span></h3><p>Though the State Department has said it will issue only “passports with an M or F sex marker that match the customer’s biological sex at birth,” the enforcement of that policy has been confusing and inconsistent.</p><p>Some trans people’s applications appear to be caught in limbo, coming up as pending or suspended on the <a href="https://passportstatus.state.gov" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">State Department’s status-checking site</a>. Westley Ebling, 26, said that he had to contact his congresswoman, Eleanor Holmes Norton, in Washington, D.C., to get any information on the passport renewal that he had submitted on Jan. 14.</p><p>Ms. Norton’s office relayed to him that passport applications with gender changes were being suspended indefinitely, adding “that the State Department will not be able to share more information until possibly late March or even later.” (A State Department spokesperson declined to comment, citing privacy laws and restrictions.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There are others, like Ms. Schafer, who have already received new passports that were reverted to their birth sex.</p><p>Lily Powers, a 29-year-old trans woman in New York, changed her gender marker from an M to an X in early 2024. After she got gender-affirming surgery last October, she thought it would make sense to correct that marker to an F, to match her driver’s license. She submitted her application on Jan. 8.</p><p>Yet when she received her new passport on Feb. 4, it had an M.</p><p>“It was an empty envelope with the new document,” Ms. Powers said. “There was no explanation for why they gave me an M marker instead of what I requested.”</p><h3 id="link-15561668"><span><strong>What are the risks of traveling with a passport that has an incorrect gender marker?</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People who have passport gender markers that don’t match their appearance have reported harassment and additional searches from security personnel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>People who travel with passports that don’t reflect their current appearance, legal name and gender often encounter situations that range from uncomfortable to humiliating or dangerous.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“For trans, intersex and nonbinary travelers, there is now this incredibly heightened and very well founded fear that we may be questioned, detained, have documents confiscated, just because of who we are,” said Arli Christian, senior policy counsel for the A.C.L.U.</p><p>In her video, Ms. Schafer voiced similar concerns. She said she would be traveling abroad on her new passport this week and was preparing for complications.</p><p>“I’m pretty sure it’s going to come along with having to out myself to border patrol agents,” she said, “much more often than I would like to, or is really necessary.”</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Follow New York Times Travel </em></strong><em>on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/traveldispatch" title=""><em>sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter</em></a><em> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
