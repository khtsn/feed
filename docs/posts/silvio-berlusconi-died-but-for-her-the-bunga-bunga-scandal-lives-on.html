Berlusconi.</p><p>Fourteen years ago, Ms. el-Mahroug, then 17 and known as the nightclub dancer Ruby Heart-Stealer, suddenly found herself at the center of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/weekinreview/23donadio.html" title="">national scandal</a> and global tabloid frenzy. Mr. Berlusconi, Italy’s prime minister at the time, was accused of paying her for sex during bacchanals he hosted at his villa near Milan in what became known as “Bunga Bunga” parties.</p><p>She denied it. He denied it. A court eventually acquitted him — and then he died. But the saga is not over for Ms. el-Mahroug, now 31 and desperate to move on.</p><p>“He messed up my life,” she said last week as she prepared to face yet another court hearing, she hopes the last. That hearing, on Monday, could determine if the case against her in the scandal will be dropped or move forward, keeping her life in suspended animation.

But she denies breaking any laws and chalks up her behavior to her youth and need for money after a difficult childhood.</p><p>More than a year after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/world/europe/silvio-berlusconi-dead.html" title="">the death of Mr. Berlusconi</a> — a brash media mogul turned politician who dominated the country for nearly three decades — he remains a potent presence.</p><p>His face is on stamps and campaign posters for his party, on cellphone covers, mugs and T-shirts. Giorgia Meloni is Italy’s prime minister, years after he brought the marginalized post-Fascist political movement in which she was reared into the mainstream. And both supporters and detractors see his enduring influence in the country’s more raucous politics; in television shows that some see as freeing and others as vulgar and sexist; and in an economy that he sought to modernize but is still largely stuck.</p><p>“Italy has a Berlusconian imprint,” said Giovanni Orsina, the director of the school of government at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome.</p><p>Mr. Berlusconi’s long shadow has for years affected Ms. el-Mahroug, who came to Italy as a child from Morocco.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>She has spent nearly half of her life as the object of media obsession as three different trials related to Mr. Berlusconi’s parties wended their way through the justice system.

He was initially found guilty, but was later acquitted because of a lack of evidence that he was aware she was underage. In the second, several of Mr. Berlusconi’s associates were convicted of aiding and abetting prostitution by procuring women for the Bunga Bunga parties.</p><p>The last trial, focused on the accusations of hush money, involves about 20 women, including Ms. el-Mahroug. The women were acquitted by a lower court on procedural grounds, but prosecutors in Milan appealed the decision. The hearing on Monday will address that appeal.</p><p>Some of the women who took part in the parties admit taking money or expensive gifts from Mr. Berlusconi, but they say he was not trying to buy their silence. Instead, they say, he had always been generous with them, even before the cases were opened, or he was compensating them for the damage the case inflicted on their lives and reputations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>According to wiretapped conversations reported in court documents, Ms. el-Mahroug said she had asked Mr. Berlusconi for €5 million in exchange for helping him in his trial. But in the interview last week, she denied receiving that sum and said that she had felt desperate at the time from the media attention and would have said anything by phone.</p><p>The other women in the case include a former Russian beauty queen who says she was Mr. Berlusconi’s longtime girlfriend and now lives in Thailand, a former “Big Brother” reality show contestant who is now a budding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/06/sports/padel-tennis-nyc.html" title="">padel</a> instructor, and a law school graduate.</p><p>They ended up in the middle of a scandal that, for many Italians, became emblematic of Mr. Berlusconi’s debasement of Italy’s top office, a general degradation of Italian politics to a sordid tabloid story, and his enemies’ single-minded zeal to take him down, even posthumously. </p><p>Even as his critics used the women as Exhibit A to show what they called Berlusconi’s depravity, the women say his enemies themselves reduced them to political ammunition.</p><p>“They killed me to get to him,” Ms. el-Mahroug said.</p><p>Still, a large chunk of public opinion is not on the women’s side. Many people see them as gold diggers, trading off their beauty — and perhaps more — for profit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Raissa Skorkina, the Russian who says she was Mr. Berlusconi’s girlfriend, said in a recent interview that she was grateful Mr. Berlusconi supported her financially until his death. But she said she was subjected to abuse by the media and strangers who pointed at her house when she lived in Italy and would say, loudly enough for her to hear, “There lives Berlusconi’s slut.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A bus with a campaign ad for the Forza Italia party, including an image of Mr. Berlusconi, the party’s former leader, in May in Rome.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Filippo Monteforte/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The night that changed everything for Ms. el-Mahroug, and, to some extent, for Mr. Berlusconi, was May 27, 2010, when she was taken into custody by the police on accusations of theft.</p><p>She said it was not unusual for her to be picked up by the police. She had left what she describes as a troubled household at 12 years old and had been adrift since, working odd jobs, sleeping on the street and running away from shelters, only to be routinely caught and taken back.</p><p>This time, though, she was released from custody without being sent to a shelter. Over the previous few months, she had danced in Milan’s celebrity nightclubs and then at Mr. Berlusconi’s parties at his villa. She had made powerful connections, and one of them, the prime minister himself, was now working to release her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Berlusconi, who was returning from an international meeting in Paris that night amid a searing financial crisis, personally called a police official and stated, falsely, that Ms. el-Mahroug was the niece of the Egyptian president then, Hosni Mubarak. Mr. Berlusconi urged the official to accelerate her release. (He later said he believed her relationship to Mr. Mubarak to be real at the time.)</p><p>When an Italian newspaper months later broke the news of her release and the ensuing investigation into Mr. Berlusconi’s actions, Ms. el-Mahroug was back in a shelter. “I got out of the house and saw my face all over the newsstand,” she said. It then emerged that prosecutors were accusing Mr. Berlusconi of paying her for sex when she was a minor, something she denies.</p><p>“I was labeled a child prostitute,” she said. “And it’s a word you carry as a mark forever.”</p><p>The name Ruby became the catchall reference for the scandal, which stained the country’s image abroad. And protests broke out with the rallying cry “Italy is not a brothel.” As newspapers described her as a “<a href="https://gossip.fanpage.it/ruby-video-hot-ecco-la-ragazza-per-bene-nipote-di-mubarak/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very very uninhibited girl</a>,” “cunning” and “<a href="https://gossip.fanpage.it/ruby-e-berlusconi-foto-dei-gioielli-della-escort-manca-collana-del-premier/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a good escort</a>,” she said people “felt authorized to violently insult me on social media.”</p><p>She added that she thought the trial should have Mr. Berlusconi’s name. “He was the maker of all this,” she said.</p><p>After the case exploded, she focused on raising a daughter she had with her boyfriend when she was 19 in Genoa. She later started a long-term relationship with a man who runs a health food restaurant there, and opened a beauty clinic that focuses on Botox injections and fillers — what she called her dream job.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But the scandal follows her.</p><p>A Google search for her name still shows provocative pictures of her, which she regrets, that were taken when she was not yet 18 and were splashed on newspaper front pages when the scandal broke. People on the street and in restaurants, and even her daughter’s friends, sometimes call her Ruby.</p><p>Ms. el-Mahroug said she had worked hard to prepare her daughter Sofia, now 12, for the teasing and worse that she expects to come Sofia’s way, despite the fact that the man at the center of the drama, Mr. Berlusconi, is gone.</p><p>“Knowing him cost me a lot,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emma-bubola">More about Emma Bubola</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Fighting Myanmar’s Patriarchy: </strong>Ying Lao has called out the pro-democracy movement for its frequent use of all-male panels, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/asia/myanmar-women-manels-patriarchy.html">arguing that the exclusion of women</a> from such discussions is hurting the cause.</p></li><li><p><strong>The World’s Biggest River: </strong>As a punishing drought dries up stretches of the Amazon River, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/world/americas/amazon-river-climate-change-brazil.html">Brazil is resorting to dredging</a> to try to keep food, medicine and people flowing along the watery superhighway.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Noble’ Moose in Newfoundland: </strong>Introduced to the island 120 years ago, moose are involved in hundreds of motor vehicle collisions each year.
