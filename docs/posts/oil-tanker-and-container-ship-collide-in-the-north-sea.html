Initial images shared by the BBC showed fire and thick black smoke rising from the ships.</p><p>The British coast guard said it was “coordinating the emergency response to reports of a collision between a tanker and cargo vessel off the coast of East Yorkshire,” and that an alarm was first raised at 9:48 a.m. local time.</p><p>Rescue helicopters were in the area, and lifeboats were deployed from a number of stations along the coast, as well as vessels with “firefighting capability,” the coast guard said in a statement. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, a charity that coordinates lifeboats around the British coast, said there were reports “that a number of people had abandoned the vessels following a collision and there were fires on both ships.”</p><p>Information from Marine Traffic, a website that tracks vessels, appeared to show the Stena Immaculate, an oil tanker, and the Solong, a container ship, on an intersecting route surrounded by emergency response vessels just off the coast of the mouth of the River Humber, near Hull.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><em>This is a developing story.
