The conflict has forced 12 million people from their homes, killed tens of thousands, and set off the world&#39;s worst famine in decades, the United Nations says.</p><p>Foreign powers like the United Arab Emirates and Russia fuel the fight by supplying weapons to either side, and many worry it could spiral into a regional conflict by drawing in fragile neighboring countries like South Sudan or Chad.</p><p>American efforts to broker peace in Sudan last year failed.

As the military closed in, the R.S.F. leader, Lt. Gen. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/world/africa/mohamed-hamdan-sudan-emirates.html" title="">Mohamed Hamdan</a>, issued a video message imploring his troops to stand their ground. When the final assault began, at least 500 paramilitary fighters were still inside, several officers said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But when they tried to flee, they ran into deadly ambushes. A video <a href="https://x.com/Sudan_tweet/status/1903465353134625171" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filmed half a mile from the palace</a>, and verified by The Times, showed dozens of bodies scattered along a street, beside incinerated or bullet-pocked vehicles.</p><p>“This is the season for hunting mice,” declared the officer who took the video, dating it to Saturday.</p><p>R.S.F. fighters stationed on Tuti Island, at the confluence of the Blue Nile and White Nile Rivers, tried to flee on boats, soldiers said. It was unclear how many escaped.</p><p>Without offering details, a Sudanese military spokesman said that “hundreds” of paramilitary fighters had been killed. But dozens of the military’s forces also died, soldiers said privately, in R.S.F. drone attacks and in other fighting.</p><p>Alan Boswell, director of the Horn of Africa project at the International Crisis Group, said it was “just a matter of time” before Sudan’s military took the entire city, forcing the R.S.F. to retreat to its stronghold in the western region of Darfur.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“Quite a fall from where they were for the first year and a half of the war, when they held most of Khartoum,” Mr. Boswell said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Two young soldiers loading their heavy machine gun with a fresh belt of ammunition.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Resting amid the ruins.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers moving out to look for R.S.F. fighters.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Few believe the war is nearing an end, though. Both the R.S.F. and the Sudanese military are backed by powerful foreign powers that have poured weapons into Sudan over the past two years. Sudan’s deputy leader, Malik Agar, recently estimated that there are now 36 million small arms in the country, which had a prewar population of 48 million.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>International efforts to broker a negotiated end to the conflict have collapsed, and the country’s military chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, recently said he preferred to fight, not talk.</p><p>On the steps of the palace, a fresh bloodstain marked the spot where an R.S.F. drone-fired missile had killed four employees from Sudanese state TV and two military officers on Friday morning. As we visited on Sunday, another drone hovered overhead, prompting soldiers to jog between buildings. They urged us to follow quickly.</p><p>Col. Algoney Ali Eseil, a commander leading a group of pro-democracy protesters turned fighters, said the R.S.F. drones were being flown from bases in Darfur and Chad, where they were operated by the United Arab Emirates, the R.S.F.’s main foreign sponsor. Colonel Eseil offered no evidence to support those claims, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/world/africa/uae-sudan-civil-war.html" title="">The Times reported</a> last year that the Emirates was operating Chinese-made Wing Loong 2 drones from an airstrip in Chad that is within striking range of Khartoum.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-30"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Sudan’s military has also relied heavily on drones and other foreign help. Last year it acquired Iranian drones that helped it capture ground in Khartoum. Also last year it acquired eight Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones, which American officials say are especially prized in African conflicts, according to documents obtained by The Times. The documents were first reported by The Washington Post.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>With the city center cleared out, the battle for Khartoum has now moved to the international airport, a mile and a half from the palace. Satellite images show that its runways are pocked with shellfire and littered with the remains of passenger airliners destroyed after fighting broke out in 2023.</p><p>As the city switches from R.S.F. to military control, human rights officials are concerned that civilians accused of collaborating with the rebels may face reprisals. In January, the army was <a href="https://www.info-res.org/sudan-witness/reports/saf-and-affiliated-forces-attack-villages-in-gezira/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused of brutal assaults</a> on suspected R.S.F. sympathizers after recapturing the city of Wad Madani. Volunteers with the Emergency Response Rooms, which runs hundreds of soup kitchens across Khartoum, said they feared they could also be targeted.</p><p>If the army succeeds in Khartoum, the focus of the war will likely shift to Darfur, where R.S.F. fighters are laying a punishing siege on the famine-stricken city of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/19/world/africa/sudan-darfur-siege.html" title="">El Fasher</a>, the only city in Darfur that it does not control. On Friday, they seized the town of Al Malha, about 130 miles north of El Fasher. Residents of the city said the occupying fighters were preventing them from leaving, amid reports of arrests and killings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Sudanese soldier looking out across the Blue Nile toward the recaptured presidential palace on Saturday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>Abdalrahman Altayeb<!-- --> contributed reporting from Khartoum, and <!-- -->Ronen Bergman<!-- --> from Tel Aviv.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Declan Walsh is the chief Africa correspondent for The Times based in Nairobi, Kenya.
