    <h1>Nicolle Wallace Calls on George W. Bush to Denounce Trump</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nicolle Wallace, who was a White House communications director in George W. Bush’s administration, called on Friday for Mr. Bush to have a late-hour “change of heart” and speak out against former President Donald J. Trump.</p><p>Speaking on her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lynsmoXZN6E" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Deadline: White House” program</a> on MSNBC, Ms. Wallace said Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/liz-cheney-trump-harris.html" title="">violent language about former Representative Liz Cheney</a> had pushed her to publicly raise the question she gets “asked more than any other” off the set: “Where is George W. Bush?”</p><p>Ms. Cheney, a former congresswoman from Wyoming, has emerged as one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent Republican critics, and she has campaigned extensively for his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Her father, Dick Cheney, who served as Mr. Bush’s vice president, has also said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/us/politics/dick-cheney-kamala-harris.html" title="">he would vote for Ms. Harris</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Trump criticized Ms. Cheney for her hawkish foreign policy views and said she should be put on a battlefield “with nine barrels shooting at her” — a remark that drew condemnations from a number of leaders. On her program, Ms. Wallace seemed to be imploring her former boss to join that group.</p></div></div>
