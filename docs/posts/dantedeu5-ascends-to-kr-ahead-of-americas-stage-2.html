		<p>I dont like keznit so root against KRU by proxy, but this is a 10/10 pickup. Dante is way better than adverso (sorry dude) and can actually be a firepower.</p>

	<div data-post-id="5145753">
		
		
		<p>roles are going to be weird but consider that this is kru and they will always qualify for champs</p>

	<div data-post-id="5146027">
		
		
		<p>Everyone can play all roles as long as nobody ego clashes 4-1 again or maybe 3-2 at worst</p>

	<div data-post-id="5146406">
		
		
		<p>kru players dont really have egos (atleast not between them), sometimes thats a bad thing tho because they let the others play like shit without telling them anything</p>

	<div data-post-id="5146031">
		
		
		<p>Yea this pickup is pretty confusing considering now they have two primary duelist players without a sova player....</p>

	<div data-post-id="5146039">
		
		
		<p>Mazino is a great initiator and smoker. Check his breach/sova stats</p>

</div></div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="5146410">
		
		
		<p>if you´ve seen keznit streams he can actually play scan on a very high level in terms of map awareness and util usage, he actually says he understands what his job is when he is playing most roles in order to know how to help his teammates when he is on competitive or to know what their opponents are supposed to do in the matches.</p>
