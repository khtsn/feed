A dome completed the back-to-the-future landscape.</p><p>“It is a stimulating and permanent symbol of the work and achievement of the people of Ontario,” then-premier Bill Davis said at its opening in May 1971.</p><p>And for a while it felt that way: it buzzed with visitors. There were playgrounds and water activities, cafes and restaurants. But, commercially, Ontario Place was not an enduring success and its infrastructure began to decay.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ontario Place, as seen in 2023, was meant to be the province’s answer to a successful World’s Fair in Montreal, known as Expo 67.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Even so, it remained a destination for locals as condos took over the waterfront.

She moved to Toronto in 2015, and immediately fell in love with Ontario Place, even though she acknowledges it was “in a state and needed care.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“People were allowed to explore on their own, and I feel like those spaces are quite rare,” she said, adding that she’s dreading the bird migration season because birds will return to West Island but will find the trees, their homes, gone.</p><p>The fight to preserve Ontario Place has now turned into a farewell — captured in a recently released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGP4pvSXdh0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documentary</a>. The site will soon be handed over to Therme, the company that won the bid to develop it, which is contractually obligated to start building by next spring.</p><p>The company adjusted its plans, in response to criticism, lowering the height of the planned spa structure and adding more public spaces around it. It has now set its sights on several more locations, including along the Anacostia River in Washington D.C., and by the Trinity River in Dallas, Texas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ryan McVittie said he and his dog, Pearl, have come to Ontario Place every morning for the past four years.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matina Stevis-Gridneff is the Canada bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the country.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/doug-jr-ford">Doug Jr Ford</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Santa’s Neighbors Are Annoyed: </strong>A tourist season in Rovaniemi, Finland that stretches from October to March has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/asia/santa-finland-rovaniemi.html">anything but jolly for some residents</a> of the “Official Hometown of Santa Claus.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Orange Skies in Iraq: </strong>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/middleeast/iraq-sandstorm.html">severe sandstorm swept across Iraq</a>, turning the sky a strange orange, reducing visibility and sending several thousand people to emergency rooms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Van Gogh’s Last Painting: </strong>The artist painted his final work, “Tree Roots,” in Auvers-sur-Oise, France.
