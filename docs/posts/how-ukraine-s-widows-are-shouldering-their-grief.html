But estimates suggest they number <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/politics/russia-casualties-ukraine-war.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">in the tens of thousands</a>.</p><p>The widows all have loss in common. But each copes in her or his own way.</p><p>Iryna Sharhorodska, 29, always told her husband everything. His death did not change that — for over a year, she has visited his grave daily to speak to him.</p><p>Her husband, Oleksandr Sharhorodskyi, was killed in May 2023, days before Russian forces captured the city of Bakhmut. Ms. Sharhorodska said she was haunted by questions after stumbling across a video on social media that showed medics trying to save him.</p><p>“I looked and was trying to imagine how it was for him,” she said. “What was he thinking? Was he in pain?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Her two children — Sofiia, 7, and Tymofii, 5 — often speak about their father.

I was in some kind of stupor, and it was so difficult.”</p><p>She went back to her work as an interior designer after only five days, seeking a distraction from the pain.</p><p>“I cried a lot — I cried an ocean of tears,” Ms. Zavhorodnia said.

His wife, Kateryna Shynkarenko, was a sniper in the Ukrainian Army. She died in February fighting Russian forces in eastern Ukraine — leaving her husband alone to raise their 7-year-old son, Denys.</p><p>Anastasiia Blyshchyk coped with the death of her fiancé by joining the Ukrainian Army and becoming a press officer in the 47th Brigade. That brought Ms. Blyshchyk, 25, into a world she had known largely through her beloved Oleksandr’s video calls from the front line.</p><p>“I really started feeling better as I understood that I was useful but also was surrounded by people who live with war,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Artem Bozhko with his son, Denys, during the funeral of his wife, Kateryna Shynkarenko, in April in Ostroh, Ukraine.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-23"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Anastasiia Blyshchyk, center, joined the 47th Brigade as a press officer after her husband was killed.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Liudmyla Paterok, 27, at the grave of her husband, Roman, in April. “From all the guys he was serving with, almost no one is left alive,” she said.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Other widows receive support in less formal ways.</p><p>Kateryna Dementiy, 35, and Oksana Tymchuk, 36, knew of each other before Russia’s full-scale invasion. They had bumped into each other in Zaporizhzhia, including at the doctor’s office when both were pregnant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>After the war began, a social media post led to the realization that they both had husbands on the front line. The women met up and went from being acquaintances to friends, bonding over all they had in common — including children the same ages, 3 and 8.</p><p>Their shared experiences grew with tragedy. Oksana’s husband, Dmytro, was killed in January 2023; Kateryna’s husband, Artem, died four months later. The men are buried in the same cemetery, a short distance apart.</p><p>Both women said they drew closer because other friends could not relate to what they were going through.</p><p>“I lost my husband and then I was, like, in a different group of wives,” Ms. Tymchuk said. “It’s like you’re on different sides of the trenches from other people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>On their own, the friends have developed their own rituals of dealing with their grief: A daily phone call at 9 a.m., with coffee. Cinema outings. Regular play dates with their children.</p><p>“Our friendship is a kind of therapy,” Ms. Dementiy said. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Anastasiia Lykova with her children at their home in Verhivtseve, Ukraine, in March.

They folded them into boats and set them afloat on the Dnipro River.</p><p>In hers, Ms. Zmiyevska asked for her husband’s forgiveness.</p><p>“Some women lose only their husband, and I lost his baby, too,” she said as she placed her white paper boat onto the water one spring afternoon.</p><p>Like her feelings of guilt, the boat did not sail away easily.
