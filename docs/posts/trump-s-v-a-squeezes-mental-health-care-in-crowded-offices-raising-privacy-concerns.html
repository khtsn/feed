Since Mr. Trump’s order, the Department of Veterans Affairs has been scrambling to find adequate office space for tens of thousands of health care employees, even those who see most or all of their patients virtually, while maintaining the legal requirement of confidentiality.</p><p>V.A. officials say the agency is handling its return to office responsibly, with the goal of improving care for veterans. While nearly 60,000 employees are being shifted into federal office space, another 45,000 have been allowed exemptions or extensions and can continue working from home for now. That includes a six- to eight-month pause for select clinicians categorized as “telemental health” providers, according to V.A. documents.</p><p>Staff members concerned about patient privacy can notify supervisors, who will give them what they need, said Peter Kasperowicz, a V.A. spokesman. If any staff members lack appropriate work space, he added, “that in itself is a violation of V.A.’s return-to-in-office-work policy.”</p><p>But interviews with three dozen V.A. employees, internal agency documents and photographs provided to The New York Times from six V.A. facilities depict crowded or stopgap office spaces where clinicians say they are being asked to administer mental health treatment or discuss sensitive information in open settings where conversations can be overheard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Veterans have noticed the lack of privacy, clinicians say. They described patients newly hesitant to discuss issues like legal problems, substance abuse and intimate partner violence, limiting the effectiveness of their treatment. Some clinicians said they had trouble hearing patients over the phone or during video calls in their new, telemarketing-style work spaces.</p><p>Providers have been instructed to use headphones, computer privacy screens and even convex mirrors to block veterans’ view of other people in the room, documents and interviews show. In an internal memo, V.A. workers were told to prepare to work in crowded environments by avoiding strong perfumes or “heating or consuming pungent foods” while at their desks.</p><p>Some providers told The Times that they are quitting or retiring early rather than work in conditions that jeopardize patient privacy or undertake long commutes just to talk to patients on video. The V.A. is already suffering from “severe” shortages of psychologists and psychiatrists, <a href="https://www.vaoig.gov/reports/national-healthcare-review/oig-determination-veterans-health-administrations-severe-0#:~:text=Facilities%20reported%202%2C959%20severe%20occupational,percent%20decrease%20from%20FY%202023.&amp;text=Every%20year%20since%202014%2C%20the,of%20occupational%20staffing%20shortages%20reports." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to an agency report</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-7"><div><figcaption><span>Photographs obtained by The New York Times show makeshift office spaces in (clockwise from top left) the Grand Rapids, Mich., area; Coatesville, Pa., Kansas City, Mo.; and Homestead, Fla. Mental health clinicians say they have been told to provide teletherapy or discuss confidential medical information in open settings where they can be overheard, which professional associations say creates ethical and legal concerns.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“They were going to put us around conference tables with headsets and laptops,” said Dr. Nicole Stromberg, 61, an addiction psychiatrist who retired on Thursday after 11 years at the V.A., much of it spent in leadership positions.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>For the past five years, Dr. Stromberg has been working remotely, seeing around 500 veterans spread out across 35 counties in Michigan. She said terminating treatment with her patients has been so painful that she often leaves the sessions crying.</p><p>“It’s really exhausting and really hard and not even what I want to do,” she said. “And I feel guilty, because I feel like doctors should be sticking it out until the end. That’s the commitment we made.”</p><p>The V.A. pioneered telehealth two decades ago to help reach its geographically dispersed patient population, hiring mental health providers for fully remote jobs to treat veterans in other counties or even states. During the first Trump administration, the V.A. aggressively <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-putting-veterans-first/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded</a> its use of virtual mental health care, which it considered a successful innovation.</p><p>But mandating that federal employees work from the office has been a priority for Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency — in part, the billionaire explained in a Wall Street Journal opinion <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">essay</a> he cowrote shortly after the election, because it “would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome.”</p><p>Mr. Kasperowicz characterized the current pushback as coming from “a small but vocal minority” of V.A. employees who were “telling tall tales in a desperate attempt to avoid returning to the office at all costs.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Referring to the photographs provided to The Times, he disputed that patient confidentiality was being violated and said that in each location, clinicians could get access to private offices when needed.</p><p>“The central — and false — premise of your hit piece is that V.A. employees are improperly discussing sensitive info in crowded spaces,” he said. “These photos show the opposite of that. They actually undermine the false narrative The New York Times is trying to push.”</p><p>Mr. Kasperowicz said no sensitive information was discussed in the medical bay in the Florida facility, which he described as “appropriately private.” He acknowledged issues at two V.A. facilities highlighted by The Times but said officials had worked to resolve them.</p><p>In Michigan, for instance, Mr. Kasperowicz confirmed that officials at a clinic outside Grand Rapids had learned on April 16 of a “small group of telehealth providers performing virtual visits in a converted conference room.” But he said that, 12 days after the situation came to light, the providers had been given access to smaller private spaces for sensitive exchanges.</p><p>The agency was “no longer a job where the status quo is to phone it in from home,” he added.</p><p>A White House spokeswoman said that the return-to-office mandate would mean “better services for our veterans.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Many private companies are ending remote work because numerous studies show that employees are more productive and collaborative in-person,” Anna Kelly, the spokeswoman, wrote in a statement.</p><p>Deadlines for returning to office were set for April and May. At the time of the executive <a href="https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-announces-return-to-in-person-work-policy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">order</a>, more than 20 percent of the V.A.’s staff had been working remotely.</p><p>The anticipated impact of the return-to-office mandate on V.A. mental health prompted protests from medical and professional organizations after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/us/politics/veterans-affairs-mental-health-doge.html" title="">an initial Times report</a> in March.</p><p>In an April 11 letter, the chief executive of the National Association of Social Workers <a href="https://www.socialworkers.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=eG0zpzIiGPI%3d&amp;portalid=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> V.A.

Studies showed that teletherapy had <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538994/#:~:text=In%202016%2C%20the%20Agency%20for,systematic%20reviews%20published%20through%202015.&amp;text=It%20broadly%20concluded%20that%20there,for%20women&#39;s%20mental%20health%20needs.&amp;text=These%20evidence%20maps%20provide%20an,and%20mental%20health%20in%20Veterans." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lowered the cost</a> of care and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784372/#:~:text=studies%20reporting%20medians.-,Results,mean%20of%2017.3%20days%20saved." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reduced wait times</a> by an average of 25 days. A study of rural veterans found a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8987904/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">22 percent reduction in the likelihood of suicidal behavior</a> among those provided care over video tablets.</p><p>Dr. Kudler, who is now in private practice, said in his conversations with current V.A. personnel that many had expressed “despair” about “abrupt and unreasoning change.”</p><p>“Once you break that system that way, it’s going to be a very long time coming back,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Alarms have sounded from within the agency about return-to-office mandates. Kevin Galpin, a top V.A. official who oversees teletherapy, wrote in a memo last month that clinicians require “private, secure and therapeutic office spaces” to deliver care, and that open-plan work stations “are inconsistent with this guidance,” according to a copy reviewed by The Times. (Mr. Galpin declined to comment.)</p><p>In interviews, V.A. clinicians described a chaotic spring, as two large waves of employees were given deadlines to report to a federal office space. Some described having to work out of hallways or split offices the size of closets. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.</p><p>A social worker who treats homeless veterans in California said she was placed with a dozen other staff members in a windowless mailroom that was so crowded with undelivered packages that she had to move boxes to reach her cubicle.</p><p>In Ohio, the V.A. asked more than 70 telehealth providers to start working out of a suburban office park, but many were unable to log into the V.A.’s computer system, according to an employee. Mr. Kasperowicz said that internet equipment there had failed and that workers have been allowed to work from home while repairs are made.</p><h2 id="link-18e6c464">Difficult Goodbyes</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“A psychiatrist and a patient, it’s an oddly intimate relationship,” said Dr. Nicole Stromberg, a psychiatrist who retired after 11 years with the V.A.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brittany Greeson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Many clinicians said the changes had prompted them to start looking for jobs outside the agency, which often pay significantly higher salaries.</p><p>Dr. Anil Kulangara and Dr. Catherine Shim, married psychiatrists who had been treating patients remotely at the American Lake clinic in Tacoma, Wash., said they were deeply discouraged on April 14, when they reported to the office spaces they had been assigned.</p><p>“It seemed a little unreal, almost laughable,” Dr. Kulangara said. They weren’t given keys for the building or the office, which still contained the belongings of previous occupants. When they were able to get in, they discovered that the I.T. setup would not allow them to see patients, so they raced home, they said.</p><p>“At no point in this did anyone explain why this was important to do, other than to comply” with an executive order, Dr. Kulangara said. “We tried. It’s not worth it, and it doesn’t make any sense. It was such an obvious harm to us and to our patients and no one seemed willing to push back.”</p><p>Both doctors officially resigned last week, citing the discontinuation of remote work as the reason. Though both have received offers for new jobs, Dr. Kulangara said, “we have been literally sick to our stomachs thinking of what is going to happen to our patients,” a combined case load of more than 500 veterans suffering from PTSD, sexual trauma and severe mental illness.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>In total, 10 clinicians told The Times that they had left their jobs, or were in the process of leaving, because of the changes.</p><p>One psychiatrist said she decided to quit as soon as she learned she would have to see patients over a video link from an open-plan office. Finding a new job was easy: Within weeks, she said, she had three offers, including one that paid 20 percent more than the V.A.</p><p>Another psychiatrist practicing in Virginia, who was hired for a fully remote position, said she has accepted a new job in the private sector rather than commute to a V.A. building to conduct virtual treatment, which would restrict the time she spends with her young children.</p><p>The psychiatrist said it took less than two weeks to find a new job. But she is torn about the decision, because it means terminating treatment with 600 veterans who need care.</p><p>“I’m angry,” she said. “I have one patient on hospice — he is recounting trauma, he only has a few months left to live, and I don’t think he will be rescheduled before he passes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>The Trump administration has said it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/veterans-affairs-cuts-trump.html" title="">plans to eliminate 80,000 V.A. jobs</a>, or roughly one-sixth of the total work force, but officials say the layoffs will target administrative and support staff and will have no affect on patient care.</p><p>Dr. Stromberg, the psychiatrist from Michigan, said her anxiety began mounting when V.A. clinicians were told to remove Pride flags and stop using pronoun identifiers.
