Since Mr. Trump’s order, the Department of Veterans Affairs has been scrambling to find adequate office space for tens of thousands of health care employees, even those who see most or all of their patients virtually, while maintaining the legal requirement of confidentiality.</p><p>V.A. officials say the agency is handling its return to office responsibly, with the goal of improving care for veterans. While nearly 60,000 employees are being shifted into federal office space, another 45,000 have been allowed exemptions or extensions and can continue working from home for now. That includes a six- to eight-month pause for select clinicians categorized as “telemental health” providers, according to V.A. documents.</p><p>Staff members concerned about patient privacy can notify supervisors, who will give them what they need, said Peter Kasperowicz, a V.A. spokesman. If any staff members lack appropriate work space, he added, “that in itself is a violation of V.A.’s return-to-in-office-work policy.”</p><p>But interviews with three dozen V.A. employees, internal agency documents and photographs provided to The New York Times from six V.A. facilities depict crowded or stopgap office spaces where clinicians say they are being asked to administer mental health treatment or discuss sensitive information in open settings where conversations can be overheard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Veterans have noticed the lack of privacy, clinicians say. They described patients newly hesitant to discuss issues like legal problems, substance abuse and intimate partner violence, limiting the effectiveness of their treatment. Some clinicians said they had trouble hearing patients over the phone or during video calls in their new, telemarketing-style work spaces.</p><p>Providers have been instructed to use headphones, computer privacy screens and even convex mirrors to block veterans’ view of other people in the room, documents and interviews show. In an internal memo, V.A. workers were told to prepare to work in crowded environments by avoiding strong perfumes or “heating or consuming pungent foods” while at their desks.</p><p>Some providers told The Times that they are quitting or retiring early rather than work in conditions that jeopardize patient privacy or undertake long commutes just to talk to patients on video.

They actually undermine the false narrative The New York Times is trying to push.”</p><p>Mr. Kasperowicz said no sensitive information was discussed in the medical bay in the Florida facility, which he described as “appropriately private.” He acknowledged issues at two V.A. facilities highlighted by The Times but said officials had worked to resolve them.</p><p>In Michigan, for instance, Mr. Kasperowicz confirmed that officials at a clinic outside Grand Rapids had learned on April 16 of a “small group of telehealth providers performing virtual visits in a converted conference room.” But he said that, 12 days after the situation came to light, the providers had been given access to smaller private spaces for sensitive exchanges.</p><p>The agency was “no longer a job where the status quo is to phone it in from home,” he added.</p><p>A White House spokeswoman said that the return-to-office mandate would mean “better services for our veterans.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Many private companies are ending remote work because numerous studies show that employees are more productive and collaborative in-person,” Anna Kelly, the spokeswoman, wrote in a statement.</p><p>Deadlines for returning to office were set for April and May.
