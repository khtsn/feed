It offered free rooms to people who enrolled, but some of its buildings were effectively government-funded drug houses, where many patients relapsed and sometimes died, the reporters found.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The state’s order said PHA Healthcare had been operating without a valid license since it expired in April. The program was told to notify its patients and either transfer them to other providers or make alternative arrangements “to ensure continuity of services” by Jan. 23. The company can appeal the state’s decision.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The company has also chosen to relocate the patients from its housing, a state Health Department spokesman, Chase Cook, said in a statement on Friday. It has been cooperating with the authorities to ensure that all patients are “transitioned appropriately,” he said.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
