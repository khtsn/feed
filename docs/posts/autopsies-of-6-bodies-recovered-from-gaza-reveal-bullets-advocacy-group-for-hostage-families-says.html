The New York Times has not reviewed them and cannot confirm the results.</p><p>Four other bodies found in the tunnels near the hostages, believed to belong to Hamas militants, did not display the same marks, the military spokesperson said.</p><p>How and when the hostages died has been a matter of contention. Hamas has blamed the deaths on Israeli airstrikes, and the Israeli military has acknowledged some of them likely died while Israel was carrying out military operations in the area where they were found. Some Israel news outlets reported the hostages may have suffocated when the tunnel filled with toxins after an airstrike.</p><p>The revelations raise new questions about the circumstances of the hostages’ deaths after months of conflicting statements about some of the recovered captives from Hamas and the Israeli military.</p><p>On Tuesday, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-bodies-recovered-gaza.html" title="">Israeli military announced</a> that it had recovered the six bodies in a hidden tunnel network, alongside four of their presumed captors.</p><p>Five of the six captives were already believed to be dead, according to the Israeli military. Three of them — Haim Peri, 80; Yoram Metzger, 80; and Alexander Dancyg, 75 — had been abducted from the Nir Oz kibbutz near the Gaza border. Two others — Nadav Popplewell, 51, and Yagev Buchshtab, 35 — were taken from another border community, Nirim.</p><p>The sixth body belonged to another resident of Nir Oz, Avraham Munder, 79. Mr. Munder’s death had not been established previously.</p><p>Abu Ubaida, a spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, said in March that Mr. Metzger and Mr. Peri were among seven hostages who had been killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Hamas then said in May that Mr. Popplewell had died from injuries sustained in an Israeli airstrike more than a month earlier.</p><p>Weeks later, in early June, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-dead-hamas-gaza.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">said</a> that it was examining the possibility that some of the hostages had been killed together months earlier while Israeli forces were operating in the Khan Younis area.</p><p>On Tuesday, Adm. Hagari was asked again about how the hostages died at a news conference. He repeated what he had said in June — that the “hostages were killed while our troops were operating in Khan Younis” — and added that a forensic examination would reveal more.</p><p>Israeli news media reported <a href="https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/rye11gbmsr?utm_source=ynet.co.il&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=copy_url" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Tuesday</a> that initial assessments suggested that five of the six hostages had died from suffocation when an Israeli airstrike hit another tunnel, causing the one they were in to fill with carbon dioxide. The Times could not confirm those reports.</p><p>The recovery of six dead hostages this week emphasized the urgent need for a cease-fire deal, families of the captives said in their statement on Thursday. The forum said the evidence the hostages may have been shot “serves as further proof of the cruelty of the terrorists,” and it condemned the government’s failure to reach a cease-fire agreement that would lead to the return of all hostages and an end to the fighting in Gaza.</p><p>“In every minute that the deal is not completed, another hostage could lose their life,” the forum said. “After 10 and a half months of war in which the hostages have been suffering, tortured, and dying, it is clear to all that the return of the hostages is only possible through a deal.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>9</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Families of Hostages Say Autopsies Revealed Bullets<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
