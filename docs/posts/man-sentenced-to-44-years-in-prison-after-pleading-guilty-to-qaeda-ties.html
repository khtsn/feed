The United States later killed him in a drone strike.</p><p>The sentencing of Mr. Pham, 41, in Federal District Court in Manhattan, appeared to conclude a winding case that began with his indictment in New York on several terrorism counts in 2012 and his extradition to the United States from Britain in 2015.</p><p>“Minh Quang Pham’s actions were not just an affront to the safety of this country, but to the principles of peace and security that we hold dear,” Danielle R. Sassoon, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said. “Today’s sentencing underscores our resolve to stop terrorism before it occurs.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A lawyer for Mr. Pham, Bobbi Sternheim, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Minh Quang Pham, pictured, received military training from Anwar al-Awlaki, a leader of the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Pham was born in Vietnam, moved to Britain as a child, worked as a web designer and converted to Islam. The events that led to his conviction and sentencing began in late 2010 when he traveled to Yemen, the base of operations for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula" title="">Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula</a>, or AQAP, according to court documents.</p><p>Mr. Pham planned to join the terrorist group, wage jihad on its behalf and martyr himself for its cause, prosecutors said. While in Yemen, he received training from Awlaki, who advised him to return to Britain and recruit others to the cause, according to court documents.</p><p>Before leaving Yemen, prosecutors said, Mr. Pham approached Awlaki about undertaking a suicide mission.</p><p>Awlaki personally taught Mr. Pham how to create a deadly explosive device using household chemicals and directed him to detonate such a device at an area of Heathrow where flights arrived from the United States or Israel, according to court documents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>During this period, prosecutors said, Mr. Pham made various videos, some of which showed him preparing the device. In others, he encouraged people to engage in violent jihad.</p><p>He was detained upon arriving at Heathrow in July 2011 after the authorities searched him and found, among other things, a live round of armor-piercing ammunition, according to court documents.</p><p>He was released, and was arrested again several months later under British immigration law, prosecutors said. Searches of his home and other locations yielded several pieces of electronic media that showed he had been viewing Awlaki’s speeches and writings since returning to Britain, according to court documents.</p><p>Mr. Pham pleaded guilty in January 2016 to providing material support to Al Qaeda, to conspiring to receive military-type training from the group and to using a firearm in furtherance of violent crimes. He was sentenced several months later to 40 years in prison.</p><p>The conviction was subsequently vacated, partly at the request of federal prosecutors, according to court filings. A grand jury later returned a superseding indictment that reinstated several of the original charges and that added new ones. Mr. Pham entered a second guilty plea in May 2023, setting the stage for the sentencing on Tuesday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ed Shanahan is a rewrite reporter and editor covering breaking news and general assignments on the Metro desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ed-shanahan">More about Ed Shanahan</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/al-qaeda">Al Qaeda</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula">Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/heathrow-airport-london-england">Heathrow Airport (London, England)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/anwar-alawlaki">Anwar al-Awlaki</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>​​A Prosecutor’s ‘Sovereign’ Status: </strong>If the Southern District of New York’s interim U.S. attorney agrees to drop the prosecution of Mayor Eric Adams, the decision could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/nyregion/eric-adams-charges-southern-district.html">threaten the reputation of a famously independent office</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>​​A Survivor’s Story: </strong>Joseph Lynskey was waiting for the subway in Manhattan when he was pushed in front of a train, but somehow he survived. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/nyregion/new-york-subway-shove-survivor.html">The random act of violence has transformed his life</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>​​Lonely at the Top: </strong>In New York City, private restaurants in luxury towers are a popular amenity.
