    <h1>Biden Aides Warned Putin as Russia’s Shadow War Threatened Air Disaster</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After innocent-looking cargo shipments began catching fire at airports and warehouses in Germany, Britain and Poland over the summer, there was little doubt in Washington and Europe that Russia was behind the sabotage.</p><p>But in August, White House officials became increasingly alarmed by secretly obtained intelligence suggesting Moscow had a far larger plan in mind: bringing the war in Ukraine to American shores.</p><p>The question was how to send a warning to the one man who could stop it: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</p><p>In a series of Situation Room briefings, President Biden’s top aides reviewed details of conversations among top officials of the G.R.U., Russia’s military intelligence arm, who were describing shipments of consumer products that burst into flames — in one case, a small electronic massager — as a test run.</p></div></div>
