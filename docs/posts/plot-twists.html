    <h1>Plot Twists</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>I’d just finished and loved Miranda July’s novel “All Fours” last year when my colleague Marie Solis wrote a profile of July with the headline, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/05/style/miranda-july-all-fours-profile.html" title="">She Wrote the First Great Perimenopause Novel.”</a> This was the first time I’d heard the book mentioned in these superlative terms. “All Fours” is about a woman in her 40s who sets off on a road trip from California to New York but gets waylaid a few miles from home, rents a motel room and stays there for three weeks, during which time she reconsiders all the received ideas she’s internalized about being a wife, mother, woman, artist. I’d read the book the way I consume most of July’s work — quickly, excitedly, marveling at how her brain works, how she’s able to take seemingly ineffable experiences and make them explicit.</p><p>“All Fours” spoke to me, but it didn’t dawn on me until I read Marie’s article that this was going to be such an important book to so many people. Soon, everyone I knew was reading it. It became “the talk of every <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/style/miranda-july-all-fours-group-texts.html" title="">group text</a> — at least every group text composed of women over 40,” The Times said. The Book Review named it one of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/books/best-books-2024.html" title="">10 best books</a> of the year.</p><p>And the conversation has continued. July has since started a Substack. There’s a mini-series coming. Surely even more people will be reading and chatting about the book when it comes out in paperback on Wednesday. A couple of weeks ago, July was a guest on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/podcasts/miranda-july-knew-exactly-what-she-was-doing.html" title="">the Modern Love podcast</a>. She reflected on the success of the book, how it was no accident that it became as big as it has. She deliberately set out to write a book that would “change our conception of older women and their sexuality and just their lived lives and what goes on in their heads.”</p><p>I was struck by one portion of the interview in which she mentions that, when she was working on “All Fours,” she and her friend Isabel would “meet once a week and eat and talk about the idea that we were always changing.” This set my mind racing: I meet up regularly with friends, but we seldom have an agenda beyond catching up. How exciting and productive to have a regular meetup with a theme!</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>July and Isabel specifically focused their get-togethers on the biological changes they were experiencing during perimenopause — “that we were actually pretty different at different times of the month and that we were kind of putting on an act of sameness” — but if that isn’t applicable to your own circumstances, you could just talk about how you’ve changed generally, your outlook or your routines or your tastes. Imagine inviting a friend to coffee and telling them you’d like to focus the date on how you’re “always changing.” It’s weird, but it would direct your conversation in a way that might be interesting. Who knows what you might discover?</p><p>This is what I love about July’s work: She seems to see the world as a canvas for creativity, her life as a space of possibility where just because things have always been done a certain way doesn’t mean they have to continue along those lines. In the 1990s, she created a <a href="https://www.joanie4jackie.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">videotape chain letter</a> of movies made by girls and women. In 2014, she created <a href="https://somebodyapp.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an app</a> that allowed you to enlist a stranger in delivering an in-person message to a friend. And I was recently thrilled to find that one of my favorite pieces of July’s audio fiction, “School of Romance,” from the late, great WNYC radio show “The Next Big Thing,” is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sarah-lawrence-radio/school-of-romance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">available on SoundCloud</a>. It’s gorgeous, delightful, heartbreaking, and, like “All Fours” and her other fiction and films, it makes me want to live my life a little more creatively. Like all good art, it makes me want to question things.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><p>India-Pakistan Conflict</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Indian paramilitary soldiers patrolling a marketplace in Kashmir.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sajjad Hussain/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><ul><li><p>Pakistan said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/world/asia/india-pakistan-conflict.html" title="">fired missiles at military sites in India</a> after accusing India of targeting its air bases.

It was wildly inventive, with graphics and gameplay that moved the medium forward. It was also, for its time, wildly violent; Germany restricted sales of the game for nearly two decades. The moral panic around video games has since subsided, and this new Doom is unlikely to cause much of a stir, even though its monster guts are far more detailed. But players who loved the original will be happy to find that, 32 years later, the objectives remain the same: Run fast.
