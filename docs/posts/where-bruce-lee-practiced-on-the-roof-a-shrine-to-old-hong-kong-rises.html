    <h1>Where Bruce Lee Practiced on the Roof, a Shrine to Old Hong Kong Rises</h1>

On summer weekends, people gathered for games of mahjong under a pavilion as children played nearby in sandboxes and swings. Movies were once shot there and Bruce Lee, its most famous patron, practiced martial arts on its roof.</p><p>In the decades since, the hotel stopped renting out rooms because new fire codes would require them to be upgraded. The surrounding rice fields were developed into middle-class housing. The restaurant is still turning out its famed roast pigeon, but it has struggled to fill its wood-trimmed dining rooms since its 500-spot parking lot was requisitioned for a new police station in the 1970s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A building with a faded sign in Chinese characters atop it, surrounded by trees on a slope." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg/00int-hongkong-dispatch-02-ktcg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/99dd2b57-2261-5096-ad09-ec4035ab203f" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lung Wah Hotel in Hong Kong’s northern New Territories.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Now, the operation has been given a chance for a new lease on life — by leaning into the past. An unused teahouse on the property has been remade into Hong Kong Radiance, a hands-on museum that seeks to recreate slices of the vibrant life in the city as it transitioned from a postwar factory town producing clothes, electronics and plastics into a glittering financial center connecting East and West.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>John Wu, a graphic designer and well-known local collector who curated the space, said he wanted it to resemble a film set, where each corner had a cohesive color palette.</p><p>His goal, he said, was to revive memories for older visitors while also inspiring younger generations. When giving tours, he often calls attention to unique details, encouraging visitors to feel the sturdiness of the wood, for example. “Only then can these objects get a second life,” he said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>John Wu said he wanted the space to resemble a film set, where each corner had a cohesive color palette.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Dusty antique shops have long been a fixture in the city, but a new crop of businesses — photo studios, restaurants and vintage-inspired shops, many run by Gen-Z and millennial proprietors — are trying to hold fast to the aesthetics and everyday objects from a more recent past, before the British returned the former colony to Chinese control in 1997.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Many residents regard the 1980s as a golden era for Hong Kong culture, when locally-made movies, television shows and music known as Cantopop, sung in Cantonese, were hugely popular both at home and abroad. The success of its entertainment scene was a point of pride, tied to the city’s identity as cosmopolitan and a place of opportunity for those with dreams, as well as the guts and wits to pursue them. But imports from mainland China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan led to the fading of Hong Kong’s pop culture in the decades since.</p><p>The wave of nostalgia has coincided with efforts by the Chinese government to redefine Hong Kong’s identity in the wake of protracted antigovernment protests, which led to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/world/asia/hong-kong-election-national-security-law.html" title="">crackdown by Beijing</a> in 2020 and the imposition of a national security law. Since then, the authorities have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/world/asia/hong-kong-history-museum.html" title="">revamped history museums</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/world/asia/hong-kong-textbooks-british-colony.html" title="">rewritten textbooks</a> to adhere to Beijing’s official narrative.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Visitors looking at Mr. Wu’s display.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Our generation has fantasies about the past,” said Connie Li, a 30-year-old interior designer who visited the museum on a recent afternoon. “Things are changing too quickly, but in these spaces, we can find an escape in the so-called glory days and search for our roots.”</p><p>To tap into public interest in the recent past, the city’s tourism board organized an exhibit tied to last year’s hit “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBU6Rff26A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In</a>,” a martial-arts action movie set in 1980s Hong Kong.

It includes an herbalist’s office flanked by antique scrolls, and a convenience store with a retro jukebox, crates full of soda bottles and vintage ice cream tubs. One room recreates a cluttered working-class home with a mahjong table, a Singer sewing machine and a bunk bed piled with suitcases.</p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-13"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit=""><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-01-lcwt/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-01-lcwt-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-01-lcwt/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-01-lcwt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit=""><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-02-lcwt/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-02-lcwt-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-02-lcwt/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-02-lcwt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit=""><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-03-lcwt/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-03-lcwt-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-03-lcwt/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-03-lcwt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-3-" data-credit=""><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-04-lcwt/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-04-lcwt-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/14/multimedia/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-04-lcwt/00int-hongkong-dispatch-grid-04-lcwt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>Mr. Wu’s goal was to revive memories for older visitors while also inspiring younger generations.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Wu, 55, began collecting Japanese and Western objects when he was young but has in recent years focused on Hong Kong designs because he believed they reflected the city’s unique history and character. He is known for his collection of designs by <a href="https://www.mplus.org.hk/en/magazine/henry-steiner-branding-hong-kong/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Henry Steiner</a>, an Austrian whose work defined some of Hong Kong’s best-known brands, like the HSBC logo.</p><p>In 2023, Mr. Wu teamed up with two other enthusiasts he had met online — Pan Tse, a maintenance worker, and Tiger Ng, a logistics worker with a passion for scavenging abandoned lots — to help elderly residents move out of an old housing estate that was slated to be torn down. </p><p>The men were allowed to keep furniture and mementos from about 30 households in their own storage units, promising to one day show them to the public. They tried to find space in an industrial building to set up a mini-museum, but rents were high.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mary Chung, the owner of the Lung Wah Hotel.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>News of their volunteer work spread and, in 2024, the owner of the hotel, Mary Chung, reached out for help sorting through the bulky recording equipment, instruments and books that had piled up at the property.</p><p>Built in the 1930s, it was her family’s <a href="https://lungwahhotel.com.hk/webpage.php?id=3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vacation home</a> until the Japanese army requisitioned it during World War II. The Chungs converted into a small hotel in 1951, with under a dozen rooms. As it was a short drive from the academic institution that became the Chinese University of Hong Kong, it often sublet rooms to people teaching there, including the martial arts writer Jin Yong.</p><p>There were poetry readings and live music, even a recording studio that was used by Cantonese opera singers. Movie crews were allowed to film there — with the proviso that the actors also checked in. (Bruce Lee stayed during shooting of his 1971 blockbuster, “The Big Boss,” a.k.a. “Fists of Fury.”)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bruce Lee in the 1971 movie “Fists of Fury.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettmann/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>But business waned as the area developed into a densely populated suburb, <a href="https://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/explore/neighbourhoods/sha-tin.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">losing its rural character</a>. Access became more difficult after the government took over adjacent land for an electric railway.</p><p>The hotel ceased operating in 1985, but the restaurant kept going with mostly local customers, the dining rooms decorated with black-and-white photos of stars and show business posters. During the Covid pandemic, it almost folded and Mrs. Chung was forced to reduce its 200 employees to a handful.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Images of Bruce Lee at a dining room at the hotel.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Last year, she reached a deal with Mr. Wu’s group, which for months cleared the teahouse, moving its clutter into other rooms in the hotel.

Some even broke into Cantonese opera as they recalled live performances.</p><p>Always on the lookout for new ways to attract visitors, Mrs. Chung has considered displaying more of the hotel’s old items in the garden’s teahouse, near cages holding three peacocks.</p><p>“Lung Wah is part of Hong Kong’s collective memory,” she said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The entrance to Lung Wah Hotel.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tiffany May is a reporter based in Hong Kong, covering the politics, business and culture of the city and the broader region.</p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>False Claims and Global Aims: </strong>A Times investigation shows Therme, a European firm which runs a spa and water park in Romania, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/world/canada/therme-spa-ontario-canada.html">exaggerated its track record in securing a deal with Ontario</a>, and government auditors found that the process had been unfair and opaque.</p></li><li><p><strong>Odes to Mexican Drug Lords: </strong>Mexican artists built enormous audiences singing about drug cartels and narco culture. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/americas/mexico-narcocorridos-ban.html">Cities and states are now moving against the style</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Debate on Sex and Gender: </strong>President Trump and right-wing politicians in Europe have railed against trans rights. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/world/europe/uk-trans-hungary-germany-us.html">Britain’s top court has now added its voice to the discussion</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Santa’s Neighbors Are Annoyed: </strong>A tourist season in Rovaniemi, Finland that stretches from October to March has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/asia/santa-finland-rovaniemi.html">anything but jolly for some residents</a> of the “Official Hometown of Santa Claus.”</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
