The sound of her snoring filled the courtroom. She appeared to be dead asleep.</p><p>In the videos, she did not respond to the touches of the men, who engaged with her body in sex acts.</p><p>Ms. Pelicot had fought hard for these videos to be shown publicly in the courtroom because, she said, they were incontrovertible evidence. While most rape victims have only their word and memory of events, Ms. Pelicot has a library of proof in the form of videos and photographs — taken by her own husband.</p><p>Showing them publicly was essential, her lawyer Antoine Camus told the courtroom, “to look rape straight in the eyes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was another astounding moment in a trial that for the past month has gripped France as if by the throat and shaken it violently. The case has raised profound questions about relations between men and women, the prevalence of rape and conceptions of consent.</p><p>More than 50 men are on trial together. Almost all are accused of aggravated rape against Ms. Pelicot, a grandmother and retired manager at a big company, while she was in an unconscious state. Her former husband of 50 years, Dominique Pelicot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/europe/france-rape-trial-gisele-pelicot.html" title="">has pleaded guilty to mixing drugs into her food and drin</a>k and inviting others into their home, in a village in southern France where they had retired, to join him in raping her limp body.</p><p>While Ms. Pelicot, 71, had the right to request that the trial take place behind closed doors, she decided to make it public. She said that she did it not for her, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/world/europe/france-rape-trial-pelicot-testimony.html" title="">but to protect other women.</a> Shame, she said, must change sides — from the victims to the perpetrators.</p><p>The accused men appear to be a gallery of working-class and middle-class French society: truck drivers, carpenters and trade workers, a nurse, an I.T. expert, a local journalist. They range in age from 26 to 74. Many have children and are in relationships. Over four months, their cases are coming before the court in batches of six or seven a week.</p><p>All but 15 have contested the charge. Many have argued that they were tricked into coming into her bedroom by Mr. Pelicot, who had offered them a playful trio with his wife. Many say he led them to believe she was sleeping — or pretending to sleep — as part of the couple’s sexual fantasy. Mr. Pelicot manipulated them when they were vulnerable, some of them have said, and directed them in the acts like a stage manager. They said they had blindly followed his orders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>One said this week that he thought he was also drugged, and had no memory from the moment he entered the room until he returned to his car later. Another said he was so terrified by Mr. Pelicot, whom he regarded as a “predator” and a “psychopath,” that he interacted with Ms. Pelicot’s body calmly in order to “not show weakness, so he attacks me.”</p><p>“They took a precise line of defense,” Mr. Camus, one of the lawyers for Ms. Pelicot, told the court on Friday. Ms. Pelicot has said that while the men were perhaps tricked into coming into her bedroom, once they got there, she was so unconscious that it was clear that she could not have possibly given consent.</p><p>This is where the videos come in. Mr. Pelicot filmed most of the encounters, often with two cameras, and carefully edited and titled them. Over the course of their investigation, the police found more than 20,000 videos and photographs on his electronic devices, many of them in a digital folder titled “Abuse.”</p><p>After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/europe/france-rape-trial-gisele-pelicot.html" title="">initially ruling the videos</a> would not be viewed because of their “indecent and shocking” nature, the judges of the criminal court in Avignon changed their minds after a heated courtroom debate on Friday. Not all the videos would be shown, announced the head judge, Roger Arata — just those videos deemed “strictly necessary” for the “manifestation of the truth.”</p><p>A dozen videos and about 10 photos were shown over the courtroom’s three flat screens on Friday afternoon and projected into the overflow room for members of the public, who have continued to line up every day to watch the proceedings and support Ms. Pelicot.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The videos’ titles alone, packed with crude words and read out by the prosecutor, made many observers flinch. Judge Arata said at one point that he didn’t have any “particular desire” to read them out loud any more.</p><p>In many, Ms. Pelicot appeared naked, but in some, she wore a garter belt, underwear and white socks. In one, she had a blindfold over her eyes. Her husband told the police he often dressed her up after she was unconscious, and then at the end of the night, he cleaned her and returned her to her nightclothes.</p><p>The accused were seen stroking her sides and intimate parts with their hands and mouths. Five were captured putting their penises in her slack mouth. The camera sometimes zoomed in for close-ups. While Ms. Pelicot could be seen moving slightly in some, in none was she seen responding to the touches. She often snored loudly.</p><p>The videos played on uncomfortably long. One defendant lowered his face. Many lawyers and journalists stopped looking at the screens.</p><p>Thierry Postat, a 61-year-old refrigeration technician who is among those on trial, told the court that he had been involved in swinging and couple sharing since he was 30. He said that in at least three other cases, he had been invited into bedrooms by husbands to have sex with their sleeping wives — only one of whom woke up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I trusted Mr. Pelicot,” because most of the time among swingers, Mr. Postat told the court, “it’s the man who organizes things&#34;</p><p>But he was pressed by Ms. Pelicot’s lawyer, Mr. Camus: “You really thought you were practicing couple swapping? You see a couple there?” Mr. Camus asked Mr. Postat, referring to the video that had just been shown.</p><p>“Yes,” Mr. Postat responded. “The way I remember it.”</p><p>Another video captured Simone Mekenese penetrating Ms. Pelicot, while she was lying on her side sleeping.</p><p>“You weren’t aware she was unconscious?” asked Stéphane Babonneau, a second lawyer for Ms. Pelicot.</p><p>“No,” responded Mr. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GDmBfzQeZzjKAN9qQmdaqx8t_xLB-uV2BdtE3vDyhic/edit#heading=h.7gp0k4k9r02x" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mekenese</a>, 43, a driver on a construction site who was a neighbor of the couple’s at the time. “I thought she would participate soon.”</p><p>An argument heard repeatedly in court this week was that while they might not have gotten direct consent from Ms. Pelicot, the accused men did not go to the Pelicots’ home with an intention to rape her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Th day before, Mr. Postat had told the court that they might be rapists because they had not received consent, “but we aren’t rapists in our souls.”</p><p>After two hours of viewing videos, the court session ended abruptly. People drifted out of the courtroom, and the overflow room, stunned.</p><p>“We are in shock,,” said Anne-Marie Galvan, 58, a nursing assistant at the local hospital. Her husband, Serge Galvan, stood nearby, tears swelling in his eyes.</p><p>“I’m almost ashamed to be a man,” he said. “You could see she was sleeping. It was obvious she was unconscious.”</p><p>The couple, and the rest of the crowd, clapped thunderously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/europe/france-rape-trial-gisele-pelicot.html" title="">when Ms. Pelicot passed by,</a> making her way with her lawyers to the court exit. She stopped, looked at the group, and put her hand to her heart.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We are here for her. We must not let this lady down. We must give her as much strength as possible. It’s important for women,” said Mr. Galvan.</p><p>“This,” he added, thinking back to the scenes on the screen, “has to stop.”</p><p>Ségolène Le Stradic<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
