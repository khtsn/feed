His father, Jonathan Dekel-Chen, a history professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, wrote <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/opinion/holocaust-israel-palestinians-hamas.html" title="">an opinion piece for The New York Times</a> critical of the Israeli government for not bringing home the hostages.</p><p>In August, the professor told The Times that he and other members of the Nir Oz kibbutz would not <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-oct-7-memorial.html" title="">participate in an official government ceremony</a> then being planned to commemorate the Oct. 7 attack.
