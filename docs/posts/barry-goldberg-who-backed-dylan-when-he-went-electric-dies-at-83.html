He was 83.</p><p>His son, Aram Goldberg, said the cause of his death, in a hospital, was complications of lymphoma.</p><p>Mr. Goldberg was part of a wave of white musicians who emerged in Chicago in the 1960s — among the others were the singer and harmonica player <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/06/obituaries/paul-butterfield-whose-band-added-chicago-blues-to-rock.html" title="">Paul Butterfield</a> and the guitarist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/25/arts/the-pop-life-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-guitar-hero-by-robert-palmer.html" title="">Michael Bloomfield</a> — to create their own brand of blues-based rock.</p><p>Over the course of his career, he led a band with the guitarist and future hitmaker Steve Miller, and played on indelible recordings like Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels’ 1966 Top 10 hit<em> </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKekoNOC7m4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Devil With a Blue Dress On/Good Golly Miss Molly,”</a> as well as albums by the Byrds, Leonard Cohen and the Ramones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Relocating in San Francisco for a period in the mid-1960s, Mr. Goldberg joined with Mr. Bloomfield, a friend from high school; the singer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/arts/music/nick-gravenites-dead.html" title="">Nick Gravenites</a>, another Chicago blues devotee; and the drummer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/29/arts/music/29miles.html" title="">Buddy Miles</a>, who would later work with Jimi Hendrix, and others, to form the Electric Flag, an earthy blues-rock outfit that rode the psychedelic wave and performed at the watershed Monterey International Pop Festival in 1967.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Goldberg was one of the founders of the band the Electric Flag, which performed at the watershed Monterey International Pop Festival in 1967. “A Long Time Comin’” was the band’s first album.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Columbia</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Goldberg also made his mark as a songwriter.

The history-making set is represented in the climactic scene of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdV-Cs5o8mc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academy Award-nominated film</a> “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/movies/a-complete-unknown-review.html" title="">A Complete Unknown,”</a> starring Timothée Chalamet as Mr. Dylan. </p><p>What it all meant has been debated for 60 years.</p><p>Barry Joseph Goldberg was born on Dec. 25, 1941, in Chicago, the only child of Frank Goldberg, who owned a leather tanning factory, and Nettie (Spencer) Goldberg, a pianist and singer who performed in Yiddish theaters around the city.</p><p>In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Gail Goldberg.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Goldberg in an undated photo.

But in planning the Butterfield band’s set, Paul Rothchild, who was producing their first album, informed Mr. Goldberg that he did not want a keyboardist onstage. (Another keyboardist, Mark Naftalin, would join the band a few months later.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“And <a href="https://forward.com/culture/511700/bob-dylan-barry-goldberg-electric-newport-folk-festival-1965-bloomfield-butterfield/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that was it</a>,” Mr. Goldberg recalled in a 2022 remembrance of the event, written with Mr. Epstein, in The Forward. “In one minute, I went from having the greatest time to being completely alone and having no gig. It just destroyed me.”</p><p>Fate would turn at a party the night before Mr. Dylan’s gig, where Mr. Bloomfield and Mr. Goldberg were drafted into an impromptu backing band, along with other Butterfield sidemen. Al Kooper, who had performed the soaring organ part on Mr. Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone,” played organ; Mr. Goldberg played piano.</p><p>To Mr. Goldberg, it was a natural fit. “We were three Jewish guys from the Midwest who had similar backgrounds, similar attitudes and even the same clothes,” he recalled in The Forward. “When I met Bob at the party, he was wearing tapered pants and pointed boots, just like I was. Bob could tell we were cool, that we were at Newport to play music and not just to ‘make the scene.’”</p><p>Tremors were already felt at the soundcheck before the Dylan performance. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/arts/music/peter-yarrow-dead.html" title="">Peter Yarrow</a> of Peter, Paul and Mary, who was serving as the M.C. that evening, “kept yelling at us to turn down,” Mr. Goldberg recalled. “Every time Yarrow yelled at us, I could see Michael glaring back at him like, ‘Oh, just you wait.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Goldberg, far right, rehearsing for Bob Dylan’s performance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival with, from left, Michael Bloomfield, Mr. Dylan, Sam Lay (at the drums) and the bassist Jerome Arnold (standing).

Those who were upset presumably “felt betrayed by him,” he said. “But Bob was creating a new kind of music, and after we were done, everyone knew how special it was.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
