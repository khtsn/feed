In the midst of it all the movie was completed in Montana, with a new cinematographer and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/25/arts/rust-alec-baldwin-montana.html" title="">only fake weapons allowed on the set</a>, by a team that said it wanted to ensure that Ms. Hutchins’s final work reached the screen.</p><p>On Wednesday, the 133-minute-long film will have its world premiere at a small if starry film festival in Torun, Poland, called Camerimage, which is devoted to the art of cinematography. Here’s what to know about the unusual event.</p><h2 id="link-1b15938e">Will Alec Baldwin be there?</h2><p>Though Mr. Baldwin stars in the film, as a grizzled outlaw named Harland Rust, he is not expected to be in the audience on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The film’s main spokesman at the festival will be its director, Mr. Souza, who was injured in the shooting when the bullet passed through Ms. Hutchins and lodged in his shoulder. Mr. Souza completed the project after Ms. Hutchins’s widower, Matthew Hutchins, gave it his blessing and stepped in as an executive producer.</p><p>“It became very important to me to finish that on her behalf,” Mr. Souza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/movies/rust-premiere-camerimage-halyna-hutchins.html" title="">said in an interview</a> this year. “I would never presume to want to speak for somebody who can’t speak for themselves anymore, but I feel pretty damn confident that’s what she would have wanted.”</p><h2 id="link-293c4dc1">How did the shooting happen?</h2><p>The shooting took place on Oct. 21, 2021, on a ranch outside of Santa Fe, in a set built to look like a 19th-century western church, where the script called for Mr. Baldwin’s character to be cornered by lawmen.</p><p>Mr. Baldwin was told on the day of the shooting that the gun he was given was “cold,” meaning that it should not have been capable of firing or wounding anyone. But as they set up for a close-up of Mr. Baldwin drawing an old-fashioned revolver, the gun fired a live bullet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The movie set on a ranch outside of Santa Fe after the shooting in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jae C. Hong/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The realization that live rounds had made it onto the film set was shocking. Real ammunition was banned on the set — as is typical in Hollywood — and the armorer was supposed to load the gun with only dummy rounds, which are inert and built to resemble real rounds for the camera.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Five more live rounds were later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/movies/rust-live-ammunition.html" title="">found on the set.</a></p><h2 id="link-3ea93691">Who was held criminally responsible?</h2><p>The film’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/arts/rust-armorer-convicted-alec-baldwin-shooting.html" title="">convicted of involuntary manslaughter</a> and is serving an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/arts/hannah-gutierrez-reed-rust.html" title="">18-month prison sentence</a>. Dave Halls, the movie’s first assistant director, who was in charge of safety on set, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, avoiding prison time.</p><p>Mr. Baldwin had several reversals of fortune. He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/19/arts/rust-shooting-charges-alec-baldwin.html" title="">charged with involuntary manslaughter</a> in early 2023 but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/arts/alec-baldwin-charges-dropped-rust.html" title="">charges were dropped</a> a few months later so prosecutors could consider new evidence. He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/arts/alec-baldwin-charged-involuntary-manslaughter.html" title="">charged again</a> in early 2024 and went to trial over the summer. After a series of dramatic episodes in the courtroom, the judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/arts/rust-trial-pause-alec-baldwin-shooting.html" title="">dismissed the case against him</a>, ruling that the state had withheld evidence that could have shed light on how live rounds got onto the set.</p><h2 id="link-67069294">Why was the movie completed?</h2><p>After the death of Ms. Hutchins, a 42-year-old up-and-coming cinematographer from Ukraine, her husband and son sued the production and Mr. Baldwin, saying that the production’s lax safety protocols had led to her death.</p><p>As part of a settlement agreement, Mr. Hutchins stepped in as an executive producer. Ms. Hutchins’s husband and son will financially benefit from the movie’s release, but its theatrical distribution partner has yet to be announced.</p><p>At the time of the settlement, Mr. Hutchins <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/arts/alec-baldwin-halyna-hutchins-rust-settlement.html" title="">said in a statement</a>, “I am grateful that the producers and the entertainment community have come together to pay tribute to Halyna’s final work.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2396d1cc">How was the movie changed after the shooting?</h2><p>The plot of the western is much the same, following an orphaned 13-year-old boy (Patrick Scott McDermott) who — in an odd parallel to the real-life tragedy — accidentally shoots a rancher. He tries to escape a death sentence with his grandfather, played by Mr. Baldwin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A still from the movie “Rust,” starring Patrick Scott McDermott as a 13-year-old boy who accidentally shoots a rancher.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The production, which originally had a budget of about $6.5 million, was initially filmed on a movie ranch outside of Santa Fe. In resuming the production in Montana in 2023, with a new budget of about $8 million, Mr. Souza rewrote the script to exclude the church scene during which the fatal shooting occurred.</p><p>To maximize the amount of Ms. Hutchins’s footage in the finished production, the moviemakers puzzled together old and new footage by employing editing tricks and, in a few instances, special effects that replaced actors’ heads.</p><h2 id="link-51f4cf02">Will the Hutchins family attend the premiere?</h2><p>Mr. Hutchins and his son will not be present in Poland, said their lawyer, Brian Panish, who noted that they “support the premiere.”</p><p>There have been some tensions surrounding the production’s fulfillment of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/arts/alec-baldwin-halyna-hutchins-rust-settlement.html" title="">the 2022 settlement agreement</a>. Mr. Hutchins’s lawyers wrote in a court filing this year that the “Rust” producers were behind on some settlement payments, which the filing said should have been paid in full by June 2023. Part of the settlement is tied to earnings from the movie’s release.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The profitability of the movie will trigger the payments to the family,” said Melina Spadone, a lawyer for Rust Movie Productions, the company behind the film.</p><p>Ms. Hutchins’s parents, Olga Solovey and Anatolii Androsovych, and sister, Svetlana Zemko, have also declined to attend the premiere, said Gloria Allred, a lawyer representing them. The family filed a lawsuit against the production and Mr. Baldwin that has not yet been resolved. Ms. Allred said in a statement on Tuesday that the family saw the premiere as an exploitation of her death.</p><h2 id="link-30763266">Why else has the festival been in the news?</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/21/arts/international/camerimage-a-film-festival-where-cinematographers-are-the-stars.html" title="">Camerimage</a>, which was founded in 1993, has been battling controversy even before the “Rust” premiere. Marek Zydowicz, the festival’s director, <a href="https://www.cinematography.world/cw-024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published an essay in a cinematography magazine</a> saying that the drive for gender equality in the movie industry should not come at the expense of quality.</p><p>Female cinematographers took to social media to <a href="https://www.cinematography.world/women-in-cinematography-statement/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">express shock</a> at the essay, and the director Coralie Fargeat <a href="https://x.com/coraliefargeat/status/1857511534471295342" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pulled a screening of her hit movie</a> “The Substance.” Steve McQueen, the director of “Blitz” and “12 Years a Slave,” also withdrew from the festival, where he had been set to receive an award.</p><p>Cate Blanchett, the president of the jury at the festival’s main competition, released a statement with other jurors seeking to tamp down the dispute, saying that they “welcome the debate” about gender representation in cinematography and look forward to “meaningful discussions” at the festival.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
