The foundation has hired private contractors, including one run by a former C.I.A. officer, to secure and distribute food from four sites in areas of southern Gaza under Israeli military control.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Aid agencies have warned of a looming famine since early March, when Israel implemented a blockade on food and fuel to Gaza. That blockade has only just begun to ease.</p><p>The project’s supporters say it will enable Palestinian civilians to access food while preventing Hamas from stealing, stockpiling and even selling it at elevated prices. Critics, including the United Nations, say it is a dangerous plan that will force civilians to walk miles through Israeli military lines to find food, and likely accelerate an Israeli goal to displace people from northern to southern Gaza.</p><p>Responding to Mr. Wood’s departure, the foundation said its operations would begin without him — as soon as Monday — and would be feeding more than 1 million Palestinians, or roughly half of Gaza’s population, by the end of the week.</p><p>The group said that critics “who benefit from the status quo have been more focused on tearing this apart than on getting aid in, afraid that new, creative solutions to intractable problems might actually succeed.”</p><p>It added: “We will not be deterred. Our trucks are loaded and ready to go.”</p><p>Until his resignation, Mr. Wood had maintained that he operated independently of Israel and its interests, and had pledged in an interview with The New York Times that he would not participate in a program that enabled the displacement of civilians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Then, on Saturday, The Times and other outlets published articles that cast doubt on the project’s autonomy. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-aid-plan.html" title="">The Times found</a> that the contours of the project were first conceived in late 2023, weeks after the start of the war, by a group of Israeli officials and military officers and their partners in the Israeli business sector.</p><p>Throughout 2024, Israeli officials developed the project with private American security contractors, principally Philip F. Reilly, a former senior C.I.A. officer. By late 2024, a team led by Mr. Reilly had settled on the idea of forming a foundation to fund and hire private contractors to take over aid distribution in Gaza, according to a planning document reviewed by The Times.</p><p>Last November, representatives of Mr. Reilly started a version of the foundation, as well as the main security company that will be securing the project within Gaza.</p><p>Mr. Wood, a former U.S. Marine, was hired in early 2025 to run the project. As a co-founder of Team Rubicon, an aid organization, he had overseen humanitarian operations in scores of crisis zones over the past decade, including in Haiti, Myanmar and Sudan.</p><p>At the time of his appointment, he said in his resignation statement, the foundation was “a loose constellation of various ideas and concepts among a wide range of stakeholders and I sought to establish it as a truly independent humanitarian entity.”</p><p>Months later, Mr. Wood feels that goal is “not possible,” he said on Sunday.</p><p>“I urge Israel to significantly expand the provision of aid into Gaza through all mechanisms, and I urge all stakeholders to continue to explore innovative new methods for the delivery of aid, without delay, diversion, or discrimination,” he said.</p><p>Ronen Bergman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Natan Odenheimer<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.</p></div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
