It has taken on rivals like Zillow, the country’s largest real estate site with 160 million properties and 230 million unique monthly visitors. In the same period of time, Zillow has been engaged in its own expansion, pushing its way into the rental market, and according to the lawsuit, now has about 60,000 rental listings.</p><p>“What Zillow has not told the public,” the lawsuit reads, “is that its growth, at least in rental properties and listings, is driven in significant part by Zillow’s widespread and systematic infringement of tens of thousands of CoStar-owned real estate images.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>CoStar employs about 300 of its own real estate photographers to photograph the properties across the sites in its portfolio.</p><p>Representatives from Zillow did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the suit. The complaint was filed along with 46,979 pages of exhibits, each containing an image owned by CoStar and licensed to brokers, property owners and property managers who advertise properties on the company’s websites. The complaint also notes that the images are registered with the United States Copyright Office.</p><p>“What’s been stolen here is a lot more than just the photos,” said Andrew Florance, the CoStar founder and chief executive, in an interview. “They wanted to get into the multifamily business and they did it by using our assets and taking shortcuts.”</p><p>To compete against its rivals, CoStar has poured millions of dollars into a media blitz, including high-gloss ads for the last two Super Bowl championships.</p><p>Its legal challenge comes as real estate companies continue to sharpen their elbows in an ever-intensifying tussle over who controls home listings. A housing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/realestate/home-sales-drop-prices-rise.html" title="">market frozen</a> by high interest rates and a record lack of affordability, coupled with antitrust allegations that have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/podcasts/the-daily/housing-market-realtors-nar.html" title="">upended the way real estate agents are paid</a>, have amplified the pressure on real estate portals and brokerages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Wednesday’s filing marks the second time in five weeks that an industry heavyweight has sued Zillow. In June, they were sued by Compass, the real estate brokerage that sells more houses than any of its competitors in the United States. Compass <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/realestate/compass-zillow-lawsuit.html" title="">filed a lawsuit</a> in New York federal court claiming that Zillow was gatekeeping home listings and breaking federal antitrust laws in the process. The focus of that suit was the so-called “Zillow ban,” which requires a home that is put on the market to be listed on Zillow within 24 hours; if that deadline is not met, the listing can never be allowed on Zillow’s site.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>CoStar’s lawsuit was filed in New York, where StreetEasy, the popular New York City rental listing platform owned by Zillow, is based. Zillow’s headquarters are in Seattle, and CoStar’s are in Arlington, Va.</p><p>The back-to-back lawsuits signal increasing efforts to challenge Zillow’s dominance. According to CoStar’s complaint, Zillow profits from the use of the photographs in multiple ways, including by marketing advertising packages to property owners and managers based on listings built from the photos. Zillow also benefits by advertising properties with the photos and then allowing landlords and property managers to “claim” ownership of them, which then creates a stream of rental listings, and further income, the complaint said.</p><p>“This results in a direct source of revenue for Zillow,” the complaint reads.</p><p>Listings that use CoStar’s images have also been sent to Redfin and Realtor.com, two smaller competing real estate portals that have partnership agreements with Zillow, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Mr. Florance said he plans to add Redfin and Realtor.com as defendants if they do not remove the copyrighted photographs from their pages. A spokeswoman for Redfin declined to comment. Representatives from Realtor.com did not immediately respond.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Debra Kamin reports on real estate, covering what it means to buy, sell and own a home in America today.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
