Tennessee state troopers, trailed by federal ICE agents in unmarked cars, raced down deserted streets in this predominantly Hispanic neighborhood. “Are you in Harding? Now — this white one went back down there too.” These are volunteers from The ReMIX Tennessee, an immigrant advocacy organization. They’re trying to document and disrupt what they say is an unprecedented partnership between state troopers and ICE agents. “Yeah it’s putting a lot of fear in the community. Like, I’m having conversations with people’s families who are wanting to self-deport because they don’t want to experience, again, what they experienced.” Self-deportation is something the Trump administration has been promoting. It even began offering charter flights and money to those who choose it. On this night, 24-year-old Gisselle Huerta and 25-year-old Stephanie Alas arrive at the scene of a traffic stop. “This car is pulling in. it’s ICE.” Here you see a state trooper vehicle, and here you see an unmarked car with ICE agents standing by. “So they just pulled someone over, and we came out here and tried to figure out why. Do you need anything from us? You’re good? Yeah we’re going to wait here until they let this gentleman go, and then we’re going to follow behind them.” State troopers can’t typically enforce immigration laws, and ICE agents can’t pull over cars without probable cause or a warrant. But this new strategy, which the Highway Patrol called a cooperative public safety operation, has meant that routine traffic stops have ended in immigration arrests. That’s exactly what happened to Ana and her fiancé, who are both undocumented. She asked to remain anonymous for fear of deportation. “So when he pulls us over, I ask him, ‘Why are you pulling us over?’ And all he says is, ‘Your tints are too dark.’ He didn’t ask us for IDs. He didn’t ask us for anything regarding the car. Nothing — all he said was, ‘Turn off the car. I’ll be right back.’ Next thing you know, we’re surrounded by cars. There’s flashlights in our faces. We can’t see anything.” Ana said no citation was given and that she was taken into custody by ICE. She was held in a cell for hours. “More than 20 in each one because there’s no space. There’s only one bathroom. They start getting us processed one by one. Like it took a long time. It’s hot in there.” She was released and said she wasn’t given a reason. ICE has said they’re targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal records. But Ana’s fiancé, who has no known criminal record, was arrested. He was sent to a Louisiana detention facility. During our interview with her, he called. “My son is scared about everything that’s going on in general. He thinks I’m not going to come home from work. People are scared. Nobody wants to come out, and I get it. They’re taking anybody.” During this weeklong operation, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said it made 660 stops for traffic violations. Nearly 200 of those stops resulted in immigration arrests, and just about half of those had prior or pending criminal charges. In a statement to The Times, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said the recent operation focused solely on enforcing Tennessee traffic laws, and that immigration actions were handled separately by federal authorities. The Tennessee governor said their role was to be a partner with ICE, that the operation was an effort to remove criminals from the streets. ICE called the operation a success. “This is what I call home. I’ve been here, like I said, for 27 years, and we’ve never seen anything like this ever. What I want people to know: They’re going to another state after this.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/world/americas/ICE-NASHVILLE-V19_H/ICE-NASHVILLE-V19_H-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">In early May, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were spotted alongside Tennessee State Highway Patrol troopers in areas of Nashville, partnering up for a weeklong operation that turned routine traffic stops into immigration arrests.</span></figcaption></figure><p><time datetime="2025-05-27T04:55:04-04:00">May 27, 2025, <span>4:55 a.m. ET</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Word spread quickly through Nashville in early May: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had been spotted alongside state highway patrol officers along the southern roads where much of the city’s Latino population lives.</p><p>The outcry over the nearly 200 immigration-related arrests was fierce in Nashville, a liberal enclave in an otherwise ruby red state. But even as the city’s Democratic mayor, Freddie O’Connell, condemned what he called the operation’s “deep community harm,” it reflected how most Tennessee leaders have embraced President Trump’s crackdown on immigration.</p><p>With little official recourse, several Nashville residents and immigration advocacy groups are now acting as unofficial chroniclers of immigration activity. Among them is The ReMIX Tennessee, which set up a hotline for community members to call in and report any sign of immigration enforcement.</p><p>On social media, they also circulate warnings about where the Tennessee Highway Patrol and ICE agents have been spotted together. State troopers can make routine traffic stops. Immigration officers legally cannot without probable cause or a warrant, but together, it meant traffic stops could end in immigration arrests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Anyone who’s from Nashville knows those areas are densely immigrant, Hispanic, Latino areas,” said Cathy Carrillo, a co-founder of the organization. She added, “if we weren’t out there documenting everything that they were doing, they would be doing double what they were doing, and they would be treating people worse.”</p><p>Brian Acuna, an official in ICE’s New Orleans field office, said <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-announces-results-targeted-enforcement-operation-nashville-area" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the operation was focused</a> on “identifying and removing individuals who pose a threat to the safety and security of Tennessee residents.” While some of those detained have not been identified, the agency said that 96 of the 196 arrests had either prior convictions or pending charges.</p><p>The Tennessee Highway Patrol “categorically rejects any suggestion that our troopers engage in racial profiling or target individuals based on ethnicity, race, or national origin,” Jason Pack, a spokesman for the department said. Troopers were focused on “observed hazardous driving behavior,” conducting 660 traffic stops and 16 arrests between May 3 and May 13.</p><p>“Each stop was lawful, consistent with department policy, and conducted in accordance with the Constitution,” Mr. Pack said.</p><p>The agency is now one of more than 600 state and local agencies that have signed a formal agreement with the federal government that allows them to help with immigration enforcement.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Jenner &amp; Block: </strong>A federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-jenner-block-law-firm.html">struck down an executive order</a> that threatened penalties against the law firm, which once employed a top attorney who helped investigate the president alongside the team run by Robert Mueller, who was then the special counsel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Restricting Covid Shots: </strong>The Food and Drug Administration announced that it was likely to limit access to Covid vaccines among healthy children and adults this fall. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/health/covid-vaccine-restrictions-eligibility.html">Here’s what experts expect if the plan goes forward</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Greenhouse Gas Limits on Power Plants: </strong>The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a plan to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/climate/epa-power-plant-rules.html">eliminate all limits</a> on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The Times.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Crypto Dinner:</strong> The Times reviewed a guest list and social media posts to identify who was invited to President Trump’s private event for customers of his cryptocurrency business and a White House tour. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-crypto-dinner-attendees.html">Here are some of them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build-Out of Nuclear Power Plants:</strong> President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/climate/trump-executive-order-nuclear-power.html">accelerating the construction of the plants</a>, including a new generation of small, advanced reactors that offer the promise of faster deployment but have yet to be proven.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ignoring Economic Warning Signs: </strong>The president’s economic policy approach is so far <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/politics/trump-taxes-tariffs-economy.html">rattling markets, businesses and consumers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>MAHA Report: </strong>The G.O.P. chairmen of the House and Senate agriculture committees said they were “troubled” by the Make America Healthy Again Commission’s findings and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/republican-agriculture-pesticides-kennedy-maha-report.html">urged it to use sounder science</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Rare Check on Trump’s Actions: </strong>President Trump has suffered a string of court losses, as federal judges ruled that his administration broke the law on a number of matters. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-administration-courts-judges-law.html">But judicial orders to unwind his actions can be easier said than done</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Report on the Trump Administration</strong></p><p>Hundreds of readers asked about our coverage of the president.
