Mr. Peng rose to a level almost on par with Mount Everest’s summit and aviation flight paths. His face and body are covered in frost and ice in the video, which was originally posted to social media and later shared by Chinese state media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>According to local news media, Mr. Peng was testing equipment as part of “ground handling training” — a step that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freeflight/comments/1gs90v1/why_groundhandling_is_important_in_paragliding/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paragliders say is critical to managing safe launches</a> — at an altitude of 3,000 meters above sea level, or about 10,000 feet. But a strong wind suddenly lifted him into the sky. He could not control the glider or land as the draft grew stronger and he was pulled up above the clouds.</p><p>Mr. Peng was apparently the victim of a potentially dangerous phenomenon that paragliders call “<a href="https://oceanwingz.com/benefits-and-dangers-of-clouds-in-paragliding/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cloud suck</a>,” in which a pilot is rapidly drawn upward into a cloud. At extreme altitudes, people risk hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, because of the thin air.<span>  </span>Severe hypoxia can cause organ damage or death.</p><p>Still, Mr. Peng managed to land about 20 miles away from where he took off. In stable health and recovering from his surprise flight, he has since said, “Thinking about it still makes me quite scared,” <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202505/29/WS6837affda310a04af22c21d0.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">China Daily reported</a> on Thursday.</p><p>The local sporting authority in Gansu province said on Wednesday that Mr. Peng, who is a licensed paraglider, would be barred from the sport for six months; it also noted that flying activities at sites in the area would be suspended for an unspecified period, <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202505/29/WS6837affda310a04af22c21d0.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local news media reported</a>. But the association deemed Mr. Peng’s incident an accident, based on his statement that he did not have a flight planned and was doing ground handling training, which does not require participants to register plans in advance, the reports said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A second pilot was also banned from flying for six months, because he released footage of the incident without permission, the authority’s report said, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/sport/china/article/3312139/chinese-paraglider-cheats-death-after-flying-28000ft-handed-6-month-ban" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the South China Morning Post</a>.</p><p>Mr. Peng was not the first paraglider to accidentally reach such extreme heights.</p><p>In 2007, Ewa Wisnierska, a champion Polish paraglider who competed on the German national team, reached around 10,000 meters, or over 32,000 feet, accidentally breaking the paragliding height record on a practice flight in Australia, just days before the World Paragliding Championships. Her six-mile ascent was treacherous, and she passed out in the air, eventually landing more than 50 miles away from where she took off, on a farm.</p><p>Another paraglider who was caught in cloud suck that day did not survive.</p><p>“Today, I still fly — but just for pleasure and to give courses to the people who come to my paragliding school. Competing no longer makes any sense to me,” <a href="https://people.com/woman-survived-getting-sucked-into-storm-while-paragliding-exclusive-8699609" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ms. Wisnierska told People magazine last year</a>. “This definitely changed a lot of priorities and made me realize that there are much more important things in life than championship cups and medals. I often ask myself why was it that I survived and this other pilot did not?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ephrat Livni is a reporter for The Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/dealbook">DealBook</a> newsletter, based in Washington.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
