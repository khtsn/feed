Bywater extends beyond the historic district, but opinions on its boundaries vary, even among locals. It is made up of a colorful architectural blend of one-story shotgun houses and Creole cottages packed cozily together. Along the river, worn wharves hint at the neighborhood’s industrial past when longshoremen lived there and unloaded tropical fruit. While the makeup of the neighborhood was racially diverse, “what most folks had in common was their economic class,” as working or middle class residents, said Richard Campanella, a geographer and author with the Tulane University School of Architecture who lived in Bywater for 15 years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/19/multimedia/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/19/multimedia/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/19/multimedia/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A fancifully painted small home in New Orleans’ Bywater neighborhood is painted in fanciful hues of yellow, orange, violet and green." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/19/multimedia/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/19/multimedia/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/19/multimedia/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/19/multimedia/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc/19re-living-Bywater-New-Orleans-02-qgbc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/83493d93-f8cc-554f-91ed-39c0e4232e0f" decoding="async" width="600" height="399"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Homes decorated in vibrant hues are not uncommon in Bywater.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Through the years, Bywater’s population has been shaped by enslavement, migration and gentrification. By the late antebellum era, Black people who were free outnumbered the enslaved population by a three-to-one ratio. In the 1960s, integration of public schools triggered an exodus of white residents, and Bywater became mostly Black. In 2005, the neighborhood was largely spared the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina, and this set the stage for the area’s ongoing gentrification. In 2000, 61 percent of Bywater residents were Black and 32 percent were white. By 2023, those numbers had nearly flipped, according to census data.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><hr/><p><strong>Location: </strong>Along the left bank of the Mississippi River, east of the French Quarter and Marigny neighborhoods, from Press Street to Poland Avenue</p><p><strong>Population</strong>: 3,600 in the <a href="https://www.datacenterresearch.org/data-resources/neighborhood-data/district-7/bywater/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bywater statistical area</a>, which extends beyond the historic district (2019-2023 American Community Survey)</p><p><strong>Area: </strong>Approximately 120 blocks</p><p><strong>Housing: </strong>Shotgun houses and Creole cottages, as well as some multifamily buildings and developing housing projects</p><p><strong>The vibe: </strong>A funky, rapidly gentrifying neighborhood where dive bars and fine dining coexist, and biking with a boombox is popular.</p><hr/><p>According to <a href="https://www.datacenterresearch.org/about-us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. census data analyzed by The Data Center</a>, a New Orleans-based independent nonprofit, from 2000 and 2023, the average household income in Orleans Parish (which includes New Orleans and Bywater) rose by about 18 percent, but in Bywater alone it rose by 85 percent, reflecting the dramatic shift in the demographics of the neighborhood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>StudioBE is an art gallery in a former warehouse focused on local artists and New Orleans Black history and culture.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Prospective residents are increasingly drawn to the neighborhood’s proximity to the city’s attractions without being overrun by tourists. Today, Bywater is an enclave of young artists, service industry workers, and hipsters, and is shape-shifting once again with the arrival of new housing developments, Airbnbs, and wealthy tech investment.</p><p>“Bywater is a beautiful neighborhood, it always has been,” said artist Brandan Odums, the founder of StudioBe, an art gallery in a former warehouse that focuses on local artists and New Orleans Black culture. But Mr. Odums, also known as BMike, is conscious of how Bywater has changed.</p><p>“StudioBe is an unapologetic reminder of Black presence in the neighborhood,” he said, “and painting Black faces on the outside of the building is one way that we make sure there isn’t a complete erasure of those voices.”</p><p>Several large housing projects are moving forward. Construction is expected to begin this year on a <a href="https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/blog/2019/09/12/controversial-bywater-mixed-income-development-moving-forward/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contentious housing project, 41 Bywater</a>, with 82 affordable units.
