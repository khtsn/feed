That dude who is looking down not at a cellphone but at the Post-it note that holds the orders of his office mates. Which is confirming that you are going to be late for that next meeting, because this person plans to order six coffee beverages, each of which involves some combination of tall venti grande double-pump, one to four shots of espresso, half-caf, oat milk, nonfat milk, soy milk, milk milk, whipped cream, syrup, brown sugar, white sugar, no sugar and mocha drizzle, from the pike position with two and a half twists.</p><p>Even ordering via app has issues. There’s often a crowd waiting at the bar end because Gen Z, which tends to prefer anything but human interface, has overwhelmed the baristas with the same orders-of-magnitude drinks. Starbucks says there are more than 170,000 possible drink combinations available, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-09-20/starbucks-spends-billions-to-slash-wait-times-with-faster-orders?embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=B3uFyqJT" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outside estimates</a> have put the number at more than 300 billion. And the person in front of you always seems to be ordering 100 million of them.</p><p>If the degree of difficulty in a typical Starbucks order now seems to be Olympian, so are its troubles. The Seattle-based company has become the Boeing of coffee bars. So much so that, like the airframe maker, Starbucks has jettisoned its chief executive, Laxman Narasimhan, and replaced him with Brian Niccol, who until recently was the C.E.O. of the Chipotle Tex-Mexish food chain. Although Mr. Niccol’s appointment drove up Starbucks’s stock price, the two companies sometimes have the same problem: too many choices and not enough staff, which at peak times is almost certain to deliver disappointment as much as it does burritos or lattes.</p><p>Starbucks and every other publicly traded food and beverage franchise face the same issue: They have a roughly 1,500- to 3,000-square-foot store envelope, and they have to figure out the optimal throughput that can provide the annual sales growth that will keep Wall Street investors sated. And they are never sated.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The answer is always: Add more stuff, which creates ever more complexity, from supply chain to food safety to packaging to scheduling and delivery. Consider outfits like Pizza Hut that once sold only … pizza. Their calculation today is that they’ve got one pizza oven in each store, and they have to keep it hot through the day anyway, so they ask: What else can we run through this thing, and profitably? And oh, it has to be simple enough for teenagers to operate. That’s why pizzerias are now selling flatbreads, chocolate chip cookies, brownies and Cinnabon mini-rolls — anything that can be baked. Because you always want a Cinnabon after you’ve consumed three slices of pepperoni pizza.</p><p>Starbucks has to deal with both a complexity issue and a culture issue. Since the company went public in 1992 at $17 a share, Wall Street pressure meant adding more stores, more snacks and sandwiches and more equipment such as an oven for breakfast items and pastries. Drink variations began to expand well beyond plain coffee — hello, pistachio crème Frappuccino. The company would even add alcohol to its upscale cafes to address the evenings — a time of day that was always weak.</p><p>Howard Schultz, who essentially created the company, famously envisioned Starbucks as a “third place,” (after homes and offices) where people could gather and talk and sip. He modeled it on Milanese coffee bars. He also promised workers would get a <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/our-partner-promise-bridge-to-a-better-future/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fair wage and benefits</a>. The first Starbucks, opened at Pike Place Market in Seattle in 1971, was and is laughably simple. The décor and the menu were minimal: coffee, tea and spices. But by 1997, Starbucks was selling a variety of foods and drinks. In 2003, it went all in on customization and personalization.</p><p>Starbucks seems culturally conflicted between being the equivalent of a charging station for humans and the rest and refuge area that Mr. Schultz envisioned. Trying to do both is complex in and of itself — what kind of ad messaging do you send out, for instance? What food items do you add or delete for the grab-and-go crowd? And from afar, it can be difficult to tell which version you’re heading toward. The Starbucks near my office in Lower Manhattan has opted for the human charging station model: There are no seats in the store; just pick up your drink and go. But there are mornings when I bypass it because the line for both app-ordered and in-person orders is too long.</p><p>And while Starbucks is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-29/starbucks-wait-times-jump-after-changing-work-algorithm-staffers-say?embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=B3uFyqJT" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">using scheduling algorithms</a> to try to maximize labor efficiency, there always seems to be one fewer employee than needed. That is, unless you’re at an airport, where there are generally four fewer employees than needed.</p></div></div><div><div><p>This is a problem Starbucks shares with many companies — drugstores, cosmetics outlets, airline check-in counters — that have decided that, should the algorithm get the scheduling wrong, they would rather risk having too little labor on hand than too much. Pity that there’s no accounting entry for lost revenues from customers who walked away.</p><p>Companies have always had to deal with choice and customization versus the complexity that comes with it. In many businesses, including food and grocery, the 80/20 rule applied. You’d get 80 percent of your business from 20 percent of the product line, but it was still worth giving customers more choice to hang on to as many of them as possible. But we know that too much choice can be paralyzing.</p><p>Simplification is generally the privilege of privately held companies that do not have to answer to Wall Street’s quarterly earnings demands and, like Patagonia, are free to pursue goals beyond profits, such as sustainability. The cult fave In-N-Out Burger is a model of menu restraint, offering all of burgers, fries, shakes and drinks, as opposed to the infinite menus at McDonald’s and Burger King. And, <a href="https://www.inc.com/chrissa-olson/why-your-local-coffee-shop-looks-like-an-apple-store.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as Inc. has reported</a>, coffee shops with minimalist and welcoming vibes, such as Blank Street and Blue Mind Coffee, are gaining traction.</p><p>The newest coffee shops, ironically or not, are a lot more like Mr. Schultz’s initial sit-and-sip Starbucks than today’s corporate version. “Less is more” has been the focus for food and beverage start-ups since the McDonald brothers got going in 1948, because start-ups are typically capital constrained. Once corporate growth becomes the driver, “more is more” always takes the wheel. If you think 170,000 options for a beverage order is excessive, just wait until fall rolls around and pumpkin-spice-everything season unfolds.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
