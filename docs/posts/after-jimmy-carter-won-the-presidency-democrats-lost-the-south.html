They became one of the most loyal Republican voting blocs and remain so to this day.</p><p>That was part of a shift that had begun in the early 1960s, as Republicans found a way to chip and then blast away at what had been a solidly Democratic South since the end of Reconstruction. Southerners’ fealty to the party had been based on their appreciation for Roosevelt’s New Deal, and their bitterness over the 19th century Republicanism of Lincoln that helped erode the region’s strict racial hierarchies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Yet Mr. Carter also helped to create a model for Democratic success in a South that has become increasingly Republican‚ a model that remains workable to varying degrees today. The election of 1976 was one of a number of times that a Democratic candidate has emerged with just the right balance of rhetoric and policy promises, uniting just enough white Southern progressives and white moderates in a successful coalition with Black and other minority voters.</p><p>Mr. Carter’s home state has provided some of the best recent examples, including President Joseph R. Biden’s razor-thin victory in Georgia in November 2020 and the subsequent elections of Democratic Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
