Kursk region as it tries to sever Russian supply lines and consolidate its territorial gains, a dozen days into its startling cross-border offensive.</p><p>Analysts say the destruction of the bridge — which spanned the Seym River near the town of Glushkovo, about 10 miles west of the battle zone in Kursk — could hamper Russia’s response to the Ukrainian attack by making it harder to move troops and

Gen. Mykola Oleshchuk, the commander of Ukraine’s Air Force, posted a video on <a href="https://t.me/ComAFUA/385" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a> late Friday showing the bridge’s destruction.

</div></div><div><p>“Ukrainian pilots are conducting precision strikes on enemy strongholds, equipment concentrations, as well as on enemy logistics centers and supply routes,” General Oleshchuk said.</p></div><div><div><p>Analysts say the destruction of the Glushkovo bridge points to a commitment by Ukraine to a sustained fight in western Russia.

Seizing more land will become harder as Russian reinforcements arrive and Ukraine’s supply lines are stretched, and holding on to captured territory could expose fixed Ukrainian positions to potentially devastating Russian airstrikes.</p><p>Thibault Fouillet, the deputy director of the Institute for Strategic and Defense Studies, a French research center, said that Ukraine would need to bring in air defense and artillery weapons, organize logistical lines and replace soldiers at the new front.</p><p>“It’s not easy to open a new front and hold it,” he said.</p><p>Ukraine’s advance in the Kursk region has slowed in recent days, according to <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open-source</a> <a href="https://deepstatemap.live/en#10/51.1913939/35.3553772" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">maps of the battlefield</a> based on combat footage and satellite images. The <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-16-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Institute for the Study of War</a>, a Washington-based think tank, said on Friday that Ukraine continued to make marginal advances and that its forces were now operating inside Borki, a village about eight miles to the southeast of Sudzha.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/europe/ukraine-russia-incursion-putin.html" title="">The Russian command</a> has so far brought in reinforcements mainly from within Russia so as not to deplete its units on the Ukrainian battlefield. But Mr. Fouillet said that Moscow was taking time to deploy these additional troops, which has allowed Kyiv to strengthen its positions and take steps to disrupt the arrival of Russian reinforcements, such as destroying the Glushkovo bridge.</p><p>Russia’s Foreign Ministry <a href="https://t.me/MariaVladimirovnaZakharova/8655" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said late Friday</a> that Ukraine had destroyed the bridge using Western rockets, possibly American HIMARS, a ground-launched rocket system. The claim could not be independently confirmed, and Ukraine instead suggested that it had used fighter jets to target the bridge.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Emil Kastehelmi, a military analyst for the Finland-based Black Bird Group, which analyzes footage from the battlefield, said Ukraine had also damaged other bridges over the Seym River, although their location was unclear.</p><p>Mr. Kastehelmi <a href="https://x.com/emilkastehelmi/status/1824513779872219397" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> that if the “three bridges over Seym get completely destroyed, it could cause the Russians significant logistical issues.” He added that Russian forces had already built at least one additional temporary bridge.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><p><strong>News and Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p>After Ukraine’s push into Russia met early success, Ukraine’s forces could try advancing farther on Russian soil, or return to the front line, where Moscow is making gains. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">There are arguments for various options</a>.</p></li><li><p>Ukrainian troops took <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/europe/russia-ukraine-airfields-kursk.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">full control of the Russian town of Sudzha</a>, President Volodymyr Zelensky said, in what would be Ukraine’s first capture of a Russian urban center since its troops launched a surprise attack into the country.</p></li><li><p>A court in Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/europe/american-russia-treason.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">sentenced a dual citizen of Russia and the United States to 12 years in prison</a> on accusations that she committed treason by donating money — about $50 — for Ukraine’s armed forces.</p></li><li><p>A European arrest warrant was issued for a Ukrainian man <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/europe/nord-stream-explosion-germany-ukraine-arrest-warrant.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">suspected of involvement in blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline in 2022</a>.
