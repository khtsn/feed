Mr. Trump, the president’s middle son, is listed as one of the founders and a member of the company’s management team.</p><p>American Bitcoin was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/business/trump-bitcoin-mining.html" title="">started in late March</a>, when Mr. Trump and his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., announced that they were joining forces with a Bitcoin mining firm called Hut 8. Bitcoin mining is a vital branch of the crypto industry, in which major companies, many of them publicly traded, run energy-guzzling data centers to process Bitcoin transactions.</p><p>The move to take American Bitcoin public could pave the way for traders — including those seeking favor from President Trump — to invest in a Trump family entity, though the company said in its announcement that existing stockholders were expected to own an overwhelming majority of the company.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The business is one facet of an increasingly broad array of Trump family crypto ventures that have alarmed government ethics experts. President Trump and his sons have started a crypto firm called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html" title="">World Liberty Financial</a> that offers its own digital coin. And working with a separate set of business partners, the Trump family has marketed the digital currency $TRUMP — a type of crypto called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-crypto-coin-auction.html" title="">a memecoin</a> that is typically treated more as a novelty investment than an actual currency.</p><p>At the same time, President Trump has taken steps to advance the crypto world’s interests in Washington, ending a Biden-era enforcement campaign against crypto companies and backing legislation supported by the industry.</p><p>In an <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/681f4573943bb673e59f9531/682160f6fe86e0dfce3aa86c_American%20Bitcoin%20Public%20Listing%20Transaction%20Overview.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investor presentation posted on its website</a>, American Bitcoin aggressively promoted its connection with the Trump family, featuring a large photograph of Eric Trump near the beginning. A message next to the photo describes the company’s ambitions and links the firm to the domestic crypto industry in ways that echo the president’s messaging.</p><p>“Crypto is the future,” the message reads. “America must lead the way. American Bitcoin will set the standard.”</p><p>Among a list of key figures in the business, the presentation describes Eric Trump as a “strategic amplifier” who “drives brand equity and institutional visibility through unparalleled network reach.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Yaffe-Bellany writes about the crypto industry from San Francisco.
