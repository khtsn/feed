    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><div id="top-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-top">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p><div></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>I am putting the finishing touches on my Summer 2024 playlist. This isn’t a collection of the summer’s hottest hits, although Chappell Roan and Charli XCX did make it on there. It’s a mix of the songs that I’ve been listening to this summer, regardless of when they came out — more <a href="https://x.com/BarackObama/status/1823091727348957440" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Barack Obama</a> than Billboard.</p><p>I’ve been curating this playlist all summer, adding to it whenever I notice there’s a song or an album that I’ve been listening to again and again such that it’s becoming part of my life soundtrack. My Summer 2024 playlist is not meant to be listened to during the Summer of 2024. It’s for the Winter of 2024, or some far-off day in 2035, when I want to evoke this period of time. This period of time when I rediscovered Genesis and became convinced that their 1983 song “That’s All” might be the best song ever written. When I spent an entire month listening to only “Worth It” by Raye and “You’ll Accomp’ny Me” by Bob Seger until I knew every lyric and drumbeat and guitar riff by heart.</p><p>When I hear these songs in the future, they’ll trigger memories from this summer. I’ll be back by the lake where a duck walked right out of the water and stood by my beach chair. I’ll be sitting on the screened-in porch drinking iced coffee while the rain blows in. By making a playlist of the season, I’m delineating a chapter of my life. I’m engineering a mechanism to induce nostalgia in the future.</p><p>This dividing of life into chapters is something I’ve become more deliberate about doing as I’ve gotten older. I don’t want one season to just bleed into the next, the days losing their distinctness, vivid experiences fading as they recede into memory. Anything that can create order out of the accumulation of life lived seems useful. Sometimes I’ll just go around and take photos of my apartment so that I’ll have a record of how it looked in this moment in time: the plants and the bedsheets and the clothes piled on the chair. They’re not photos I want to look at now, but 20 years from now when I’ve forgotten about these details that are mundane but so essential to my daily life.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>My friend Grace has been making monthly playlists for the 10 years I’ve known her. She calls them her musical diary. “I don’t keep a written journal, but I can look back at the playlists and remember how I was feeling at that time, what was going on in my life: a breakup, a move, a low, a high,” she told me recently. This is what I want: reliable ways to conjure the feelings, the major and minor events.</p><p>I feel a lot of remorse around not keeping a journal, a record of my days. I kept one as a kid, but in college, I made the error of reading those cloth-covered notebooks. It was too soon — I was so embarrassed at my young self’s hopes and concerns and insights (or lack thereof) that I took the diaries and threw them in the dumpster behind my dorm. How stupid! How rash! Ever since, any effort to keep a journal has felt doomed, a stop-and-start affair that’s always tinged with anger at my college self’s impulsivity.</p><p>I like the idea of using playlists as a journal. It’s easy to do, and easy to stick with. But while I hope the songs on my playlist will evoke forgotten memories and feelings when I listen to them in the future, they’re unlikely to unleash the complicated thought processes, the quickly vanishing flashes of insight, the tiny observations that you uncover only when you actually sit down and write through them. Perhaps this weekend I’ll listen to my summer playlist and try writing out a companion journal entry, a sort of State of the Season that goes deeper into this moment than songs written by someone else ever could.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/magazine/journaling.html" title="">How to keep a journal.</a></p></li><li><p>Or consider a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/magazine/commonplace-books-recommendation.html" title="">commonplace book</a>.</p></li><li><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/at-home/newsletter.html" title="">log book</a> works, too.</p></li><li><p>In 2022, readers of The Morning made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/20/briefing/the-ultimate-summer-playlist.html" title="">a big, collaborative summer playlist</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-1439ed98"><span><strong>THE WEEK IN CULTURE</strong></span></h3><p>Music</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Liam Gallagher, left, and his brother Noel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><ul><li><p>Oasis, which broke up 15 years ago, announced a tour next summer.

These days, most nationwide releases come coated in grave dust. But few mainstream movies are as wildly singular as Tim Burton’s “Beetlejuice,” a giddy, gothic orgy of macabre imagination and morbid practical effects. Maybe its singularity will beget a decent sequel. Burton’s follow-up reunites much of the original cast — Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder, Catherine O’Hara — and adds Jenna Ortega (the star of “Wednesday”) as the daughter of Ryder’s indelible Lydia Deetz. If that doesn’t tempt you to get your fleshbags into a theater, what will?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h3 id="link-63067b6e"><span><strong>RECIPE OF THE WEEK</strong></span></h3></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Gardner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>By </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-clark" itemprop="name">Melissa Clark</a></p></div></div></div></div><h2 id="link-7f7f7464">Saffron salmon kababs</h2><p>There’s an art to grilling fish that can elude even the most seasoned home cook. How do you keep it from sticking, from overcooking, from catching on fire? Kabab it! Threading chunks of fish onto skewers makes them easy to move around the grill, and keeping the fish pieces small means they’ll cook quickly and evenly. In Naz Deravian’s Iranian <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022437-saffron-salmon-kababs?algo=identity&amp;fellback=true&amp;imp_id=8240338650604611&amp;req_id=8211560832192531&amp;surface=cooking-search-web&amp;variant=holdout_best_cooking-search" title="">saffron salmon kababs</a>, a fragrant marinade imbues salmon fillets with a tangy, spicy flavor in only 30 minutes — so you don’t need to plan much ahead. If you like, you can thread quick-cooking vegetables onto the skewers.
