He is still in Afghanistan, where he has lived in hiding since the Taliban takeover in 2021 while awaiting approval to resettle in the United States.</p><p>He had passed background checks and needed only a medical exam to finish the process, he said. But this past week, he and tens of thousands of other Afghans found their paths to the United States blocked by an executive action signed by President Trump.</p><p>The order suspended a resettlement program that brings thousands of legal refugees to the country each year. Among the many now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/world/asia/refugees-afghanistan-trump.html" title="">in limbo are Afghans who assisted the American war effort</a> and are seeking a new start and a sense of security in the United States.</p><p>Nasir, a former lieutenant colonel who asked that his full name not be used, wrote in a text message that Mr. Trump had “not only disregarded the interests of Afghans in this decision, but also failed to consider the interests of the United States.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“How can the world and America’s allies rely on the U.S. government?” he added.</p><p>The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, in place since 1980, allows legal immigration for vetted people who have fled their home countries because of persecution, war or other threats. In suspending the program, Mr. Trump said that continuing it would burden communities that were not equipped to handle refugees.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/realigning-the-united-states-refugee-admissions-program/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">order,</a> titled, “Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program,” takes effect on Monday. It says that the secretary of state and the homeland security secretary may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis, but only if they determine that it is “in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States.”</p><p>The order does not specify when the suspension will end, saying that it will continue “until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A U.S. Air Force pilot training Afghan service members in 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Denton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>At least 40,000 Afghans were pursuing resettlement in the United States before the order was issued on Monday and refugee flights were halted the next day, according to #AfghanEvac, a coalition of 250 groups working to help Afghans immigrate.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The suspension is particularly devastating for the 10,000 to 15,000 Afghans who, according to #AfghanEvac, had been fully vetted and were preparing for flights. It is also a severe blow to an estimated 200 active-duty U.S. service members who are trying to get their families out of Afghanistan.</p><p>A U.S. Army paratrooper at Fort Liberty in North Carolina, who asked to be identified by his code name, Mojo, said he had spent the past year helping his sister and her husband apply for refugee status to enter the United States from Afghanistan.</p><p>Mojo, 26, was an interpreter for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. He said he joined the U.S. Army two years ago after leaving Afghanistan in 2021 under a program that grants visas to Afghans who directly served the U.S. military or government.</p><p>His sister and brother-in-law, both physicians, are in hiding, fearing retribution from the Taliban because of Mojo’s military service, he said. They recently completed the lengthy refugee vetting process and were approved to resettle in the United States, he said. All that remained was to arrange a flight out of Afghanistan.</p><p>“We were so close to bringing them to safety — and suddenly it all got shut down,” Mojo said by phone from Fort Liberty, formerly known as Fort Bragg, where he serves in the 82nd Airborne Division.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When his sister heard the news, Mojo said, “she started crying — and I started crying with her.”</p><p>Shawn VanDiver, the president of #AfghanEvac, called the executive order a betrayal of Afghans who supported the U.S. government or military.</p><p>“Everyone is frozen in place — it’s heartbreaking,” he said in a phone interview.</p><p>Among those thrust into uncertainty are former members of the Afghan military and security forces, as well as judges and lawyers involved in prosecutions of Taliban members. Some of the judges and lawyers are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/world/asia/afghan-judges-women-taliban.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">women</a>, who have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/europe/icc-afghanistan-leader-women.html" title="">persecuted by the Taliban</a>.</p><p>Mr. VanDiver said that suspending the resettlement program did not address the problem of illegal entry by migrants at the southern U.S. border — a focus of Mr. Trump’s campaign. Individuals in the program cannot apply by themselves, but must be referred by U.S. government agencies or designated nongovernmental partners.</p><p>“Failing to protect our Afghan allies sends a dangerous message to the world: that U.S. commitments are conditional and temporary,” Mr. VanDiver said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, in his home office on Saturday in San Diego.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ariana Drehsler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Hundreds of thousands of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/world/asia/pakistan-afghanistan-refugees.html" title="">Afghans who fled</a> after the Taliban takeover landed in neighboring Pakistan.

Biden Jr. revived the program, admitting 100,000 refugees last year, the most in three decades.</p><p>The program requires applicants to undergo a demanding <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-and-asylum/usrap" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">screening process</a> that includes background checks by the F.B.I. and other agencies, biometric screenings, medical exams, interviews and multiple security reviews.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Waiting to board planes in Kabul in August 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.
