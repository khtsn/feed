</span> all making their mark. With seeding for the playoffs slowly starting to crystalize, teams are hoping to fix their errors from earlier in the year or try to keep up momentum with the goals of reaching <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/champions-tour-2025-masters-toronto" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>. </p>

<p>Here is a rundown of how all the week three matches went in VCT China:</p>



<p>Only two matches in week three went to three maps, and one of them was an interesting bout between DRG and EDG. The main interest came out of a new addition to the EDG roster, as <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/51244/jieni7">
		Jieni7	</a>
</span> made his VCT debut, replacing <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13768/s1mon">
		S1Mon	</a>
</span> in the roster. It was another close win for EDG, and while they are still clearly a top team regionally, the team is showing weaknesses weeks into the regular season.</p>

<p>Other notable wins included Ascension winners Xi Lai Gaming sweeping the surging Wolves Esports, barely jumping above them in the Group Omega standings, as well as Nova Esports sweeping FunPlus Phoenix for the latter teams&#39; first loss in Stage 1. With these results, there are seven different teams with a 2-1 record, marking only one undefeated team: Bilibili Gaming.</p>

<p>The fact that Bilibili Gaming is the only undefeated team left in China is a little questionable, but they have shown resilience in the early matches of regular season play. Not only is their win over All Gamers their first sweep of Stage 1, but they had the standout performance of the week with <span data-ref-id="18">

</span>. He had an average performance last week, but this match against All Gamers was his playground. Ending this week with a match rating of 1.73, a 91% KAST, and 46 kills over two dominant maps, both his Yoru and Neon play were elite.</p>

<p>With week three over, the overall group standings shifted minimally, but Nova Esports moved to the top of Group Alpha while Bilibili took the top slot of Group Omega. Dragon Ranger Gaming moved out of the top four of Group Alpha due to Titan Esports Club overtaking them. Plus, due to their record and map differential, Bilibili Gaming was the first team to qualify for the Stage 1 playoffs.</p>
