The judge, John Coughenour, sided with states that had sued Trump arguing that the president’s order violated the 14th Amendment. “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,” he said today. </p><p>“Frankly,” Judge Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, added, “I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar would state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It just boggles my mind.”</p><p>The order to end birthright citizenship, set to take effect on Feb. 20, also extends to babies born to mothers who are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/birthright-citizenship-visa-holders.html" title="">in the country legally but temporarily</a>, such as tourists, university students or temporary workers.</p><p>The judge’s injunction, which lasts two weeks, marks the beginning of what will almost certainly be a long battle between the new administration and the courts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-pardons-jan-6-day-1.html" title="">over Trump’s ambitious second-term agenda</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-7488319e">The Senate pushed Hegseth toward approval</h2><p>The vast majority of Senate Republicans voted today <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/hegseth-defense-secretary.html" title="">to advance Pete Hegseth’s nomination</a> as secretary of defense. His final confirmation vote in the Senate is expected tomorrow evening.</p><p>Every single Democrat in the Senate voted against Hegseth, some citing a sworn statement from his former sister-in-law calling him “abusive.” Hegseth has denied the account, along with several other allegations of misconduct.</p><p>Just two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined the Democrats in opposition to Hegseth. Murkowski said that she could not “in good conscience” support installing him at the Pentagon. Two more Republicans would need to oppose Hegseth in order to sink his nomination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Purdue Pharma’s headquarters in Stamford, Conn.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.

New York’s attorney general hailed the deal, but thousands of other claimants would still need to sign on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Javier Jaén</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-4c38b8e3">A start-up said its device could cure cancer.
