She wasn’t on social media. No one except her friends and family knew she had an orange Louise Brooks bob and a penchant for round John Lennon sunglasses.</p><p>But by Thursday, as Ms. Pelicot stood with her head held high in a courtroom in Avignon, France, as the verdicts in the harrowing four-month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/europe/france-husband-rape-drug-trial-mazan.html" title="">rape trial</a> of her ex-husband and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/france-mass-rape-pelicot.html" title="">50 other men</a> were read, she had become the image of bravery across the globe.</p><p>Her face has stared out from posters in protests across France and been pasted on the sides of buildings. It graced the digital cover of Vogue Germany and was used on a mock cover of Time’s <a href="https://www.journaldequebec.com/2024/12/16/gisele-pelicot-comme-personne-de-lannee-du-magazine-time-a-la-place-de-trump-un-montage-photo-viral-sur-les-reseaux" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">person of the year</a> issue. It has become the symbol of her own horrific experience, of course, but also that of every woman who was rendered helpless, lied to and abused. As one of her lawyers, Stéphane Babonneau, said, Ms. Pelicot’s face, with its seeming lack of artifice, has become the physical expression of the fact that “the shame has switched sides.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Pelicot on the digital cover of Vogue Germany.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cecilia Lundgren/Vogue Germany</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Rarely has someone who was so literally objectified — turned into a rag doll for men to violate as they saw fit — been able to so fully take back control of her own objectification and turn it into a picture of empowerment.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In this, Ms. Pelicot’s image has become one in a long line of images that have transcended a unique story to become visual shorthand for a collective turning point.
