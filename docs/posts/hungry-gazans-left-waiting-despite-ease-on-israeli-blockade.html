But the United Nations has so far been unable to move any trucks from Kerem Shalom to warehouses inside Gaza, according to two U.N. officials, who requested anonymity to share sensitive details.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said on Tuesday that U.N. teams had waited for several hours for Israeli permission to head to the crossing. But they were unable to “secure the arrival” of those supplies to aid warehouses, <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2025/db250510.doc.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a> at a news conference.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A torn W.F.P. banner is seen on the outside of a shuttered building." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw/21int-gaza-aid-02-hvcw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/dd45fd75-0f30-5c29-9843-c34c0096c477" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A shuttered bakery in Gaza City on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Awad said he and others had been informed by the United Nations that some shipments of flour might arrive on Wednesday. But even if they did, it would only be a dent the daily hunger that became widespread in Gaza under the Israeli blockade.</p><p>“Even if we get some flour today, it seems we won’t have anything close to what’s needed to feed people,” Mr. Awad said.</p><p>In the meantime, Palestinians reeling from Israel’s two-month ban on food, fuel and other supplies have been left waiting. The delays suggested that distributing aid across Gaza was likely to take time, even as Israel threatens a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-ground-offensive.html" title="">major ground offensive</a> that could upend the process.</p><p>“Today we will mostly eat lentils, or pasta,” Riyadh al-Housari, a 25-year-old in Gaza City, said in a phone interview. “We eat one meal in the late afternoon. It is one meal and there is no other.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Israel’s blockade has rendered the situation so dire that Gazans are at “critical risk of famine,” a panel of U.N.-backed experts <a href="https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Gaza_Strip_Acute_Food_Insecurity_Malnutrition_Apr_Sept2025_Special_Snapshot.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said earlier this month</a>. They projected that tens of thousands of children could suffer from acute malnutrition if the restrictions continued. Israel <a href="https://gaza-aid-data.gov.il/media/rjtbf0th/response-to-ipc-snapshot-may-2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a> the report was based on faulty data and assumptions.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced people sheltering at a school in Gaza City on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The spiraling humanitarian crisis in Gaza has ignited growing international opprobrium against the Israeli campaign against Hamas. Even Israel’s allies — which offered vigorous support after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks started the war — have voiced frustration and even anger over the conflict and its cost to ordinary Palestinians.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/world/middleeast/israel-allies-denounce-gaza-offensive.html" title="">Britain, France, and Canada</a> denounced the Israeli blockade and planned ground offensive in unusually stark and harsh terms, labeling them “disproportionate” and “egregious.” On Tuesday, the British government said it was suspending negotiations on expanding the countries’ free-trade agreement in protest.</p><p>The Israeli ban on humanitarian aid began in early March, as the initial phase of a two-month cease-fire between Israel and Hamas ended. Both sides were supposed to be negotiating the next steps in the truce. Israeli officials argued the restrictions aimed to pressure Hamas to compromise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The impact on ordinary Gazans was immense: Aid organizations <a href="https://wck.org/news/gaza-update-5-7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended their operations</a> as food stockpiles <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-runs-out-food-stocks-gaza-border-crossings-remain-closed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dwindled</a>, and the price of food skyrocketed. In late March, Israel ended the truce with a massive bombardment and resumed its offensive against Hamas in Gaza.</p><p>By May, relief officials were warning that widespread hunger had become a daily reality. But for weeks, Israel refused to allow aid agencies to resume operations unless they agreed to new Israeli conditions, purportedly to prevent supplies from falling into Hamas’s hands.</p><p>Israeli leaders publicly insisted that Gaza still had plentiful stockpiles of food. But behind closed doors, some military officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/gaza-famine-starvation-israel.html" title="">privately concluded</a> that Palestinians there could face starvation within weeks.</p><p>Even the United States — one of Israel’s most stalwart supporters throughout the conflict — began suggesting that the humanitarian crisis was spiraling out of control. Last week, President Trump said that “a lot of people are starving” in the Gaza Strip and that the United States was working to alleviate the situation.</p><p>The Israeli authorities relented on Sunday night, announcing that they would begin allowing in small amounts of food.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Aid trucks on the road to the Kerem Shalom crossing near the Israeli-Gaza border on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Cohen/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Without any new aid having actually arrived, many in Gaza are trying to make whatever provisions they have last as long as possible. “We don’t plan meals anymore. We just work with whatever we can find,” said Sabah ِAbu al-Roos, 63, in the central city of Deir al-Balah.</p><p>Produce like eggplants and tomatoes are often hawked at eye-watering prices, according to several Gazans. Ms. Abu al-Roos said that one vendor in a local street market had been selling a single onion for $8.50.</p><p>Iman Jundiyeh, a mother of four in Gaza City, said she could only dream of the regular meals she used to enjoy before the war — fragrant sliced lamb; chicken, potatoes and rice; and maftoul, a kind of Palestinian couscous.</p><p>She now relies almost exclusively on soup kitchens run by charities that still manage to stew pots of lentils and other staples for crowds of displaced Palestinians. Everything else is either unavailable or too expensive, she said.</p><p>“Just yesterday, my son begged me for watermelon,” said Ms. Jundiyeh. “I started to cry with him.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lining up for a free meal in Gaza City.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Ameera Harouda<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
