    <h1>Biden Administration Running Out of Time to Send Allocated Aid to Ukraine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The official said that the North Koreans were not battle-hardened and that Ukraine had struck their command and control sites as well as infantry positions.</p><p>Both officials were authorized to speak to reporters only on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said earlier this week that the Defense Department had seen “indications” that the North Korean forces sent to Russia had suffered their first casualties.</p><p>The first official said on Tuesday that the administration would use some of the $5.6 billion, all of which remains in presidential drawdown authority. That allows the administration to transfer Pentagon stocks to Ukraine instead of waiting the months or years it can take for defense contractors to manufacture weapons under new contracts.</p><p>“We will continue to do drawdown packages for the remainder of this administration,” she said. “But $5.6 billion is a substantial amount of authority, so I would certainly anticipate that there could be remaining authority that would transition and be available for the next administration to use.”</p><p>The first official said Tuesday that the administration would probably use all of the $1.2 billion that remains in the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which allows Kyiv to purchase goods directly from the defense industry.</p></div></div>
