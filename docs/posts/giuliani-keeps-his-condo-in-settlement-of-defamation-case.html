Giuliani has reached a settlement with two Georgia election workers who he repeatedly, and falsely, claimed had helped to steal the 2020 election.</p><p>The former mayor of New York was at risk of losing millions of dollars worth of personal mementos, valuables and real estate that he had gathered over his decades practicing law and then in public office. He had previously been ordered to pay down some $11 million of a $148 million judgment he owed the election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, who he claimed had manipulated ballots.</p><p>The full details of the settlement have yet to be released, but a letter signed by both sides in the case said that, once certain conditions were met, it would result “in the conclusion of all litigation.”</p><p>Mr. Giuliani declared victory and said he was going to hang onto all of a treasure trove of items that included a 10-room apartment on the Upper East Side, a vintage Mercedes-Benz convertible and a signed Joe DiMaggio jersey.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The plaintiffs said through their legal team that they had agreed to allow Mr. Giuliani to retain his property and other belongings in exchange for an undisclosed amount of compensation and his promise not to defame the women again.</p><p>“The past four years have been a living nightmare. We have fought to clear our names, restore our reputations and prove that we did nothing wrong,” the women said in the statement. “Today is a major milestone in our journey. We have reached an agreement and we can now move forward with our lives.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
