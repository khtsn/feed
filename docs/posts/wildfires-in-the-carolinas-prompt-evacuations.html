Tryon’s population is about 1,500, and Saluda’s less than 1,000.</p><p>The county said on social media that the Tryon brush fire was spreading rapidly and that multiple fire departments had been mobilized.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A brush fire along the South Carolina coast was threatening Carolina Forest, S.C., just west of Myrtle Beach. That fire was 75 percent contained as of early Saturday night, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission.</p><p>“Crews are continuing to work toward the containment of this fire,” the Horry County Fire Rescue, which is leading efforts to fight the fire, said on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1ADupKboKr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a> on Saturday evening. Several neighborhoods in Carolina Forest were under an evacuation order.</p><p>Another fire broke out near Six Mile, S.C., a rural town about 30 miles west of Greenville. County officials there had recommended evacuations along several streets but, as of Saturday evening, no evacuations had been ordered.</p><p>The fires ignited while a large portion of the southeastern United States was under a <a href="https://www.weather.gov/fire/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">red-flag warning</a>, an alert from the National Weather Service indicating a high risk of fires.</p><p>Gusty winds, dry air and afternoon high temperatures in the low 70s helped fuel the rapid spread of the fires.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Another factor: South Carolina had unusually low rainfall in February, and the vegetation is dry. For instance, Myrtle Beach, S.C., has recorded 2.30 inches of rain since Jan. 1, compared with 6.30 inches of rain that is considered normal for this time of year. North Carolina was a bit wetter last month, though it also received below-average rainfall.</p><p>The fire risk is expected to decrease overnight as winds ease. The red flag warnings were set to expire at 10 p.m. on Saturday.</p><p>Claire Fahy<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
