Most of those warnings expired late Saturday night, and the fire risk was expected to decrease overnight as winds eased.</p><p>On Saturday afternoon, a brush fire in the mountains was threatening Tryon and Saluda, small communities in the Blue Ridge Mountains, about 40 miles south of Asheville, N.C.</p><p>Polk County officials said multiple fire departments were responding to a blaze threatening Meadowlark Drive in Tryon, which was evacuated. Tryon’s population is about 1,500, and Saluda’s less than 1,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The county said on social media that the Tryon brush fire was spreading rapidly.</p><p>A brush fire along the South Carolina coast was threatening Carolina Forest, just west of Myrtle Beach. That fire was 75 percent contained as of early Saturday night, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission.</p><p>“Crews are continuing to work toward the containment of this fire,” the Horry County Fire Rescue, which is leading efforts to fight the fire, said on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1ADupKboKr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a> on Saturday evening. Several neighborhoods in Carolina Forest were under an evacuation order.</p><p>Another fire broke out near Six Mile, S.C., a rural town about 30 miles west of Greenville. County officials there had recommended evacuations along several streets but, as of Saturday evening, no evacuations had been ordered.</p><p>Gusty winds, dry air and afternoon high temperatures in the low 70s helped fuel the rapid spread of the fires.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Another factor: South Carolina had unusually low rainfall in February, and the vegetation is dry. For instance, Myrtle Beach, has recorded 2.30 inches of rain since Jan. 1, compared with 6.30 inches of rain that is considered normal for this time of year. North Carolina was a bit wetter last month, though it also received below-average rainfall.</p><p>Claire Fahy<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
