They were supposed to negotiate terms for the full truce during the first stage, which lasted six weeks.</p><p>Last weekend, the six weeks elapsed with little apparent success toward that goal, despite efforts by Qatar and Egypt, who have been mediating the talks.

He has been far more reluctant to declare an end to Israel’s war against Hamas while the group remains <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israel-cease-fire.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">firmly entrenched in Gaza</a>.</p><p>As the first phase of the cease-fire expired, Mr. Netanyahu said that Israel had accepted a new proposal pitched by Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East envoy. That plan breaks significantly with the truce signed in mid-January.</p><p>Under the new proposal, Israel would immediately get half of the remaining hostages back in exchange for another 50 days of a “temporary cease-fire.” During that time, Israel and Hamas would continue talks over a permanent end to the war.</p><p>The remaining hostages would be released “if we reach an agreement on a permanent cease-fire,” Mr. Netanyahu said.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff’s proposal would effectively allow Israel to get more hostages back without giving Hamas any of its core demands. The Palestinian armed group has called on Israel and the United States to carry out the January deal as written, appearing to rule out the deal as a non-starter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But at the same time, Mr. Trump has issued proposals that have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/world/middleeast/arab-nations-reject-trump-evacuate-gaza.html" title="">rattled the region</a>, including urging the permanent displacement of Gaza’s Palestinian residents and a U.S.-led takeover of the territory. He has also issued ultimatums to Hamas to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/politics/trump-hostages-hamas.html" title="">return all of the hostages immediately</a>, a demand that contradicts the staggered releases prescribed by the cease-fire agreement.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Trump issued a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/world/middleeast/trump-hamas-warning-hostages-gaza.html" title="">last warning</a>” to Hamas on social media, calling on the armed group to immediately return the remaining hostages “or it is OVER for you.”</p><p>“I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say,” Mr. Trump wrote.</p><p>Hamas said that Mr. Trump’s threats were encouraging Israel to avoid negotiating an end to the war. “The language of threats does not intimidate us; it only complicates matters further,” Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas official, <a href="https://t.me/ALAQSA_LIVE/170088" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> posted on a Hamas-affiliated Telegram channel.</p><p>On Thursday, speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr. Witkoff said that President Trump is intent on securing the release of Edan Alexander, an American hostage who was serving in the Israeli military when he was captured. Mr. Alexander is believed to be the last living American hostage in Gaza. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Edan Alexander is very important to us. He is injured and he is a top priority,” Mr. Witkoff said, adding that the president wants Hamas to release Mr. Alexander to show it is serious about negotiations. </p><h2 id="link-3db9153f">The Trump administration is also talking to Hamas.</h2><p>Over the past week, Mr. Trump’s administration held <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/middleeast/us-hamas-hostage-talks-gaza.html?searchResultPosition=7" title="">intensive and secret direct meetings</a> with Hamas aimed at securing the release of American citizens seized during the October 2023 attack.</p><p>The meetings leapfrogged the seemingly moribund cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas. They also broke with the longstanding U.S. approach toward Hamas, which sought to isolate the Palestinian armed group through a “no-contact” policy.</p><p>Critics had long argued that not engaging with Hamas over the years had produced few tangible results. In practice, the United States wound up dealing with the group anyway, typically through mediators like Qatar and Egypt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Adam Boehler, Mr. Trump’s nominee to be a special envoy for hostage affairs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/middleeast/us-hamas-hostage-talks-gaza.html" title="">met Hamas officials</a> in Doha, Qatar, this week, according to a diplomat familiar with the talks.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yael Alexander, holding a poster of Edan Alexander, her son, at a rally in Tel Aviv last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maya Alleruzzo/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The negotiations focused on freeing Mr. Alexander and securing the release of the bodies of four other U.S.-Israeli dual citizens who were kidnapped and taken to Gaza in the October 2023 attack, officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/middleeast/us-hamas-hostage-talks-gaza.html" title="">told The New York Times</a>.</p><p>One of those is Itay Chen, 19, an American-Israeli soldier.
