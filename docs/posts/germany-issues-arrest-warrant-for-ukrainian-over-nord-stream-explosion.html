    <h1>Germany Issues Arrest Warrant for Ukrainian Over Nord Stream Explosion</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sweden and Denmark had both opened investigations into the blasts, but closed them earlier this year.</p><p>The German authorities, however, continued their investigation into the explosions, which rendered three of the four strands that make up Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines inoperable. Even before the blasts, though, Russia had severely curtailed the amount of natural gas it was sending to Germany via Nord Stream 1, citing problems with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/business/germany-russia-gazprom-pipeline.html" title="">turbine that had been sent to Canada</a> for repairs. Nord Stream 2 had never come online.</p><p>Experts have said that divers could have been responsible for planting the explosives on the subsea pipes, and German news reports identified Volodymyr Z. as a professional diver. When the <a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2024-07/nordstream-anschlag-ermittlungen-festnahme" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Süddeutsche Zeitung</a> newspaper reached a man who identified himself by that name by telephone, he denied having any involvement with the attacks or knowing about the warrant.</p><p>A person briefed on the matter confirmed that German prosecutors had issued a warrant for a Ukrainian diver believed to be a member of the team that planted explosives on the pipelines. The diver was living in Poland but was able to escape before being apprehended, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss an ongoing investigation.</p><p>The Süddeutsche, along with the Die Zeit newspaper and the German public broadcaster ARD, reported that the German authorities had tracked down the suspect after a speed camera recorded a van with Ukrainian license plates on the northeastern German island of Rügen on Sept. 8, 2022.</p><p>One of the passengers in the van was the suspect sought by German prosecutors, according to the German media outlets. The suspect lived in a suburb of Warsaw and worked as an instructor for a diving school in Kyiv, the media outlets reported. </p><p>Anatol Magdziarz<!-- --> contributed reporting from Warsaw.</p></div></div>
