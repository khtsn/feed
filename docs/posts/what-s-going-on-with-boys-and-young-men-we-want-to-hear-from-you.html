We won’t publish any part of your response without following up with you first, verifying your information and hearing back from you. And we won’t share your contact information outside the Times newsroom or use it for any reason other than to get in touch with you.</p><p>The open-ended questions are optional — feel free to answer whichever feel relevant to you.
