Israel has barred any humanitarian aid to Gaza in an effort to press Hamas to surrender, leading to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/world/europe/israel-gaza-blockade-humanitarian-crisis.html" title="">“catastrophic” shortages of food, water and medicine</a>, the U.N. said.</p><p>An Israeli spokesman said the offensive would aim to increase pressure on Hamas to release the hostages and to destroy all of the group’s infrastructure. Officials said it would start slowly ahead of President Trump’s trip next week to the region. Cease-fire negotiations are ongoing, but the officials said that if a deal is not reached soon, the expanded ground operation would commence in earnest.</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>Israeli fighter jets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/middleeast/israel-yemen-houthis-tel-aviv.html" title="">bombed Yemen today</a> after Houthi militants fired a missile that landed near Israel’s main airport.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-28cbf24d">Trump offered money to migrants who deport themselves</h2><p>In an effort to ramp up deportations, the Trump administration has begun to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-immigrant-deportation-payments.html" title="">offer $1,000 and a flight home</a> to any undocumented immigrant who agrees to willingly leave the U.S. Already, one migrant from Honduras has taken up the offer.</p><p>The program is the latest effort by the administration to encourage migrants to “self deport,” which officials consider cheaper and easier than arresting, detaining and flying people out of the country.</p><p><strong>In other immigration news, </strong>the administration is in talks with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/africa/rwanda-trump-deportees.html" title="">Rwanda to accept U.S. deportees</a>.

The 12-member panel will be confronted with the question of whether Combs led a typical celebrity entourage or, as prosecutors will argue, a criminal enterprise that enabled years of sexual exploitation and other crimes.</p><p>The government says employees set up hotel rooms, procured drugs and arranged for male prostitutes ahead of “drug-fueled coercive sex marathons.” Testimony is expected to take two months.
