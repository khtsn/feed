And it underscored a steep challenge they face as they try to put together consequential legislation aimed at cutting taxes, slashing spending and cracking down on immigration that he has demanded.</p><p>During his first term, Mr. Trump functioned less as a coach calling plays and more as a cantankerous owner demanding that his team throw out the entire playbook in the fourth quarter. In 2018, he threatened to veto a spending bill passed by a Republican-controlled Congress, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/trump-veto-spending-bill.html" title="">only to relent</a>. Months later, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/politics/trump-immigration-compromise.html" title="">threatened to veto an immigration bill</a> backed by the speaker at the time, Paul D. Ryan, only to have his aides walk the comments back. In 2020, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/us/politics/trump-veto-threat-stimulus-package.html" title="">said he would veto</a> a $900 billion Covid relief and government funding bill, but signed it days later.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
