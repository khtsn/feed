Kennedy Jr. is expected to end his troubled independent presidential campaign on Friday, according to three people briefed on his plans, and has been in talks to throw his support behind former President Donald J. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s campaign said this week that he intended to address his “path forward” in a speech from Phoenix. Mr. Trump is expected to hold a rally later in the day in nearby Glendale, Ariz.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Kennedy filed paperwork to withdraw from the ballot in Arizona, a spokesman for the secretary of state’s office there said. It could not immediately be determined if the campaign was taking similar steps in other states.</p><p>But lawyers for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also filed papers in federal court in New York on Thursday seeking to block the enforcement of a court decision that disqualified Mr. Kennedy from the state’s ballot. His lawyers also now seek to broaden a federal lawsuit he filed in May about his ballot application to argue that New York’s ballot requirements are unconstitutional.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The three people briefed on Mr. Kennedy’s plans emphasized that nothing was final, and that the iconoclastic Mr. Kennedy could still change his mind, but said that plans were in the works for him to appear alongside Mr. Trump on Friday. Some people close to Mr. Kennedy were still arguing forcefully against an endorsement, according to two of the people.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s backing of Mr. Trump would be the culmination of weeks of discussions, brokered by high-level intermediaries, between the two men, which began in July just before the Republican National Convention.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s departure from the race would be the end of one of the more bizarre third-party presidential bids in modern American history, and it would remove an unpredictable element that could have tipped the outcome of the race. His endorsement of Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, would be a stunning turn for a scion of one of America’s most storied Democratic families.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy spent much of his career working as an environmental lawyer but became known in recent years for his opposition to vaccines and for his promotion of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/us/politics/rfk-conspiracy-theories-fact-check.html" title="">conspiracy theories</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-twitter-2024.html" title="">right-wing misinformation</a>. Many members of the Kennedy family <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/us/politics/kerry-kennedy-rfk.html" title="">condemned his</a> candidacy and took to the campaign trail this year to support President Biden’s re-election.</p><p>In recent weeks, as his campaign’s money ran low, Mr. Kennedy’s support in national polls, once in the low double digits, plunged to about 5 percent. It was nowhere near sufficient to have a shot at victory, but still enough to potentially affect the results of the election, depending on his numbers in key swing states.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Kennedy began running for president last year as a Democrat, challenging Mr. Biden. He later embarked instead on an independent campaign that unnerved both major parties, which feared that he would siphon critical support from their candidate.</p><p>His campaign has in recent months become focused almost singularly on the costly effort of securing ballot access in all 50 states. As of earlier this week, the campaign was on the ballot in 19 states — including the swing states of Michigan and North Carolina — and had submitted ballot access applications in more than a dozen more. Some of those applications had been challenged by the Democratic Party and its allies, leading to legal battles.</p><p>The campaign’s move to withdraw the Arizona application came less than a week after a supporter dropped off 110,000 signatures with the secretary of state’s office in Phoenix. The New York Times reported that those signatures appeared to have been provided by a pro-Kennedy super PAC that gathered the signatures last winter, an arrangement that would have exposed the campaign to legal challenges.</p><p>Indeed, on Friday, Lis Smith, a strategist for the Democratic National Committee, said the party’s lawyers had already reviewed the signatures in Arizona and found that the vast majority had been collected when the PAC was active.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Rebecca Davis O’Brien covers campaign finance and money in U.S. elections.
