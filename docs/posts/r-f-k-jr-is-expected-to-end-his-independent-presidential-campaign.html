    <h1>R.F.K. Jr. Is Expected to End his Independent Presidential Campaign</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The three people briefed on Mr. Kennedy’s plans emphasized that nothing was final, and that the iconoclastic Mr. Kennedy could still change his mind, but said that plans were in the works for him to appear alongside Mr. Trump on Friday. Some people close to Mr. Kennedy were still arguing forcefully against an endorsement, according to two of the people.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s backing of Mr. Trump would be the culmination of weeks of discussions, brokered by high-level intermediaries, between the two men, which began in July just before the Republican National Convention.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s departure from the race would be the end of one of the more bizarre third-party presidential bids in modern American history, and it would remove an unpredictable element that could have tipped the outcome of the race. His endorsement of Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, would be a stunning turn for a scion of one of America’s most storied Democratic families.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy spent much of his career working as an environmental lawyer but became known in recent years for his opposition to vaccines and for his promotion of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/us/politics/rfk-conspiracy-theories-fact-check.html" title="">conspiracy theories</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-twitter-2024.html" title="">right-wing misinformation</a>. Many members of the Kennedy family <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/us/politics/kerry-kennedy-rfk.html" title="">condemned his</a> candidacy and took to the campaign trail this year to support President Biden’s re-election.</p><p>In recent weeks, as his campaign’s money ran low, Mr. Kennedy’s support in national polls, once in the low double digits, plunged to about 5 percent. It was nowhere near sufficient to have a shot at victory, but still enough to potentially affect the results of the election, depending on his numbers in key swing states.</p></div></div>
