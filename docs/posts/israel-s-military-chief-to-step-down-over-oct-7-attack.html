Gen. Herzi Halevi, announced on Tuesday that he would resign in early March, citing in part the military’s failure while under his command to protect Israelis from the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>The heavy toll of the Hamas attacks — 1,200 dead in Israel and 250 taken hostage to Gaza — had long prompted an expectation in Israel that at least some of the country’s leaders would ultimately resign. Only a handful have done so, in part because Israel has since faced an unprecedented war, and General Halevi is the highest-ranking military leader to step down so far.</p><p>“My responsibility for the terrible failure accompanies me every day, every hour and will for the rest of my life,” he said in a letter announcing his resignation.</p><p>General Halevi resigned just three days after Israel and Hamas began a 42-day <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/world/europe/gaza-war-fighting-ceasefire-hamas-israel.html" title="">truce</a>, the first phase of a cease-fire and hostage release deal. On Sunday, Hamas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/world/middleeast/what-we-know-hostage-release.html" title="">released</a> three women hostages for 90 Palestinians jailed by Israel, mostly women and minors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has rebuffed calls to step down over the attack, saying only that he would have to answer “difficult questions” after the war, like everybody else. He has given no suggestion that will change because of the truce with Hamas, which mediators hope will ultimately put an end to the war.</p><p>Over the past 15 months, General Halevi, who assumed the role in early 2023, has overseen the Israeli military through the war in Gaza, a ground invasion of Lebanon, military operations in Syria and strikes in Iran.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
