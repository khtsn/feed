It can be fatal.</p><p>Most outbreaks stem from homemade products, rather than from commercially manufactured ones.<strong> </strong>Improperly home-canned or fermented food can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. If in doubt about whether home-canned food is safe to eat, you should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/prevention/home-canned-foods.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">throw it out</a> rather than taste it, the C.D.C. says.</p><p>Signs of contamination include containers that are leaking or damaged, or that spurt liquid or foam when opened. Other signs of contamination include discoloration, mold or bad odor from the food. The C.D.C. recommends refrigerating canned or pickled foods after opening them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-5858c31c">How common are botulism outbreaks?</h2><p>Outbreaks are rare but can be life-threatening. In 2023, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/world/europe/france-botulism-sardines.html" title="">a woman in France died</a> and at least a dozen other people became ill with botulism after eating homemade sardine preserves at an organic wine bar in central Bordeaux. In 2019, U.S. health departments reported 21 cases of food-borne botulism to the C.D.C.</p><p>Jonathan Wolfe<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
