Ho of Federal District Court in Manhattan, refused to allow the government to keep open the option of reinstating the charges, as the Justice Department had sought. Even so, the ruling underscores the remarkable power that Mr. Trump’s administration has to terminate cases, regardless of the rationale.</p><p>The decision abruptly ended the long-running case weeks before it had been set for trial. It was also the culmination of a bitter clash between the prosecutors who indicted Mr. Adams and the officials at Mr. Trump’s Justice Department who killed the case.</p><p>The fight, in which Manhattan prosecutors and Justice Department officials accused each other of ethical misconduct, left Mr. Adams deeply damaged as he faces a steep uphill climb for re-election this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Justice Department had moved to dismiss the charges against the mayor after the prosecutors who had brought the indictment refused to do so. One of the department’s highest-ranking officials offered a highly unusual justification, arguing that the case was compromising Mr. Adams’s ability to help enforce the Trump administration’s immigration policies.</p><p>The judge said that granting the government’s request “would create the unavoidable perception that the mayor’s freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents.”</p><p>Mr. Adams was indicted last year on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html" title="">five counts</a>, including bribery, fraud and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations. He had pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>The prosecution was pursued aggressively by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan after the indictment was returned in September. But after the change in presidential administrations, the Trump Justice Department reversed course, ordering prosecutors to seek the charges’ dismissal.</p><p>Danielle R. Sassoon, the interim U.S. attorney in Manhattan, refused to obey the order and resigned, and a spate of resignations in New York and Washington followed. Justice Department officials, including Emil Bove III, then the acting deputy attorney general, ended up filing the motion themselves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></section><div><div><div><p>William K.
