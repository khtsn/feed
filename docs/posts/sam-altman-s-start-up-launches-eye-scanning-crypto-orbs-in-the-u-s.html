There are <a href="https://world.org/blog/developers/privacy-deep-dive" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">baked-in privacy features</a>, and the company says it doesn’t store the images of users’ irises, only a numerical code that corresponds to them.</p><p>In exchange, users receive a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin, which they can spend, send to other World ID holders or trade for other currencies.

The company has raised roughly $200 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures.</p><p>There have been some hiccups. World’s biometric data collection has faced opposition from privacy advocates and regulators, and the company has been banned or investigated in places including <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/hong-kong-regulator-directs-worldcoin-cease-operations-citing-privacy-concerns-2024-05-22/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/sam-altmans-eye-scanning-worldcoin-venture-blocked-in-spain-057b7b14?mod=article_inline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spain</a>.

Roughly 26 million people have signed up for World’s app since it launched two years ago, Mr. Blania said, and more than 12 million have received Orb scans to verify themselves as humans.</p><p>World stayed out of the United States at first, partly out of concern that regulators would balk at its plans. But the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/technology/trump-crypto-reserve-executive-order.html" title="">crypto-friendly policies</a> have given it an opening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On Wednesday, World announced that it was launching in the United States and opening retail outposts in cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles and Nashville, where new users can scan their eyes and get their World IDs. It plans to have 7,500 Orbs in the country by the end of the year.</p><p>The company also revealed a new version of its Orb, the Orb Mini — which is not, in fact, an orb. Instead, it looks like a smartphone with glowing eyes, but serves the same purpose as the larger device. And World announced partnerships with other businesses including Razer, the gaming company, and Match Group, the dating app conglomerate, which will soon allow Tinder users in Japan to verify their humanity using their World IDs.</p><p>It’s not clear yet how any of this will make money, or whether privacy-conscious Americans will be as eager to fork over their biometric data for a few crypto tokens as people in developing parts of the world have been.</p><p>It’s also not clear whether World can overcome basic skepticism about how strange and sinister the whole thing can feel.</p><p>Personally, I’m sympathetic to the idea that we need a way to tell bots and humans apart. But World’s proposed fix — a global biometric registry, backed by a volatile cryptocurrency and overseen by a private company — may sound too much like a “Black Mirror” episode to reach mainstream acceptance. And even on Wednesday, in a room packed with eager early adopters, I met plenty of people who were reluctant to stare into the Orb.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I don’t give up my personal data easily, and I consider my eyeballs personal data,” one tech worker told me.</p><p>World’s connection to Mr. Altman has also drawn scrutiny. During the event, a few skeptics pointed out that by virtue of his position atop OpenAI, he is in some sense fueling the problem — an internet full of hyper-convincing bots — that World is trying to solve.</p><p>But it’s also possible that Mr. Altman’s connection could help World scale quickly, if it teams up with OpenAI or integrates with its A.I. products in some way. Maybe the social network that OpenAI is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/648130/openai-social-network-x-competitor" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly building</a> will have a “verified humans only” mode, or perhaps users who contribute to OpenAI’s products in valuable ways will someday be paid in Worldcoin.</p><p>(The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.
