According to a spokesman for the Capitol Police, Mr. Tarrio struck the woman’s arm as she put her cellphone close to his face.</p><p>He was subsequently arrested on charges of simple assault.</p><p>It was an astonishing development that Mr. Tarrio — fresh from being pardoned — was taken into custody again after appearing with several other Jan. 6 defendants outside the very building that sat at the center of the riotous attack that sent many of them to prison. The officers who made the arrest were part of the same organization that bore the brunt of the mob’s violence on Jan. 6.</p><p>Before Mr. Trump’s clemency grant, Mr. Tarrio had been serving a 22-year sentence after his conviction on seditious conspiracy charges at a lengthy trial in Washington two years ago. His four co-defendants in the case — Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola — were also present at the news conference, but did not get into scuffles with protesters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The event, which Mr. Tarrio had been actively promoting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/cpac-january-6-proud-boys.html" title="">while in Washington to attend CPAC</a>, the conservative political conference, appeared to be an opportunity for him and his compatriots in the far-right group to tell their version of what took place on Jan. 6.</p><p>The men sought to play down their own role in the violence that day, blaming the police and claiming that their joint prosecution, culminating in a multiweek trial, had been unfair.</p><p>When Mr. Pezzola, who used a stolen police riot shield to shatter a window at the Capitol, was asked by a reporter if the action had escalated the chaos on the ground, he said he disagreed.</p><p>“Escalated? No,” he responded. “It was escalated by the police.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
