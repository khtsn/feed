It was the latest in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-new-phase.html" title="">escalating series of Russian air assaults on urban centers</a> that have further dampened hopes for a cease-fire.</p><p>Located just 20 miles from the Russian border, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/world/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-russia-glide-bombs.html#:~:text=Since%20January%2C%20Ukrainian%20officials%20said,first%20months%20of%20the%20war." title="">Kharkiv is a frequent target of Russian air assaults</a>. What set the latest attack apart was the sheer volume of weapons launched in a short span of time.</p><p>The local authorities said that within 90 minutes, Russia struck the city with nearly 50 drones, two missiles and four glide bombs, powerful guided weapons that carry hundreds of pounds of explosives. Kharkiv’s mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said 40 explosions were heard in the city. He <a href="https://t.me/ihor_terekhov/2619" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described the overnight assault</a> as “the most powerful attack” on the Kharkiv since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began more than three years ago.</p><p>On Saturday afternoon, Russia dropped two more glide bombs on the city, killing at least one more resident and injuring at least 16 others, Mr. Terekhov said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Photographs released by <a href="https://t.me/dsns_telegram/43894" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukraine’s emergency services</a> showed the upper floors of a residential block ablaze after the overnight strike, with white smoke pouring into the early morning sky. In other images, rescuers sifted through the charred wreckage of a gutted apartment. Parts of the photos were blurred, most likely to hide the remains of two people killed in that strike, according to the rescuers. A third person died elsewhere in Kharkiv, and about 20 others were injured in the assault.</p><p>The local prosecutor’s office <a href="https://t.me/prokuratura_kharkiv/23416" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Saturday afternoon that six people were most likely still trapped under the rubble of an industrial facility in Kharkiv that was struck during the overnight attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A resident wounded during the attack.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sofiia Gatilova/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The attacks on Saturday came as Russian forces about 100 miles north of Kharkiv pushed deeper into Ukraine’s northeastern Sumy region, seizing two more villages and advancing their effort to carve out a buffer zone along the Russia-Ukraine border.</p><p>Even in Kharkiv, a city of 1.3 million that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/europe/kharkiv-ukraine-russia-photos.html" title="">over the years has learned to live with near-daily Russian bombardments</a>, Saturday’s attacks were a clear sign of Russia’s strategy to intensify air assaults in a bid to overwhelm and break through Ukraine’s air defenses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>They came just a day after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/world/europe/russia-missile-attack-ukraine-kyiv.html" title="">Russia launched one of its biggest air assault of the war across Ukraine</a>, involving more than 400 drones and over 40 missiles, in what Russia described as retaliation for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-strike-what-to-know.html" title="">Ukraine’s audacious attacks on its strategic bomber bases last weekend</a>.</p><p>President Trump this past week compared the dual air assaults between Russia and Ukraine with “two young children fighting like crazy.”</p><p>“They hate each other, and they’re fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart,” Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-children-fighting.html" title="">said on Thursday in an Oval Office news conference</a>. “They don’t want to be pulled. Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.”</p><p>In an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-rejects-trumps-playground-characterization-ukraine-war-calling/story?id=122573501" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with ABC News</a> released on Friday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine responded to the comment. “We are not kids with Putin at the playground in the park,” he said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “He is a murderer who came to this park to kill the kids.”</p><p>In April, a Russian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/europe/ukraine-kryvyi-ri-attack.html" title="">missile struck a playground in Mr. Zelensky’s hometown, Kryvyi Rih</a>, killing 19 civilians, including nine children. It was the deadliest strike against children since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion, <a href="https://ukraine.ohchr.org/en/T%C3%BCrk-denounces-Russian-attack-which-leaves-nine-children-dead-in-Ukraine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the United Nations</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Russia’s intensified attacks have come alongside a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-offensive.html" title="">new offensive in the east and in the northeastern Sumy region</a>. The push into Sumy follows Russian forces driving Ukrainian troops back from parts of Russia’s Kursk region, just across the border from Sumy.</p><p>To prevent future incursions into Kursk, Mr. Putin announced last month that Russian forces would launch an offensive in Sumy to create a buffer zone along the border. In the past three weeks, Russian troops have seized about 10 villages in the area, gaining control of roughly 75 square miles of territory.</p><p>“It’s clear this is already an offensive on Sumy region — a full-scale offensive,” said Andrii, a 44-year-old company intelligence commander fighting there who declined to be identified with his full name for security reasons and due to military protocol.</p><p>He said he saw the offensive not only as an effort to establish the buffer zone that Mr. Putin called for, but also as a strategy to pin down Ukrainian forces and prevent their redeployment to other frontline hot spots in the east.</p><p>Andrii said Russian troops were currently pushing toward the village of Khotin, six miles from the border. If they seize it, he warned, the situation could turn critical.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Khotin sits on high ground and lies less than 12 miles from the city of Sumy, the regional administrative center, close enough for Russian forces to strike with drones and artillery. Sumy is home to about 250,000 people.</p><p>More than 200 villages and settlements have been evacuated from the Sumy region over the past year because of the fighting.</p><p>Liubov Sholudko<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>11</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Russians Pummel Kharkiv With Drones and Bombs, Ukraine Says<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump’s Analogy:</strong> As Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, sat beside him watching in silence, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-children-fighting.html">President Trump compared Russia and Ukraine to two fighting children</a> who needed to work out their differences for a while before anyone could intervene.</p></li><li><p><strong>Russian Gas: </strong>Amid the geopolitical jockeying touched off by Trump’s re-engaging with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, the future of Europe’s energy supply has emerged as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/world/europe/us-russia-nord-stream-gas-pipeline.html">source of tension and vulnerability</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flipping the Script</strong><strong>: </strong>A drone attack on airfields and warplanes in Russia revealed how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/politics/ukraine-russia-drone-attack.html">Ukraine is changing how wars will be waged</a> in the 21st century, U.S. officials and military analysts said.
