On a monthly basis, both overall and core inflation climbed 0.1 percent — slightly less than what economists had expected, and slower than in October. That suggested that progress on inflation had not stalled quite as much as expected.</p><p>In all, the fresh inflation figures probably reinforce both the Fed’s cautious stance and a widespread belief among its policymakers that inflation will eventually slow further.</p><p>“I don’t think this one report is going to change their minds on next year,” said Omair Sharif, the founder of the research firm Inflation Insights. While the monthly slowdown was encouraging, he said, officials would be keenly focused on the inflation outlook for next year.</p><p>Fed officials raised interest rates sharply in 2022 and 2023 to try to wrestle price increases back under control. But months of progress on inflation and signs of a slowdown in the job market spurred them to lower borrowing costs starting in September. Policymakers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/fed-meeting-interest-rates.html" title="">cut interest rates three times</a> as of their meeting this week, lowering them by a full percentage point in total.</p><p>Now, the next phase of monetary policy is much more uncertain. Officials are unsure how much more they should lower interest rates as inflation proves stubborn and as the job market shows signs of stabilizing. They have been clear that they will focus intently on the pace of price increases as they contemplate future rate cuts, which are likely to be fewer and farther between next year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Fed officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/fed-meeting-interest-rates.html" title="">released economic projections</a> this week that forecast just two rate cuts in 2025 — causing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/stock-market-fed-rate-cut-forecast.html" title="">stock prices to plummet</a>, a shift in tone after weeks of optimism among investors. Higher interest rates could cost companies and consumers, cool the economy and dim the outlook for many riskier asset classes.</p><p>“The slower pace of cuts for next year really reflects both the higher inflation readings we’ve had this year, and the expectation inflation will be higher,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference this week.</p><p>“We’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation, as well as continued strength in the labor market,” he added. “And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid, we can be cautious.”</p><p>Friday’s <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/personal-income-and-outlays-november-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Personal Consumption Expenditures report</a> suggested that the economy did retain momentum: Consumers were spending at a solid clip. After adjusting for inflation, personal consumption climbed 0.3 percent from a month earlier, faster than 0.1 percent in October.</p><p>A broad range of evidence has suggested that Americans have remained willing to open their wallets as they headed into the holiday season. Early reports on seasonal shopping suggest that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/business/black-friday-cyber-monday-shopping.html" title="">has been strong</a>, even as some consumers are more conscious of their budgets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said during an interview on CNBC Friday morning that he still thought that interest rates were “restrictive,” meaning that they were weighing on the economy and should pull inflation down over time. But he also highlighted that the economy was facing unknowns as it headed into 2025.</p><p>“There is a lot of uncertainty right now,” Mr. Williams said.</p><p>Among those, Fed officials are trying to figure out how tariffs from the incoming Trump administration may affect the economy and how much they may push up inflation. But there are many unknowns — including basic issues like how extensive the tariffs will be and how other countries will react.</p><p>Given that, the Fed is planning to wait and see both how policies shape up and how the economy progresses, moving more gradually with policy.</p><p>“The next phase is really looking at the incoming information,” Mary C. Daly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday morning before the release.</p><p>Beth Hammack, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, was the one official who voted against the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates earlier this week. She <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/collections/speeches/2024/sp-20241220-fomc-statement-president-beth-hammack" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained her reasoning</a> in a statement on Friday morning, noting that it had been a close call.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I prefer to hold policy steady until we see further evidence that inflation is resuming its path to our 2 percent objective,” she wrote. “The economy’s momentum and recent elevated inflation readings caused me to revise up my inflation forecast for next year.”</p><p>Now, the Fed will be in wait-and-watch mode as it heads into the new year.</p><p>“It’s been a bit of a bumpy journey,” Mr. Williams said. “We’re still not to our 2 percent goal, we’re going to make sure we get there.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
