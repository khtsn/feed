The Israeli military subsequently ordered residents of the densely populated Hadath neighborhood of Dahiya, an area on the southern edges of Beirut, to evacuate from the vicinity of a building there.</p><p>Less than two hours later, the Israeli military struck.</p><p>The Israeli military said it had targeted a site that stored Hezbollah’s drones, but did not explicitly blame the Lebanese militant group for the rocket fire earlier in the day. Hezbollah denied any involvement in the attack on Israel and said it remained committed to the cease-fire.</p><p>But this was the second such exchange of fire in less than a week, prompting fears that the truce between Israel and Hezbollah could unravel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was not immediately clear who fired the rockets. But experts say that Hezbollah, which is still struggling to recover from the devastating 14-month conflict with Israel, has little desire to risk reigniting a conflict. Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas maintain a sizable presence in Lebanon, operating mostly from decades-old refugee camps. During the war in Gaza, these groups have intermittently launched rockets from Lebanon into northern Israel.</p><p>After the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attack ignited the war in Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones at Israeli positions in solidarity with its Palestinian ally. After nearly a year of low-level violence, the fighting escalated into full-scale war and an Israeli ground invasion before the two sides <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/middleeast/cease-fire-israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">agreed to a cease-fire</a>.</p><p>It marked Lebanon’s deadliest and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/europe/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-government-economy.html" title="">most destructive</a> conflict since the country’s 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Israeli strike stirred fear and pandemonium in parts of the capital, Beirut.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hussein Malla/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Despite the truce, Israeli forces have regularly attacked southern and eastern Lebanon. But Dahiya, which is traditionally a bastion of support for Hezbollah, had not been targeted since the cease-fire was agreed.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Friday, Israeli drones began to whir above Beirut and gunfire erupted in the Dahiya as residents attempted to alert neighbors to an imminent Israeli strike.</p><p>The Lebanese authorities ordered all schools in the area to close, and footage circulated on social media of parents rushing to collect screaming children. Students who spoke to The New York Times reported being ordered by teachers to move away from the windows, and said their classmates broke down in fear.</p><p>The attack sparked a pandemonium reminiscent of the most intense days of the war, when Israeli airstrikes pounded Beirut’s southern outskirts on a near daily basis.</p><p>“People are panicking,” said Elie Hachem, the director of the St. Therese hospital, about 600 meters from the targeted building. “I can hear cars honking like crazy outside on the street.”</p><p>The hospital, which had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/middleeast/lebanon-hospitals-israel-offensive.html" title="">badly damaged in the war</a>, was left unscathed by the strike, but casualties soon began arriving into the emergency room, said Mr. Hachem.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>For now, he said, they were just trying to keep everyone calm.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents of the southern outskirts of Beirut rushed to take cover after an Israeli airstrike.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anwar Amro/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Air-raid sirens warning of incoming rocket fire had rung out earlier on Friday in northern Israel, including the city of Kiryat Shmona. The Israeli military later said one of the projectiles was intercepted and another fell inside Lebanese territory.</p><p>Lebanon’s prime minister, Nawaf Salam, ordered the security forces on Friday to arrest those responsible for the rocket fire, calling it “irresponsible” and a threat to “Lebanon’s stability and security,” according to a statement from his office.</p><p>The Lebanese state is distinct from Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political party that wielded enormous influence in Lebanon before the war. The new government has pledged to bring all weapons under the state’s control — including Hezbollah’s — but it remains unclear exactly when and how they will do that.</p><p>Amid the violence, the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, called for restraint on Friday, warning that a “a return to wider conflict in Lebanon would be devastating.”</p><p>Hwaida Saad<!-- --> and <!-- -->Dayana Iwaza<!-- --> contributed reporting from Beirut.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
