The Israeli military subsequently ordered residents of the densely populated Hadath neighborhood of Dahiya, an area on the southern edges of Beirut, to evacuate from the vicinity of a building there.</p><p>Less than two hours later, the airstrikes began.</p><p>The Israeli military said it had targeted a site that stored Hezbollah’s drones, but did not explicitly blame the Lebanese militant group for the rocket fire earlier in the day. Hezbollah denied any involvement in the attack on Israel and said it remained committed to the cease-fire.</p><p>But this was the second such exchange of fire in less than a week, prompting fears that the truce between Israel and Hezbollah could unravel. At least three people were killed in separate Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon on Friday, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Lebanese military said it was investigating who had fired the rockets. Hezbollah, which is struggling to recover from the devastating 14-month conflict with Israel, has little desire to risk reigniting a conflict, according to experts. </p><p>But Palestinian armed groups like Hamas also maintain a sizable presence in Lebanon, operating mostly from decades-old refugee camps. During the war in Gaza, these groups have intermittently launched rockets from Lebanon into northern Israel.</p><p>After the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attack ignited the war in Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones at Israeli positions in solidarity with its Palestinian ally. After nearly a year of low-level violence, the fighting escalated into full-scale war and an Israeli ground invasion before the two sides <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/middleeast/cease-fire-israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">agreed to a cease-fire</a>.</p><p>It marked Lebanon’s deadliest and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/europe/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-government-economy.html" title="">most destructive</a> conflict since the country’s 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/28/multimedia/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/28/multimedia/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/28/multimedia/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A girl crying is embraced by a man next to a red car." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/28/multimedia/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/28/multimedia/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/28/multimedia/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/28/multimedia/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm/28Lebanon-israel-03-fjkm-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/85b41667-064d-5894-982b-b3419e725f25" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Israeli strike stirred fear and pandemonium in parts of the capital, Beirut.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hussein Malla/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Despite the truce, Israeli forces have regularly attacked in southern and eastern Lebanon, leading Hezbollah to accuse Israel of breaking the cease-fire. But Dahiya, which is traditionally a bastion of support for Hezbollah, had not been targeted since the cease-fire went into effect. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said that the country was determined to “strongly enforce” the cease-fire, which obligated the Lebanese government to prevent militant groups from attacking Israel from its territory. </p><p>“The equation has changed,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “We will not allow firing at our communities — not even a trickle.”</p><p>After the Israeli military issued the evacuation warnings, surveillance drones began to whir above Beirut and gunfire erupted in the Dahiya as residents attempted to alert neighbors to an imminent Israeli strike. The Lebanese authorities also ordered all schools in the area to close, and parents rushed to collect screaming children. Students who spoke to The New York Times reported being ordered by teachers to move away from the windows, and said their classmates broke down in fear.</p><p>The pandemonium was reminiscent of the most intense days of the war, when Israeli airstrikes pounded Beirut’s southern outskirts on a near daily basis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“People are panicking,” said Elie Hachem, the director of the St. Therese hospital, about 600 meters from the targeted building. “I can hear cars honking like crazy outside on the street.”</p><p>The hospital, which had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/middleeast/lebanon-hospitals-israel-offensive.html" title="">badly damaged in the war</a>, was left unscathed by the strike, but casualties soon began arriving into the emergency room, said Mr. Hachem.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents of the southern outskirts of Beirut rushed to take cover after an Israeli airstrike.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anwar Amro/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Air-raid sirens warning of incoming rocket fire had rung out earlier on Friday in northern Israel, including in the city of Kiryat Shmona.
