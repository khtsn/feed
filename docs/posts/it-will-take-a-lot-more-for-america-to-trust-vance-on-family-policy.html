She’s dear to him. She’s from his Ohio hometown, and she had an unplanned pregnancy. “She felt like if she hadn’t had an abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship,” he said in Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. Vance said that he and Donald Trump want to earn “the American people’s trust back on this issue.”</p><p>He further explained that they’re going to earn that trust back by making life more affordable for American families and by letting states decide their own abortion policies, because what people want in California is different from what people want in Arizona.</p><p>While I must admit that Vance’s delivery was incredibly smooth all evening, I don’t know that I believe that he really supports his “dear” friend who had an abortion; if she were unfortunate enough to be living in Idaho right now, she would not be able to make the decision she made in Ohio. A states’ rights approach often means stripping millions of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/opinion/desantis-amendment-4-abortion.html" title="">women of their rights</a>.</p><p>When Norah O’Donnell, one of the moderators, pointed out that Vance previously supported a federal ban on abortion, he claimed he had done no such thing. “I never supported a national ban,” he said. “I did when I was running for Senate talk about a minimum national standard.” But O’Donnell was correct. You can hear Vance say, “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally</a>” on a podcast in Jan. 2022. He also said he was “sympathetic” to the idea that there might need to be some kind of federal response if, after the fall of Roe, George Soros were to send airplanes to fly women from states with abortion bans to places where abortion was legal.</p><p>Vance says he wants to help Americans build families through pro-family policy, like “making child care more accessible.” But when he had the opportunity to vote for an expanded child tax credit over the summer — a policy he claims to support — <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/vance-calls-for-child-tax-credit-increase-after-skipping-senate-vote-to-expand-benefit/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he skipped the vote</a>.</p><p>It’s a shame Walz did not do a better job articulating the Harris ticket’s positions on family policy. He has been blustery and stilted all evening. Because even though Vance talked a very good game, I still don’t trust him — or Republicans in general — to help create a thriving America for mothers or their children. I don’t care how many women he claims to know.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="32" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzRmZWU3YTVkLTFmODctNWMwYi04MTk1LTgwMGY3NTdiMTE0YQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#vance-winning-debate" data-source-id="100000009735604"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ross-douthat"><img alt="Ross Douthat" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/ross-douthat/ross-douthat-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/ross-douthat/ross-douthat-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/ross-douthat/ross-douthat-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-02T02:06:58.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 1, 2024, 10:06 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The first half of the vice-presidential debate has been the strongest illustration in this campaign so far of why it made sense for Donald Trump to pick JD Vance as his running mate. The Ohio senator is delivering one of the best debating performances by a Republican nominee for president or vice president in recent memory and making a case for Trump’s record far more effectively than Trump has ever been capable of doing.</p><p>Vance’s performance has included a dose of self-conscious humanization, an attempted reintroduction to his blue-collar background and striking personal biography after weeks of effective Democratic attacks on his right-wing podcast commentary. It’s included some careful rhetorical tap dancing and policy jujitsu on issues like climate change and abortion. But mostly it’s just been an effective prosecution of the case against the Biden-Harris administration, focusing relentlessly on encouraging viewers to be nostalgic for the economy, the immigration landscape and the relative foreign-policy calm of Trump’s term.</p><p>Tim Walz, on the other hand, seems affable, well meaning and, relative to Vance, largely out of his depth. He’s spending too much time partly agreeing with his rival while making a much more haphazard case against Trump than Vance is making against Kamala Harris.</p><p>I think one question raised by this performance so far is why the Harris campaign has basically kept Walz away from one-on-one interviews while Vance has been out there dealing with hostile questions from Day 1 of his candidacy. It feels as though the Minnesota governor would have benefited immensely from spending some more time being grilled on the Sunday shows before he was sent out to do battle with a Republican vice-presidential nominee, who, whatever his other weaknesses, clearly knows how to debate.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="29" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RiOTA5NjI3LWY1ODctNTU5MS05YmRkLWYwNTUyMzJiODdiYQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#adams-punishment-campaign-finance" data-source-id="100000009732300"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-01T20:56:51.099Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 1, 2024, 4:56 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Last week, Mayor Eric Adams of New York was accused by federal prosecutors of fraudulently obtaining matching funds from the city for illegal campaign contributions. On Thursday, Councilman Lincoln Restler of Brooklyn, the chair of the </em><a href="https://council.nyc.gov/committees/governmental-operations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Committee on Governmental Operations</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://x.com/LincolnRestler/status/1839387442887208993" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>wrote to the city’s Campaign Finance Board</em></a><em>, urging that Adams be removed from the finance program. Restler explains why in this interview, which has been edited.</em></p><p><strong>Q: It’s striking that Adams is accused of abusing the very system designed to keep big money out of city politics.</strong></p><p>A: The New York City campaign finance system is nationally renowned. It has been a model for cities and states around the country to democratize our elections, to allow for immigrant New Yorkers and low- and moderate-income New Yorkers to run for public office and serve in the most powerful positions in our city. Our campaign finance system has leveled the playing field and meant that it’s not just those who are connected to the rich and powerful who are in the key elected offices.</p><p><strong>To what extent is the city’s campaign finance system based on the ability to trust candidates?</strong></p><p>Fortunately, we have seen the contributions move in overwhelming numbers to an online donation system where it’s much easier to verify the identity of the donor. But I’ve introduced legislation that would require certain types of donations — cash donations, for example — to require additional verification of the donor by the Campaign Finance Board. There are certain types of donations where we see fraud much more commonly taking place, including on Mayor Adams’s campaign, and we need greater oversight and accountability of those donations to preserve public trust in our very generous taxpayer-funded matching system.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lincoln Restler.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Roy Rochlin/Getty Images For Emirates And Us</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>What can the Campaign Finance Board do to a candidate who has lied to the city and cheated the system?</strong></p><p>These donations to Eric Adams from Turkish corporations and foreign agents and straw donors were flagged by the Campaign Finance Board during the 2021 campaign and he ignored all requests for information and documentation. There has to be meaningful accountability, and if you cheat the system as he has, you can’t continue to take taxpayer-funded dollars.</p><p>The integrity of our campaign finance system is at stake in how the C.F.B. holds Eric Adams accountable right now. If Eric Adams cheats the system repeatedly in the most flagrant ways and then continues to receive millions of dollars in taxpayer funding for his re-election campaign, what message does that send to every future candidate who’s intent on undermining the rules? I am hopeful that the decent people who run the C.F.B. will protect the credibility and reputation of our campaign finance system, and hold the mayor accountable and kick him out of our matching fund system once and for all.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE2ZWE1N2E5LTI1NTAtNTFkOC05NjUxLWU0ZjVkZjQxMGQ2Zg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#iran-attack-israel" data-source-id="100000009733753"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-l-friedman"><img alt="Thomas L.

The Israeli antimissile system shot down almost all of them, Israeli sources said, and while there was some damage the attack was not considered particularly successful. There are no reports at this time of extensive casualties.</em></p><p><em>The attack was executed by the Air Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and was not an operation of the regular Iranian army or air force, according to Israeli sources. The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, was not informed of the attack until shortly before it began, the sources said, indicating that the Iranian regime is divided over the operation, which will probably add to the fractures in the government.</em></p><p><em>Israel’s ability to anticipate the Iranian strike and name the precise hour of the attack, and the fact that it was a revolutionary guards operation — not the regular Iranian armed forces under the command of the new president — demonstrates how deeply the Mossad, Israel’s cyber command, Unit 8200, and the Israeli Air Force have penetrated the Iranian regime and coordinated their defensive response. It means no Iranian leader can trust another anymore.</em></p><p>We may be about to enter what could be the most dangerous moment in the history of the modern Middle East: a ballistic missile war between Iran and Israel, which would almost certainly bring in the United States on Israel’s side and could culminate in a full-blown U.S.-Israeli effort to destroy Iran’s nuclear program.</p><p>That is the assessment I have gleaned from talking to Israeli intelligence sources, whose analysis is that Iran plans to launch a missile attack against Israel at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time, which is 7:30 p.m. in Israel. The attack is planned in two waves 15 minutes apart, and each wave will involve 110 ballistic missiles, the Israelis said.</p><p>The Iranian missiles are aimed at three targets. First, the headquarters of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service, near Tel Aviv. Second, the Israeli air base at Nevatim, and third, the Israeli air base at Khatzirim; both bases are in the south of Israel in the Negev Desert. The Israeli officials are particularly concerned about any strike on Mossad headquarters because it is in the densely populated north Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon. It is also not far from the Israeli defense intelligence headquarters, Unit 8200.</p><p>This information has been shared with me because the Israelis insist that they do not want a full-scale ballistic war with Iran, and want the United States to try to deter the Iranians by letting them know that if they do launch this missile attack, the United States will not be a bystander, and its response, unlike with the April 13 Iranian missile and drone attack on Israel, will not be purely defensive. In other words, Iran could be risking its entire nuclear program if this missile attack goes ahead.</p><p>I have not been able to speak to any senior U.S. officials to gauge their reactions, but will update this blog post as I do.</p><p>One might think that Israel is itching for this kind of war with Iran to finally take out its nuclear program and involve the United States. That is not my impression. A war of ballistic missiles could do enormous damage to Israel’s infrastructure unless virtually every missile is intercepted.</p><p>Could the Iranians be bluffing and intending to land the missiles in open areas in Israel? That is not the impression the Israelis have gleaned from their intelligence.</p><p>The Israeli intelligence assessment is that the Iranian people by and large do not want this war with Israel. There has long been discontent in Iran over the billions of dollars the regime has spent supporting Hamas and Hezbollah at a time when Iranian infrastructure is so dilapidated and the country’s economy is on its back. The message the Israelis hope the U.S. can convey to Iran is also that if they start this war and it leads to great destruction and death of Iranian civilians, it could also trigger an uprising against the regime.</p><p>In the last year we have seen red lines crossed left and right — from the savage Hamas onslaught on Israel on Oct. 7 to the Israeli pager attack against Hezbollah’s leadership and the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The Iranians feel their deterrence has been eroded and need to respond.</p><p>This is Code Red time. Because once you start crossing red lines, they all disappear.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="26" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzViMGViZjcwLWNlNmMtNTI0Yy04YjZmLTE5NzAyNzViM2NhYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#california-legacy-admissions" data-source-id="100000009732059"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/pamela-paul"><img alt="Pamela Paul" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-01T09:03:40.260Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 1, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Madison/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Every time California takes a big step on education, you have to brace yourself: Is this going to lead the country in the right direction, as it did with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/02/magazine/the-class-of-prop-209.html" title="">eliminating racial preferences</a> in college admissions in the ’90s?

Asked in private, they will admit to what everyone already knows: Legacies are about money. Wealthy alumni often give to their alma mater with the tacit expectation that it will propel their borderline offspring over the finish line to Ivy League admission. It amounts to a significant source of fund-raising.</p><p>In other words, legacy admissions stand in opposition to ideals that most selective colleges and universities profess to espouse: Education as a force for social and cultural progress. Equality of opportunity and American egalitarianism. A significant driver of social and economic mobility for first-generation college students.</p><p>Some have referred to legacy admissions as “<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/6/30/23778906/affirmative-action-white-applicants-legacy-athletic-recruitment" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">white affirmative action</a>” and believe its elimination <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/9/22/harvard-without-legacy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could help foster</a> racial, ethnic and economic diversity.

After he rode down the Trump Tower escalator, I needed some relief and found it by returning to the library. For the next five years, I found that turning the pages of the Carter documents brushed away some of the Trump toxins.</p><p>As Carter celebrates his 100th birthday on Tuesday, we shouldn’t think of him as a saint. No politician is humble and self-effacing. But Carter is a global humanitarian icon, a moral exemplar and the ultimate un-Trump.</p><p>The two former presidents know each other only slightly. In the early 1980s, Carter traveled to Trump Tower and asked Trump to contribute to the Carter Center. Trump said he respected Carter’s “nerve and guts” in asking for $5 million but gave him nothing. After Trump was elected, Carter, at age 93, hoped Trump would dispatch him to North Korea and offered Trump advice on dealing with China. But Trump predictably began trashing Carter, who later concluded that Trump “was put into office through Russian efforts.”</p><p>The contrast could not be starker. Trump is corrupt, chaotic and vulgar; Carter is honest, disciplined and respectful. Trump is a physically big man who acts small; Carter is a physically small man who acts big. Trump appeals to the worst in us; Carter to the best in us.</p><p>Trump is a nationalist and an authoritarian. Carter is an internationalist and devoted to the promotion of democracy. Trump has told thousands of well-documented lies; Carter promised in his 1976 campaign not to lie to the American people and — despite plenty of exaggerations — never did.</p><p>Trump’s a grifter who is selling gold watches; Carter’s an uplifter who lives in a modest home in Plains, Ga. Trump thinks he’s really smart; Carter actually is. Trump is on wife No. 3 and was found liable for sexual assault; Carter was married for 77 years and lusted only in his heart.</p><p>Trump refused to release his tax returns; Carter originated the practice. Trump botched his handling of the Covid pandemic; Carter (with the help of his wife, Rosalynn) convinced most states to require vaccination before children can enter school and has spent his post-presidency eradicating diseases and otherwise advancing global health.</p><p>Even the superficial similarities don’t bear scrutiny. Both Trump and Carter used racial code words in the past. But while Trump ditched dog whistles in favor of rank racism, Carter compensated for his absence from the civil rights movement by beginning the effort to bring diversity to the federal government. Both have been criticized for cozying up to dictators. But while Trump does it because the strongmen flatter him and share their tips on autocratic rule, Carter met often with dictators to broker peace, free political prisoners and — in Nicaragua and Haiti — persuade them to do what Trump would not: peacefully transfer power.</p><p>Carter recently told his grandson that he wants to stay alive so he can vote for Kamala Harris. Let’s hope his core decency and moral courage can help light our way forward in a direction that would make him proud.</p><p><em>Jonathan Alter is the author of “</em><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/His-Very-Best/Jonathan-Alter/9781501125546" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life</em></a><em>.”</em></p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="23" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdmMWU0NDlhLTUzZGMtNWY2Mi1iYzY1LWUxNDY1Mzc0NWJmNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#stevie-nicks-abortion-song" data-source-id="100000009729380"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/frank-bruni"><img alt="Frank Bruni" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/frank-bruni/frank-bruni-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/frank-bruni/frank-bruni-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/frank-bruni/frank-bruni-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-30T09:06:31.335Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 30, 2024, 5:06 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stevie Nicks in Brooklyn in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chad Batka for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>I’ve spent many contented decades listening to Stevie Nicks sing about gypsies, witches and white-winged doves, her gossamer lyrics and onstage twirls imported from some dream world gloriously estranged from the real one.</p><p>So I was jolted, to say the least, by her new song about abortion.</p><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJDCYh5iWQs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It’s called “The Lighthouse,” <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/stevie-nicks-new-song-the-lighthouse-womens-rights-listen-1235786229/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it came out Friday</a> and it doesn’t specifically mention the medical procedure.

And in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAaAyr0tqcc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">written statement</a> released with the song, Nicks explained that she wrote it in response to the repeal of Roe v.

Roan canceled gigs in New York and Maryland after being savaged online for her comments about finding fault with both the Democratic and Republican Parties. In mid-September, Linda Ronstadt <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/linda-ronstadt-donald-trump-toxic-politics.html" title="">felt compelled</a> to issue a statement denouncing Trump and endorsing Harris after she learned that a Tucson, Ariz., <a href="https://www.tucsonsymphony.org/plan-your-visit/linda-ronstadt-music-hall/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">music hall</a> named after her was being used for a Trump rally.</p><p>Now comes Nicks, 76, with a new song inspired by … the Supreme Court.

Herbert Daughtry</a>, 93, who was once widely known for street activism , and <a href="https://www.naacpconnect.org/blog/entry/tribute-to-hazel-nell-dukes" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hazel Dukes, 92, a longtime official</a> of the N.A.A.C.P., who allowed that she had not read the indictment and yet had decided it was unfair.</p><p>Despite Adams’s protestations, however, this story is about the arrogance and disregard for appearances of impropriety that he displayed from his first days in City Hall. To cite just one example, The Times reported extensively two years ago about his inexplicable friendship <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/22/nyregion/eric-adams-la-baia-zero-bond.html" title="">with an unsavory pair of restaurateurs</a> who had pleaded guilty to felonies after being accused of money laundering.</p><p>This episode called to mind Mayor Jimmy Walker, the Tammany Hall peacock who resigned in the wake of a corruption scandal in 1932 and fled to Europe. No modern-day mayor who had absorbed even a smidgen of New York political history would have tempted fate by following stylistically in Walker’s footsteps.</p><p>The five charges listed in the federal indictment against Adams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html" title="">— centering on bribery, conspiracy, fraud and soliciting illegal campaign contributions</a> — are reminiscent of the quotidian corruption that was institutionalized in the city during the Tammany period. The count that accuses the mayor of rushing through the approval of the newly built Turkish Consulate in Manhattan in exchange for travel and gifts is particularly resonant of that age, though Adams substituted his own gang of cronies for the old Tammany machine.</p><p>The indictment presentation by Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for New York’s Southern District, made no direct reference to Gotham’s rich corruption history while explaining the charges. But Williams made clear that the investigation is not over and could well produce further indictments. In addition to that ominous possibility, at least three other federal investigations have reached people in the mayor’s circle. Adams pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday.</p><p>The mayor’s civil-rights-themed news conference signals his intent to portray himself as a noble civic servant who is being prosecuted on racial grounds. This strategy is unlikely to sustain him through a public legal process that allows New Yorkers to learn the sordid particulars of this case.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="20" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2ZlMTQwYTMyLWYzMzgtNTM2ZC1iNjM5LTA2MjAxMDFhZjNiMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#maggie-smith-death" data-source-id="100000009725552"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/author/adam-sternbergh/"><img alt="Adam Sternbergh" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/06/opinion/Adam-Sternbergh/Adam-Sternbergh-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/06/opinion/Adam-Sternbergh/Adam-Sternbergh-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/06/opinion/Adam-Sternbergh/Adam-Sternbergh-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-27T16:10:10.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 27, 2024, 12:10 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Maggie Smith might have found it amusing that her death at age 89, in addition to being universally noted by appreciators of excellent acting, is being spontaneously memorialized in GIFs. Social media was flooded with pictorial snippets of memorable moments from “Downton Abbey,” as well as the “Harry Potter” films.</p><p>Her career was much more than that, of course; she won her first Oscar in 1969 for “The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie” and won again in 1978 for “California Suite.” But to many Americans, at least, she’s best remembered for her turn as Violet Crawley, the acerbic dowager countess on “Downton Abbey.”</p><p>The countess’s withering put-downs and cutting asides were often the highlight of each episode, and in the United States they were certainly a driving force in the series’s success. Smith wasn’t the first across-the-pond figure to import a successful brand of English iciness — the game show “The Weakest Link” once featured a British host, Anne Robinson, who was dismissive and rude to hapless American contestants — but being an exquisite performer, Smith lent a crisp and cutting ruthlessness to her ably written dialogue, turning an ossified aristocrat into a stateside star.</p><p>Americans like to think of themselves as truth tellers, unhindered by societal niceties. There are entire cottage industries built around blowhards who promise to tell it like it is, consequences be damned. But Smith, as a capper to her remarkable career, showed American audiences what we were apparently badly wanting: a sharp-eyed and even sharper-tongued observer who could cut anyone down to size with a few choice, sharp strokes.</p><p>Americans tend to be experts in the comedy of bluster, as many of our late-night hosts can attest. We’re less practiced in merciless precision — which, among her many gifts to us, is something Maggie Smith demonstrated with each lacerating, memorable (and memeable) gibe.</p><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Sept. 27, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the character played by Maggie Smith on “Downton Abbey.” It is Violet Crawley, not Crowley.</p></div><p>How we handle corrections</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="19" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM2MTlhNGZjLTFlMTYtNTIyYS1hYTk1LTI5YWQzNDRhMjVjZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#badbehavior-republican-outreach-women" data-source-id="100000009724236"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-27T09:04:00.965Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 27, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bernie Moreno, the Republican candidate for Senate in Ohio.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Dermer/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Every Friday through the election, Michelle Cottle will highlight outstanding examples of misdeeds, outrageous statements and simply bizarre political behavior.</em></p><ul><li><p>The past week has been something extra-special in terms of Republican outreach to women.</p><p>Bernie Moreno, the party’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/politics/bernie-moreno-women-haley.html" title="">pick for Senate in Ohio</a>, kicked us off <a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/your-local-election-hq/bernie-moreno-says-women-are-single-issue-voters-for-abortion-during-ohio-town-hall/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last Friday</a> whining about many women being “single-issue voters” on reproductive rights. “It’s a little crazy, by the way — especially for women that are like past 50,” he said. “I’m thinking to myself: I don’t think that’s an issue for you.”</p><p>So … If you cannot personally get pregnant, you shouldn’t really care about this issue?</p><p>I’ll give Moreno three guesses as to what <em>I’m</em> thinking to myself.</p></li><li><p>Representative Anthony D’Esposito, a freshman Republican from Long Island, deserves a shout-out for his creativity in striving to balance his work and personal life.

The rebellion from the rank-and-file has given a boost to a bid by John Palmer, the Teamsters’ vice president at large, who <a href="https://x.com/GrimKim/status/1814397058553405928" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced an effort</a> to run against O’Brien in July shortly after O’Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention.</p><p>Palmer’s letter cited a long list of grievances against O’Brien, including the embarrassing moment when he and Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl-2KTpXShY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly came to blows</a> at a Senate hearing, requiring the intervention of Bernie Sanders. Palmer was also critical of O’Brien for allowing artificial intelligence and automation to “run wild through many of our workplaces.” But his top complaint was clearly about cozy relations with Donald Trump, whom O’Brien visited at Mar-a-Lago in January — “kissing the ring of a man that scabbed a picket line.”</p><p>The whole situation is bizarre, since it is hard to come up with an administration that has done more for the Teamsters than President Biden’s. When the Teamsters pension plans were threatened with insolvency, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/us/politics/biden-union-pensions.html" title="">the Biden-Harris administration got them a $36 billion bailout</a>.

He said he would be a voice for working-class residents in the city. He promised a campaign focused on literacy in the nation’s largest public school system.</p><p>What New York City received instead was a mayor who filled City Hall with his cronies and patronage hires. Several of his highest-ranking appointments, including his former police commissioner, schools chancellor and a top deputy mayor, are under separate federal investigations, and several are among a widening group of city officials who have resigned, either in protest or disgrace.</p><p>According to federal officials, Adams used his office for personal gain, soliciting a contribution from foreign officials, committing wire fraud and bribery. He took discounted trips and luxury travel benefits from the Turkish government, the indictment said, and engaged in a conspiracy to accept and conceal foreign campaign contributions, which are illegal. In exchange, he let a Turkish consular building open without a proper Fire Department inspection.</p><p>The images on Thursday of federal agents arriving at Gracie Mansion before dawn brought reality into painful relief: New York City is without any clear leadership, a situation that is untenable.</p><p>Adams has said he is innocent and plans to fight the charges, as is his legal right. But even if he remains in office as the prosecution unfolds, it is hard to see him seeking a second term, or successfully persuading voters to give him one. For now, his most pressing struggle is to assure the public that the people’s business continues while he defends himself, which will be an immense task.</p><p>There are pressing needs in New York City, beginning with affordable housing, and few signs that City Hall is up to meeting those needs.</p><p>Rather than expend his political capital to push a promising plan within his administration to build more affordable housing, known as the City of Yes, Adams has focused much of his attention on pursuits like redesigning trash cans and fighting a war on rats. He has struggled to address the arrival of over 210,000 migrants, allowing City Hall to operate in a constant state of reaction.</p><p>The more than eight million residents of New York City deserve better.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2I3NjU0OTI0LTYyNzEtNTM0My05ZTk0LTFlMzQ3ZWI3ZGU3YQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#electoral-college-votes" data-source-id="100000009719122"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gail-collins"><img alt="Gail Collins" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/01/opinion/opcollins-headshot-2021/opcollins-headshot-2021-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/01/opinion/opcollins-headshot-2021/opcollins-headshot-2021-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/01/opinion/opcollins-headshot-2021/opcollins-headshot-2021-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-26T09:05:31.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 26, 2024, 5:05 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Peterson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Dear Help Person,</strong></p><p><strong>I live in New York and nobody cares how I vote in the big, huge, potentially history-changing presidential race.

True, the only people poll-watchers will really pay attention to are from a handful of states where the political division is very close. Nobody cares if about two million New Yorkers cast votes for Kamala Harris because nobody cares about the popular vote.</p><p>Snap question: Who won the popular vote in 2016?</p><p>Answer: Hillary Clinton, by about 2.9 million. But she lost a few states, including Michigan and Wisconsin, by itsy-bitsy margins, and that knocked her out of the White House. Blame the Electoral College.</p><p><strong>How did we get stuck with this thing?</strong></p><p>The Electoral College was created at the nation’s constitutional convention after a long, long struggle. Led by the Committee of Unfinished Parts.</p><p><strong>Wait a minute. The committee of what?</strong></p><p>Yeah, that’s the story. The founding fathers couldn’t decide whether the president should be elected by Congress or state legislatures, the people, or something else. They finally settled on something else.</p><p>“They squished it all together,” said Robert Alexander, an expert on the Electoral College at Bowling Green State University. Alexander likes to explain that the founders’ solution “looks like Frankenstein’s monster.”</p><p>These were the same guys who gave the power to do everything from trying impeachments to confirming members of the Supreme Court to the Senate, in which California and Wyoming have exactly the same number of votes despite the fact that California’s population is approximately 68 times as large.</p><p>What can I tell you, people? True, a lot of you are going to feel cranky when you diligently go to the polls on Election Day, say hello to all your neighbor-voters, and then go home to watch the whole world hanging on their fingernails to see what people who live in Pennsylvania and Arizona decide.</p><p>But don’t blame the swing states.

The next day, at his rally at the Wilmington, N.C., airport, which I attended — a clear, hot day on the tarmac — he more or less read the post as part of his prepared remarks:</p><blockquote><p>So let’s talk about our great women, because women, they’ve gone through a lot. Women are poorer than they were four years ago, are less healthy than they were four years ago, are less safe on the streets than they were four years ago, are paying much higher groceries and everything else than they were four years ago, are more stressed and depressed and unhappy than they were four years ago, and are less optimistic and confident in the future than they were just four years ago. I will fix all of that, women; I will fix all of that. And at long last, this national nightmare that we’re going through will be over. Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free; you will no longer be thinking about abortion because it will be where it always had to be, with the states and with the vote of the people.</p></blockquote><p>Setting aside the crime portrait and the sort of Virginia Slims texture of “women will be happy, healthy, confident and free,” clearly this is a sentiment that’s working backward from a deep awareness of abortion bans being a problem, politically, for Trump.</p><p>Trump has really tried to insist that his state-focused approach to abortion access is good and what everyone wants. So much of his politics is about shaping, hammering, subverting, blowing up perceptions — winning through attrition of how people perceive him, an opponent or an event. Abortion, though, doesn’t really work like that; abortion is either legal or illegal, and it’s not as if people don’t notice whether it’s legal in the state they live in, including the activists who want Trump to oppose all abortion.</p><p>This Tuesday, he added a different element — the idea of being the “protector” of women — in Pennsylvania, noting he hoped “you don’t make too much of it”:</p><blockquote><p>You will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. You will no longer be in danger — you’re not going to be in danger any longer — you will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today, you will be protected, and I will be your protector. Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion — that’s all they talk about.</p></blockquote><p>Here, Trump’s presidency would have a kind of leviathan effect on negative emotions; Trump’s speeches this year have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/27/magazine/trump-rallies-rhetoric.html" title="">contained</a>, at times, these kinds of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/28/opinion/nikki-haley-not-leaving-race.html" title="">dark</a> prepared segments about the ruin of America. This one still leads into the discordant note, though, about how women won’t be thinking about abortion, as though people’s lives work that way and people don’t care about the things they actually care about.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2VhODM2MDU1LWRhNjMtNTNiZS04NTJmLTZlZDEyYzY4YTY4Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#nypd-illegal-stop-frisk" data-source-id="100000009719166"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/brent-staples"><img alt="Brent Staples" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-25T17:32:29.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 25, 2024, 1:32 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The New York Police Department has shown repeatedly over decades that it cannot be trusted to do its work in a constitutional manner. The Federal District Court in Manhattan underscored this problem most emphatically when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/opinion/racial-discrimination-in-stop-and-frisk.html" title="">it ruled in 2013 that</a> city officials had willfully ignored “overwhelming proof” that the department’s stop-and-frisk program was violating the Fourth Amendment and discriminating against minority citizens.</p><p>The courts have long ruled that officers can legally stop and detain a person when they have reasonable suspicion that the person is committing, has committed or is about to commit a crime. But in the New York case, the stops were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/opinion/bloomberg-stop-and-frisk-judge.html" title="">often based on race</a> and overwhelmingly targeted the innocent.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/nyregion/nypd-stop-and-frisk-report.html" title="">A court-ordered review</a> of the department’s more recent progress, made public this week, suggests that city officials are thumbing their noses at the stop-and-frisk ruling, which required thorough reforms. As my colleagues Benjamin Weiser and Maria Cramer reported on Monday, the most comprehensive review since 2013 found that the department has “failed at every level” to punish officers who violated the rights of people whom they stopped on the street.</p><p>The report, by James Yates, a retired New York State judge, was ordered by Judge Analisa Torres of the Federal District Court in Manhattan. Yates said that commanding officers at the precinct level were undermining constitutional compliance by tolerating inappropriate stops and failing to supervise their officers. Even so, he noted, “discipline for such failures is close to nonexistent.”</p><p>The report also scrutinized the upper ranks, noting that police commissioners had “demonstrated an inordinate willingness to excuse illegal stops, frisks and searches in the name of ‘good faith’ or ‘lack of malintention,’ relegating constitutional adherence to a lesser rung of discipline.”</p><p>This brings to mind the former police commissioner Edward A. Caban, who resigned this month in connection with one of several investigations that have paralyzed Mayor Eric Adams’s administration. Caban weakened the disciplinary system — such as it was. And as The Times reported this week, one of his final acts was to release “watered-down guidelines for punishing officers for infractions like abuse of authority, discourtesy and misconduct, although not wrongful stop-and-frisk tactics.”</p><p>New Yorkers have a right to go about their lives without experiencing frightening, invasive and wrongful searches. The federal courts should maintain oversight for as long as it takes to bring policing practices in line with the Constitution.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2NkY2E5ZWRjLTU3MWMtNWI3ZS04YWIyLWVjNTc0YTgyMjUwMg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#missouri-republicans-abortion-referendum" data-source-id="100000009718255"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-25T09:06:29.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 25, 2024, 5:06 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abortion rights supporters outside the Missouri State Capitol this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>It’s virtually impossible to get an abortion in Missouri now, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/us/abortion-rights-missouri-south-dakota.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">at least 380,159 people</a> in the state are pretty upset about it. That’s the number of people who signed a petition to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot this November that would restore abortion rights in Missouri, one of the first states to ban abortions after the Supreme Court made that possible in 2022.</p><p>The number of signatures on that petition is extraordinary, more than twice the number required by law. And <a href="https://www.slu.edu/research/research-institute/big-ideas/slu-poll/index.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the most recent poll</a> showed that 52 percent of state residents support the amendment, which would allow abortions until the point of fetal viability. (That includes a third of the Republican respondents, meaning that many of the people who will vote for Donald Trump and other Republicans in a few weeks will also vote for abortion rights.) Missouri is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/politics/abortion-ballot-states.html" title="">one of 10 states</a> with abortion rights measures on the ballot this fall.</p><p>Abortion opponents in Missouri are clearly worried that the amendment will pass, and if you want to see just how worried, take a look at the many ways state Republican officials tried to prevent voters from having a say on the matter:</p><ul><li><p>Attorney General Andrew Bailey <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2023/07/20/missouri-supreme-court-rejects-ags-push-to-inflate-cost-of-abortion-rights-amendment/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refused to sign</a> a required fiscal note on the cost of allowing abortions in the state. The state auditor had said there would be no cost or savings to the amendment, but Bailey insisted it would cost Missouri billions of dollars. His refusal brought the petition process to a halt, until the A.C.L.U. sued him and took the matter to the state Supreme Court, which <a href="https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=197720" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled unanimously</a> that Bailey had no power to substitute his financial estimate for the auditor’s.</p></li><li><p>Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill that would have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/missouri-constitution-amendment-democracy-democrat-voters-filibuster-7996412ccfdfb5b8ee4aa28d77c34610" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increased the threshold</a> for passing constitutional amendments from a simple majority of voters to a majority of voters in a majority of congressional districts, giving more weight to rural rather than urban voters. Republicans backed off after Democrats staged a 50-hour filibuster to block the change.</p></li><li><p>The state’s secretary of state, Jay Ashcroft, <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article291246145.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote a misleading summary</a> of the amendment to appear in polling places, saying it would allow abortion “at any time in pregnancy” and “prohibit any regulation of abortion.” The A.C.L.U. once again had to sue, and a state judge rewrote the summary to reflect its actual language.</p></li><li><p>Republicans filed a suit to get the amendment removed from the ballot, claiming it did not properly identify the statutes to be modified. A circuit court judge ruled in favor of the Republican attempt, but this month <a href="https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2024-09-23/missouri-abortion-amendment-3-supreme-court-decision" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Missouri Supreme Court ruled</a> there is no requirement that the amendment list the statutes.</p></li></ul><p>The amendment now seems to be firmly on the ballot, and so Republicans are resorting to outright lies to stop it.

Trump’s <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/platform" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">platform</a> on this subject could charitably be called sparse; he only mentions the word “epidemic” once, referring to the “migrant crime epidemic.”</p><p>There is a uniquely American bent to this: Individuals can and should make their own choices.

Then it was the slow abandonment of bus lanes (the city is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/street-wars-bus-lanes.html" title="">on track</a> to build just 27 miles of the 150 miles promised by Mayor Eric Adams). And now, bit by bit, New York City’s <a href="https://www.amny.com/news/adrienne-adams-outdoor-dining-street/?ref=hellgatenyc.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overwhelmingly popular</a> outdoor dining is collapsing.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine a more illogical, infuriating and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/nyregion/congestion-pricing-mta-budget-nyc.html" title="">self-defeating</a> series of capitulations than those made by New York’s leadership — from the governor’s office to city boards — to the relatively small demographic of auto-reliant New Yorkers and commuters, as well as those city residents who seem to think their neighborhoods <a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2023/08/03/controversy-al-fresco-big-changes-coming-to-outdoor-dining" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">should resemble quiet suburbs</a>.</p><p>On one street near where I live in Brooklyn, almost all of the dining sheds are gone. In spaces that would once have fed dozens of people in an evening, there instead sits a single car, occasionally two. Where people could have socialized, eaten and supported the local economy, helping small businesses stay afloat, there is now space that serves the <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/25/nyc-transforms-site-of-award-winning-outdoor-dining-space-into-street-parking?ref=hellgatenyc.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">desire to park</a>. Across the city, the story is similar: The sheds have gone, fallen victim to onerous new rules under which just 2,600 restaurants <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/08/05/outdoor-dining-open-restaurants-covid-new-rules/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">applied</a> for outdoor dining permits, a far cry from the more than 12,000 that had used the pandemic-era program.</p><p>For restaurants, the stakes are bleak: They must tear down, at great cost, the structures just recently built, also at great cost. They will often have to <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/new-nyc-outdoor-dining-rules-poison-pill/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lay off staff members</a>. They will lose revenue. And once the structures are down, rebuilding them is costly. Restaurant owners note that dining structures — often professionally built, some award-winning — cost thousands or tens of thousands of dollars to build and cannot be remade on a whim. Once down for a season, they’re probably down for good.</p><p>The city’s mandate that outdoor dining be seasonal, with structures removed each winter, will effectively end the program for those restaurants, since most cannot afford to rebuild every year. Many built the structures only after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/nyregion/nyc-outdoor-dining-restaurants.html" title="">the city promised</a> that outdoor dining would be permanent, even in winter. As one restaurant owner <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/new-nyc-outdoor-dining-rules-poison-pill/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the website HellGate</a>, “I voted for this mayor because he said he wanted to preserve outdoor dining. And he’s not.”</p><p>Outdoor dining’s detractors had many arguments: that it attracted rats (outdoor dining <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/08/oh-rats-experts-say-outdoor-dining-is-not-to-blame-for-the-citys-rodent-problem" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">probably wasn’t to blame</a>), that it was too <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/realestate/outdoor-dining-noise.html" title="">noisy</a> or simply that it <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/parking-spots-are-historic-nyc-outdoor-dining/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blocked</a> their parking spaces. But the system was popular with diners and restaurateurs, and its loss because of these narrow and self-serving complaints is another example of shortsightedness, lack of creativity and choosing an outdated status quo over a vision of a better, healthier city.</p><p>A gutless city government has undermined outdoor dining — adding it to the Second Avenue subway extension, shelved <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/manhattan/transit/2024/06/19/mta-halts-second-avenue-subway-expansion-following-congestion-pricing-pause" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by the rollback of congestion pricing</a> and innumerable bus lanes, in the dustbin of improvements New York City badly needs in order to stay vital.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2NhMTU2ZDYxLTYwZWItNWY3Zi05OGJlLTJjMDA2MTBlMWMzOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#trump-exploited-immigrant-workers" data-source-id="100000009715545"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-alter"><img alt="Jonathan Alter" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-24T09:04:17.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 24, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, N.J., where he employed undocumented workers for years.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Gregory for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>JD Vance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/us/politics/vance-haitian-immigrants-illegal.html" title="">doubled down last week on maligning Haitian residents</a> of Springfield, Ohio, as “illegal aliens,” even as Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of the state that Vance purports to represent in the Senate, told him to knock it off.

But it’s worse than that. In 1980, Donald Trump had a chance to take a stand against using undocumented Polish workers in the New York construction industry. Instead, he hired them to demolish the old Bonwit Teller department store building (including the Art Deco friezes that Trump had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1980/06/09/archives/builder-says-costs-forced-scrapping-of-bonwit-art-threeweek-delay.html" title="">claimed he was going to donate</a> to the Metropolitan Museum of Art) to make way for Trump Tower.</p><p>And Trump exploited these migrants. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/nyregion/trump-tower-illegal-immigrant-workers-union-settlement.html" title="">The Times reported in 2017</a>, Trump “employed a crew of 200 undocumented Polish workers who worked in 12-hour shifts, without gloves, hard hats or masks.” It added: “The workers were paid as little as $4 an hour for their dangerous labor, less than half the union wage, if they got paid at all.”</p><p>As usual, Trump feigned ignorance, but in 1998 a judge ruled that he “should have known,” and the Trump Organization settled the case for $1.38 million.</p><p>This was hardly a hypocritical one-off. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/my-whole-town-practically-lived-there-from-costa-rica-to-new-jersey-a-pipeline-of-illegal-workers-for-trump-goes-back-years/2019/02/08/8cdbc1dc-2971-11e9-97b3-ae59fbae7960_story.html?noredirect=on" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an exhaustive 2019 Washington Post report</a>, Trump illegally employed undocumented immigrant housekeepers, cooks, landscapers, greenskeepers, waiters, bellhops, farm hands and caddies at 11 Trump Organization properties in Florida, New Jersey, New York and Virginia.</p><p>When reporters asked Trump to comment, he said, “Probably every club in the United States has that, because it seems to me, from what I understand, a way that people did business.”</p><p>Contrast this “everybody does it” excuse for breaking the law with the way the companies that are reviving Springfield, Ohio, handle employment. They are obeying the law and hiring properly documented Haitians to fill their many vacancies. Unlike Trump, these employers treat their workers — many of them victims of unspeakable violence in Haiti — with dignity and respect.</p><p>Their reward?

How well are we coping with the global warming we’ve already got?</p><p>A new, eye-opening paper suggests the distressing answer is not very well at all. In “Are We Adapting to Climate Change?” — a preprint <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32985#:~:text=Using%20comprehensive%20panel%20data%20across,evidence%20of%20adaptation%20to%20date." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research — a distinguished group of researchers examined human outcomes of weather extremes over the last 50 years. For each of 21 climate impacts — for instance, on mortality, agricultural productivity and damages from flooding and hurricanes — they asked whether the impact of a given shock had shrunk in recent decades, as the world has grown wealthier, more technologically advanced and more aware of the risks of warming.</p><p>In certain corners of the climate and public policy worlds, it is taken for granted that it has — that adaptation has been a hugely underappreciated success story, illustrated by charts of declining deaths from extreme weather, and a success story that is poised to continue, even on a hotter and more ragged planet. But by drilling into the historical record, the authors of the new paper uncovered a very different story from the recent past, which implies a much more challenging one about the future.</p><p>“We find limited evidence of adaptation to date,” they wrote. On three-quarters of the impacts they studied, our vulnerability to warming hasn’t improved at all, meaning that a given climate event would be just as damaging as 50 years ago — perhaps more damaging.</p><p>“In many settings,” they wrote, “sensitivities appear to be growing, even in wealthy countries.”</p><p>The results weren’t uniformly bleak. The researchers found improving climate sensitivity when it comes to American corn and European wheat yields, some European mortality impacts, the relationship between income and temperature within the United States, and the relationship between temperature and both violent crime and injury mortality in the United States. But those are only six of the 21 case studies; in the others, sensitivities either worsened or remained unimproved.</p><p>We know, of course, that climate change will worsen from here. Even relatively optimistic scenarios suggest the world is due for roughly twice as much of a rise in temperature as we’ve seen to date, when warming has already brought the planet outside the range of conditions that have enclosed and supported everything we know as human history.</p><p>As the authors were careful to emphasize, adaptation failures to this point are not signs that adaptation is impossible or foolish. But they suggest that almost certainly we’re going to have to do a whole lot more preparation for the stiffer climate tests to come.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzViMDc3ZGEwLWRhNmItNTg0Yy1hNGM5LWZlMzIwMGU3MzBiNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#nixon-marijuana-unjust" data-source-id="100000009714026"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/brent-staples"><img alt="Brent Staples" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-23T15:49:00.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 23, 2024, 11:49 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>President Richard Nixon insisted on classifying marijuana as a dangerous drug <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-science-behind-the-dea-s-long-war-on-marijuana/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on par with heroin</a>, despite abundant evidence to the contrary.

During one conversation, he referred to a 30-year sentence that had come to his attention as “ridiculous.”</p><p>Why did the president preserve a system of punishment he knew to be unjust? Nearly a decade ago, <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the journalist Dan Baum, writing in Harper’s Magazine,</a> reported putting the question to John Ehrlichman, Nixon’s political adviser and Watergate co-conspirator.</p><p>According to Baum, Ehrlichman said Nixon’s drug policy was designed to punish two groups of enemies, the antiwar left and Black activists. “We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or Black,” Ehrlichman said, “but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and Blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. … Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”</p><p>Nixon’s marijuana tapes come to light as legalization is sweeping the nation. Recreational use of marijuana is now permitted in <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/marijuana-overview.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">24 states and Washington, D.C.</a>, and medical use is established in <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">38 states</a>.

I think this is crucial to understanding why Trump is beatable in November, and more specifically why he has been so stuck and unable to build past 47 percent in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">national polling averages</a> — despite having an edge with voters on issues they care most about, like the economy and immigration.</p></li><li><p>One of the paradoxes about Trump is that he badly wants to be liked by people and yet says and does things that make him off-putting to many voters. Most Americans were taught at an early age not to whine, not to be a sore loser and not to break the rules. In my conversations with voters and Times Opinion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/focus-groups" title="">focus groups</a> over the years, Trump gets little sympathy for his constant grievances from people outside his MAGA base because he puts his interests ahead of the country’s.</p></li><li><p>To wit: Here is a man who faced two assassination attempts this summer, and has no evident or sustained “sympathy vote” to show for it, even from those who might be inclined to support him. It would be puzzling with any other candidate — surely, to face what Trump faced, you would gain sympathy from some voters for being a victim and some admiration for bouncing back. But Trump receives little of either beyond his base, if the polls and interviews are any measure.</p></li><li><p>Last week I asked our Times Opinion panel of 14 young, undecided voters for their reactions to the second assassination attempt, how it made them feel about Trump, and whether it made them more likely to vote for him. I was struck by how little sympathy they felt for Trump, and how his personal behavior and political record have made him such a figure of distaste for centrist voters even in the context of assassination attempts.</p></li><li><p>“I am worried that he might be mentally unfit to be president after this,” said Jasper, 25, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/17/opinion/politics/17focus-group-persuadable-voters-2.html" title="">who had been leaning toward Trump</a> in this election. Lillian, 27, said the apparent assassination attempt was “really shocking” but it did not affect her thinking about him. McLane, 25, who wrote in Mitt Romney’s name on the ballot for president in 2020, said she disagreed with Trump’s claim that the attack was due to “inflammatory language” from Democrats. “That’s far too simple. I imagine the gunman was angry or depressed, and latched onto the polarized environment and rhetoric,” she said.</p></li><li><p>With Trump and Harris heading into the final six weeks of the election, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-newly-popular-harris-challenging-trump-change-rcna171308" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new polls</a> showing a bit more <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-harris-poll-debate-economy-09-22-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">momentum for Harris</a>, Trump needs to start winning over more people. No doubt he has ability — his staying power with such a large fraction of voters is testament to his base appeal. But are enough undecided and swing voters really still open to him? That’s his big challenge, and Harris’s big opportunity.</p></li></ul></div></div></section></div></div>
