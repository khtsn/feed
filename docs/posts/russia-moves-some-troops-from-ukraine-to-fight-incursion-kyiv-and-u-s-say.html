That included the Kursk region of western Russia, where the incursion has taken place, he said.</p><p>A United States official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion-war.html" title="">said that Russia had pulled out small numbers of troops from Ukraine</a>, but he did not specify their location or the number of soldiers involved.</p><p>Analysts say that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion.html" title="">one of the goals of the Ukrainian offensive</a> is to draw Russian forces away from the front lines in Ukraine to relieve Ukrainian troops struggling to push back relentless Russian attacks. But it is too early to say whether the latest Russian troop movements will allow that to happen, they say.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In particular, there is little sign that Moscow has redeployed troops from eastern Ukraine, where Russia has been steadily advancing in recent months. Instead, the Russian Army appears to have sent in reinforcements drawn mainly from less combat-ready units based in northern Russia and Ukraine, military experts say.</p><p>“The Russian strategy is to avoid drawing from units in the Donetsk direction as much as possible,” said Serhii Kuzan, the chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, an independent research group, referring to the region in eastern Ukraine that is on the front line. “The Russians are reluctant to do this, because it would jeopardize all the gains of their summer offensive campaign.”</p></div></div><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="kursk-incursion-map" data-id="100000009628060" data-source-id="100000009628060"><div data-sourceid="100000009628060" id="embed-id-100000009628060">

Mr. Kasciunas was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3813120042338625" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visiting President Volodymyr Zelensky</a> in Kyiv.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ukrainian military officials said that Russian assaults in the Donetsk region had continued unabated over the past week, despite the new Ukrainian offensive. Russian troops have continued to slowly advance in or toward the frontline towns of Chasiv Yar, Niu York, Pokrovsk and Toretsk, they say.</p><p>Oleksandr Bordiian, a spokesman for the 32nd Separate Mechanize Brigade, which is fighting near Toretsk, <a href="https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-toretskyi-napriamok-boi/33076794.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the Ukrainian news media</a> on Tuesday that Ukraine’s attacks in the Kursk region “have not yet had any impact on the density of assaults and shelling in our direction.” A medic fighting in another brigade near Toretsk also said on Wednesday that there had been no changes on that section of the front.</p><p>Military analysts say that Kyiv will need to expand or hold onto its gains in western Russia long enough to compel Moscow to divert significant forces from the battlefield in Ukraine.</p><p>Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine’s top commander, <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/11366" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Mr. Zelensky</a> on Wednesday that Ukrainian troops had advanced up to two kilometers, about 1.2 miles, in the Kursk region since the beginning of the day. He also said that more than 100 Russian soldiers had been captured during the day. His claims could not be independently verified.</p><p>After quick successes in the early days of the offensive, the Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region appear to have slowed, according to maps of the battlefield compiled by independent analysts. Ukrainian troops are now attacking to the north and south of the bulge they have carved out into Russian territory, but are facing more Russian resistance, the maps show.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group, which scrutinizes footage from the battlefield, said on Tuesday evening that an attack by Ukrainian troops on Giri, a village southeast of the initial Ukrainian assault and about eight miles from the Ukrainian border, had likely been repelled. “They suffered significant losses and likely had to retreat,” Mr. Kastehelmi <a href="https://x.com/emilkastehelmi/status/1823430566080901614" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>.</p><p>The Ukrainian raids appear to have a strategy of probing and destabilizing Russian defenses. After several days of Ukrainian attacks on the Belgorod region, which borders the Kursk region, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, declared a state of emergency on Wednesday.</p><p>Whether Ukraine can continue to conduct these raids depends on the number of troops it can commit to the fight. Its forces are stretched thin, and Kyiv has already sent into the offensive experienced units that were pulled from the front lines in eastern Ukraine.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Armees_Gouv/status/1822975772597825564" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">France’s defense ministry</a> said on Monday that Kyiv’s forces “appear to have reduced the pace of their initial advance, but are consolidating their positions” in the territory they have already captured.</p><p>But holding on to a position that can be attacked from multiple sides will prove difficult, <a href="https://x.com/WarintheFuture/status/1822827209285136423" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysts say</a>. Mr. Kuzan, of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, also noted that any static Ukrainian position would be exposed to Russian airstrikes. Such a dynamic, he said, “immediately invites the use of aviation, guided bombs and ballistic missiles.”</p><p>Olha Konovalova<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
