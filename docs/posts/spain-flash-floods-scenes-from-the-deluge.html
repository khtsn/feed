    <h1>Spain Flash Floods: Scenes From the Deluge</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Flash flooding across Spain killed at least 95 people this week after torrential rain left towns and villages submerged and turned streets into rivers in the eastern and southern parts of the country. In some areas, several months’ worth of rain fell in a single day.</p><p>Since Monday, when the deluge began, residents in affected areas have struggled to clear mud and tree-covered streets. Cars and trucks were swept away and dumped in piles, blocking roads. Rescuers have carried out evacuations by helicopter and boat, and wide swaths of the country have been left without electricity.</p><p>Most of the deaths occurred in the region of Valencia, on Spain’s eastern coast. With roads impassable and bridges broken, some communities were completely cut off.</p><p>The death toll is expected to rise as some people are still missing, and more rain is forecast.</p></div></div>
