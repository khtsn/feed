He said he had spent about $2.5 million to renovate Annunciation, including about $325,000 for its massive pipe organ.</p><p>When approached by Ms. Carpenter’s representatives, he glanced at the script for the video and agreed to a daylong rental for $5,000.

Long before entering the priesthood, he studied at the Culinary Institute of America; now he is the host of a cooking show called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6ogikZNfnw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breaking Bread</a>,” the author of a cookbook by the same name and the purveyor of “A Taste of Heaven,” a tomato sauce.</p><p>He has also made considerable money as an investor — including in the New York real estate market — before and even after he was ordained.</p><p>In 1980, he bought a home in Brooklyn for himself, his sister and his mother to live in. He paid $50,000 and about a decade later sold it for about $225,000. He later bought his mother her own apartment and inherited a windfall profit after she died.</p><p>He continued to buy low and sell high. With his friend Monsignor Cassato, he bought and later sold a house in Quogue, on Long Island, netting nearly $400,000. Together they bought a condominium in Pompano Beach, Fla., and a house in Westhampton Beach, N.Y., with four bedrooms and a poolside kitchen. They bought the house for $850,000 and listed it for sale this summer for $2.5 million.

At a Fat Tuesday celebration a few years ago held at Tiro a Segno, a private Italian heritage club in Manhattan, Dr. Ciuffo introduced himself to Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, telling him that he was a parishioner of Monsignor Gigantiello’s.</p><p>“Oh, that Monsignor Jamie,” Dr. Ciuffo said the archbishop said to him in a jovial tone. “Better hold on to your wallet!”</p><p>Mr. Vivolo said that given Monsignor Gigantiello’s talents, Bishop Brennan’s punishment “is too much.”</p><p>“How do you take a guy who annually raises millions for the diocesan schools, and tell him he is not allowed to fund-raise for the church?” he said. “It’s like cutting your nose to spite your face.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><h2 id="link-641a322b">A Fateful Friendship</h2><p>Monsignor Gigantiello’s brief connection to Sabrina Carpenter may have been the start of his troubles. His long relationship with Mr. Carone compounded the situation.</p><p>In 2008, long before Mr. Carone went to work for Mr. Adams, Monsignor Gigantiello reached out to him as part of his fund-raising efforts for the church. Mr. Carone, a lawyer, entrepreneur and investor, helped set up dinners at the rectory where the priest could get to know other business leaders in the community.</p><p>The monsignor and Mr. Carone were entwined in a particularly Brooklyn-Italian-American-Catholic way: Mr. Carone’s mother had known Monsignor Cassato since they were in grade school together at a neighborhood Catholic school. When Mr. Carone’s father died, Monsignor Cassato brought with him to the wake a priest he was mentoring: Jamie Gigantiello.</p><p>From there, Mr. Carone and Monsignor Gigantiello grew to be close friends. “Monsignor Jamie has a unique way of bringing our Catholic community together through our faith, unlike anyone I have ever experienced,” Mr. Carone said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many parishioners at Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, seen here, and Our Lady of Mount Carmel revere Monsignor Gigantiello.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Over the years, the priest sought Mr. Carone’s help investing the profits he generated from real estate.</p><p>In 2018, Monsignor Gigantiello said, he turned to Mr. Carone for help investing the parish’s money, too. The diocese had given a condo developer a long-term lease on church property across the street from Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary — a deal in which the developer initially paid the parish $1 million.</p><p>The monsignor said he asked Mr. Carone to invest the money on the parish’s behalf. He did not ask for specifics about the investment. “He was a dear friend that I trusted,” he said.</p><p>By 2021, Mr. Carone’s firm had repaid the parish’s $1 million, along with a return of about $120,000.</p><p>Monsignor Gigantiello said he then asked Mr. Carone to invest another $900,000 on behalf of the parish.

The documentation that the diocese did find for one transaction showed only that a company associated with Mr. Carone had pledged to repay the parish’s money with interest — an arrangement the diocese sees as an apparent loan.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Carone denied that the transaction was a loan, and said he had never needed or taken a loan from a church.

There clearly is a conflict between personalities now.”</p><p>In the last two weeks, that conflict has created yet another strange subplot: An administrator sent by Bishop Brennan to oversee Monsignor Gigantiello’s parish was removed from his post after the monsignor and others accused him of using terms like “Goombah” and “the Mob” to describe Italians.</p><p>After the monsignor turned over rectory surveillance video of the man uttering the slurs, the bishop removed the administrator — but castigated the monsignor for recording private conversations. Now, lawyers are duking it out over whether the slurs or the surreptitious recordings were the greater sin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-23"><div><h2 id="link-7037b9e9">Leaving His Mark</h2><p>On a recent Sunday at Our Lady of Mount Carmel, there was standing room only as Monsignor Gigantiello conducted Mass in elaborate green and white vestments.</p><p>His service began with a procession of children, and then a congregant delivered a reading in Italian. Before the communion sacrament, loved ones of those who had died this year were invited to the altar to light candles. Monsignor Gigantiello added some levity by leading the congregation in singing “Happy Birthday” to those who had birthdays that week.</p><p>Before the service concluded, there were announcements, including from a member of the parish council. He made reference to the tension with the bishop and the diocese. “We’re not going to stand around and let anyone — I don’t care who — push us around,” the councilman said. “We support our church and we support our pastor.” Much of the congregation began to applaud.</p><p>The monsignor said the entire drama had left him shaken and unsure of who to trust. “It’s sad when the D.O.J. treats you better and with more respect than your own bishop,” he said.</p><p>Whatever happens next, he has left his stamp on the parish. On a wall in a rec room at Our Lady of Mount Carmel is a mural he commissioned. It shows Monsignor Gigantiello standing above a group of parishioners, reaching up toward the heavens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-48"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Monsignor Gigantiello commissioned a mural of himself and parishioners in a rec room at one of his churches, Our Lady of Mount Carmel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Nov. 21, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a church where Monsignor Gigantiello is pastor.
