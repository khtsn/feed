But Mr. Gallant had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/middleeast/gantz-quits-israel-netanyahu.html" title="">increasingly been viewed</a> as an internal opponent, and he has been a more moderate voice within the government on security issues.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu, who announced the decision in a video statement issued by his office, said, “significant gaps on handling the war” emerged between him and Mr. Gallant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He named Israel Katz, the foreign minister, as the new defense minister, and said he offered Gideon Saar, a hard-liner, to replace Mr. Katz as foreign minister and formally bring his party into the coalition.</p><p>The prime minister’s decision comes at an extraordinary moment for Israel. Its military is fighting against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, two groups backed by Iran, and bracing for possible Iranian attack in a cycle of retaliatory strikes. It is also conducting raids in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p><p>Israel’s closest ally, the United States, is voting in a presidential election that could have major implications for the American approach to the war in the Middle East. Mr. Gallant maintained close contact with senior U.S. officials, who often chose to communicate with him instead of Mr. Netanyahu, a dynamic that frustrated the Israeli prime minister. On Monday, Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, called Mr. Gallant to discuss the situation in Gaza and Lebanon.</p><p>The decision also comes amid a newly unfolding national security scandal. The Israeli authorities are investigating a spokesman who has been working over the past year in Mr. Netanyahu’s office and is suspected of illegally obtaining and leaking classified documents to the news media.</p><p>Mr. Katz, an ally of the prime minister, was unlikely to stand in the way of Mr. Netanyahu’s approach to cease-fire talks, which critics say have undermined the possibility of a deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Gallant also clashed with Mr. Netanyahu over important domestic political issues, particularly the conscription ultra-Orthodox Israelis.</p><p>“At the height of a war, complete trust is needed between the prime minister and the defense minister,” Mr. Netanyahu said in the video statement on Tuesday. “In recent months, that trust between the defense minister and I was damaged.”</p><p>In a letter dated Nov. 5, Mr. Netanyahu informed Mr. Gallant that he would end his term as defense minister within 48 hours of receiving the notice.</p><p>Minutes after Mr. Netanyahu released his statement, Mr. Gallant, 65, posted on social media that Israel’s security “was and will always remain my life’s mission.” He did not directly address his dismissal.</p><p>The prime minister had dismissed Mr. Gallant before, months before the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack that began the war in Gaza. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/10/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gallant.html" title="">reversed his decision</a> days later.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
