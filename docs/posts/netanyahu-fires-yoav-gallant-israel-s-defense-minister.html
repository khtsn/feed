    <h1>Netanyahu Fires Yoav Gallant, Israel’s Defense Minister</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, on Tuesday after disagreements between the two men over the prosecution of the war in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s decision to sideline Mr. Gallant, a powerful figure within his own party, Likud, is a dramatic step for the prime minister. But Mr. Gallant had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/middleeast/gantz-quits-israel-netanyahu.html" title="">increasingly been viewed</a> as an internal opponent, and he has been a more moderate voice within the government on security issues.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu, who announced the decision in a video statement issued by his office, said, “significant gaps on handling the battle” emerged between him and Mr. Gallant. He named Israel Katz, the foreign minister, as the new defense minister, and said Gideon Sa&#39;ar would replace Mr. Katz as foreign minister.</p><p>“At the height of a war, complete trust is needed between the prime minister and the defense minister,” Mr. Netanyahu said in the video statement. “In recent months, that trust between me and the defense minister was damaged.”</p></div></div>
