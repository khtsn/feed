    <h1>A Coastal New England Town’s ‘Ornery’ Vandal: A Woodpecker</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The first casualty was a side-view mirror.</p><p>Then another and another and another, until residents of one New England enclave said that the number had reached at least 20. The culprit apparently did not believe that it was bad luck to break mirrors — and still doesn’t.</p><p>Janelle Favaloro, 59, who has lived in the Squam Hill section of Rockport, Mass., for 36 years, put out an A.P.B. on Facebook for the menace.</p><p>“We have a vandal in the neighborhood,” Ms. Favaloro wrote. “He was described as 18 to 24 inches tall, wearing black and white with a red hat.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-1"><div><figcaption><span>When Janelle Favaloro and her husband saw cracked mirrors in their driveway, they initially blamed their son. “He was like, ‘I don’t know. It wasn’t me.’”</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The brazen suspect, who would become known to many in the neighborhood, was actually a pileated woodpecker, one of the largest forest bird species on the continent.</p><p>The male bird was marking his turf during mating season, which may explain some of the aggression. Residents recognized the bird by the distinctive <a href="https://www.birdnote.org/explore/field-notes/2013/03/pileated-woodpecker" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">red malar stripe</a> along its cheekbone area, as well as by its size.</p><p>In the beginning, Ms. Favaloro nicknamed him “the pileated pillager.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-4"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/22/23xp-woodpecker-8705-cover/23xp-woodpecker-8705-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The pileated woodpecker drilling into a tree. The bird is what one expert called the “biomechanical equivalent of a hammer.”</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His siege is now entering its second month, bemusing residents and testing their ingenuity to prevent more widespread damage. Those without folding mirrors or garages have resorted to wrapping mirrors in plastic bags, sweatshirts or towels. But the angry bird would not be stopped, cracking the driver’s side window of at least one man’s pickup truck while he was sitting in it, the man said.</p><p>“When it landed on the window, I thought it was my girlfriend tapping on the window,” said Mike Foster, 30, who owns a landscaping business. “I was like, ‘Oh, I’m in trouble.’ It was staring me right in the eyes for a solid 30 seconds.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Foster said the tinted glass of his Ford F-350 pickup truck has a “nice big crack.” By the time he had grabbed his phone to get a photo of the bird, he said, it flew off. He managed to capture only a slightly blurry image of the woodpecker in flight.</p><p>“That woodpecker is looking at 30 years to life right now, I think,” he said, chuckling.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>When the bird landed on the window of Mike Foster’s truck, he thought it was his “girlfriend tapping on the window.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Billy Hickey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>By the time Mr. Foster had grabbed his phone, the bird had taken off.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Foster</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Pileated woodpeckers are notoriously territorial, especially during mating season, said Matthew Fuxjager, a co-director of the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology graduate program at Brown University. That period can last a few months as the weather warms.</p><p>“They’re a ferocious bird, and they’re really strong,” he said, adding, “it’s the biomechanical equivalent of a hammer.”</p><p>He said that it was more than likely the same woodpecker tormenting the residents of Rockport. Birds can become agitated upon seeing their reflections, he said, but the Rockport woodpecker’s behavior “is pretty odd.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Woodpeckers make their signature drumming noises to announce their presence to potential mates and rivals, the professor said. To study the territorial behavior of woodpeckers, he said, researchers would play sounds of other woodpeckers on a speaker, prompting them to fly up to the speaker and tap at it aggressively.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23xp-woodpecker-TOP-still-tvhc/23xp-woodpecker-TOP-still-tvhc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23xp-woodpecker-TOP-still-tvhc/23xp-woodpecker-TOP-still-tvhc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23xp-woodpecker-TOP-still-tvhc/23xp-woodpecker-TOP-still-tvhc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A woodpecker on a side view window of a silver car.

It’s on Cape Ann, a coastal destination about 40 miles northeast of Boston that is a popular vacation spot.</p><p>Ms. Favaloro first noticed something unusual in late March, when, she said, both mirrors on a van belonging to her family’s home heating oil company had been broken while it was parked in the yard. Also nailed: a pickup truck. She said that she and her husband were puzzled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“He kind of blamed our son,” she said. “He was like, ‘I don’t know.

She got a photo of the bird, and soon the image spread online and in the local news media, drawing the attention of <a href="https://www.gloucestertimes.com/news/local_news/woodpecker-shattering-car-mirrors-this-mating-season/article_bc659484-5028-4ef3-b5c6-9f3e7ee0f369.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Gloucester Daily Times</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-16"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Janelle Favaloro said she held no bad feelings toward the woodpecker. “It’s hard to be mad at him,” she said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Billy Hickey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Favaloro believes the bird sees his reflection as competition during mating season.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Janelle Favaloro</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“He’s trying to eliminate his competition,” she said. “When he looks in the mirror, that’s what he sees.
