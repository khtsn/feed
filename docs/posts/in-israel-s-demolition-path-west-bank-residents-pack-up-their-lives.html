Israeli officials, who say the purpose of the campaign is to target militants and their weapons, have said the military should be prepared to remain in the camps for a year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The military has said the latest demolition of homes in Tulkarm was meant to make the city’s two camps, Tulkarm and Nur Shams, more accessible to Israeli forces and to prevent militants from regrouping there.</p><p>Many Palestinians believe Israel is seeking to transform the camps, which have housed refugees and their descendants, into neighborhoods like the rest of Tulkarm.</p><p>In recent days, Israel has allowed some residents of the camps to return to their homes to gather their belongings.</p><p>Nasr al-Jundi, 45, a resident of Nur Shams, said he only had time to grab only some of his belongings on Tuesday, including clothing, a television, a fan, a microwave and a sauté pan.</p><p>“They’re taking away my dreams,” he said.</p><p>Later, residents of the camp assembled on a nearby hill, watching a bulldozer knock down homes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-4"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure
