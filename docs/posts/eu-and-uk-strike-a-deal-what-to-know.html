Diplomats have been negotiating for weeks on the plans, which are expected to set the tone for relations at a critical moment, as Russia’s war in Ukraine grinds on and as the United States urges European nations to shoulder a greater responsibility for their own security.</p><p>“The E.U. and U.K. are providers of global stability,” Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council and one of the officials attending the summit, said on Monday. “We must be guardians of the rules based global order.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The defense deal lays the groundwork for Britain to eventually become a bigger part of European defense efforts, including a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/world/europe/europe-trump-ukraine-defense.html" title="">150 billion euro</a> loan program for joint procurement and investment. That plan is largely limited to E.U. nations and select allies, and Britain has been eager to take part.</p><p>The deal “will pave the way for the U.K. defense industry to participate,” the British <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-secures-new-agreement-with-eu-to-benefit-british-people?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&amp;utm_source=a6d00dda-138b-4403-af12-ce7ff1aaa38e&amp;utm_content=immediately" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government said</a>.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/3w3hhlxz/eu-uk-summit_sdp.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the defense</a> partnership, the two sides agreed to biannual meetings between Kaja Kallas — the E.U.’s top diplomat — and the British foreign and defense secretaries, as well as more cooperation on crisis management exercises and improved information sharing, including of classified information.</p><h2 id="link-471f784e">What was agreed on trade and immigration?</h2><p>The partners agreed to plan on relaxing some post-Brexit trade barriers to make it easier for animals and food to move between the two economies without onerous sanitation certifications and checks. And, as the British emphasized, it will now be possible for the nation’s producers to again sell raw meat products into the bloc, including burgers and sausages. </p><p>In return, Britain will have to make sure that it permanently aligns with European Union food safety and animal welfare rules.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And the two sides also agreed to work more closely together on detecting and deterring illegal migration.</p><h2 id="link-2eee6617">What have been the sticking points?</h2><p>Reaching an agreement was far from seamless. Europeans — and particularly coastal countries like France and Belgium — insisted that Britain extend access to U.K. fishing waters for more than a few years. Fishing is a politically sensitive topic, and the British side was hesitant to make that move.</p><p>After discussions that went to the last minute, the two sides agreed that they would allow European boats to access British fishing waters until June 30, 2038. That’s not the indefinite extension that some in Europe wanted, but it is a far longer window than the four years that the British had initially suggested.</p><p>“This agreement brings stability and predictability for fishermen and fisherwomen on both sides of the channel,” said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission and one of the attendees in London on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>French fishing boats protesting post-Brexit restrictions in front of the port of Saint Helier off the British Island of Jersey in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sameer Al-Doumy/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Likewise, tensions had emerged over a youth mobility program, which is meant to give young people from both sides access to each other’s countries. Europe was pushing for lower tuition for E.U. students who study at U.K. universities. Their British counterparts argued that granting that access would be too expensive.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the end, the two sides agreed to “work toward” a plan — rebranded the “youth experience” scheme, rather than the “youth mobility” scheme, to avoid any hint of immigration.</p><p>“The exact conditions related to this scheme will be decided during the negotiations,” according to a European Union <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_25_1268" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fact sheet</a>.</p><p>In fact, much of the final deal is broad-brush — a plan to collaborate in the future, but one with details that remain to be determined.</p><h2 id="link-1e435b59">What are the politics?</h2><p>For the European Union, striking new trade and security agreements is an important way to prove to the United States that it is an economic and diplomatic power to be reckoned with.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>President Trump has hit Europe with several waves of tariffs and is only beginning to make deals to de-escalate the situation. While Britain has struck a preliminary deal with the U.S., the European Union has made limited progress toward one.</p><p>And both partners see a need for greater collaboration in a world where the United States is a less-willing supporter of its traditional allies. Britain’s defense industry could benefit from being included in Europe’s push to rearm, and Europe could benefit from Britain’s military capabilities.</p><p>But the partners also face domestic pressure to defend their own interests — and Keir Starmer, Britain’s prime minister, faced particularly stark criticism as the deal became public.</p><p>The insurgent Reform U.K. party, led by Nigel Farage, a Trump ally and famous Brexit backer, has attacked the proposed <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/britain-needs-labor-shortage-not-eu-youth-mobility-nigel-farages-richard-tice/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">youth experience plan</a>.</p><p>On Monday, headlines in some British publications made it clear that Mr. Starmer would also face backlash over other aspects of the deal.</p><p>“This humiliation is only the beginning,” read one on the front page of The Telegraph. “Starmer rejects claim ‘win-win’ UK-EU deal has sold out fishing sector,” read another in The Guardian.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>May 19, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier photo caption accompanying this article misstated the title of Ursula von der Leyen. She is the president of the European Commission, not the European Union.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Jeanna Smialek is the Brussels bureau chief for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
