    <h1>Elon Musk, His 16-Foot Wall and the Feud With His Texas Neighbors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>At first, residents of the upscale cul-de-sac in West Lake Hills, Texas, did not know who had moved into the 6,900-square-foot, six-bedroom mansion next door.</p><p>Then construction workers arrived to erect a 16-foot chain-link fence around the $6 million property, which is one of four homes on the leafy street. They also installed an outward-facing camera. Next, a fleet of cars — many of them Teslas — began parking on the street. Three times a day, a shift change signaled security personnel coming and going at the house. Once, the driver of a passing car shouted late at night that he was looking for a party at “E’s house.”</p><p>No one liked the commotion, or the traffic, or the keypad-activated gate opening and closing for workers and cars at all hours. So even when they learned through word of mouth that their new neighbor was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-trump.html" title="">Elon Musk</a>, the world’s richest man, that did not stop some of them from grousing to the City of West Lake Hills about his mansion.</p><p>The complaints have since escalated into an uproar over city ordinances, permits and exceptions known as variances — so much so that the matter of Mr. Musk’s house landed in a contentious Zoning and Planning Commission meeting last month. The debate is headed next to a West Lake Hills City Council session, scheduled for May 14.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Transporting service employees to other houses, leaving their cars on our quiet streets, hauling laundry to and fro to other houses has to stop,” Paul Hemmer, a neighbor and the main complainant, wrote to the Zoning and Planning Commission. The letter was also signed by the occupants of the two other houses on the street.</p><p>For the past few months, Mr. Musk, 53, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/musk-federal-bureaucracy-takeover.html" title="">bulldozed his way across Washington</a>, flouting long-established traditions and hacking away at what he deemed to be unnecessary federal bureaucracy. But in his own backyard outside Austin, the tech billionaire has become mired in a maze of local regulations and red tape. No one, it seems, is rich enough to escape the neighbors.</p><p>Moguls including <a href="https://padailypost.com/2017/11/15/zuckerberg-builds-new-houses-near-his-palo-alto-home/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mark Zuckerberg</a> have sometimes hit the limits of their wealth and connections in disagreements over their luxury homes. So has Mr. Musk, who is so far losing against the municipal bureaucracy in West Lake Hills. He and his employees did not obtain permits for a metal gate and the fence built around the property, making the chain-link structure 10 feet taller than was allowed, local records showed. In total, the construction violated six city ordinances. After some neighbors protested, Mr. Musk’s team tried to gain retroactive permission for the projects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A sign saying “West Lake Hills Municipal Offices,” seen between two tree trunks." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb/00biz-musk-neighbors-01-gktb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/72b0e4c8-1195-5f56-8956-2e87598735bf" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk owns a mansion in the small city of West Lake Hills, Texas, through a limited liability company.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But Jim Pledger, one of the six commissioners on the West Lake Hills Zoning and Planning Commission, said he and his colleagues voted unanimously last month against recommending that the homeowner — he was careful not to name Mr. Musk — be granted variances for the projects. If an exception was made, Mr. Pledger said, “we’d incentivize people to break the rules.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Unless the City Council disagrees with that decision, Mr. Musk faces the prospect of tearing down the fence and gate or changing them to comply with the town’s rules.</p><p>Mr. Musk did not return requests for comment. A house manager linked to the property declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s history in Texas is relatively recent. The tech mogul, who oversees six companies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/texas-elon-musk.html" title="">moved</a> most of his business operations to the state from California starting around 2021. He has built factories for his electric vehicle company, Tesla, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/05/us/elon-musk-starbase-texas.html" title="">his rocket company, SpaceX</a>, and his tunneling venture, the Boring Company, around Austin and neighboring Bastrop.</p><p>Mr. Musk also moved himself to Austin. He initially wanted to build houses for himself and his children (he has at least 13) on hundreds of acres that he bought there. After the plan fell through, he looked at other properties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view of the Austin skyline from West Lake Hills.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In 2022, Mr. Musk purchased the West Lake Hills home through a limited liability company, which was named after the street where the property sits. The house is in the middle of a residential neighborhood at the bottom of about two acres of sloping land off a narrow public road, making security challenging.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Castles are supposed to be built on hills, right?” said Anne Yeakel, a longtime West Lake Hills resident who lives around the corner. “These were sophisticated buyers, and if security was the prime directive, this was not the house for it.”</p><p>Mr. Musk and his staff did not introduce themselves to the neighbors. Few residents have seen him there. But word traveled fast in the community of 3,400, and soon everyone knew he had moved in.</p><p>“It’s common knowledge here,” Ms. Yeakel said.</p><p>The mansion was one of three that Mr. Musk bought in the area over the last three years to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/business/elon-musk-children-compound.html" title="">create a compound</a> for his children and their mothers. At one point, Claire Boucher, known as the musician Grimes, lived with Mr. Musk and their three children in the house. Shivon Zilis, a brain technology executive who has four children with Mr. Musk, lives about a 10-minute walk away. Mr. Musk also purchased another Tuscan-style mansion about a year ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Musk and Shivon Zilis, mother of four of his children, talking with the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, at a presidential inauguration party in January.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evan Vucci/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Neighbors soon grew frustrated with the constant hubbub at the house. They saw people coming and going carrying gun holsters, as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/technology/elon-musk-security.html" title="">security team</a> ballooned along with Mr. Musk’s safety concerns. Though Texas has permissive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/us/texas-guns-law-permits.html" title="">gun laws</a>, the activity stood out.</p><p>“I call that place Fort Knox,” said Mr. Hemmer, a retired real estate agent who lives across the street and is president of the neighborhood homeowners association.</p><p>The house was quieter on days when Mr. Musk was not in town, neighbors said, especially in recent months, when he lived mostly in Washington to advise President Trump. Now residents are bracing for Mr. Musk’s return, after he said he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html" title="">spend less time in the capital</a>.</p><p>Some neighbors became particularly annoyed at the hulking fence in front of the mansion, as well as the giant metal gate at the other end of the property, which appears to serve as an employee entrance.</p><p>Mr. Hemmer, who has long owned a Tesla, grew so frustrated with his neighbor that he began flying a drone over the house to check for city violations, and he keeps a video camera trained on the property around the clock. Last year, he complained to West Lake Hills officials about Mr. Musk’s fence, the traffic and how he thought the owner was operating a security business from the property.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Musk’s security team also contacted the West Lake Hills Police Department about Mr. Hemmer, according to city records. One security official accused Mr. Hemmer last year of standing naked in the street, according to the records.</p><p>Mr. Hemmer denied that he was naked and said he was on his property wearing black underwear. On another night, he said, he was walking his dog fully clothed and stopped when he suddenly needed to urinate — which Mr. Musk’s camera captured.</p><p>“The cameras got me,” Mr. Hemmer said. “It’s scary they have guys sitting and watching me pee.”</p><p>After repeated remonstrances from Mr. Hemmer, West Lake Hills officials found that Mr. Musk had violated city ordinances with the fence and the gate. Last month, the Zoning and Planning Commission debated whether to grant him variances for the projects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>West Lake Hills is an upscale enclave of about 3,400 residents.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Before the meeting, Tisha Ritta, a permit expert working for Mr. Musk’s limited liability company, wrote a letter to the planning commission asking for relief from the city rules.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“As a high-profile public official, the property’s resident faces ongoing security threats, making proactive safety measures imperative,” she wrote, according to a copy of the letter. Ms. Ritta did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. Hemmer and other residents wrote their own letter to the planning commission, admonishing their neighbor for facilitating “bad behavior on our quiet little cul-de-sac.”</p><p>For a time, Mr. Musk appeared poised to win the neighborhood battle. Planning and zoning officials recommended that his property be granted “hardship variances,” which would allow him to keep the fence and other projects with only small changes to the property, according to city documents.</p><p>But at the planning meeting, the commissioners refused Mr. Musk the variances. When they questioned Ms. Ritta, she blamed a former house manager for failing to get permits for the construction.</p><p>“I just met the property owner last year, and unfortunately they were under the guidance of the property manager,” she said, according to a recording of the meeting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mr. Hemmer also spoke up at the meeting to say he doubted the homeowner had been misguided.</p><p>“If you follow him at all in the news, he’s always guilty of building stuff and then asking for permission later,” he said.</p><p>One commissioner, who was not identified in the recording, said she could not believe West Lake Hills staff had recommended that the homeowner receive any exceptions.</p><p>“I’m astounded the staff is putting forth any kind of suggestions we bend based on who is asking,” she said.</p><p>The planning commission’s decision does not end the process. At the upcoming West Lake Hills City Council meeting, members must decide whether to stick with the commissioners’ recommendation on Mr. Musk’s mansion.</p><p>If the City Council votes against him, Mr. Musk could sue the town. And if that does not work — and given his track record in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/elon-musk-donald-trump-pennsylvania.html" title="">backing candidates</a> — there is always the next local election.</p><p>Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kirsten Grind is an investigative business reporter for The Times, writing stories about companies, chief executives and billionaires across Silicon Valley and the technology industry.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
