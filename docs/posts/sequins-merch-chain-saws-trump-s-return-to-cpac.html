That scene is a typical feature of Trump rallies and conservative events, sometimes threading pro-MAGA and pro-MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) messages among sequins on bags and clothes, often emphasizing the singularity of Mr. Trump and the movement he started.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>It used to be a perception on the right that Republican presidents were elected without channeling the intensity of the conservative base. CPAC and other activist gatherings have in the past served as a way to imagine a world in which Republicans really took control of the federal government, actually changed the direction of the country and truly embodied the unyielding energy of the base, even if the policy vision back then differed.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But Mr. Trump and the conservative activist core are often now one both in policy vision and certainly in energy, and his second term is all cataclysmic action, firing employees and officials, freezing contracts, ending programs and reworking the post-Cold War framework in one daily shock after another. At the end of all this, the U.S. government might look pretty different and more like the energy of four days of CPAC speeches.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Katherine Miller is a writer and editor for Opinion section, writing about politics and elections.</p><p>Damon Winter is a Times photographer working for the Opinion section, based in Miami.</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
