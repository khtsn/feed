    <h1>When Trump Was the One Taking Land From Farmers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump turned his repeated attacks on South Africa <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/21/us/trump-news" title="">directly on the country’s president</a> in the Oval Office today, falsely accusing his government of seizing land from white farmers as part of a systemic persecution of Afrikaners, the white ethnic minority that led the apartheid regime.</p><p>“You can take away land for no payment,” Trump claimed, making an accusation that skipped over the facts and amplified false claims of mass killings of white South Africans that have long circulated on the right.</p><p>President Cyril Ramaphosa pushed back, seeking to clarify the details of his country’s law while pointing out that the United States government, too, has the right “to expropriate land for public use.”</p><p>What Ramaphosa did not say during the extraordinary confrontation was that Trump himself has used that power. And that’s a story I happen to know well.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Six years ago, I found myself face to face with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/us/politics/trump-border-wall.html" title="">white farmer preparing for the government to take his land</a>.</p><p>This did not happen in South Africa. It was in South Texas, and it was because of Trump.</p><p>And it’s a reminder of how a president who has railed against the state’s power to seize land overseas has long been quick to embrace similar tools at home, both as a developer and then in the White House.</p><h2 id="link-33d1a801">‘Take the land’</h2><p>At the root of Trump’s claims of discrimination is a law Ramaphosa signed this year that allows the government to seize privately held land — without providing compensation — when it’s in the public interest. The law is part of the South African government’s efforts to chip away at the racial inequities shaped by decades of apartheid rule.</p><p>Legal experts say the seizures are likely to be rare. And the law provides for judicial review, giving property owners an opportunity to challenge any effort to take their land. That has not stopped Trump from falsely accusing South Africa of “confiscating land” as he cut off foreign aid to the nation this year.</p><p>But Trump himself used government-sanctioned land grabs in recent years to build his promised wall along the United States-Mexico border, albeit through a system that works differently from South Africa’s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Take the land,” Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/us/politics/trump-border-wall.html" title="">told his aides</a> in 2019, as he pushed them to accelerate construction — years before he would accuse the African National Congress of confiscating land.</p><p>By the end of Trump’s first term, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/28/us/trump-biden-border-wall.html" title="">his administration filed more than 110 lawsuits</a> against landowners in Texas as it sought to secure space for his border wall, turning to eminent domain even though many conservatives view it as an excess of government power that violates the sanctity of private property. (In the United States, when the government takes land by eminent domain, it offers compensation, though it is not always as much as landowners would like.)</p><p>Trump’s interest in eminent domain didn’t start there. As a casino developer in Atlantic City, N.J., he urged local officials to use eminent domain to seize the home of an older widow that stood in the way of a parking lot he wanted to build. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/21/nyregion/widowed-homeowner-foils-trump-in-atlantic-city.html" title="">She prevailed</a>.</p><p>“Eminent domain is very interesting,” Trump said in a speech in 2019 in the Rose Garden. “But without eminent domain, you wouldn’t have any highways, you wouldn’t have any schools, you wouldn’t have any roadways. What we’re doing with eminent domain is, in many cases, we’ll make a deal up front.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That is not how the farmers I interviewed in South Texas felt.</p><h2 id="link-64c956bd">‘That damn wall’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Richard Drawe on his property in Donna, Texas, in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Take Richard Drawe, who supports Trump and his goal of bolstering border security. After years of living on the border with Mexico, Drawe did not believe a wall was worth the cost, given the existing barriers and technology at the border to deter migration. And he wanted to hold on to farmland that had been in his family for a century.</p><p>Landowners like Drawe could acquiesce, allowing the authorities to use and survey their land and accepting a monetary offer for it. Or they could go to court, where the government would argue that the construction of the wall was an emergency. Lawyers told me at the time that legal action almost always ended with the government getting the land anyway.</p><p>The Trump administration accelerated its efforts to seize private property for the wall during the coronavirus pandemic, bringing a flurry of lawsuits at the start of 2020. Some landowners refused initial payment from the administration and tried to fight the land grabs in court.</p><p>Drawe reluctantly agreed to allow the government to build on his land because he did not believe he had much of a choice.</p><p>“It just kind of screwed up my whole idyllic living, out in the country, having that damn wall there,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. “I’m never happy with eminent domain laws, being a landowner.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The administration paid him about $42,000 for the 12 acres needed for the wall project and about $197,000 to compensate for depressing the value of his farm. It limited views of the sunsets that he and his wife used to savor after a day’s work. Drawe told me at the time in 2019 that he felt that Trump’s taking of farmland would “ruin” his life.</p><p>But he is now resigned to waking up and seeing the wall on his land.</p><p>“I really don’t give it a hoot anymore,” Drawe said.</p><hr/><p>the Face-off</p><h2 id="link-2cce35a7">A dressing-down that didn’t go as planned</h2><p>The America First president was bent on doing something we have rarely seen him do: declaim for a full hour about a travesty he said was unfolding in a country other than his own.</p><p>On Wednesday, President Trump — who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia.html" title="">backed away</a> from negotiations over the war in Ukraine and written off Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-ai-video.html" title="">as a future resort</a> — wanted to talk about land seizures and mass killings that he said were victimizing white Afrikaners in South Africa. He had printouts of news articles and a video cued up, seemingly determined to embarrass President Cyril Ramaphosa, who had come to “reset” his country’s relations with the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The problem? The human tragedy Trump was describing wasn’t grounded in fact, and Ramaphosa was determined to tell him so.</p><p>While white South Africans have been killed, police statistics show that they are no more likely to be victims of violent crime than any other citizens of the country. Yet Trump doubled down on his fringe assertions, echoing claims that Afrikaner lobbyists and right-wing figures like Tucker Carlson have been making for years.</p><p>The face-off, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/trump-ramaphosa-south-africa-visit.html" title="">as my colleagues wrote</a>, offered a window onto Trump’s conviction that the world is unfair to white people. “Dead white people, dead white farmers,” he said to Ramaphosa.</p><p>It also pointed up his selective concerns for human rights, just a week after he made nice with a series of repressive regimes in the Middle East. Trump’s body language in the room also made it abundantly clear whom he wanted to hear from the most: the white golfers Ramaphosa had brought with him.</p><p>The display may have shocked Ramaphosa. But if Trump’s goal was to bait the South African leader, it didn’t work. Where Volodymyr Zelensky was essentially kicked out of the White House after being dressed down in the Oval Office, Ramaphosa held his ground. He stated the facts. He even joked.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I am sorry I don’t have a plane to give you,” Ramaphosa said to Trump, in an apparent reference to the luxury jet the Qatari government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/qatar-plane-trump-air-force-one.html" title="">has given the United States</a>.</p><p>“I wish you did,” Trump replied. “I’d take it.”</p><p>— <!-- -->Jess Bidgood</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa with President Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>inside the room</p><h2 id="link-556f6d88">‘Not easily flustered’</h2><p>My colleague John Eligon, who leads The Times’s coverage of South Africa, was in the Oval Office today, standing right by the screen that Trump used to show what he said was video evidence of the persecution of white Afrikaner farmers. I asked John how President Cyril Ramaphosa’s career in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa may have prepared him for today’s meeting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p><strong>JB: The Trump team clearly went in intending to knock Ramaphosa off his game, but he never quite lost his cool. What in the president’s background might have readied him for this encounter?</strong></p><p>JE: First as a trade-union leader, and then as a political activist, Ramaphosa has had to deal with these very tense moments when it comes to race, racism and racial issues in South Africa. Nelson Mandela picked him to be one of the leaders of the negotiations to end apartheid. His reputation has been as a guy who can negotiate.</p><p>One of the things that he’s criticized for in South Africa is that he doesn’t make decisions quickly. Some people are saying that was a strength in this moment: He wanted to take his time. He wanted to get a team together, and get a strategy and deals and proposals for Trump together. In the meeting itself, you saw a guy who’s not easily flustered. He’s almost a foil to Trump’s demeanor.</p><p><strong>JB: Trump seemed to respond to the white speakers in the room differently than he responded to Ramaphosa. He seemed really engaged by the golfers and the billionaire Ramaphosa had brought with him. Yet he didn’t seem to make so much eye contact with Ramaphosa. Was that clear in the room?</strong></p><p>JE: Trump definitely looked at those golfers. The golfers are people he knows, he golfs with, he hangs out with, and Ramaphosa is just another world leader and someone who’s not in his social circle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>When Trump first started the video, Ramaphosa turned to Trump and was trying to explain something. And Trump swatted his hand down and said no, and pointed to the TV.</p><p>Ramaphosa’s people told me they expected, potentially, a hostile reception. And so he would have trained for this.</p><p><strong>JB: What else did you see that the rest of us might have missed?</strong></p><p>JE: When Trump cued up the video, I turned and looked over my shoulder, because I was standing right next to the big-screen TV. There was a White House aide who opened up the laptop and pulled up the video. I looked at President Ramaphosa’s spokesman. He gave a shrug — like, ‘What am I to do?’</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Oversight of Local Police: </strong>Days before the anniversary of George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/trump-police-consent-decrees.html">the Trump administration said that it would abandon efforts to reduce police violence</a> there and in several other cities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Justice Dept.
