After the state’s highest court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional in 1972, Ms. Krenwinkel’s sentence was reduced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, as it was for all those convicted in the Manson group’s murders.</p><p>Ms. Krenwinkel, who has spent the last 54 years in the California Institution for Women in Chino, first became eligible for parole in 1976. This was her 16th appearance before the parole suitability panel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The provisional decision has to be reviewed by the legal division of the Board of Parole Hearings. That process can take up to <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/bph/parole-suitability-hearings-overview/what-to-expect-after-a-parole-suitability-hearing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four months</a>, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p><p>If the full board agrees with the panel’s recommendation, Gov. Gavin Newsom has 30 days to review its decision. He could reject it, or send it back for further review.</p><p>In 2022, the parole board panel recommended that Ms. Krenwinkel be paroled but Mr. Newsom reversed its decision, according to state records. Mr. Newsom wrote at the time that Ms. Krenwinkel “still poses an unreasonable danger to society if paroled at this time.”</p><p>“At her parole hearing, Ms. Krenwinkel accepted responsibility for her direct crimes, yet she continued to shift disproportionate blame to Mr. Manson for decisions and conduct within her control,” Mr. Newsom wrote.</p><p>At the four-hour hearing on Friday, Ms. Krenwinkel did not speak, but family members of her victims read statements opposing her release.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“For years, this woman laughed about the murders in court and showed absolutely no remorse at all,” <a href="https://www.change.org/p/california-board-of-parole-hearings-keep-charles-manson-cult-murderer-patricia-krenwinkel-from-getting-parole" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Debra Tate, Sharon Tate’s sister, in an online petition on Friday. “Society cannot allow this serial killer who committed such horrible, gruesome, random killings back out.”</p><p>Ms. Krenwinkel and other followers of Manson engaged in a two-night murderous rampage, beginning on Aug. 9, 1969.</p><p>They stormed the home shared by the actress Sharon Tate, 26, and her husband, the film director Roman Polanski.</p><p>Ms. Tate, who was pregnant, and four others — Thomas Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, Wojciech Frykowski and Steven Earl Parent — were stabbed and shot to death. Mr. Polanski was in Europe at the time.</p><p>Ms. Krenwinkel testified to chasing Ms. Folger, a coffee heiress, with a knife and stabbing her 28 times. She later testified at trial that her hand throbbed from stabbing so many times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The next night, Ms. Krenwinkel and the other Manson followers killed a grocery store executive, Leno LaBianca, and his wife, Rosemary, at their home. Both homes had walls smeared with blood, and Ms. Krenwinkel used blood to scrawl the words “Death to pigs.”</p><p>In 1971, a Los Angeles jury convicted Ms. Krenwinkel on seven counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. In the 14 previous parole denials, panelists cited the brutality of the murders.</p><p>Charles Manson and three of his followers, in addition to Ms. Krenwinkel, were convicted of all the murders in 1971.</p><p>Mr. Manson, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/obituaries/charles-manson-dead.html" title="">died</a> in prison in 2017, did not personally kill the victims, but he was found guilty of ordering their murders as part of a delusional plot to ignite a race war.</p><p>One of the other followers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/us/26atkins.html" title="">Susan Atkins</a>, died in prison in 2009. Another follower, Charles Watson, 79, remains in a prison in Los Angeles County. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/us/linda-kasabian-dead.html" title="">Linda Kasabian</a>, who was a Manson follower but became the prosecution’s lead witness and testified against him, died in 2023.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Separately, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/us/leslie-van-houten-charles-manson-parole.html" title="">Leslie Van Houten</a>, who played a role in the second night’s double murder, was released on parole in 2023, after serving more than half a century in prison.</p><p>A lawyer who has represented Ms. Krenwinkel at past hearings, Keith Wattley, was not immediately available for comment on Saturday.</p><p>At earlier hearings, Mr. Wattley has insisted that medical professionals who have examined Ms. Krenwinkel have determined that she poses no danger to society.</p><p>At her hearing in 2016, Ms. Krenwinkel said that she was “just haunted each and every day by the unending suffering my participation in murders caused.”</p><p>“I’m so ashamed of my actions,” she said. “I am ever aware that the victims who perished had so much life yet to live.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Family members of the victims remain opposed to the release. Chief among them is Debra Tate, the younger sister of Sharon Tate, who often attends parole hearings for Manson family members.</p><p>“I’ve been asking for a program called restorative justice — which would be a face-to-face meeting — for many, many years now, and they’ve all refused,” Ms. Tate said in an interview on Saturday.</p><p>“They could have an opportunity to actually sit down face-to-face and say they’re sorry, but they won’t do it,” she added. “When you refuse to talk and your victims’ families are asking for it over and over again, isn’t that yet another kind of torture? Isn’t that another way not to allow any kind of conclusion or peace to happen?”</p><p>Jack Begg<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adeel Hassan, a New York-based reporter for The Times, covers breaking news and other topics.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
