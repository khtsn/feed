</span>. Liquid delivered on the pick early on with a strong 8-4 defensive half, winning the pistol and finding hard shutdowns on all three sites with a combination of forward positions to find information and individual plays.</p>


<p><em>daiki locks down the C site by herself.</em></p>

<p>Not to be counted out, Shopify drew even at 8-8 with a pistol round win and a bonus conversion. After a Liquid timeout, attention primarily turned towards the C site, where Liquid found success in multiple close postplants to recover their lead to 11-9 and then 12-9 after changing up to an A hit.  </p>

<p>Heroics from Shopify led to overtime. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3079/alexis">
		alexis	</a>
</span>, who had a standout 26-kill map on Killjoy, locked down C with a 3K in round 23, and <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/17397/noia">
		Noia	</a>
</span> followed up with an ace that included four kills through smokes in round 24. Team Liquid ultimately came out on top, winning 14-12 after a flawless defense round and a 1v1 attack round. alexis ended at the top of the scoreboard, while <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/12143/bizerra">
		Bizerra	</a>
</span> led her side on Sova with 20 kills, 162 ADR, and six first bloods.</p>

<p>The first half of Shopify&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581493/team-liquid-brazil-vs-shopify-rebellion-gold-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-ubf/?game=240136&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a> was a tale of two streaks of rounds. Shopify converted the bonus on defense with a KAY/O flash trap in Art to go up 6-0, but Liquid clawed back six of their own, winning out clutches and adapting to Shopify&#39;s A main pushes to make it an even half. </p>

<p>A second bonus conversion swung the momentum back in Shopify&#39;s favor as they once again took the lead, this time going up 10-6 and then 12-7. Liquid fought back to double digits, forcing a Shopify timeout, but a chaotic final round led to a 13-10 map win for the defending champions. </p>


<p><em>Noia burns down the clock to secure a second bonus for Shopify.</em></p>

<p>Noia put up an impressive 27/14/3 performance on Killjoy for Shopify, while daiki&#39;s heroics were key to keeping the map close as she scored 21 kills of her own. </p>

<p>Everything came down to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581493/team-liquid-brazil-vs-shopify-rebellion-gold-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-ubf/?game=240137&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Sunset</a>. It was the first time playing the map in the event for Liquid, who brought out a double-Controller composition with a Sage against Shopify&#39;s double-Sentinel. The new look found success as they seized an early 7-2 lead on their attack, winning the pistol and outwitting Shopify in midround situations. </p>

<p>Shopify brought things back to 7-7, stabilizing their defense with key retakes and taking the second pistol with a 1v3 clutch from sarah. </p>

 
<p><em>The Sage wall breaks and sarah strikes.</em></p>

<p>The critical decider was round 17. Shopify went all-in on an eco, investing three ultimates, but <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/14386/isaa">
		isaa	</a>
</span> won a 1v1 against Noia to deny the gambit and go up 10-7. From there, Liquid could no longer be stopped, storming ahead to a 13-7 victory and exacting revenge on Shopify for the heartbreak they suffered two years ago.</p>

<p><span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/21435/jelly">
		Jelly	</a>
</span> ended the map as the top-fragger with 20 kills on Neon, but it&#39;s daiki who continues to stand out the most. The Brazilian IGL led her team by example over the course of the series with a 47/40/19 KDA, a 1.25 rating, and four clutches, and continues to be the highest-rated player in the tournament all while demonstrating formidable calling. </p>

<p>Liquid finally have their revenge, but Shopify remains in the hunt as they go down to the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581502/shopify-rebellion-gold-vs-tbd-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lbf" target="_blank">lower final</a>, where they will face the winner of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581501/kr-blaze-vs-mibr-gc-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr4" target="_blank">KRÜ BLAZE versus MIBR GC</a> tomorrow. The winner will claim the right to challenge Liquid in a decisive grand final.</p>
