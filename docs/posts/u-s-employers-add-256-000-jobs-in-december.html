But markets recoiled as interest rate cuts seemed more distant.</p><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="jobs-monthly-change-rqgpo" data-id="100000009918560" data-source-id="100000009918560"></section><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lydia-depillis"><img alt="Lydia DePillis" title="Lydia DePillis" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/03/reader-center/author-lydia-depillis/author-lydia-depillis-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></a></p></div></div><p><time datetime="2025-01-10T14:11:17-05:00"><span>Jan. 10, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>2:11 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Employers stuck the landing in 2024, finishing the year with a bounce of hiring after a summer slowdown and an autumn marred by disruption.</p><p>The economy <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added 256,000 jobs in December</a>, seasonally adjusted, the Labor Department reported on Friday. The number handily beat expectations after two years of cooling in the labor market, and the unemployment rate edged down to 4.1 percent, which is very healthy by historical standards.</p><p>The strong result — unclouded by the labor strikes and destructive storms of previous months — may signal renewed vigor after months of reserve among both workers and businesses. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent from November, or 3.9 percent over the previous year, running well above inflation.</p><p>“This employment report really crushes all expectations,” said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets. “It kind of wipes out the summer slump in payrolls we saw from June to August before the big Fed rate cut in September.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The apparent turnaround in employment growth, however, dampens chances of further interest rate cuts in the coming months. Investors already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/business/fed-rates-jobs.html" title="">expect Federal Reserve officials to hold steady</a> at their meeting in late January. For monetary policymakers, the robust growth means that additional easing could reignite prices and stymie progress on inflation.</p><p>“The Fed is like, ‘We think this is a good labor market, we want to keep it that way, we don’t want it cooling further,’” said Guy Berger, director of economic research at the Burning Glass Institute. “What they haven’t said is, ‘We want to heat the labor market back up.’”</p><p>The strong employment data <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/business/stocks-bonds-inflation-fed-jobs.html" title="">sent stock markets tumbling</a>. Bond yields rose to even loftier heights, signaling expectations that interest rates would remain high for longer.</p><p>For now, the numbers are good news for workers, even as job openings have fallen back to normal after soaring after the pandemic. December’s report also rounds out an impressive record for President Biden, who has presided over an average of 355,000 jobs per month added over the course of his term. (That number will probably be revised downward slightly when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/business/economy/us-jobs-economy.html" title="">updated data</a> is integrated next month.)</p><p>“This report caps off a remarkable run on our watch,” Jared Bernstein, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, said in an email. “For this president, getting back to and staying at full employment was a north star.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It completes the picture of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/us/politics/trump-us-disaster-numbers.html" title="">one of the best economies to greet an incoming president</a> in modern history, with consumers continuing to spend confidently as inflation has eased, and layoffs at unusually low levels.</p><p>Some of President-elect Donald J. Trump’s stated goals — like raising tariffs and clamping down on immigration — may slow hiring in the coming years. But businesses have expressed <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250107926289/en/JPMorganChase-Survey-Businesses-Ring-in-the-New-Year-with-Renewed-Optimism" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">optimism</a> that the restoration of tax cuts and looser regulation will cut in the opposite direction.</p><p>“For the new administration, the key question is, ‘how do you make sure you don’t downgrade this in any way?’” said Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, chief economist at the Boston Consulting Group. “This is a big inheritance to start a term with.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="unemployment-chart-dec-2024-01-10-25" data-id="100000009919215" data-source-id="100000009919215"><div slug="unemployment-chart-dec-2024-01-10-25" data-sourceid="100000009919215" id="embed-id-100000009919215">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Karin Kimbrough, chief economist for the professional networking and job search site LinkedIn, thinks the turnaround may reflect impatience from employers who over the past two years have been focused on dealing with inflation and digesting their pandemic-era hiring binges.</p><p>“You cannot remain in a state of caution,” Dr. Kimbrough said. “At some point they have to emerge and say, ‘we’re going to make investments,’ and that’s hopefully going to result in a more dynamic labor market going forward.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>That’s how Tristan Hamberg has been feeling after running a painting company in and around Portland, Ore., for 11 years. Since the pandemic, he has dealt with both difficulty in hiring — with wages for painters escalating about 40 percent — and rising prices for materials. Portland lost population, eroding his residential client base, while commercial work fell off sharply.</p><p>“The job market was so uncertain and yet competitive,” Mr. Hamberg said of that time.</p><p>These days, he thinks his fortunes might be turning around, and he has a solid crew of four full-time employees and four part-timers. That brighter mood — matched by a <a href="https://www.nfib.com/news-article/monthly_report/industry-report/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jump in sentiment</a> measured by the National Federation of Independent Business last month — comes partly from the idea that Mr. Trump may create a more favorable environment for small businesses.</p><p>“We’re heading into 2025 very optimistic, and feel like we have a good budget and overall annual plan in place for profitability and sustainable growth,” Mr. Hamberg said.</p><p>Adding to that sense of security for employers: Small business clients surveyed by the payroll processing firm Gusto <a href="https://gusto.com/company-news/smb-trends-forecast-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said they expected</a> wage growth to slow in the coming year, allowing them to manage expenses more comfortably.</p><p>But there’s a flip side to falling wage growth. People who haven’t been looking for work are less likely to start doing so if it doesn’t seem worthwhile. In a potential sign of that, the share of people between the ages of 25 and 54 who were either working or looking for work edged down to 83.4 percent, and is now half a point lower than the 83.9 percent it reached earlier last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At the same time, for those who’ve found themselves without a job, getting back to work — or just getting a foot in the door — can be a discouraging experience. With few people quitting their jobs for better opportunities, not many positions have been coming open, and the average length of unemployment <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UEMPMEAN" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been rising since the summer</a>.</p><p>One indicator of labor market inflection points is recruiters. As the people who manage head count expansions, their prospects do not appear to be improving much yet.</p><p>Christian Carver, a 31-year-old recruiter in central North Carolina, has been looking for work since November, when she was laid off along with her whole team from Advance Auto Parts. It happened at a bad time: She was pregnant with her fourth child, who is due this spring. Being in the office five days a week is now impossible, but employers <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2024/11/19/november-labor-market-update-remote-work/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">haven’t been offering</a> as many virtual positions lately.</p><p>“Remote was such an easy role to come by like two years ago, and now everyone’s wanting you to be hybrid or in office,” Ms. Carver said. “I’m praying for a miracle at this point and grateful for the time I got to take off while looking for work to be with my family.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lydia DePillis reports on the American economy.
