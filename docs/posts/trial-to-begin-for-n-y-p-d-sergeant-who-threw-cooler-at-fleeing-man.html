</span> player <span data-ref-id="1">Lu		&#34;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/40845/levius">Levius</a>&#34;
		Yinzhong (卢胤中)</span> has <a href="https://weibo.com/7871567590/QmVRHdsBQ" target="_blank">shared</a> that he will be taking a temporary leave of absence from competitive play.</p>

<p>&#34;I have encountered some problems in my psychological and competitive state recently,&#34; he shared. &#34;To better prepare for future competition, and to live up to the team and those who support me, I&#39;m choosing to press the pause button at this stage, hoping to find my own answer in this period of time. I believe this will not be the end of my career. I hope that after the phased adjustment, I can return to the game in a better state.&#34;</p>

<p>Levius has spent his entire professional Valorant career with BiliBili, having joined the team at the end of the 2023 season as a rookie. While he has played other roles before in a limited capacity, he has primarily been BLG&#39;s go-to Sentinel player. In recent offseason events, the team has tried using him as a Controller player.</p>

<p>In 2025, Levius helped BiliBili reach the international stage on two different occasions. A second-place finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2359/vct-2025-china-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> saw the team just miss the mark on lifting its first VCT trophy, but helped it qualify for its first-ever Masters event. He helped BLG break past that barrier in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2499/vct-2025-china-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 2</a>, which ended with the team not only qualifying for a second-straight Champions event, but lifting its first-ever trophy in VCT.</p>

<p>Since the end of the season, BLG has been relatively quiet in the transfer market. They parted ways with longtime head coach <span data-ref-id="2">
