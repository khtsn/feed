King Charles III and Queen Camilla also stay often at Windsor Castle, but were not there at the time.</p><p>A spokesman for the Thames Valley Police said it had received a report of a burglary on Crown Estate land shortly before midnight on Oct. 13. The intruders reportedly scaled a fence at Shaw Farm, a working farm on the estate.</p><p>“Offenders entered a farm building and made off with a black Isuzu pickup and a red quad bike,” the police spokesman said. “No arrests have been made at this stage and an investigation is ongoing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Sun reported that after climbing over the six-foot fence to enter the grounds, the intruders used the truck, which had been stored in the barn, along with the bike, to crash through a farm gate on their way out. The gate is five minutes from Adelaide Cottage, where William and Catherine live with their children, Prince George, 11, Prince Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6.</p><p>Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, where William and Catherine have their offices, declined to comment on the incident, in keeping with their policy of not commenting on security issues.</p><p>There is no suggestion that the prince or his family were in direct danger. They have their own security at Adelaide Cottage, one of several residences on the Windsor estate used by members of the royal family.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
