The State Department did not respond when asked about the exact amount for condoms specifically.</p><p>But <a href="https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/press-release/international-medical-corps-operations-in-gaza/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement last week</a>, the International Medical Corps wrote that it had received more than $68 million from the United States Agency for International Development since October 2023 for its work in Gaza and “no U.S. government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms.” Instead, the group said, the money was used to operate two field hospitals providing medical care, treat and diagnose malnutrition, deliver more than 5,000 babies and perform 11,000 surgeries.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=070922f8031816bae79cbc79beb617f4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public government database</a> outlining the International Medical Corps’ contracts shows that the organization has received nearly two dozen grants that are still in progress and add up to more than $100 million. A vast majority of the awards, however, are not related to Gaza or family planning services. About $80 million worth of grants is for work in Africa to treat malnutrition, improve water sanitation, prevent infectious diseases and provide other health services. None of the remaining $20 million specifically mention Gaza, but some aimed to combat gender-based violence in Lebanon and Jordan, where many Palestinians have sought refuge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The New York Times and other news organizations have been unable to find evidence supporting assertions of $50 million or $100 million in funding for condoms in the Gaza Strip.

Almost 90 percent of that went to Africa, and just $45,681 worth went to one country in the Middle East, Jordan.</p><p><a href="https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20240503_ACAPS_Palestine-_Impact_of_the_war_in_Gaza_on_the_SRH_and_health_rights_of_women_and_Girls.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Humanitarian</a> and <a href="https://www.ippf.org/featured-perspective/no-freedom-without-reproductive-freedom-palestinian-women" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">family planning organizations</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31856794/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers</a> have specifically noted that condom access in Gaza is limited and made even more unavailable by Israel’s war.</p><p>In <a href="https://palestine.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/FP-Study-Final-Ver-Sept19.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2018 report</a> entitled “A Much Neglected Service: Assessment of Family Planning Services in Palestine,” the United Nations Population Fund found that a vast majority of the condom supply in the strip was distributed by the Gaza Ministry of Health and UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.

That was the highest on record, but still short of Mr. Trump’s estimate. A White House official cited a Fox News report showing that in Mr. Trump’s first seven days in office, crossings along the southwest border <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-era-southern-border-sees-migrant-encounters-plummet-over-60-new-policies-kick-in" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fell</a> to just over 7,200, down more than 60 percent compared to the last seven days of the Biden administration. That was a precipitous decline, but not “almost zero” as Mr. Trump said. There is no evidence that “millions” of people from jails all over the world had entered the United States through the southern border.</p><p>Mr. Trump did not specify just how much fentanyl and criminal migrants were coming through the northern border beyond describing the flow as “a lot.” But the data does not show a particularly large number.</p><p>Throughout all of the 2024 fiscal year, officials intercepted just 43 pounds of fentanyl on the northern border, <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/drug-seizure-statistics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to drug seizure data</a>. In comparison, the amounts were 21,100 pounds across the southern border and 698 pounds along the coasts and in airports. Similarly, officials recorded 23,700 <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">encounters</a> with migrants trying to cross the northern border illegally in the 2024 fiscal year, compared with more than 1.5 million at the southern border.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-17"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/04/us/politics/FACTCHECK-TRUMP-PARISCLIMATE-0000000/FACTCHECK-TRUMP-PARISCLIMATE-0000000--superJumbo.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p><strong>This is misleading. </strong>On his first day in office, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html" title="">Mr. Trump withdrew</a> the United States from the Paris climate agreement. He characterized the agreement later as unfair to the United States. Mr. Trump has a point that China’s and Russia’s pledges for curbing emissions have a later deadline than the United States’, but they still made reduction targets. Moreover, the Paris agreement is nonbinding for all parties involved, with no enforcement mechanism.</p><p>Under the Paris agreement, 195 countries pledged in 2015 to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of a worldwide effort to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Countries set their first targets beginning in 2015, and agreed to update them every five years. The United States is the largest emitter historically, while China is the largest currently.</p><p>Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in 2017, and the Biden administration rejoined in 2021.</p><p>The United States, under the Biden administration, had pledged in 2021 to reduce emissions by at least 50 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, and to reach net zero emissions by 2050, according to a <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/usa/targets/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">compilation of targets</a> by Climate Action Tracker, a research group. The United States is on track to reduce its emissions by 29 to 39 percent by 2030, short of reaching its goal, the group said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>A White House official noted that China’s emissions <a href="https://archive.ph/uLUlC" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also rose in 2024</a>. But China, in 2021, said its emissions would continue to climb until 2030, and then begin declining before reaching carbon neutrality in 2060. But emissions are on track to peak in 2025, a few years ahead of schedule, according to Climate Action Tracker.</p><p>And Russia pledged to reduce emissions by at least 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. Under current policies, Russia’s emissions will continue to climb in 2030, not decline, Climate Action Tracker reported.</p><p>What Was Said</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-21"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/04/us/politics/FACTCHECK-TRUMP-BADDRUGS-0000000/FACTCHECK-TRUMP-BADDRUGS-0000000--superJumbo.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p><strong>This lacks evidence. </strong>In justifying sweeping tariffs and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/trump-drug-cartels-terrorist-mexico.html" title="">an executive order</a> designating some cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, Mr. Trump spoke about the toll fentanyl has taken in the United States, appearing to dispute official overdose estimates.
