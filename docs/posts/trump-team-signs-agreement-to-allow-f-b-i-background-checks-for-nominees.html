Trump’s transition operation announced on Tuesday that it had belatedly signed an agreement with the Justice Department that will allow the F.B.I. to conduct background checks on people Mr. Trump intends to appoint as senior officials in his new administration.</p><p>F.B.I. background checks have long been a routine part of transitions. Law-enforcement vetting of a president-elect’s senior team is normally part of decisions about whether they can be entrusted with access to national security secrets, and senators traditionally want to see such dossiers during the confirmation process.</p><p>But Mr. Trump, who is hostile to the F.B.I. because of its role in various criminal and counterintelligence investigations into him, had let weeks pass without signing the agreement.</p><p>His team <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/politics/trump-security-clearances-fbi.html" title="">considered bypassing the F.B.I. and instead using private investigators</a>. Under that plan, Mr. Trump would grant security clearances to his picks after his inauguration, and the Senate would not have access to the usual vetting materials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Despite the signing of the agreement, it remains unclear whether Mr. Trump’s team plans to send the names of all officials requiring a security clearance or Senate confirmation to the F.B.I. for vetting. The announcement did not say whether Mr. Trump would require his appointees to undergo the process or was simply allowing the F.B.I. to begin looking at those who are willing to submit to its scrutiny.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pam Bondi, Mr. Trump’s pick for attorney general, meeting with Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa at the Capitol on Monday. Despite the signing of the agreement, it remained unclear whether all of Mr. Trump’s prospective cabinet nominees would submit to an F.B.I. background check.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Susie Wiles, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager and the incoming White House chief of staff, said in a statement that the agreement would ensure that Mr. Trump and his team were “ready on Day 1” to begin enacting their agenda. The transition also said submitting names for background checks and security clearances “will afford the transition process additional insights, and it facilitates our agency landing teams gaining access to the information they need to prepare for leadership of the federal agencies and departments.”</p><p>Still, the background check process begins with an individual filling out a form with personal information. Under normal circumstances, if an intended appointee refused to cooperate, the president-elect would presumably drop that person. But Mr. Trump revels in flouting norms and there is no legal requirement that requires him to use F.B.I. checks, so the possibility remains that if some decline to participate, Mr. Trump might ultimately grant them a security clearance or submit their names to the Senate anyway.</p><p>The Trump transition team had also delayed signing other agreements with the Biden White House that are part of the normal handoff process. One enables a transition team to use government resources, like office space and email; Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/us/politics/trump-transition-transparency.html" title="">decided instead to use private donations to pay for administrative support</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The other agreement, which the Trump transition <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/us/politics/trump-transition-briefings.html" title="">finally signed last week,</a> allows transition officials to gain access to nonpublic — though still not classified — information in exchange for agreeing to obey certain ethics rules and other limits. That agreement allowed so-called “landing teams” to arrive at agencies for briefings about their activities ahead of the transfer of power.</p><p>In October, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/politics/trump-security-clearances-fbi.html" title="">reported</a> that a memo had circulated at high levels within Mr. Trump’s orbit outlining a proposal suggesting that Mr. Trump bypass the F.B.I. entirely and, after private screening processes, grant security clearances to a large number of people on his first day in office. The proposal was said to have been influenced by his top legal adviser, Boris Epshteyn, among others.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Boris Epshteyn, center, during Mr. Trump’s criminal trial in New York in May.

It would also severely undermine the value of the background checks, since private investigators do not have access to information in government law enforcement and intelligence databases.</p><p>Because the same background check materials are also routinely consulted by the Senate during the confirmation process, that step would represent a challenge to the legislative branch’s independent authority and constitutional role.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The memo also suggested that Mr. Trump could regard the private background checks as covered by executive privilege — which means he would not have to show them directly to the Senate. Instead, the memo laid out a scenario in which a Trump administration official would brief a limited number of Senate staffers on the findings at the White House.</p><p>The contents of the memo were described to The New York Times by three people briefed on the matter.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s delay in starting the process of F.B.I. background checks had attracted growing attention on Capitol Hill, where Republicans will hold a majority of the Senate starting in January. Assuming all 47 Democratic senators would vote against any nominee who lacked a background check as a matter of principle, it would take four Republican senators to break partisan ranks and deny confirmation.</p><p>Against that backdrop, some Republican senators have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-senators-seek-normal-process-confirm-trump-nominees/story?id=116406755" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> that they would like nominees to receive traditional background checks, while others have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/schumer-senate-fbi-checks-trump-nominees.html" title="">made clear</a> they would go along whatever Mr. Trump wanted to do.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
