Hezbollah started firing missiles into Israel in solidarity with Hamas the day after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. A year of back-and-forth bombings between Hezbollah and Israel followed. Yesterday, Israel struck more than 1,300 sites across Lebanon. More than 490 people died in the attacks.</p><p>Since Israel sent troops into Gaza to fight Hamas, analysts and officials have warned that the war could spiral into a regional conflict. Hamas is part of a network of anti-Israel groups backed by Iran that spans the Middle East. That network includes Hezbollah.</p><p>The airstrikes over the past few days, in retaliation for Hezbollah’s own attacks, move Israel closer to an all-out war in the region against Iranian proxies. Today’s newsletter will explain what led to the strikes, what’s happening now and what might come next.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><h2 id="link-2705f1fe">Year of escalation</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Metula, Israel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Levy/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hezbollah is a large paramilitary group that says it wants to destroy Israel and curb U.S. influence in the Middle East. The group, founded during Israel’s war in Lebanon in the 1980s, is also a powerful force in Lebanese politics and essentially runs part of Lebanon. It has spent much of its four-decade history attacking Israel, Israel’s allies and other targets around the world, including a Jewish cultural center in Argentina in 1994.</p><p>Hezbollah first gained international notoriety in 1983, when it blew up the American embassy in Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, and later American and French barracks there.</p><p>Since the Oct. 7 attack, the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated:</p><ul><li><p>Hezbollah’s missiles have displaced tens of thousands of civilians in northern Israel. The group says it will continue its barrage until Israel agrees to a cease-fire in Gaza.</p></li><li><p>Israel has retaliated with its own attacks. Last week, it blew up pagers and other electronic devices belonging to Hezbollah members. Those attacks killed at least dozens and wounded thousands more.</p></li><li><p>Israel says Hezbollah is storing long-range rockets in people’s homes. This past weekend, Israel warned people in Lebanon to evacuate areas with those caches. Some human rights groups criticized the warnings as inadequate, arguing that Lebanese civilians can’t reasonably know if they live close to hidden military targets.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="ambriefing-israeli-lebanon-strikes-map-xsjsi" data-id="100000009715628" data-source-id="100000009715628"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Israeli airstrikes reported in Lebanon on Monday</h2></header><div data-sourceid="100000009715628" id="embed-id-100000009715628">

That would allow thousands of Israeli civilians to return home.</p></li><li><p>Hezbollah has responded with more rockets, at times firing deeper into Israel than usual. Expecting such counterattacks, Israeli officials have restricted gatherings in their country’s north. Schools and businesses in the area remained closed yesterday.</p></li></ul><p>The cycle is familiar. Israel and Hezbollah each claim that its attacks are meant to get the other to back down from a war. Instead, the strikes lead to further escalation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h2 id="link-b30f02b">What’s next</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rescue workers in Beirut, Lebanon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Israel and Hezbollah have not fought an all-out war since 2006, when Israel invaded Lebanon. More than 1,000 Lebanese and 150 Israelis died. Israel claimed that it won that war, but it did not appear to have much long-term effect on Hezbollah’s operations.</p><p>How would Israel fare in a full war against Hezbollah today? It has already hurt Hezbollah’s leadership with the recent airstrikes and pager attacks. But Israel is also fighting in Gaza and the West Bank, where the military has supported Israeli settlers.</p><p>For a ground war in Lebanon, Israel may have to call up tens of thousands of reservists, many of whom are already exhausted from fighting elsewhere. “On the one hand, it is one of the best-equipped militaries in the world,” my colleague Patrick Kingsley, the Jerusalem bureau chief, told me. “On the other, it is stretched thin.”</p><p>Yet Israeli leaders might have the public’s support. Recent polling suggests that a small majority of Israelis back a broader war against Hezbollah. “The displacement of so many Israelis from northern Israel is considered a kind of loss of sovereignty,” Patrick told me. And since Hezbollah does not appear willing to back down from its attacks in support of Hamas, the chances of further escalation remain high.</p><h2 id="link-1613c85e">More on the Middle East</h2><ul><li><p>Hezbollah said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/24/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah/dc29eb59-bb56-5c2c-b95e-5396fb7f5f60?smid=url-share" title="">targeted military-industrial sites</a> in northern Israel this morning and fired a barrage of rockets at the Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona.</p></li><li><p>Yesterday was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-strikes.html" title="">deadliest day of Israeli attacks</a> in Lebanon since 2006. </p></li><li><p>One Israeli strike in Beirut <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/23/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah/israeli-warplanes-target-another-top-hezbollah-commander-in-beirut-officials-say" title="">targeted Ali Karaki</a>, Hezbollah’s top commander in southern Lebanon.
