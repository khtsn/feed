Only people who have been living in Spain for at least two years will be eligible, the government said.</p><p>Legalizing undocumented migrants is not just about “respect for human rights,” said Elma Saiz, Spain’s migration minister, in an interview with national broadcaster Radio Nacional de España. “It’s also about prosperity.”</p><p>She said Spain needs about 250,000 foreign workers a year to maintain its welfare state, given its “demographic challenges,” including one of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spanish-birth-rate-hits-lowest-level-since-records-began-1941-2024-02-21/#:~:text=MADRID%2C%20Feb%2021%20(Reuters),of%2048.6%20million%20in%202023." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lowest</a> birthrates in Europe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Countries in Europe have shrinking working-age populations, with businesses reporting a chronic shortage of workers, especially in sectors like caring for older people, agriculture and hospitality. Yet there is only a limited legal path for migration to the continent, and governments have been slow to expand it as anti-immigrant sentiment grows across Europe.</p><p>Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister of Spain, has spoken often about the country’s dire need for labor and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spains-sanchez-touts-benefits-migration-european-neighbours-tighten-borders-2024-10-09/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said last month</a> that immigration was critical for economic growth. The key to migration, he said, “is in managing it well.”</p><p>Spain’s <a href="https://www.inclusion.gob.es/w/el-gobierno-aprueba-un-nuevo-reglamento-de-extranjeria-para-mejorar-la-integracion-de-las-personas-migrantes-a-traves-de-tres-palancas-trabajo-formacion-y-familia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new rules</a> will not apply to recent arrivals, including the more than 25,500 people who have arrived illegally this year to the Canary Islands from West Africa — more than double the number of arrivals in the same period last year, <a href="https://www.frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/eu-external-borders-detections-down-39-in-first-8-months-of-2024-g8VfWH" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Frontex</a>, the European Union’s external border agency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Migrants being helped onto shore by a Spanish maritime rescue vessel in the Canary Islands in September.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Antonio Sempere/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Ismael Gálvez Iniesta, an economics professor at the University of the Balearic Islands, said that most undocumented migrants in Spain are women from South America. Many arrived by plane on tourist visas and overstayed. There are no official figures on how many of them are working, but many move to Spain — where they already speak the language — for the economic opportunities, he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Legal paths to immigration involve a cumbersome process for employees. “There is a great deal of bureaucracy to make contracts,” said Mr. Gálvez, who has co-written several reports on statistics about undocumented migrants in Spain. “This discourages companies from starting the procedures.”</p><p>Patricia Fernández, a lawyer at the Coordinating Association of Neighborhoods, an organization that provides legal advice to migrants, said that the new regulation falls short in that the process for acquiring a residence permit is still “excessively rigorous.” She also said there were not enough civil servants to issue such documentation, which would likely lead to long delays.</p><p>About seven in 10 Europeans believe that demographic trends put Europe’s long-term economic prosperity and competitiveness as risk, according to <a href="https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/3112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an E.U. study last year</a>. The more than four million Ukrainians who have moved to E.U. countries since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/business/refugees-ukraine-jobs.html" title="">fast-tracked for employment</a>, but politicians say a longer-term solution is needed.</p><p>In the European Union as a whole, the numbers of unauthorized migrants attempting to cross into the E.U. dropped 43 percent in the first 10 months of this year compared to the same period last year. <a href="https://www.frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/significant-rise-in-irregular-border-crossings-in-2023-highest-since-2016-C0gGpm#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20irregular%20border,to%20preliminary%20calculations%20by%20Frontex." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In 2023</a>, the bloc experienced its highest number of such crossings since 2016.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Migrants at a temporary assistance center in San Andres on the island of El Hierro, Spain, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Borja Suarez/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Right-wing parties have tapped into anxiety over migration and concerns about a dilution of national identity. Local leaders in such countries as Germany, which has seen huge numbers of migrants in the last decade, say that schools and health care facilities are overwhelmed.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In recent weeks and months, Germany and France have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/europe/europe-migration-shift.html" title="">intensified border controls</a>, and the Netherlands announced plans to do so starting next month. In September, Sweden, a nation long known for its welcoming policy toward migrants, said it planned to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/europe/sweden-immigration-reform.html" title="">offer cash</a> to immigrants who agree to go home. And European leaders are exploring how to create hubs where they could pay countries outside the European Union to process asylum applications and take on the responsibility of deporting those whose claims fail.</p><p>Eve Geddie, the head of Amnesty International’s Europe office in Brussels, said that the debate over outsourcing asylum screening is a distraction from the need to increase legal migration. “Huge, key, core sectors in Europe are relying on these people,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
