The committee last week halted a vote on the report’s release after Gaetz abruptly resigned from Congress.</p><p>Senators in both parties have clamored to see the report — the result of a yearslong bipartisan investigation — as part of their vetting of presidential nominees, who normally require Senate confirmation. If the House declines to share it, a constitutional clash between the two chambers could result. Democrats on the ethics panel said they would reconvene next month to discuss the report.</p><p>The committee obtained a document in which federal investigators established a trail of payments from Gaetz to women, including some who testified that he hired them for sex. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/matt-gaetz-venmo-payments-sex.html" title="">You can see it here</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Gaetz, who has gleefully disparaged some Republican senators whose votes he now needs, went to Capitol Hill today to win the support of key members.
