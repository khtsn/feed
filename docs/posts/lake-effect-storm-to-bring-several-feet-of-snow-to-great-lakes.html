They typically happen in late fall and early winter.</p><p>“The lakes started out at basically a record warm for late November,” said David Roth, a forecaster with the Weather Service.</p><p>“Even in areas that are used to it, this is their first real lake-effect of the season,” he added. “They’re going to feel this. This will be a ‘welcome to winter’ for them.”</p><p>Portions of Interstate 81, which runs through Jefferson and Oswego Counties in New York, were within the area of the severe weather. Along the shores of Lake Erie, hazardous conditions were expected on Interstate 90.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>According to AAA, the automobile organization, <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2024/11/nearly-80-million-americans-expected-to-travel-over-thanksgiving/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly 80 million </a>people were expected to travel for Thanksgiving this year. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/us/thanksgiving-travel-chicago-new-york.html" title="">About three million people</a> in the United States were expected to travel by air on Sunday.</p><p>Erie International Airport in Pennsylvania was closed on Friday afternoon, and MBS International in Saginaw County, Mich., and Akron-Canton Airport in Ohio were de-icing aircraft, according to the F.A.A.</p><p>More than four feet of snow could fall downwind of Lake Ontario through the weekend, and up to three feet of snow was possible across portions of northeastern Ohio and northern Pennsylvania. Up to two feet was predicted to accumulate in areas of the Upper Peninsula in Michigan.</p><p>The first lake-effect snowstorm of the season “tends to be pretty exceptional,” Mr. Roth said. “When this happens is usually October, or much earlier in November.”</p><p>Buffalo could receive up to six inches of snow through Sunday, when the Bills host the San Francisco 49ers at their stadium in nearby Orchard Park, N.Y.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While the snow was expected to pile up, an Arctic blast was moving across the Northern Plains and the Midwest on Friday, with the wind chill across parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota plunging to 15 degrees below zero.</p><p>The Weather Service <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NWSWPC/posts/pfbid02wjDt5ycWjb5i9pZiVtviPKn699hQyLsopqbqhjdQVh3T2SbQrKB1YpyTpFYYsZ56l" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that the cold would persist into next week, with the Northern Plains and parts of the Midwest experiencing their lowest temperatures since mid-February.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emmett Lindner writes about breaking and trending news.
