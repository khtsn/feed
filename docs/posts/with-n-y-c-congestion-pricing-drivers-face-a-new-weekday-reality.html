    <h1>With N.Y.C. Congestion Pricing, Drivers Face a New Weekday Reality</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><div><p>The first Monday commute under New York City’s new tolling plan went smoothly, but officials are still assessing how the program is affecting traffic patterns.</p><div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-01-06T16:47:41-05:00"><span>Jan. 6, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>4:47 p.m. ET</span></span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>New York City’s long-awaited congestion pricing plan got off to a smooth start as drivers adjusted to the new tolls, but many crucial questions remained about the nation’s most ambitious traffic experiment.</p><p>After decades of failed efforts to bring the tolling program to city streets, it finally went live on a freezing night over the weekend when few drivers were out and transit workers could monitor the newly deployed tolling equipment at a relaxed pace.</p><p>A tougher test took place on Monday, when many commuters returned to work from holiday vacations and drivers were confronted with the reality of an additional toll to drive into the heart of Manhattan. But that, too, seemed to proceed without any major mishaps.</p><p>Most drivers will now be charged $9 a day to enter a designated “congestion relief zone,” which runs from 60th Street to the southern tip of Manhattan. The tolls are expected to help generate $15 billion for critical repairs and upgrades to subways, buses and commuter rail lines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is too soon to tell, however, whether the tolling program, the first of its kind in the United States, will have a lasting impact. Though it has survived multiple lawsuits, congestion pricing continues to face efforts by opponents, who include President-elect Donald J. Trump, to stop it.</p><p>And despite an auspicious beginning, it remains to be seen whether congestion pricing can speed up traffic on some of the most gridlocked streets in the world, or raise enough money to shore up the crumbling mass transit system that millions of riders rely on every day.</p><p>Vanessa Alves, the owner of Stop By Cafe on West 57th Street, a few blocks into the congestion pricing zone, drove to her storefront on Monday morning without realizing that her E-ZPass would be charged.</p><p>“Of course, I prefer not to pay,” said Ms. Alves, 32. “But I don’t mind paying if there’s less traffic.”</p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, did not promote the start of congestion pricing on its first day. She inherited the policy from her predecessor, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who pushed to pass it before he resigned, but later questioned whether now was the right time to enact it. Ms. Hochul’s political fortunes could be tied to its success or failure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In June, she abruptly halted the program weeks before its original start date, citing concerns that it would hurt the city’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The move was applauded by some and denounced by others.</p><p>It is still unclear whether Gov. Hochul will pay a political price for resurrecting the tolling program in November, even after lowering the tolls by 40 percent to start. At a news conference on Monday, she focused on the program’s benefits for residents of the Hudson Valley, north of New York City, who are the kind of suburban commuters who balked at the tolls in large number. She said they would see noticeably shorter commutes by 2026.</p><p>Mayor Eric Adams, also a Democrat, who is running for re-election, has been conspicuously quiet about the program since it began. A spokeswoman for the mayor said on Monday that he had spoken often about congestion pricing in the past, but did not offer additional comment.</p><p>Just two days into the program, there were some small signs that congestion pricing could achieve some of its goals. Many residents and business owners in the congestion zone said the roads were emptier as light snow blanketed the city, potentially keeping some people home.</p><p>Yossi Benhamou, the owner of Matles Florist on West 57th Street, a heavily used artery, said he was not accustomed to seeing so little traffic outside his store. “The roads are nearly empty,” said Mr. Benhamou, 59. “It’s quiet.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some drivers were pleasantly surprised by quicker commutes. Maurice DiMaggio, an electrical contractor from Matawan, N.J., said it normally takes two hours to drive into Manhattan through the Lincoln Tunnel. He made it in just one hour on Monday.</p><p>“This morning traffic at the Lincoln Tunnel was way less than normal,” he said. “I can’t run my business off the subway, but maybe this whole congestion pricing thing is keeping people from driving.”</p><p>Traffic data, however, was mixed. Faster travel speeds could indicate that the plan was working, allowing traffic to move more freely. And according to INRIX, a transportation analytics firm, the average travel speed in the congestion zone initially rose the first morning compared with the same time on a comparable day in January 2024. But it slipped back down later Sunday and on Monday, when it was slightly slower than in 2024.</p><p>Transportation officials have projected that the tolling program could eventually reduce the number of vehicles entering the congestion zone by at least 13 percent.</p><p>In cities around the world that already have congestion pricing, the tolls overcame opposition from drivers and business owners who eventually got used to it. They proved effective in reducing traffic, cutting vehicle emissions and raising money for government coffers, and also encouraged the use of alternative transportation with the addition of new buses and bike lanes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But there were setbacks and adjustments along the way. London’s congestion zone, established in 2003, quickly got results reducing vehicles and delays but in later years, traffic returned even as the fees rose.</p><p>In New York, the toll for most motorists will rise to $12 by 2028, and to $15 by 2031.</p><p>Many transit riders were eagerly anticipating the rewards of congestion pricing. “I’m super excited for my kids’ lungs, for a better funded M.T.A., for safer streets with less cars,” said Peter Klecha, 38, as he walked with his wife into the subway station at Columbus Circle on Monday.</p><p>Julie McKee, a playwright who lives in Midtown and does not own a car, said she hoped the program would reduce traffic around the blocks where she walks her small dog, Lucy. “That would be nice,” she said.</p><p>But some workers worried that less traffic could mean fewer customers. In Queens on Monday morning, there were rows of empty pumps at a gas station in Long Island City near the Queensboro Bridge. “Six, seven o’clock, eight o’clock is very busy, but today is nothing, you know,” said Amir Masood, 50, from behind a counter where he has worked for about four years.</p><p>The tolls also increased the cost of business for Sergio Balbuena Jr. and his father, who drive their food cart from the Bronx to serve coffee, pastries and breakfast sandwiches at East 59th Street and Second Avenue. They plan to raise their prices to help offset the new tolls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>There was also confusion among some for-hire drivers who mistakenly believed they would be charged. Instead, a small fee — $1.50 for Ubers and Lyfts and 75 cents for taxis — will be added to each fare paid by passengers.</p><p>Still, one Uber driver, Angel Rodriguez, 33, idled Monday morning just outside the congestion zone because he worried that the tolls would cost him “mucho dinero.”</p><p>Most drivers seemed to accept that they would have to pay the new tolls, though many were not happy about it. Some switched up their routes to avoid being charged.</p><p>“I hate congestion pricing,” said Jay Beam, who was driving a passenger in an Access-A-Ride van and was trying to avoid crossing into the tolling zone.</p><p>Others dodged the tolls by parking just north of the zone.</p><p>Shanoi Martinez left his home in Teaneck, N.J., a half-hour early to get a spot at a parking garage on West 61st Street. He normally parks at a garage inside the tolling zone next to Mount Sinai West hospital, where he works as a diagnostic specialist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Yet Mr. Martinez, 38, still ended up paying more for his commute, because his new garage costs $4 more than his previous one. “It’s $4 more or $9 more, I’ll take the $4,” he said.</p><p>Angel Hernandez drives to work from his home in Riverdale, a neighborhood in the Bronx, to the congestion pricing zone, where he operates a horse-drawn carriage. Unlike his car, the carriage is exempt from the toll.</p><p>“It’s not fair,” Mr. Hernandez, 38, said about the new fee. “I guess I’m going to take my horse all the way to Riverdale.”</p><p>Sean Piccoli<!-- -->, <!-- -->Anusha Bayya<!-- --> and <!-- -->Maya King<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Ley is a Times reporter covering New York City’s mass transit system and the millions of passengers who use it.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-ley">More about Ana Ley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Winnie Hu is a Times reporter covering the people and neighborhoods of New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/winnie-hu">More about Winnie Hu</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>17</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>With Congestion Pricing, N.Y.C.
