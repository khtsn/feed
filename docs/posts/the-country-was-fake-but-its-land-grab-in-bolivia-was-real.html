Their leader, a fugitive holy man, professes to be able to guide the process of reincarnation, guaranteeing that billionaires who use his services won’t be paupers in the next life.</p><p>But the self-proclaimed United States of Kailasa has now collided with reality.</p><p>Last week, officials in Bolivia said they had arrested 20 people associated with Kailasa, accusing them of “land trafficking” after they negotiated 1,000-year leases with Indigenous groups for swathes of the Amazon.</p><p>The agreements were declared void, and the Kailasans were deported — not to Kailasa, but to their actual home countries, among them India, the United States, Sweden and China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Bolivia does not maintain diplomatic relations with the alleged nation ‘United States of Kailasa,’” Bolivia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Kailasa’s “press office of the Holy See of Hinduism” did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The bizarre story of Kailasa stretches back at least to 2019, when the guru known as Swami Nithyananda — a.k.a. His Divine Holiness, the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism — fled India after being accused of rape, torture and child abuse.</p><p>Born Arunachalam Rajasekaran in southern India, he became a Hindu monk and started his first ashram in his 20s near the tech hub of Bengaluru. He quickly built an empire across India and in cities around the world.</p><p>Nithyananda was also grandiose, linking himself to long religious and royal lineages. He claimed miracle powers, like helping the blind see through a “third eye” or delaying the sunrise by 40 minutes.</p><p>“I am a totality of unknown in your life. I’m the manifest of un-manifest,” he said in one sermon. “The moment you sit in front of me, enlightenment starts.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>During a conversation in front of a large crowd, he endorsed the idea of “the world’s first inter-life reincarnation trust management.” Rich people like Bill Gates or Warren Buffett could invest a few billion dollars in a trust; Nithyananda said he possessed the knowledge system to ensure they got the money when they were reborn.</p><p>That would be important, Nithyananda’s interlocutor said, “because it is possible Bill Gates will be born very poor, Warren Buffett may be born in some African village as a very poor guy.”</p><p>When the accusations of rape and sexual assault started piling up and the government went after Nithyananda, he claimed that the cases were an anti-Hindu conspiracy “to grab my land.”</p><p>It is not clear where he went after fleeing India, but reports put him in South America or the Caribbean. A couple of years later, he resurfaced with the declaration that he had founded the United States of Kailasa, which he said was the revival of past Hindu kingdoms.</p><p>The new nation’s website — where “free e-citizenship” is just a few clicks away — said its sovereign lands were “in the Andean region.” Nithyananda, who is now in his late 40s, was up front about the benefits the location offered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Many people asked me, ‘Swami ji, why did you leave such a huge empire you built in India and are sitting in a corner?” he says in a video, referring to himself using an Indian honorific. The answer, he said, was “immunity” that made him “non-prosecutable” as the head of his own state.</p><p>Since then, Kailasa had popped up now and again when its emissaries caused embarrassment for politicians around the world.</p><p>In 2023, a senior official in Paraguay resigned after he had signed a memorandum of understanding with Kailasa. Earlier that year, the mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, rescinded a sister cities agreement with the fictitious nation days after holding a ceremony announcing the partnership.</p><p>In Bolivia, the Kailasa followers, who officials said had arrived on tourist visas, managed a photo with the country’s president, Luis Arce. There is no evidence that Nithyananda joined them there.</p><p>Scandal erupted after an investigation by the Bolivian newspaper El Deber revealed the leases that the Kailasans had signed with Indigenous groups in the Amazon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Pedro Guasico, a leader of the Baure, one of the groups, said its contact with the Kailasa emissaries had begun late last year, when they arrived offering help after forest fires.</p><p>The conversations eventually turned to a lease of land three times the size of New Delhi, and the Baure agreed to a 25-year deal that would supposedly have paid them nearly $200,000 annually. But when the Kailasa representatives came back with a draft in English, it covered 1,000 years and included the use of air space and the extraction of natural resources.</p><p>Mr. Guasico said his group signed anyway. “We made the mistake of listening to them,” he said by phone. “They offered us that money as an annual bonus for conserving and protecting our territory, but it was completely false.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mujib Mashal is the South Asia bureau chief for The Times, helping to lead coverage of India and the diverse region around it, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mujib-mashal">More about Mujib Mashal</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Driving in Singapore: </strong>The city-state, where it costs up to $84,000 just for the right to own a car, is one of the most expensive places to drive. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/car-certificate-singapore-luxury.html">That is by design</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Radio Martí Goes Off the Air: </strong>For four decades, a U.S.-financed broadcaster <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/americas/radio-marti-cuba-trump-castro.html">provoked the ire of the communist government</a> in Cuba.
