They’re very close to a final deal,” Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVWaQ5zhNKo&amp;ab_channel=%C3%89lys%C3%A9e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Monday at the White House</a>.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Olha Stefanishyna, <a href="https://x.com/StefanishynaO/status/1893971378375651759" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on X</a> that “Ukrainian and U.S. teams are in the final stages of negotiations regarding the minerals agreement.”</p><p>A version of the agreement being discussed Monday, which was reviewed by The New York Times, contained more favorable terms to Ukraine than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/world/europe/ukraine-trump-minerals.html" title="">previous drafts</a> but did not include security guarantees Ukraine had been requesting as it struggles to fight Russia’s invasion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Four people, who have been briefed on the deal and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations, said those were the terms being discussed. Two of the people said the talks were still ongoing as of Monday evening. So the terms of the deal, which was not final, could still evolve.</p><p>The question of mineral wealth is tied up in conflicts over U.S. military and financial aid to Ukraine, and over how to end the war. Mr. Zelensky has said Ukraine must have Western arms and backing in any peace deal, to prevent a future Russian assault, while Mr. Trump has insisted the war must end quickly, without offering such security guarantees.</p><p>“This economic agreement with Ukraine will not be a guarantee of future aid for war, nor will it include any commitment of U.S. personnel in the region,” a White House official said on Monday.</p><p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday also appealed to Mr. Trump’s interest in natural resources, telling a state television reporter that Russia’s deposits of rare earth minerals used in high-tech manufacturing were “orders of magnitude” greater than Ukraine’s. He said Russia could work with American companies to help develop those deposits, even inside Russian-occupied Ukraine.</p><p>The draft U.S.-Ukraine deal seen by The Times no longer included a demand that Ukraine commit to giving the United States $500 billion in revenue generated from natural resources, including oil, gas and minerals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The White House has described that request as compensation for past American military and financial aid, but Ukraine balked, saying it would create a huge financial burden for future generations.</p><p>Nor would Ukraine be required to repay twice the value of future American aid, one of the conditions in an earlier draft.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump with President Emmanuel Macron of France, at the White House on Monday.  “They’re very close to a final deal,” Mr. Trump said of Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But the version obtained by The Times showed that the United States is not offering the security guarantees to deter further Russian aggression that Ukraine has been requesting.</p><p>The request for U.S.-backed security guarantees has been a standing demand of Mr. Zelensky. The absence of any guarantee was one reason the Ukrainian leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/world/europe/ukraine-minerals-us-deal-rejected.html" title="">refused to sign previous</a> draft agreements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Last week, Mr. Trump called Mr. Zelensky “a dictator” and appeared to falsely accuse Ukraine of starting the war, and on Monday his administration opposed a U.N. resolution, backed by most U.S. allies, that called Russia the aggressor.</p><p>The document obtained by the Times, dated Feb. 24, lists Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky as required signatories.</p><p>Under the terms of the draft agreement, Ukraine would relinquish half of its revenues from the future monetization of natural resources. Those revenues would be directed to a fund in which the United States would hold the maximum percentage of financial interest allowed under U.S. law, but not necessarily all of it.</p><p>Those provisions are an improvement for Ukraine. A previous draft agreement dated on Saturday said the U.S. would have 100 percent interest in the fund and that Ukraine would contribute to it with revenues from both current and future natural resource extraction projects.</p><p>The new draft agreement instead says the fund will reinvest revenues in Ukraine — though it remains unclear what percentage — and will be designed to attract further investment. It also says the United States will maintain long-term support for Ukraine’s economic development.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The White House has argued the mere presence of American economic interests in Ukraine would deter future Russian aggression, even without specific assurances spelled out in the deal.</p><p>“What better could you have for Ukraine than to be in an economic partnership with the United States?” Mike Waltz, the U.S. national security adviser, said on Friday.</p><p>Maggie Haberman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump Attacks Zelensky: </strong>President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-trump-russia-war.html">called Volodymyr Zelensky a “dictator without elections”</a> after the Ukrainian president said Trump was in a “web of disinformation.” Earlier Trump had falsely stated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/trump-zelensky-ukraine-comments.html">that Ukraine had started the war</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shift in Senate G.O.P. </strong><strong>: </strong>As Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia-republicans.html">moves to normalize relations with Russia</a>, Republicans who once vowed to uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/trump-putin-senate-gop-ukraine.html">have stayed silent or moderated their tone</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ukrainians React: </strong>Trump’s claim that Ukraine was responsible for its war with Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/ukrainians-trump-voices.html">has left many Ukrainians disillusioned</a>, including residents of Bucha, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/europe/bucha-russia-massacre-trump.html">a Kyiv suburb that has become a symbol of Russian brutality</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saudi Arabia: </strong>By hosting high-stakes talks over Ukraine and Gaza, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-diplomacy.html">the kingdom offers more proof of its regional clout</a> and warm relations with Trump. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/middleeast/mbs-saudi-crown-prince-what-to-know.html">Here’s what to know about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s role</a> in global diplomacy.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Alarmed Alliance: </strong>Europe’s leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/europe-trump-russia-ukraine.html">met in Paris to recalibrate their relations</a> with the U.S. after Trump embraced Russia’s narrative.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Verify Our Reporting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Our team of visual journalists analyzes satellite images, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/insider/verifying-images-of-the-war-in-ukraine.html">photographs</a>, videos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/28/world/europe/reskin-russian-radio-ukraine-war.html">radio transmissions</a> to independently confirm troop movements and other details.</p></li><li><p>We monitor and authenticate reports on social media, corroborating these with eyewitness accounts and interviews. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html">Read more about our reporting efforts</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
