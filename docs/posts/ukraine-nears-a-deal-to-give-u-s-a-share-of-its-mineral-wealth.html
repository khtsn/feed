They’re very close to a final deal,” Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVWaQ5zhNKo&amp;ab_channel=%C3%89lys%C3%A9e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Monday at the White House</a>.</p><div><p>Earlier in the day, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Olha Stefanishyna, <a href="https://x.com/StefanishynaO/status/1893971378375651759" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on X</a> that “Ukrainian and U.S. teams are in the final stages of negotiations regarding the minerals agreement.”</p><p>A version of the agreement being discussed Monday, which was reviewed by The New York Times, contained more favorable terms to Ukraine than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/world/europe/ukraine-trump-minerals.html" title="">previous drafts</a> but did not include security guarantees Ukraine had been requesting as it struggles to fight Russia’s invasion.</p><p>Four people, who have been briefed on the deal and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations, said those were the terms being discussed. Two of the people said the talks were still ongoing as of Monday evening. So the terms of the deal, which was not final, could still evolve.</p><p>The question of mineral wealth is tied up in conflicts over U.S. military and financial aid to Ukraine, and over how to end the war. Mr. Zelensky has said Ukraine must have Western arms and backing in any peace deal, to prevent a future Russian assault, while Mr. Trump has insisted the war must end quickly, without offering such security guarantees.</p><p>“This economic agreement with Ukraine will not be a guarantee of future aid for war, nor will it include any commitment of U.S. personnel in the region,” a White House official said on Monday.</p><p>The draft seen by The Times no longer included a U.S. demand that Ukraine commit to giving the United States $500 billion in revenue generated from natural resources, including oil, gas and minerals.</p><p>The White House has described that request as compensation for past American military and financial aid, but Ukraine balked, saying it would create a huge financial burden for future generations.</p><p>Nor would Ukraine be required to repay twice the value of future American aid, one of the conditions in an earlier draft.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump with President Emmanuel Macron of France, at the White House on Monday.  “They’re very close to a final deal,” Mr. Trump said of Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>But the version obtained by The Times showed that the United States is not offering the security guarantees to deter further Russian aggression that Ukraine has been requesting.</p><p>The request for U.S.-backed security guarantees has been a standing demand of Mr. Zelensky. The absence of any guarantee was one reason the Ukrainian leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/world/europe/ukraine-minerals-us-deal-rejected.html" title="">refused to sign previous</a> draft agreements.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Trump called Mr. Zelensky “a dictator” and appeared to falsely accuse Ukraine of starting the war, and on Monday his administration opposed a U.N. resolution, backed by most U.S. allies, that called Russia the aggressor.</p><p>The document obtained by the Times, dated Feb. 24, lists Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky as required signatories.</p><p>Under the terms of the draft agreement, Ukraine would relinquish half of its revenues from the future monetization of natural resources. Those revenues would be directed to a fund in which the United States would hold the maximum percentage of financial interest allowed under U.S. law, but not necessarily all of it.</p><p>Those provisions are an improvement for Ukraine. A previous draft agreement dated on Saturday said the U.S. would have 100 percent interest in the fund and that Ukraine would contribute to it with revenues from both current and future natural resource extraction projects.</p><p>The new draft agreement instead says the fund will reinvest revenues in Ukraine — though it remains unclear what percentage — and will be designed to attract further investment. It also says the United States will maintain long-term support for Ukraine’s economic development.</p><p>The White House has argued the mere presence of American economic interests in Ukraine would deter future Russian aggression, even without specific assurances spelled out in the deal.</p><p>“What better could you have for Ukraine than to be in an economic partnership with the United States?” Mike Waltz, the U.S. national security adviser, said on Friday.</p><p>Maggie Haberman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="59" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad1"><div id="ad-1" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="58" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNWE1ZTRiOTItYjcxZC01ZjgzLTk0OTMtOGQ4Y2JlMTRiYmMz"><div id="5a5e4b92-b71d-5f83-9493-8d8cbe14bbc3" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/24/us/trump-musk-news#5a5e4b92-b71d-5f83-9493-8d8cbe14bbc3"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager"><img alt="Tyler Pager" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-24T20:34:38.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 24, 2025, 3:34 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager" itemprop="name">Tyler Pager</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting on the Trump administration</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>The news conference has ended with another long handshake between Trump and the French president.</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="57" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMGQwZWVmNDEtZWNkZC01Yjc5LThlODMtYTMzMDYzMjRmZTMy"><div id="0d0eef41-ecdd-5b79-8e83-a3306324fe32" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/24/us/trump-musk-news#0d0eef41-ecdd-5b79-8e83-a3306324fe32"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-e-sanger"><img alt="David E.

For decades, presidential administrations from both parties have had policies that largely avoid immigration enforcement in sensitive locations, such as places of worship, schools and hospitals.</p><div><p>Judge Theodore D. Chuang, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, denied the groups’ request for a temporary nationwide halt to the Trump administration’s policy.</p><p>As a result, about 1,700 places of worship in 35 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico will be temporarily spared immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration’s policy allowing operations around sensitive areas that were off limits during the Biden administration. The groups are being represented by Democracy Forward, a legal organization focused on fighting for democracy.</p><p>At issue is a shift in immigration enforcement policy under the Trump administration that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to conduct operations in sensitive locations. This is a significant expansion of enforcement authorities from what was permitted during the Biden administration. There has not been an overwhelming number of arrests of immigrants at religious services since the start of the Trump administration. Still, the groups have argued that just the potential for such arrests has led people to avoid services they previously attended.</p><p>The lawsuit was brought against the Homeland Security Department by a group of mostly Quaker organizations. However, a Baptist church in Atlanta and a Sikh temple in Sacramento also joined, and officials in those organizations said they had already seen a decline in attendance because of the new policy.</p><p>“Plaintiffs have provided evidence that the willingness of their congregants to attend worship and participate in ministry services is presently being chilled,” Judge Chuang wrote in his order. “In contrast, D.H.S. has provided no facts demonstrating how its interests, in increased immigration enforcement or otherwise, would be materially and adversely impacted” by a pause in enforcing the policy.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-immigration-lawsuit-religious-groups.html" title="">A similar case</a>, brought by a coalition of denominational entities, was filed in federal court in the District of Columbia.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="32" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNmFiMzA2YmMtYThmYy01NWNlLTliODctY2YxNjU4YzE4ZjQw"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="31" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNGMwZmVlNDYtZDA5Ny01M2ViLThlYjAtZTZmNzc1MmVkMDE3"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="30" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad7"><div id="ad-7" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid8">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="29" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNWM5MTIyODEtOTg3Mi01YzIzLWIwM2ItNTcxY2I1MDJkMGY2"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNzE5MDBmNjgtMWM2Zi01Y2Q4LTgwYzktNjcxMWY2NzgxNDUz"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="27" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzczY2JkMTc4LTNjZjMtNTJmOC1hY2IxLWE3ZjdkYzUxYWNjMw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/24/us/trump-musk-news#trump-documents-report" data-source-id="100000010008176"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/charlie-savage"><img alt="Charlie Savage" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-charlie-savage/author-charlie-savage-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-charlie-savage/author-charlie-savage-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-charlie-savage/author-charlie-savage-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-24T19:35:37.885Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 24, 2025, 2:35 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/charlie-savage" itemprop="name">Charlie Savage</a></p><p>Reporting from Washington</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzczY2JkMTc4LTNjZjMtNTJmOC1hY2IxLWE3ZjdkYzUxYWNjMw=="><a href="#trump-documents-report">Another group asks the judge in Trump’s documents case to release the special counsel’s report.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The special counsel Jack Smith in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A free speech institute <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/6938bdcc748a3d50/061a92f5-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked a federal judge in Florida on Monday</a> to make public the special counsel report about the classified documents case against President Trump, arguing that the public has a First Amendment right to see it.</p><p>The request, made to Judge Aileen M. Cannon of the Southern District of Florida, who oversaw that case and eventually dismissed it, was the latest effort seeking the release of the report by the former special counsel, Jack Smith.</p><div><p>In the waning days of the Biden administration, Judge Cannon intervened to block the Justice Department from showing the report to anyone outside the department. As part of that effort, she required the department to share a copy of the report with her.</p><p>The report is the second volume of a two-part report Mr. Smith wrote after dropping the federal criminal cases he brought against Mr. Trump because of his 2024 election victory. The Justice Department has long taken the position that sitting presidents are temporarily immune from prosecution.</p><p>The first volume, regarding the case Mr. Smith brought against Mr. Trump over his attempts to overturn his loss of the 2020 election, became public in January. But the second volume, about Mr. Trump’s retention of classified documents after leaving office, remains hidden.</p><p>Judge Cannon based her order to keep the report confidential on the idea that doing so would protect the rights of Mr. Trump’s two co-defendants, whose cases were not initially dropped, should they eventually be tried.</p><p>But, as expected, the Trump-era Justice Department swiftly asked the appeals court to dismiss the remainder of the case, and on Feb. 11 it did so. Citing the end of the matter, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University asked her to lift her injunction because its legal rationale has ended.</p><p>And in a twist, it also asked her to post the report on the public docket, arguing that the fact that she ordered the government to give her a copy of it has made it subject to the public’s constitutional right to see judicial records.</p><p>The report “is a judicial document inextricably intertwined with a proceeding that is itself subject to the constitutional access right,” the motion said.</p><p>Judge Cannon became known for showing unusual favor to Mr. Trump in her rulings throughout the investigation and the case. But even if she were to reject the request, the Knight First Amendment Institute could ask an appeals court to order the document made public.</p><p>The motion is the second attempt by an outside group to get Judge Cannon to address her order keeping the report secret.</p><p>American Oversight has <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69624625/american-oversight-v-us-department-of-justice/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in the Federal District Court in Washington for the report</a>, asserting that time was urgent because it wanted the public to know what Mr. Smith wrote about Kash Patel, whose nomination was then pending to be F.B.I. director.</p><p>Mr. Smith’s team had questioned Mr. Patel before a grand jury about his public claim that Mr. Trump, while still president, had declassified all the documents that accompanied him to his Florida club and estate, Mar-a-Lago, after he left office. But the Senate confirmed Mr. Patel as F.B.I. director on Feb. 20.</p><p>Judge Cannon has said she will address what, if anything, to do about her injunction next month. On Feb. 14, American Oversight asked her to immediately lift her order because the case had ended, but she declined to alter her timetable.</p><p>Separately, The New York Times has also <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69560598/the-new-york-times-company-v-united-states-department-of-justice/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in the Southern District of New York</a> seeking access to the report.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="26" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad8"><div id="ad-8" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid9">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="25" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzc4MGQ1NDkwLWMyZGQtNWIwNS05MTg5LTI1M2VkMTk1MmJjZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/24/us/trump-musk-news#elon-musk-email-federal-workers" data-source-id="100000010009146"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-d-shear"><img alt="Michael D.

Employees at the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security and Justice were all flatly told not to comply.</p><p>“For now, D.O.E. employees are asked to please pause on any direct response to the O.P.M. email,” Chris Wright, the secretary of energy, said in a weekend email. A top State Department official wrote, “No employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their department chain of command.”</p><p>At the same time, the president’s handpicked leaders at the Treasury, the General Services Administration, the Department of Transportation and the Office of Management and Budget told employees to follow Mr. Musk’s weekend directive. A Treasury email said, “You are directed to respond to this message before the deadline,” adding that “we expect that compliance will not be difficult or time-consuming.”</p><p>Mr. Trump on Monday downplayed the differences among members of his team. During a meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Mr. Trump responded to questions about the leaders of agencies who had told employees not to respond to Mr. Musk’s email.</p><p>“They don’t mean that in any way combatively with Elon,” he said, suggesting that those responses were prompted by concerns about security at agencies like the F.B.I. “They’re just saying there are some people that you don’t want to really have them tell you what they’re working on last week. But other than that, I think everyone thought it was a pretty ingenious idea.”</p><p>The split among advisers came just two days before Mr. Trump is set to convene his first full cabinet meeting of his second term at the White House on Wednesday. Eight years ago, his first cabinet meeting turned into a session of gushing, “dear leader” praise for Mr. Trump as his top aides extolled, as one put it, the “blessing” of working for the president.</p><p>That could still happen again on Wednesday. People in Mr. Trump’s current orbit have repeatedly sung his praises in recent weeks. After a meeting with Russian officials last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said over and over again that “Trump is the only leader who can bring peace to Ukraine.”</p><p>Since Mr. Trump took office, his most senior officials have aggressively implemented the president’s demand for a smaller government, free of what Republicans call “woke” ideology. Thousands of employees have been fired or put on leave. Entire agencies, like the U.S. Agency for International Development, have been all but shuttered. Remote workers have been told to return to the office or be fired.</p><p>But the response to the email suggests that there may be limits to how far Mr. Musk, acting on Mr. Trump’s behalf as the leader of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, can push the bureaucracy.</p><p>Emails to several members of the White House press office, including Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, did not receive a response.</p><p>Madeleine Ngo<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nicholas Nehamas<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington, and <!-- -->Kate Conger<!-- --> from San Francisco.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="24" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNGFlNDkyMGItYjYwYi01MmQ1LWI5NWMtNmRiNDBiOTVmOWU4"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="23" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM3ZTNjMzljLWRmZTQtNWU1ZC04NzBjLWNhODkyYjU4OGZlNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/24/us/trump-musk-news#trump-macron-ukraine" data-source-id="100000010009318"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-baker"><img alt="Peter Baker" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-24T18:58:34.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 24, 2025, 1:58 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-baker" itemprop="name">Peter Baker</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting on the Trump administration</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM3ZTNjMzljLWRmZTQtNWU1ZC04NzBjLWNhODkyYjU4OGZlNA=="><a href="#trump-macron-ukraine">The French president is visiting as the U.S. sidelines Europe in Ukraine peace talks.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Donald J.

Putin of Russia a dictator and falsely stated that the United States had spent three times more on the war than Europe has. Mr. Macron treaded gently, but he made clear that Russia was to blame for the war, not Ukraine, and corrected Mr. Trump’s assertions about European aid.</p><p>Mr. Trump also said he might go to Moscow if a peace deal is reached, which he predicted could happen within weeks. That would make him the first American president to visit Russia in more than a decade and would be seen as a boon for Mr. Putin, who faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes.</p><p>The session came at a time of growing tension over the future of the Atlantic alliance and peace talks with Russia that have sidelined Ukrainian and European leaders. Mr. Macron has rallied European leaders to formulate a strategy as the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/trump-russia-putin.html" title="">appears to be shifting favor from Europe to Russia</a>, then he rushed to Washington to meet personally with Mr. Trump.</p><p>Speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump, who last week said that Ukraine “started” the war and that Mr. Zelensky is a “dictator without elections,” declined to use the term for Mr. Putin. “I don’t use those words lightly,” Mr. Trump said.</p><p>Mr. Macron, by contrast, gave voice to the consensus view in Europe and, until now, in the United States that Moscow is to blame for the war. “This is a responsibility of Russia because the aggressor is Russia,” the French president said.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Trump repeated the false claim that the United States had spent $350 billion to aid Ukraine and “we had nothing to show for it,” while Europe has spent only $100 billion. In fact, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Europe has allocated $138 billion compared with $119 billion from the United States.</p><p>Mr. Trump also mischaracterized the nature of European aid. “Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine,” he said. “They get their money back.”</p><p>Mr. Macron, who earlier in the meeting had been speaking in French through an interpreter, <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1894098479859077345" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quickly interjected in English</a> and put his hand on Mr. Trump’s arm to correct him.</p><p>“No, in fact, to be frank, we paid,” Mr. Macron said. Like the United States, he said, there has been a mix of grants, loans and loan guarantees. “We provided real money, to be clear,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump, smiling, made a skeptical face and waved his hand as if to say that he did not buy it.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who failed to broker an end to the war in 24 hours or before his inauguration, as he promised on the campaign trail, said that talks he has initiated with Mr. Putin could end the war “within weeks, if we’re smart.” He added: “If we’re not smart, it will keep going and we will lose young, beautiful people.”</p><p>The president emphasized his demand that Ukraine sign over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/world/europe/ukraine-trump-mineral-deal.html" title="">hundreds of billions of dollars in mineral rights</a> to repay U.S. military aid, which Mr. Zelensky has resisted. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, however, said U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators were “very close” to a deal, at the “one-yard line.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s return to power has convulsed relations with European allies as he threatens to impose tariffs on their consumer goods, demands that they increase military spending even beyond a previous target and breaks with them over Ukraine. Relations were inflamed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/europe/vance-europe-immigration-ukraine.html" title="">a speech in Munich by Vice President JD Vance</a> suggesting that the biggest security threat to European nations is not Russia or China, but their own political and cultural policies.</p><p>Mr. Macron has organized two meetings of European leaders to formulate a plan for dealing with an America that can no longer be depended on as an ally and hoped to use his visit to fortify Mr. Trump in negotiations over the fate of Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron have a long and complicated history. As the president greeted Mr. Macron at the entrance to the West Wing on Monday, the two engaged in a vigorous handshake in which both seemed in a lighthearted but pointed way trying to assert masculine dominance, reminiscent of similar encounters during Mr. Trump’s first term. During their later session in the Oval, they flashed smiles, flattered each other and jocularly shook hands again.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad9"><div id="ad-9" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid10">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="21" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZWUyZGQ3MjAtOGQzZC01Y2NlLTlhMzEtMmE3YTlhZGIwOTM4"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="20" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYmIyYjRkYjUtNThhZS01MDFiLWEzMjItM2U4YWE1ZDFmOTgx"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="19" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNDFiN2IxYWUtN2IwZi01M2JmLTgzYTUtNzMwNmY1NGU4Mzgw"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNmMxMTQzOTEtNGIwZS01YWM0LTk2MDMtYTAzOTU2OTkyOGRh"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad10"><div id="ad-10" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid11">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNTBkNjJhZjUtZWU3My01NTZjLWI0ZjItMzZkNDVhYjI2ZjNl"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="15" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvODlhNDlhMmItMGQxNy01NWJhLTk2MGYtYmM4Nzk0MmM4NGEy"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvODk1YjNkOGUtMzM4My01MGY0LTgwMDctNzkyOGE5ZDI0NjIx"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYTgxNzhlYWUtZjkwYS01NjE2LTlmY2UtOTM1ZTc0MzUzNTFh"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad11"><div id="ad-11" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid12">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzg4NWI3NGUyLTdmYWItNWNjYi04YTA2LTliOTE2MWM5NGJiMQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/24/us/trump-musk-news#musk-trump-toes-video" data-source-id="100000010009158"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-24T18:41:40.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 24, 2025, 1:41 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christopher-flavelle" itemprop="name">Christopher Flavelle</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-nehamas" itemprop="name">Nicholas Nehamas</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/madeleine-ngo" itemprop="name">Madeleine Ngo</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karoun-demirjian" itemprop="name">Karoun Demirjian</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzg4NWI3NGUyLTdmYWItNWNjYi04YTA2LTliOTE2MWM5NGJiMQ=="><a href="#musk-trump-toes-video">A fake video of Trump and Musk appears on TVs at the federal housing agency.</a></h2></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/24/multimedia/24trump-news-hud-pmbv/24trump-news-hud-pmbv-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A fake video depicting President Trump sucking on the toes of the tech billionaire Elon Musk played on monitors in the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The video, which appeared to be generated by artificial intelligence, was emblazoned with the message “Long Live the Real King.”</p><p>The short video appeared two days after Mr. Musk — the tech billionaire Mr. Trump appointed to make cuts across the federal government — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/us/politics/elon-musk-email-federal-employees.html" title="">ordered federal workers</a> to respond to an email demanding they summarize their accomplishments during the past workweek, threatening that failure to comply would be construed as a resignation. That threat did not appear in the email, which gave federal employees a deadline of Monday night to respond with about five bullet points describing what they had accomplished over the last week.</p><div><p>A handful of cabinet secretaries, including those engaged in national security matters, instructed the agencies under their purview not to comply with the directive, given the sensitivity of their work activities. According to three people familiar with the situation at the housing department, employees there have asked superiors for guidance on whether to comply with the order, but there has not yet been any agencywide direction. </p><p>The looping video greeted housing department employees on the first day that all workers were expected to be back at their headquarters full-time, to comply with Mr. Trump’s orders ending remote work for federal workers. Leaders could not immediately identify how monitors had been hacked to display the images, and ended up simply unplugging several devices, according to two people familiar with what transpired.</p><p>“Another waste of taxpayer dollars and resources. Appropriate action will be taken for all involved,” said Kasey Lovett, a spokeswoman for the department. </p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzcyZWVmYjgxLTNiMDUtNWY1OC04MGE0LTIwMmMzYWNhOTUwZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/24/us/trump-musk-news#fda-safety-workers-reinstated" data-source-id="100000010008823"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christina-jewett"><img alt="Christina Jewett" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/22/reader-center/author-christina-jewett/author-christina-jewett-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/22/reader-center/author-christina-jewett/author-christina-jewett-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/22/reader-center/author-christina-jewett/author-christina-jewett-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-24T18:12:50.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 24, 2025, 1:12 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christina-jewett" itemprop="name">Christina Jewett</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzcyZWVmYjgxLTNiMDUtNWY1OC04MGE0LTIwMmMzYWNhOTUwZQ=="><a href="#fda-safety-workers-reinstated">The F.D.A. reinstates staffers who oversee food and medical device safety.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Food and Drug Administration reversed course over the weekend to reinstate workers in several departments.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Mangum for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Food and Drug Administration has reinstated dozens of specialized employees involved in food safety, review of medical devices and other areas who were laid off last week, according to more than a dozen workers who got called back.</p><p>The total number of employees recalled was not immediately clear. But a person familiar with the conversations said nearly all of the roughly 180 medical division employees who had been let go would get their jobs back. More than a dozen workers across a handful of teams said that they had received a call or email reinstating their employment; some reported that up to a dozen others on their teams had also been brought back.</p><div><p>The F.D.A. and its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The workers had been fired as part of the Trump administration’s efforts, led by Elon Musk, to significantly downsize the federal government and cut costs. But the salaries of many of the fired F.D.A. staff members had been funded by fees companies pay the F.D.A., not taxpayer money.</p><p>Many of the reinstated jobs were financed by those kinds of fees, but some such employees were still out of work. Those whose job were funded by an excise tax on cigarettes, for example, said they were not called back to work over the weekend. Those workers reviewed applications for new tobacco products and studied the safety of emerging tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and devices that heat up tobacco but do not burn it.</p><p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/health/fda-trump-layoffs-device-and-food-safety.html" title="">The New York Times featured</a> the accounts of laid-off staff members who reviewed the safety of surgical robots, cardiovascular devices and diabetes-care systems that infuse insulin. All had their jobs back as of Monday morning.</p><p>AdvaMed, a trade association for medical device makers, had pushed the administration in a letter and in meetings to ensure that workers who review those products got their jobs back. The industry’s funds have helped the device review division hire experts, including doctors with experience using the devices. The industry funds are approved periodically in agreements passed by Congress that also include strict deadlines to make approval decisions. </p><p>Reinstated workers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation, said about a dozen staffers from the agency’s chief counsel got their jobs back, including lawyers who supported medication policy. About a dozen who oversee cardiovascular devices and another 12 who authorize artificial intelligence software programs were also restored. Others were called back to their jobs assessing food-chemical safety, a priority of the new health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p>In interviews, employees who returned on Monday reported a feeling of whiplash and frustration, but also of relief to get back to work.</p><p>Dr. Robert Califf, F.D.A. commissioner during the Biden administration, called the staff cuts “anti-efficiency” because many recent hires had been recruited to fill knowledge gaps at the agency, including in artificial intelligence and food-chemical safety. He also said the cuts were made with no regard to well-being of workers.</p><p>“It’s despicable to treat fellow human beings this way and a sign of immaturity of the people doing it,” he said in a text message on Monday.</p><p>The fired workers had uniformly been told that their performance was “not adequate to justify further employment by the agency.” Yet many of the dismissed workers — reinstated and not — said their performance reviews from the agency had been excellent.</p><p>Alice Callahan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad12"><div id="ad-12" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid13">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjliMzEyMTQtYjEyNi01MjBlLWE2ZDMtYTkyNjAwODA2NWFm"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNzFjOGI5NjYtM2ZmOC01NDI4LWJiOTEtYWY0ZThjNmFhN2Q0"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMyYTFmYmYyLTkwMTYtNTIwZi1hMGVjLTQ2MGZmN2VlODA0Yw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/24/us/trump-musk-news#elon-musk-doge-department-of-education-data-ban" data-source-id="100000010008723"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague"><img alt="Zach Montague" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-24T15:33:52.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 24, 2025, 10:33 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague" itemprop="name">Zach Montague</a></p><p>Reporting from Washington</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMyYTFmYmYyLTkwMTYtNTIwZi1hMGVjLTQ2MGZmN2VlODA0Yw=="><a href="#elon-musk-doge-department-of-education-data-ban">A federal judge bars Elon Musk’s team from student loan databases.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Department of Education in Washington.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Al Drago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A federal judge in Maryland granted a temporary restraining order on Monday blocking the Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management from disclosing sensitive data to members of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency team and anyone assisting them.</p><p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.576070/gov.uscourts.mdd.576070.38.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">order</a>, issued by Judge Deborah L. Boardman in Federal District Court for the District of Maryland, prevents Mr. Musk’s representatives from carrying out what they have described as an audit of the Education Department’s student loan systems for two weeks while the lawsuit continues.</p><div><p>Judge Boardman wrote that the government had not argued convincingly that members of Mr. Musk&#39;s team had a real need for access to such personal information in the performance of their duties.</p><p>“DOGE affiliates have been granted access to systems of record that contain some of the plaintiffs’ most sensitive data — Social Security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses, income and assets, citizenship status, and disability status — and their access to this trove of personal information is ongoing,” Judge Boardman wrote. “There is no reason to believe their access to this information will end anytime soon because the government believes their access is appropriate.”</p><p>The American Federation of Teachers, a union representing more than 1.8 million educators, had sued to keep members of the Musk team out of the department’s data systems, which it said contained private information that its members had submitted in connection with student aid for themselves or their families.</p><p>“We brought this case to uphold people’s privacy, because when people give their financial and other personal information to the federal government — namely to secure financial aid for their kids to go to college, or to get a student loan — they expect that data to be protected and used for the reasons it was intended, not appropriated for other means,” Randi Weingarten, the group’s president, said in a statement.</p><p>Last week, a judge in a related case <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/politics/doge-education-department-data.html" title="">refused</a> to issue a restraining order restricting Mr. Musk’s team, finding that the group that brought the lawsuit had not shown that a group of students who had lodged similar complaints had suffered clear harm by having their data analyzed by affiliates of Mr. Musk.</p><p>But Judge Boardman found that the disclosure of sensitive personal information to Mr. Musk’s team alone was itself a concrete injury, notwithstanding any hypothetical concerns like the possibility of identity theft.</p><p>Lawyers who brought the suit had asked that the same restraints be placed on the Treasury Department, but Judge Boardman declined, as a judge in a separate case had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/nyregion/sdny-doge-elon-musk-treasury-injunction.html" title="">already blocked</a> Mr. Musk’s team from sensitive data there.</p><p>She indicated that she believed the teacher’s union would prevail in its lawsuit, and that the restraining order was necessary until the members of Mr. Musk’s team who are detailed to the Education Department could explain why they could not do their analysis with data that left out or redacted sensitive information.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off"

Most of those working on the initiative were recruited by Mr. Musk and his aides.</p><p>Ms. Warren said she was concerned that DOGE could obtain data from the Bureau of Industry and Security, which holds information disclosed in export license applications from companies that compete directly with Mr. Musk’s businesses. She said she also worried that Mr. Musk’s team could access confidential information on chip manufacturers that submitted applications for billions of dollars in federal grants under the Biden administration.</p><p>Ms. Warren also said that the group could “feed sensitive data from the department’s many databases into AI programs that analyze the weaknesses of his competitors’ business models and identify investment opportunities.”</p><p>Mr. Lutnick, who was sworn in as commerce secretary on Friday, has promised that the Trump administration would “get rid of so much waste, fraud and abuse.”</p><p>“We’re not going to hurt anybody, but we’re going to get rid of it,” Mr. Lutnick said last week. “Then we are going to grow this economy in a way that people have never seen.”</p><p>So far, Mr. Musk’s team appears to be more closely targeting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a division of the Commerce Department that tracks the weather and researches climate change. Members of Mr. Musk’s team gained access to NOAA systems this month, and the agency was asked to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/climate/noaa-trump-executive-orders.html" title="">compile a list of grants</a> related to global warming and other topics targeted by Mr. Trump’s executive orders.</p><p>The Commerce Department collects proprietary data from companies in a number of industries in which Mr. Musk operates, including space commerce, broadband and artificial intelligence.</p><p>The Commerce Department also runs the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/business/economy/chips-act-childcare.html" title="">CHIPS program</a>, which has been distributing subsidies to semiconductor manufacturers, as well as a program to expand broadband access around the country. Both programs require applicants to share in-depth information about their businesses and clients. The department is also in charge of issuing licenses for companies to export technology.</p><p>DOGE has faced numerous legal challenges as the group has tried to burrow deeper into the federal government and gain access to vast amounts of information held by agencies. Trump administration officials have defended the initiative, which they say is helping taxpayers by identifying what they call wasteful and fraudulent spending.</p><p>On Friday, a federal judge banned the group from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/nyregion/sdny-doge-elon-musk-treasury-injunction.html" title="">regaining access</a> to the Treasury Department’s most sensitive payment and data systems until the conclusions of a lawsuit that claims the team’s access is unlawful.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjc3NDIzZGUtZTNiYi01Y2YyLWI2MGUtOWEyZTY3Y2RiZTQ2"><div></div></div></section></div></div>
