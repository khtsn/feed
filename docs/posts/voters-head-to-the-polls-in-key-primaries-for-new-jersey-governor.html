The results are often seen as an early barometer of voter sentiment ahead of the following year’s congressional midterm races, which can shift the balance of power in Washington.</p><p>But turnout is frequently low.</p><p>Eight years ago, when New Jersey voters were choosing nominees to run for an open seat after former Gov. Chris Christie’s second term, just <a href="https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/election-results/2017/2017-official-primary-voter-turnout.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">15 percent</a> of registered Democrats and Republicans cast ballots.</p><p>This year, there were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/nyregion/new-jersey-governors-race-what-to-know.html" title="">six days of early voting</a> at polling locations throughout the state.</p><p>The pace of early voting was brisk, according to a tally by an election researcher for The Associated Press, Ryan Dubicki.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>As of Sunday, about 318,000 voters had already mailed ballots or deposited them in secure drop boxes. More than 148,000 people voted early at polling locations.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The race featured several wild-card factors.</p><p>Mr. Baraka was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/nyregion/ras-baraka-alina-habba-lawsuit-ice.html" title="">charged with trespassing</a> last month outside a private jail in Newark that has a lucrative contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain undocumented migrants. Prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/23/us/mayor-baraka-judge-dismissal.html" title="">dropped the charges</a> 13 days later, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/nyregion/newark-ice-protest-arrest-ras-baraka.html" title="">his arrest</a> made national news for weeks.</p><p>Separately, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/new-jersey-sanctuary-city-lawsuit.html" title="">has sued</a> over policies that it says make Newark and Jersey City “sanctuary cities.” Mr. Baraka and Mr. Fulop, unsurprisingly, disagree.</p><p>There are also a handful of hotly contested primaries for the State Legislature, including several that include <a href="https://stevenfulop.com/assembly-candidates/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">candidates backed by Mr. Fulop</a>, the only candidate for governor to run with a slate of like-minded contenders. Political observers are watching the potential for down-ballot energy to spin off crucial votes for Mr. Fulop in densely populated parts of the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Both mayors have been jockeying for second place in the Democratic primary behind Ms. Sherrill of New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District, according to polls.</p><p>And the three other Democratic candidates — Mr. Gottheimer of the Fifth Congressional District, Mr. Spiller and Mr. Sweeney — all have viable pathways to victory on Tuesday.</p><p>On the Republican side, Mr. Trump last month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/nyregion/trump-endorsement-governor-new-jersey.html" title="">endorsed Mr. Ciattarelli</a>. In a dial-in telephone rally last week, the president told supporters that Mr. Ciattarelli was the candidate best prepared to help New Jersey, a state led by Democrats, “pop out of that blue horror show.”</p><p>Mr. Ciattarelli’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/nyregion/new-jersey-governor-republican-primary.html" title="">alliance with a divisive president</a> in a state where registered Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans could prove to be a liability if he wins the nomination.</p><p>“I could never support someone who is aligned with that,” said Christopher Watson, an urban planner who emigrated from Guyana decades ago and lives in Newark.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>A Democrat, he cast his ballot Tuesday for Mr. Baraka, who he believes represents “striving middle-class idealism.”</p><p>“He understands that a rising tide should lift all boats,” Mr. Watson, 47, said. “And I don’t think that’s a Robin Hood policy.”</p><p>Mr. Bramnick, a moderate Republican who has been critical of Mr. Trump, has noted the Democratic Party’s registration advantage and argued that his centrist policies make him the candidate best prepared to appeal to the 2.4 million voters in New Jersey who are not registered with either major party.</p><p>Mr. Spadea, who is running for the nomination from the far right, had also sought Mr. Trump’s backing. In a television ad released after the president endorsed Mr. Ciattarelli, Mr. Spadea encouraged voters to think for themselves.</p><p>“I’ve disagreed with him in the past,” Mr. Spadea <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urgIfij-LCA&amp;t=1s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says about Mr. Trump</a>. “And it’s OK for you to disagree with him now.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Deirdre Koczur, a Republican, said national politics had almost nothing to do with her decision making on Tuesday. Ms. Koczur, 29, of Cranford, N.J., said she was mainly concerned about overdevelopment in the flood-prone suburb where she lives.</p><p>Last year, New Jersey enacted legislation to streamline the development of affordable housing, but dozens of affluent suburban communities tried to block its implementation. Each of the candidates have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/21/nyregion/new-jersey-governor-candidates-issues.html#housing" title="">distinct ideas</a> on how, and where, to build needed affordable housing, and the issue is likely to be one of the clearest policy differences in November’s general election.</p><p>“We have to find a way to develop in a way that’s appropriate for our area,” said Ms Koczur,<span>  </span>who said she voted Tuesday for Mr. Ciattarelli.</p><p>Mark Bonamo<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>15</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Voters Head to the Polls For Primary in New Jersey<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
