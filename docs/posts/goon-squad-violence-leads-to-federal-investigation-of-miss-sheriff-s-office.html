Six officers pleaded guilty and were sentenced to federal prison in March.</p><p>“Since the Goon Squad’s sickening acts came to light, we have received reports of other instances where Rankin deputies overused Tasers, entered homes unlawfully, bandied about shocking racial slurs and deployed dangerous, cruel tactics to assault people in their custody,” Kristen Clarke, the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the Justice Department, said during a news conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left: Eddie Parker, the lawyers Malik Shabazz and Trent Walker, and Michael Jenkins during a news conference in Jackson, Miss., in March. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vickie D.
