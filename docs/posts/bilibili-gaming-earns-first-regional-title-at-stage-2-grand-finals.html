</span>. After losing a relatively <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/473244/xi-lai-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-stage-1-gf/?game=all&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">one-sided final in Stage 1</a>, BLG fought back against the other regional Ascension team to earn a trophy heading into <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions Paris</a>.</p>

<p>It all started on Sunset, and if someone were to just watch map one, they would have a very different view of how the series went. DRG had two map bans and the first map pick, choosing Sunset and running their now staple double Duelist with <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/52904/akeman">
		Akeman	</a>
</span> on Neon and <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/31753/spiritz1">
		SpiritZ1	</a>
</span> on Yoru. After winning the pistol and converting the bonus against the attack side from BLG running a double Initiator composition, DRG were utterly dominant. </p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3741/vo0kashu">
		vo0kashu	</a>
</span> wins a 1v2 clutch to convert the first bonus round on Sunset. (Clip via Project Horizon)</em></p>

<p>BLG was able to get two round wins on their attack, but Akeman dropped a 17/6/2 half on Neon to lead DRG to a 10-2 half. Even when DRG moved to their attack side, they won pistol and converted the bonus to speedrun map one 13-2 and earned a quick map one victory.</p>

<p>Bilibili needed to bounce back on their map pick: Haven. DRG decided to stick with double Duelist, but moved vo0kashu on Iso while Akeman played Cypher. BLG ran a more standard solo Duelist comp with double Initiator, with a focus on setting up whzy on Neon. When BLG won the first pistol, the team built a similar run to what DRG did to start the series. This time, it was the Neon from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4885/whzy">
		whzy	</a>
</span> that stood out, but it was more of a total team effort statistically as BLG reached the half up 9-3. DRG was able to win the second half pistol and convert the bonus, but as soon as BLG got their first defensive round win, the momentum carried BLG to a Haven 13-8 win.</p>

<p>BLG successfully erased the tough loss on Sunset to win Haven, and now they had to try and continue that form on Corrode. DRG ran a composition that consisted of Gekko, Cypher, Yoru, Omen, and Clove, while BLG ran Omen, Sova, Deadlock, Viper, and Neon. BLG won the first pistol but were unable to convert the bonus, which DRG took to build an early lead. Great moments from whzy and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4774/knight">
		Knight	</a>
</span> were countered by some smart plays from SpiritZ1 and <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11524/nicc">
		Nicc	</a>
</span>, leading to a 6-6 tie at the half. However, BLG won their second pistol, putting the team in a great position to win the map. It wasn&#39;t without some worries, but BLG was able to stop DRG from getting a lead in the second half, securing Corrode 13-10 and getting to series point.</p>

<p>Lotus was map three, with DRG going back to double Duelist and solo smokes, while BLG opted for double Controller with Vyse and Raze. The many different long-range angles on Lotus have always been better suited for double Controller compositions, and it showed in the BLG pistol win and dominance on retakes to end the first half up 8-4. Where whzy and Knight led the charge on previous maps, <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/48878/rushia">
		rushia	</a>
</span> was unlocked on Viper as he ended the first half with a 14/6/6 statline.</p>


<p><em>rushia gets four kills to end the first half on Lotus. (Clip via Project Horizon)</em></p>

<p>DRG fought back to start the second half of Lotus, winning pistol and converting the bonus, but BLG was resilient to win rounds afterward to keep a small lead. Then, it was over, as BLG won 13-9 and completed the grand finals win 3-1, earning their first regional title as champions of VCT China 2025 Stage 2.</p>

<p>The star of the series was rushia, who was consistent throughout the series to assist whzy and Knight, and then stepped up on Lotus to close the series out. He ended the series with a lobby-leading 1.13 match rating and 80% KAST, alongside 205 ACS, 133 ADR, and a positive 7 first kills to 6 first deaths.</p>

<p>With this win, not only have BLG won their title as DRG finished in second, but VCT China has their official seeding for Champions Paris. BLG has the top seed after their impressive regional performances in 2025, while DRG earned the second seed after advancing to the finals in the Stage 2 playoffs. </p>

</span>, EDG earned the third seed due to a one-point lead in Championship Points over XLG. The teams earned equal points in the Stage 2 playoffs, but the points EDG earned from both Kickoff and Masters Bangkok edged them ahead of XLG, who stepped up regionally but struggled at Masters Toronto.</p>

<p>Additionally, with both Chinese Ascension teams qualifying for Champions Paris, the team that finishes higher in the final VCT competition of 2025 will retain its slot in 2026. The lower team will have to compete in the Ascension tournament soon after Champs to try and requalify for VCT 2026.</p>
