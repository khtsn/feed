Winds up to 70 miles per hour and hail from two inches to three and a half inches (from the size of a lime to a little bigger than a baseball) are possible, along with a tornado or two. </p></li><li><p>Severe thunderstorms are possible by later afternoon across southwest Kansas and into the Panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas. The storm activity is forecast to continue overnight across western Oklahoma.</p></li><li><p>A portion of the central United States is also at risk for isolated instances of heavy rain that could lead to flash flooding. That includes parts of East Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Louisiana.</p></li><li><p>By the afternoon, several tornado warnings and watches had been issued across the region, including <a href="https://x.com/NWStornado/status/1915521871933489660" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a warning</a> in Omaha, Neb. (Warnings are issued after a tornado is spotted on a radar or a trained spotter sees a tornado, while watches mean the conditions to form a tornado are in place.)</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-2"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-04-24-texasrain" data-id="100000010128843" data-source-id="100000010128843"><div slug="2025-04-24-texasrain" data-sourceid="100000010128843" id="embed-id-100000010128843">
