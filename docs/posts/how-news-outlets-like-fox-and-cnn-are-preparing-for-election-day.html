CNN is adding to its bench of legal experts in case of disputed counts in swing states.</p><p>The Associated Press, whose election calls are widely amplified by major media outlets, has determined it needs to devote more people and other resources to explain its decisions to readers.</p><p>Election Day is the news industry’s biggest night, when voters rely on media outlets to declare state-by-state winners and keep score in the Electoral College.</p><p>But as presidential polls project a razor-thin finish that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/election-night-results-timing.html" title="">could take days to determine</a> — and as baseless claims about voting fraud run rampant — news executives acknowledge that the onus is on them to help viewers understand the nuances of the vote-tallying process.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As a result, almost every major news organization is putting contingency plans in place to push back against a gale-force storm of misinformation and ensure that audiences trust their coverage. Their efforts will probably stretch far beyond Nov. 5, as absentee ballots are counted and close races potentially face legal reviews.</p><p>“We live in an environment where misinformation travels really fast, and we understand that the public is confused,” Julie Pace, the executive editor of The A.P., said in an interview. “There’s distrust in elections — there’s distrust in institutions in general.”</p><p>“We’ve assumed that because we’ve been doing it for so long, it was understood by the public, and that when we called a race, people believed it,” Ms. Pace added. “And we know we have got to do more than that.”</p><p>The A.P. has hired additional reporters to produce journalism that explains the wire service’s decisions, including for states closely contested by Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump. NBC News is dispatching a new corps of correspondents, called “county captains,” to monitor vote-counting efforts in potentially pivotal counties.</p><p>“If there are disputes, they will be there to help us figure out what’s happening,” said Rebecca Blumenstein, the president of editorial at NBC News. “It’s ultimately going to help us earn the trust of our viewers and our readers by having people in key places.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Much of the public doubt in the news media has been sown by Mr. Trump, whose insistence that the 2020 presidential election was rigged has remained a staple of his political talk. Polls show that many Trump supporters continue to believe his outlandish claims of voter fraud, virtually all of which were eventually dismissed by courts.</p><p>Over the past several months, Mr. Trump and his allies have steadily built <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/us/politics/republican-election-campaign-2024.html" title="">up an infrastructure</a> to fight back against an outcome that displeases him this November.</p><p>“We had prominent figures in American politics challenging the results of the election without evidence of widespread fraud,” Ms. Pace said. “So of course the public is going to be confused. We look at this as our responsibility.”</p><p>CBS News, which is also bracing for an influx of misinformation on Election Day, set up a new fact-checking and misinformation unit last year, staffed by about 20 journalists, called CBS News Confirmed. On Election Day, the unit will scrutinize any claims that might arise around issues like malfunctioning voting machines or hiccups at polling centers.</p><p>“Anything that creates doubt or sows concern and anxiety undermines our electoral system,” said Claudia Milne, the senior vice president for standards and practices at CBS News. “What we are trying to do is to make sure that voters know what’s really happening and get real information that allows them to vote and have faith in the electoral process.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For this presidential election, The New York Times plans to deploy additional journalists across the country to follow vote counts in key counties and precincts. The reporters will track how many votes are outstanding, including the number of absentee ballots and early mail-in votes that remain to be counted. A spokesman for The Times, Charlie Stadtlander, said the effort was aimed at providing “greater understanding of the vote count and the ability to quickly identify any problems or disputes if, when and wherever they may arise.”</p><p>The vote-counting process involves the byzantine behind-the-scenes machinery of local and state election officials. To project winners, news organizations apply their own analysis to the available data. Fox News uses The A.P.’s proprietary election research, called VoteCast. ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC work with another group, Edison Research. Each network employs its own “decision desk.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>NewsNation will rely on an independent company, Decision Desk, when the time comes to call a race.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune, via Tribune News Service, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Several states, including the key battleground of Pennsylvania, plan to count mail-in ballots only after Election Day polls are closed. In 2020, that process led to the abrupt additions of large batches of votes to the networks’ onscreen counts. Because Democrats disproportionately relied on mail-in ballots, these additional votes sometimes flipped a state from red to blue, leading allies of Mr. Trump to falsely accuse news organizations of inventing votes.</p><p>Arnon Mishkin, who oversees the Fox News decision desk, said his team had developed new models that could better estimate eventual totals from mail-in ballots. The idea is for viewers to receive more precise guidance on how to interpret early returns that may not include mail-in or absentee votes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Fox News was at the center of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/04/us/politics/panic-fox-news-2020-election.html" title="">most consequential network race call</a> in 2020: its early projection that Mr. Trump would be defeated in Arizona. No other news organization chose to predict the outcome in Arizona so early. The decision infuriated Mr. Trump, whose aides demanded that Fox News retract the call; the network refused and was ultimately proved correct.</p><p>Weeks later, Fox News <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/business/media/fox-news-chris-stirewalt-trump.html" title="">pushed out</a> a pair of top political journalists who had been involved in election night coverage. But the network stood behind Mr. Mishkin, who said that he and his team would be siloed off in a room inside network headquarters, and that he had no concerns about outside interference.</p><p>“One hundred percent of the job is to look at the numbers,” he said. “Just look at the numbers and report out what the numbers are saying.”</p><p>Asked if he had regrets about Fox News’s Arizona call, Mr. Mishkin demurred. “I joke that our stomachs were queasy,” he said. “But our brains always said this is going to be fine.”</p><p>One journalist pushed out by Fox News was Chris Stirewalt, who is now the political editor of NewsNation, a relatively new cable channel. In an interview, Mr. Stirewalt said he was taking a new approach in 2024. Rather than rely on in-house number crunchers, NewsNation will turn over its race calls to Decision Desk HQ, a start-up that provides election results. The company <a href="https://x.com/DecisionDeskHQ/status/1324710866516905984" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called the 2020 election</a> for President Biden a day before the major networks.</p><p>“What you have to do,” Mr. Stirewalt said, “is be honest with your audience about what’s going on.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Mullin reports on the major companies behind news and entertainment.
