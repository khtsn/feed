The other two installments, “Sex” and “Love,” premiered last year at the Berlin and Venice film festivals.</p><p>In his acceptance speech, Haugerud said the film was about the act of “writing and reading.” He added that people should “write more and read more, it expands your mind.” He also praised the film’s young star, Ella Overbye, whose warm, finely calibrated performance carries much of the film.</p><p>The American director Todd Haynes led this year’s jury, which included the Chinese actress Fan Bingbing, the German filmmaker and actress Maria Schrader, and the Los Angeles Times film critic Amy Nicholson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The runner-up prize went to “The Blue Trail,” a Brazilian film set in a society in which people above the age of 77 are sent to a “colony.” It was one of the most praised titles in competition at the Berlinale, as the festival is known in Germany.</p><p>“The Message,” a film from Argentina about a girl who claims to communicate with animals, won the special jury prize. In his speech, the director Iván Fund said the award represented a “counterweight” to the government’s drastic cuts to the cultural sector under President Javier Milei. “Cinema is under attack,” Fund said, but “film cannot be undone.”</p><p>Huo Meng won best director for “Living the Land,” a sprawling film about four generations of a family in a countryside village in China. The award for best screenplay went to Radu Jude of Romania for “Kontinental ’25,” a satire centered on a bailiff’s crisis of conscience after a stranger’s suicide.</p><p>The best performance award went to the Australian actress Rose Byrne for her relentlessly intense presence in “If I Had Legs, I’d Kick You.” Byrne plays a mother in Long Island taking care of a sick child and circling a nervous breakdown while negotiating a tense relationship with her therapist, played by the comedian Conan O’Brien. The Irish actor Andrew Scott won best supporting performance for his take on the composer Richard Rodgers in Richard Linklater’s chamber piece “Blue Moon.”</p><p>This year’s Berlinale has been closely watched because it is the first under the leadership of Tricia Tuttle, the American former head of the London Film Festival, whom many hoped would reinvigorate the festival. The German event has long faced criticism over its lack of glamour compared with the Cannes and Venice film festivals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Among other changes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/movies/tricia-tuttle-berlin-film-festival.html" title="">Tuttle eliminated</a> a competition program that was centered on experimental film and introduced a new section for directors’ debut features.</p><p>She has also had to navigate a heated debate around freedom of speech and the war in Gaza, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/movies/berlin-film-festival-israel-gaza.html" title="">after filmmakers criticized</a> Israel during their acceptance speech at last year’s ceremony. Tuttle said she wanted to refocus attention on the films.</p><p>By many accounts, she succeeded. Political controversy has largely been absent from the festival, and German critics have generally been positive about the festival’s lineup. Fabian Wallmeier of <a href="https://www.rbb24.de/kultur/berlinale/beitraege/2025/preisgala-goldener-silberne-baeren-wettbewerb-preistraeger.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the public broadcaster RBB</a> called it a “surprisingly solid competition” selection, and Hanns-Georg Rodek of the newspaper <a href="https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article255503474/Filmfestival-Die-Berlinale-macht-wieder-Spass.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Die Welt</a> said that Tuttle had “tackled the problems of the festival.”</p><p>Tuttle said that she had also aimed to expand the Berlinale’s appeal to locals. Figures released midway through the Berlinale, already the largest film festival in the world by audience numbers, suggested she had achieved her goal: According to the organizers, ticket sales had increased by more than 14,000 over last year.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore More in TV and Movies</h2><h3>Not sure what to watch next?
