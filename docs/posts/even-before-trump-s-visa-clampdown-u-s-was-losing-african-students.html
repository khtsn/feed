But for tens of thousands of students in Africa, that shift was already happening.</p><p>Over the past decade, applicants across the continent have traded prestigious academic institutions in countries like Britain and the United States for Chinese alternatives, attracted by government scholarships, affordable tuition, lower living costs and easier access to visas.</p><p>Africa is home to the world’s youngest and fastest-growing population at a time when many of the world’s wealthier regions — particularly in the West and Asia — are aging rapidly, making it difficult to find enough workers to keep their economies growing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Africa lacks enough universities to educate its own students, but China has mounted an effort to recruit them as the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/world/africa/usaid-africa-trump-musk.html" title="">reduces</a> its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/state-department-cuts-rubio.html" title="">diplomatic</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/us/politics/chad-us-troop-withdrawal.html" title="">military</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/africa/usaid-africa-uganda-lgbtq.html" title="">humanitarian</a> engagement on the continent.</p><p>The Chinese Communist Party sees educating the next generation of African leaders as part of a broader plan to boost China’s soft power and promote its economic and political model in the developing world.</p><p>The efforts are already paying off.</p><p>China-educated graduates increasingly <a href="https://x.com/DrHodanOsman/status/1867241258479133169" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">take up roles in African governments</a>, support the expansion of Chinese conglomerates like Huawei on the African continent and help bridge cultural gaps, whether it’s by teaching Mandarin or embracing Chinese cuisine.</p><p>China has created “an educational superhighway for African students looking to study abroad,” said Hannah Ryder, the founder of Development Reimagined, a consultancy that <a href="https://developmentreimagined.com/where-africans-study-abroad-post-covid19/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researches</a> China-Africa relations.

Depending on the program and university, students may learn in either Chinese or English, but typically take Mandarin courses to navigate daily life in China.</p><p>Attracting more African students could also help Chinese universities offset a looming enrollment decline, driven by a drop in birthrates and slowing economic growth.</p><p>Easier access to visas is part of China’s appeal. In 2022 alone, over half of all African student visa applications to the United States — or over 28,000 — <a href="https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shorelight-2324.pdf#page=8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were rejected</a>.

The latest screening measures risk throwing international students’ ability to study in the United States into disarray. Already, international students have had their visas suddenly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/nyregion/columbia-student-kristi-noem-video.html" title="">revoked</a>, and others have been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.</p><p>On Wednesday, President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-student-visas.html" title="">vowed to suspend</a> visas for incoming students at Harvard and requested that Secretary of State Marco Rubio determine if visas for current international students at Harvard should be revoked.</p><p>The new restrictions are likely to undermine the financial stability, global reputation and research output of American colleges and universities, said Ken Opalo, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service.</p><p>They are also likely to accelerate a shift toward countries like China, he said, and weaken America’s role as a hub for education, cultural exchange and talent development.</p><p>“The world’s elite come to school in the U.S., and get to acquire an appreciation of American attributes, culture and outlook,” Mr. Opalo said. “That influences the relationship with the U.S. once they go back home, and losing that also means losing American soft power.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Students like Helen Dekyem are being drawn to China by partial scholarships and lower fees for science and engineering courses. After studying Mandarin for years, Ms. Dekyem, a native of Ghana, secured a partial scholarship to pursue a degree in clinical pharmacy at a university in Nanjing. While the same program in the United States could cost her tens of thousands of dollars a year, it costs just a few thousand dollars in China, she said.</p><p>“China is the future,” said Ms. Dekyem, who is graduating this month.</p><p>Over the past two decades, China has become Africa’s largest trading partner and lender.

To meet that need, and to forge ties with Africa’s future leaders, the United States <a href="https://africanactivist.msu.edu/organization/210-813-782/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mobilized to support them</a>, including through the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1960/08/28/archives/group-off-today-in-africa-airlift-aides-in-kennedy-project-for.html" title="">John F. Kennedy airlift</a>, which sponsored hundreds of African students with limited access to higher education to attend American colleges. Those students included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/nyregion/letters-by-and-about-barack-obamas-father.html" title="">Barack Obama’s father</a> and Nobel laureate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/world/africa/wangari-maathai-nobel-peace-prize-laureate-dies-at-71.html" title="">Wangari Maathai</a>.</p><p>During that same period, China granted scholarships to train African professionals. Those efforts hit a snag as some African students <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1964/01/an-african-student-in-red-china/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">became dissatisfied</a> with the quality and socialist bent of the curriculum. By the mid-1960s, African students were shut out of China as Mao Zedong closed universities during the Cultural Revolution.</p><p>Chinese leaders began to pursue closer ties and long-term deals in Africa in the 1980s. Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, made his first trip to the continent in 2013, when more than 33,000 African students had come to China to study — <a href="https://asq.africa.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/168/2_Li_Anshan.HD-ed-2.pdf#page=7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">up from just over 5,000</a> total between 1976 and 1995.</p><p>For many of those students, arriving in China marked the beginning of a new chapter: It was their first time flying or traveling abroad and, in many cases, their first time meeting Africans from other countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>It’s not uncommon now to find African students in China sharing Nigerian jollof or Ethiopian injera while discussing Beijing’s censorship of the internet.
