While the specialized schools educate only about 5 percent of New York City high schoolers, their admissions are scrutinized yearly, as they are regarded both as shining examples of the best of the city’s education system and as symbols of entrenched school segregation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>According to the D.O.E., approximately 30,000 eighth graders and 5,000 ninth graders take the test each year. Major racial gaps have persisted in the admissions process, with 12 percent of spots last year offered to Black and Latino students — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/nyregion/nyc-specialized-high-school-admissions-black-and-latino-students.html" title="">the highest number since 2013</a> and up from 10 percent the year before. Mayor Eric Adams once referred to the schools as “<a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/03/15/de-blasio-has-means-if-not-will-to-reform-specialized-school-admissions-317675" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Jim Crow school system.</a>”</p><p>The flagship school, Stuyvesant, admitted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/nyregion/nyc-specialized-high-school-admissions-black-and-latino-students.html" title="">only 10 Black students to its first-year class of 744 students</a> last year.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
