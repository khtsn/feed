A State Department official confirmed on Tuesday that Mr. Rubio had given the order to pause new interview appointments until further guidance.</p><p>“We use all available information in our visa screening and vetting,” the State Department said in a statement, without specifying what could flag an applicant for rejection under a new social media policy. The statement noted that visa applicants have been asked to provide social media account information on forms since 2019.</p><p>The secretary of state’s order comes as President Trump is trying to coerce Harvard University and other institutions to restrict what can be said on campuses, with a particular focus on anti-Israel speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump this month said the U.S. government would no longer grant Harvard the right to enroll international students. On Friday, a federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/harvard-sues-trump-international-students-garber.html" title="">issued a temporary restraining order</a> blocking Mr. Trump from moving forward with the action against Harvard and foreign students.</p><p>Many universities in the United States rely on foreign students to pay full tuition. Those students are responsible for a substantial portion of the annual revenues of many American universities. On some campuses, foreign students make up the majority of researchers in certain disciplines, mainly in the sciences.</p><p>Foreign students collectively pursued more than 1.3 million degrees in higher education in 2023, <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/btn/24_0510_hsi_sevp-cy23-sevis-btn.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a report</a> by the Department of Homeland Security. Visiting professors from abroad will also be affected by the new restrictions.</p><p>Foreign citizens with existing interview appointments for student or exchange visas should in theory still be able to attend those.</p><p>In its statement, the State Department suggested the pause was a part of the ordinarily “dynamic” scheduling of interviews for such visas. The department said it bases visa timelines on what the officers need for sufficient vetting, in compliance with U.S. law and “to ensure applicants do not pose a security or safety risk to the United States.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Rubio issued a cable on March 25 that told consular officers to scrutinize the social media content of some applicants for student and other types of visas. That directive said that officers need to refer certain student and exchange visitor visa applicants to the “fraud prevention unit” for a “mandatory social media check.”</p><p>In recent months, Mr. Rubio has spoken about canceling student visas, revoking permanent residency status (“green cards”) and scrutinizing the social media history of foreign visitors, mainly in the context of outrage around Israel’s war in Gaza. He has said pro-Palestinian protesters on campuses have harassed other students, destroyed property and disrupted daily life, even though those acts have not been widespread across university protests.</p><p>Critics say the Trump administration is trying to suppress free speech and promote ideological conformity.</p><p>Mr. Rubio told reporters in late March that he had revoked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/rubio-immigration-students-ozturk-chung-khalil.html" title="">300 or more visas</a>, many of which were issued to students, and was continuing to cancel more daily.</p><p>In early March, Mr. Rubio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/trump-rubio-khalil-columbia-student-protests.html" title="">stripped Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a recent graduate student at Columbia University, of his permanent residency status. Mr. Rubio said Mr. Khalil, who has Palestinian heritage and is married to an American citizen, was undermining U.S. foreign policy. Immigration agents then arrested Mr. Khalil.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In some cases, the foreign citizens at risk of losing their visas or green cards have brought cases against the U.S. government, and judges have issued temporary restraining orders on federal actions.</p><p>In March, Mr. Rubio boasted about revoking the visa of a Turkish doctorate student and Fulbright scholar at Tufts University, Rumeysa Ozturk. The only protest action she had taken of any note was to co-write an <a href="https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">essay</a> in a student newspaper calling for university support of Palestinian rights and divestment from Israel. A judge this month ordered immigration officers to free her from a detention center.</p><p>Andy Newman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Edward Wong reports on global affairs, U.S. foreign policy and the State Department for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Jenner &amp; Block: </strong>A federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-jenner-block-law-firm.html">struck down an executive order</a> that threatened penalties against the law firm, which once employed a top attorney who helped investigate the president alongside the team run by Robert Mueller, who was then the special counsel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Restricting Covid Shots: </strong>The Food and Drug Administration announced that it was likely to limit access to Covid vaccines among healthy children and adults this fall. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/health/covid-vaccine-restrictions-eligibility.html">Here’s what experts expect if the plan goes forward</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Greenhouse Gas Limits on Power Plants: </strong>The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a plan to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/climate/epa-power-plant-rules.html">eliminate all limits</a> on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The Times.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Crypto Dinner:</strong> The Times reviewed a guest list and social media posts to identify who was invited to President Trump’s private event for customers of his cryptocurrency business and a White House tour. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-crypto-dinner-attendees.html">Here are some of them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build-Out of Nuclear Power Plants:</strong> President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/climate/trump-executive-order-nuclear-power.html">accelerating the construction of the plants</a>, including a new generation of small, advanced reactors that offer the promise of faster deployment but have yet to be proven.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ignoring Economic Warning Signs: </strong>The president’s economic policy approach is so far <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/politics/trump-taxes-tariffs-economy.html">rattling markets, businesses and consumers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>MAHA Report: </strong>The G.O.P. chairmen of the House and Senate agriculture committees said they were “troubled” by the Make America Healthy Again Commission’s findings and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/republican-agriculture-pesticides-kennedy-maha-report.html">urged it to use sounder science</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Rare Check on Trump’s Actions: </strong>President Trump has suffered a string of court losses, as federal judges ruled that his administration broke the law on a number of matters. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-administration-courts-judges-law.html">But judicial orders to unwind his actions can be easier said than done</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Report on the Trump Administration</strong></p><p>Hundreds of readers asked about our coverage of the president.
