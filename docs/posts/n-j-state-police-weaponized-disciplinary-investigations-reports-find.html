Platkin, announced the restructuring on Tuesday as he released two scathing reports that detailed bias in the agency’s promotional policies and systemic flaws in its ability to police itself.</p><p>The reports, including a four-year, <a href="https://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases24/2024-0924_NJSP-FINAL-INVESTIGATIVE-REPORT-8-13-2024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taxpayer-funded review</a> by an outside law firm that conducted interviews with 150 troopers, offered an ugly glimpse into how New Jersey’s largest policing agency had handled reports of racism and allegations of sexual misconduct.</p><p>“These investigations revealed deeply troubling conduct and systemic problems within the New Jersey State Police that demand reform,” Mr. Platkin said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“There are favored members at the State Police, and some members hesitate to report discrimination or misconduct for fear of reprisals,” he added.</p><p>His office recommended more than two dozen policy changes, including disclosure of complaints made against senior State Police officers and alterations to the agency’s sick-leave policies and physical fitness tests that most often penalize women. He also ordered the State Police to restructure its academy training program.</p><p>The agency’s superintendent, Col. Patrick Callahan, agreed to implement the recommendations. “We cannot allow these problems to tarnish the honor and fidelity that so many men and women in this uniform live by,” Colonel Callahan, who has led the department since late 2017, said in a statement.</p><p>The attorney general said his office had taken over all equal opportunity functions at the State Police and will embed staff members in the internal affairs unit, known as the Office of Professional Standards, to oversee the evaluation of complaints.</p><p>The public release of the reports and Mr. Platkin’s policy recommendations come a year after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/nyregion/state-police-new-jersey-women.html" title="">Justice Department began conducting its own review</a> of the New Jersey State Police. The Justice Department had no immediate comment about the attorney general’s actions or the status of its review.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Colonel Callahan was appointed acting superintendent in 2017 by former Gov. Chris Christie. Gov. Philip D. Murphy kept Colonel Callahan on when he took over the following year and later pressed for the officer’s appointment as superintendent. Last year, Mr. Murphy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/nyregion/waterfront-organized-crime-nyc-nj.html" title="">expanded the role</a> of the State Police to include oversight of <a href="https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-state-police-assumes-control-of-new-jersey-port-from-waterfront-commission-of-new-york-harbor/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Jersey’s cargo ports</a>.</p><p>The policing agency has had a storied but often troubled 103-year history.</p><p>It has been subject to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/08/archives/jersey-state-police-agree-to-job-quota-of-blacks-hispanics-job.html" title="">two federal consent</a> decrees, including one that <a href="https://nj.gov/lps/jointapp.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lasted 10 years</a> because of a documented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/23/nyregion/us-will-monitor-new-jersey-police-on-race-profiling.html" title="">pattern of racial profiling</a> in highway <a href="https://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases23/2023-0711_NJSP_Traffic_Stop_Analysis.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">traffic stops</a>. In the last several years, more than 20 officers have filed lawsuits alleging racial and gender bias.</p><p>Last year, the New Jersey State Police employed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/nyregion/state-police-new-jersey-women.html" title="">173 female officers</a> — about <a href="https://www.njoag.gov/policerecruiting/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">5 percent</a> of its 3,264 troopers. The number of Black and Latino troopers has nearly doubled since 1998, but the force is still 73 percent white in a state that is among the most <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/NJ/PST045222" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ethnically diverse</a> in the Northeast.</p><p>An investigation conducted by the law firm Kaufman Dolowich concluded that the agency lacked diversity in its top ranks. Yet it also found that race, gender and age did not have a “statistically significant impact” on the number of promotions a trooper earned in the years evaluated, 2017 to 2021.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases24/2024-0924_OPIA-Memo-Nitti--Summary--Redactions-Applied.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">separate review</a> done by the attorney general’s Office of Public Integrity and Accountability highlighted two troubling episodes involving a retired lieutenant, Joseph Nitti, who had worked in the agency’s internal affairs unit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After receiving an anonymous letter containing a complaint that a trooper had made a racist comment about a senior Black officer, Mr. Nitti “squandered police resources” trying to identify the tipster rather than investigating the accuracy of the concern, according to the attorney general’s office.</p><p>Mr. Nitti, who according to <a href="https://www.nj.gov/treasury/pensions/documents/board-agendas/sprs/sprs0923.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state treasury records</a> retired last year with a $8,893 monthly pension, obtained typewriter samples and video from the area near a post office where the envelope had been mailed and evaluated fingerprints found on the letter. Against orders, he also submitted it for DNA testing. Then, at the lieutenant’s urging, the Black officer who had been the reported target of the racist comment was brought up on bogus internal affairs charges.</p><p>Mr. Nitti referred questions to his lawyer, Robert Woodruff, who said that his client was “doing his job.”</p><p>“We already know that some of the allegations are just flat-out false,” Mr. Woodruff said, adding that Mr. Nitti had filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the State Police.</p><p>The investigation involving Mr. Nitti was not the only one in which the internal affairs unit “attempted to discover the identity of an anonymous complainant,” according to a <a href="https://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases24/2024-0924_OPIA-Memo-Nitti--Summary--Redactions-Applied.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summary memo</a> released on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In another case, investigators found that Mr. Nitti had sent a text message to colleagues discussing the arrest of a trooper who had been charged with giving alcohol and having sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl on a school sports trip. “Can we at least see a pic of her. I’d like to see what all the hubbub is about,” he wrote, according to the attorney general’s office.</p><p>None of the troopers who received the text message reported it.</p><p>All of them will be transferred out of the internal affairs unit.</p><p>The attorney general’s office concluded that the culture at the State Police had perpetuated an “inner-circle mentality” and that the circle was “dominated by white males” who used their connections to “foster fear in other members.”</p><p>“Members are discouraged from making complaints because they will themselves be subject to discipline for reporting matters too early or too late,” investigators found.</p><p>Susan C.
