But there has never been someone in the direct employ of an administration like Mr. Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, who is leading Mr. Trump’s aggressive effort to shrink the federal government, the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p>Over the weekend, Mr. Musk traveled to and from Florida aboard Air Force One with Mr. Trump, and posted on his social media website, X, that he had dinner with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday night after some tense interactions earlier in the week.</p><p>And on Tuesday, as Mr. Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, faced some violent protests around the globe, Mr. Trump made a display of having five Teslas brought to the White House grounds in a demonstration for the news media, and checked out the cars with Mr. Musk by his side. It was an extraordinary promotion of a company by the most powerful person in the federal government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I think he’s been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people,” Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to Mr. Musk. “And I just want people to know that he can’t be penalized for being a patriot.”</p><p>Mr. Musk and White House officials didn’t return a request for comment.</p><p>Associates of both Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump have talked in recent days about Mr. Musk’s planned donation to a Trump-controlled entity. Mr. Musk has signaled he wants to make the donations not to his own super PAC, which is called America PAC and has spent heavily on Mr. Trump in the past, but to an outside entity affiliated with the president.</p><p>The groups that are leading Mr. Trump’s outside activities include Make America Great Again Inc., a super PAC, and Securing American Greatness, a political nonprofit. It is not clear if the money would go to those groups or to a new entity the Trump team could create.</p><p>Both MAGA Inc. and Securing American Greatness were founded by close allies of Mr. Trump, and have a diverse set of major donors aligned with the president.</p><p>Mr. Musk is still committed to his own super PAC, which has now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">spent</a> $6 million to support a conservative candidate in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election next month. He spent close to $300 million on the presidential race last cycle, almost all through America PAC, which he founded last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But Mr. Musk is now showing a willingness to also fund some groups he doesn’t directly control. And his past giving indicates he’s willing to exceed amounts that other donors might consider excessive.</p><p>At the moment, Mr. Musk may see some political upside in showing that he is a team player of sorts.</p><p>Mr. Musk has been viewed by some Trump officials, including by members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet, as pursuing his own agenda without properly consulting the rest of the Trump administration. Mr. Musk pointedly backing some of Mr. Trump’s longer-standing, loyal groups, rather than solely his own, could help soothe those tensions.</p><p>The precise split of Mr. Musk’s money, or if he has followed through with his plans, is not known and may never be. The political nonprofit group is not required to disclose its donors.</p><p>Mr. Trump is not eligible for re-election, yet his outside groups are continuing to rake in seven-figure contributions from major donors, presumably to reward friendly lawmakers and pressure those who oppose his agenda.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a White House correspondent, reporting on the second, nonconsecutive term of Donald J.
