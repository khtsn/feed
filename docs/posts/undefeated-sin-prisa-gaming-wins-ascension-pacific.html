<p>The Asian region&#39;s Ascension competition was held in a ten-team, double-elimination bracket, with results from last year&#39;s tournament deciding the seeding for the teams. The teams qualified for Ascension Pacific were:</p>







<p>The upper bracket of the ten-team tournament was dominated by two teams: Sin Prisa Gaming and FULL SENSE. Both teams, due to the format and seeding of the competition, were one of four teams that were required to play an extra match, while other teams received direct qualification into the quarterfinals. </p>

<p>Both teams did not drop a map before meeting in the upper final. Sin Prisa Gaming defeated Revenant Esports, RIDDLE ORDER, and BOOM Esports, while FULL SENSE defeated Oblivion Force, Disguised, and Justice For Tomorrow.</p>

<p>In the upper final, Sin Prisa claimed map one in dominant fashion, 13-6. While one may have expected them to carry their momentum into map two, the 13-0 blowout that ensued may have been hard to predict. The result came about on Haven, FULL SENSE&#39;s map pick that they had won on twice before in the competition. </p>

<p>The win made for some eye-popping stat lines, including <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/31829/ivy">
		Ivy	</a>
</span>&#39;s 411 ACS on Haven.</p>



<p>The lower bracket had very few surprises. The team that had just been sent down from the upper bracket won in most cases, with RIDDLE ORDER being an exception. </p>

<p>After being eliminated in the upper quarterfinals by Sin Prisa, they defeated NAOS and Justice For Tomorrow to reach the lower semifinals. There, they fell to eventual runners-up BOOM Esports.</p>

<p>In the lower final, BOOM was matched up against FULL SENSE. Both teams had been defeated by Sin Prisa 2-0 previously, and a high-stakes rematch was on the line in the grand finals for the winner. </p>


<p><em>BOOM would end up losing Lotus, but <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/10739/shiro">
		Shiro	</a>
</span> had himself a <strong>clip</strong> on it.</em></p>

<p>After going up 2-0 with relatively few problems, a 14-12 overtime loss put BOOM, playing in front of a home crowd in Jakarta, in trouble of a reverse sweep. Any worries of that were negated on Sunset though, as they came out with a 3-1 victory to secure a rematch with Sin Prisa with a VCT berth on the line.</p>



<p>A dominant showing on their opening pick and a good-enough performance on their opponents&#39; map pick meant that Sin Prisa had a 2-0 lead heading into map three, with the chance to sweep yet another opponent in the tournament. </p>

<p>It looked as though Boom had a path back into the match on Lotus. With a 9-6 lead, they had the chance to steal away Sin Prisa&#39;s second map pick, but a thrifty round seemed to change the tides for the Korean team.</p>

<p>Sin Prisa claimed six straight rounds, but three straight from Boom forced overtime, where they won 14-12 to force a fourth map in the series.</p>

<p>Map four, played on Haven, seemed to see the home favorites pushed with a new sense of motivation. They won three rounds to open the map, but Sin Prisa were back online following the run. Nine straight rounds from Sin Prisa gave them a comfortable halftime lead. The back-and-forth nature of the match continued, as BOOM tied up the map at 9-9 after beginning their attack side. They didn&#39;t look back, dropping just one round in the second half to force map five and bring the threat of a reverse sweep close to a reality.</p>

<p>It felt as though Boom could do no wrong. They had the momentum and the crowd behind them on Bind, which they used to come out to an 11-6 lead. Despite the cushion of rounds, a Sin Prisa comeback forced overtime, and the Ascension grand final was settled 17-15 in favor of the Koreans. </p>
