It is also used, and abused, recreationally.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The police in Los Angeles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/arts/matthew-perry-ketamine-investigation.html" title="">acknowledged this year</a> that they were working with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to investigate the source of Perry’s ketamine and whether it was obtained legally. A spokesman for the United States Postal Inspection Service said it was assisting with the investigation.</p><p>The autopsy report said that Mr. Perry had been on ketamine infusion therapy, but it determined that the ketamine in his system could not have been from his last known therapy session, about a week and a half before he died. The autopsy said the level of ketamine found in Mr. Perry’s blood was equivalent to the amount that would be used during general anesthesia.</p><p>Mr. Perry had a history of drug and alcohol addiction, which he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/23/arts/television/matthew-perry-friends-lovers-and-the-big-terrible-thing.html" title="">wrote about in a memoir</a>.</p><p>The medical examiner’s office said that drowning, coronary artery disease and buprenorphine, which is used to treat drug addiction and for pain, had contributed to his death.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
