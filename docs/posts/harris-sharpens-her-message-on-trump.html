    <h1>Harris Sharpens her Message on Trump</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Kamala Harris delivered a short and searing statement today from the vice president’s official residence at the Naval Observatory, rarely a site for political events. She called Donald Trump “unhinged and unstable,” and said that reports that he made admiring remarks about Hitler offered voters “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/harris-kelly-trump.html" title="">a window into who Donald Trump really is</a>.”</p><p>Harris pointed to comments that John Kelly, the former Marine general and Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, made to my colleague Michael Schmidt. Kelly, across three interviews, said that Trump met the definition of a fascist and would govern like a dictator if re-elected. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html" title="">Listen to his comments</a>.</p><p>Trump’s campaign has tried to discredit Kelly, and has denied his accounts.</p><p>Harris’s speech today, after which she took no questions, showed a shift in campaign strategy. As Democrats grow anxious about the closeness of the race, Harris is trying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/harris-trump-strategy.html" title="">to turn the race into a referendum on the former president</a> — a man they think they can convince enough voters to vote against.</p><p>Trump has also ramped up his attacks on Harris. His comments have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/trump-harris-attacks-personal.html" title="">become more personal and derogatory</a> as Election Day nears.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahn Young-Joon/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-1f3cbf26">The U.S. said North Korea sent troops to aid Russia</h2><p>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said today that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/north-korea-russia-military-ukraine.html" title="">North Korean troops had landed in Russia to join the fight against Ukraine</a>. Austin called the troops’ presence a “very, very serious” escalation that would have ramifications in both Europe and Asia.</p><p>American officials estimate that 3,000 North Korean troops have been dispatched to training sites in the Russian Far East. South Korean officials said they expect their numbers to swell to 10,000 by December. Austin cast the development as a sign of desperation by Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. More than 600,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to U.S. estimates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A picket line outside Boeing’s Seattle office, last week. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">M.

The deal on the table includes raises of nearly 40 percent over four years.</p><p>However, even if the more than 33,000 workers agree to return, Boeing’s new C.E.O. acknowledged that there’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/business/boeing-earnings-strike-vote.html" title="">still much more to do in order to revitalize the beleaguered company</a>, both in its reputation and its finances.

He did the same for the decade prior on “Saturday Night Live.”</p><p>So it might surprise some fans to see him embrace the testier, less flattering aspects of his personality on “Dad Man Walking,” his new comedy special, which comes out this weekend. It’s about parenting, or as Meyers describes it: the reality that “good parents have moments where they really hate what their kids are doing.” Friends of his, like John Mulaney and Andy Samberg, said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/arts/television/seth-meyers-late-night.html" title="">it’s a part of his personality that’s always been present</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shrek, a Przewalski’s horse, in Aurora, Colo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Brenner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-db00f40">How two of the world’s rarest horses got lost</h2><p>Hannah Huckabay, who lives with her four children on a ranch in Aurora, Colo., paid $1,375 this summer to save a mule from the so-called slaughter pipeline. But when the animal arrived, she realized that it was not a mule but a Przewalski’s — a horse so rare that it was once extinct in the wild.</p><p>Shockingly, the Huckabays weren’t alone. Another Przewalski’s turned up at a Utah sanctuary after it had been purchased at an auction for just $35. My colleague Sarah Maslin Nir traveled across the region, talking to ranchers and investigating how the horses got there. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/nyregion/rare-horses-przewalski.html" title="">Here’s what she found</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Little Island is one of New York’s newest free attractions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Colin Clark for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linda Xiao for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The American Giants Museum in central Illinois.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Birks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><h2 id="link-1b98e95b">A tribute to the fiberglass giants</h2><p>For more than a decade, a 19-foot-tall fiberglass man has towered over Atlanta, Ill., a tiny no-stoplight town along Route 66.
