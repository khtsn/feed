She was 45.</p><p>The cause was brain cancer, her mother, Joan Powers, said.</p><p>Dr. Powers appeared as a medical expert on Fox Business and Fox News, contributing to “Fox &amp; Friends” and the talk show “Red Eye,” among other programs, throughout the 2010s. She had <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6009020300001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emergency surgery</a> in 2018 after doctors found fluid around her heart, starting a yearslong journey with life-threatening health crises.</p><p>In July 2020, she had a seizure and was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer. Dr. Powers had three brain surgeries and received chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy treatment, as her family described on a GoFundMe page, but the cancer returned and another mass was found in her brain <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3tzDntO6rG/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier this year</a>.</p><p>Kelly Ann Powers was born in Yonkers, N.Y., on May 13, 1979, to Joan Marie Powers and Joseph Powers.

During the height of the coronavirus pandemic, she would appear on Fox Business to talk about the virus and vaccine development.</p><p>After her diagnosis in 2020, Dr. Powers began to document her health journey on social media and spoke about it on TV. She called herself the “unluckiest lucky girl” because her cancer was caught early.</p><p>Amid her health challenges, Dr. Powers and her husband, Steven Doll, wanted to have a baby. But her cardiologist told her she should not carry a child, so they chose to use a surrogate, she said in a 2023 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN4vBpsZ8LU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iHeart Radio interview</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Her son, Bennett, was born in 2021 while she continued to receive treatments. Her parents, husband and son survive her.</p><p>During this time, Dr. Powers also used her platform to talk about brain cancer research and raise money for medical nonprofits and organizations.</p><p>“This horrible disease needs to stop, and we all need to just fight cancer in general, every type of cancer,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8Mv2GjunJn/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she said on Instagram in June</a>. “Why is this even still a problem?”</p><p>Sheelagh McNeill<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
