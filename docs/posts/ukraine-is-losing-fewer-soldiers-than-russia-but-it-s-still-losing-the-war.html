As Ukrainian positions are exposed, they are suffering heavy casualties inflicted from afar by Russian drones, shells and glide bombs.</p><p>Calculating the scale of the casualties, and therefore the war’s trajectory, is difficult: The information is a state secret in both countries. The Ukrainian government has been especially secretive, restricting access to demographic data that could be used to estimate its losses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian soldiers carrying the coffin of a comrade killed in recent fighting in eastern Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Finbarr O&#39;Reilly for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The most complete counts of Ukraine’s dead soldiers are made by groups abroad with biased or opaque motivations.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Working with incomplete information, experts estimate that Ukraine has suffered about half of Russia’s irreplaceable losses — deaths and injuries that take soldiers out of battle indefinitely — in the nearly three-year-old war.</p><p>Russia is still winning. Its much larger population and more effective recruitment have allowed it to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-soldiers.html" title="">replace losses</a> more effectively, and to gradually push forward, said Franz-Stefan Gady, a Vienna-based military analyst. </p><p>“The fat man grows thinner. But the thin man dies,” Mr. Gady said.</p><h2 id="link-19abb55f">Counting the dead</h2><p>The most complete publicly available tallies of Ukrainian deaths come from two opaque websites that track obituaries, posthumous medal awards, funeral announcements and other death-related information published online.</p><p>The websites — <a href="https://lostarmour.info/ukr200" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lostarmour.info</a> and <a href="https://ualosses.org/en/soldiers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UALosses.org</a> — have produced similar results: They have each individually counted about 62,000 Ukrainian soldiers who have died since the invasion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Lostarmour and UALosses say they can only find some of the dead soldiers, because obituaries are published with a delay, and some deaths are never publicized at all. Lostarmour estimates that more than 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died by December, in total.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A memorial in Kyiv in November for Ukrainian soldiers killed in the conflict.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mauricio Lima for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>By comparison, Russian researchers and journalists have used similar methods to estimate that Russia had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/europe/russia-troops-losses-ukraine.html" title="">suffered more than 150,000 battlefield deaths</a> through the end of November.</p><p>Lostarmour’s casualties project is run by about 10 anonymous volunteers, most of them Russian, who scour the internet and cross check information to verify its authenticity, the website’s spokesman said in an emailed response to questions. The group appears to sympathize with Russia and seeks to discredit Ukraine’s propaganda.</p><p>The person who claims to run UALosses told The New York Times in a message exchange on X that he is an IT specialist based in a Western country who started his project to address a public knowledge gap. He said he has no ties to Ukraine or Russia and works anonymously to avoid legal and personal risk. The Times was not able to confirm those personal details.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Ukrainian government has accused UALosses of “disseminating false information,” and appears to periodically block the website. Lostarmour is blocked in Ukraine, like all other websites registered in Russia.</p><p>The websites’ secrecy or ideological bias do not necessarily invalidate their findings. The independent Russian media outlet Mediazona and the Ukrainian nonprofit <a href="https://memorybook.org.ua/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Memory Book</a> have separately verified some UALosses data by taking random tally samples and matching them with online obituaries.</p><p>A Times statistical analysis of Lostarmour’s public data has found that 97 percent of the group’s entries are accurate with 95 percent certainty, with a 5 percent margin of error.</p><h2 id="link-6b007683">Intelligence estimates</h2><p>In a rare move, a prominent Ukrainian public figure in December contradicted his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/europe/ukrainian-war-dead.html" title="">country’s official casualty claims</a>.</p><p>The independent war correspondent Yurii Butusov <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_XZUcBExag&amp;t=2767s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced to his 1.2 million YouTube subscribers</a> that sources inside Ukrainian Armed Forces’s headquarters told him that 105,000 soldiers have been “irreversibly lost,” including 70,000 killed and 35,000 missing. That’s far more than the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/europe/ukrainian-war-dead.html" title="">43,000 soldiers that President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed had been killed</a> as of Dec. 8.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Butusov added that his figure excludes units outside the Armed Forces’ command, such as the National Guard. This would increase the total casualties number further.</p><p>A military analyst familiar with Western governments’ assessments of Ukrainian casualties said Mr. Butusov’s numbers were credible. The analyst discussed sensitive information on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Western intelligence agencies have been reluctant to disclose their internal calculations of Ukrainian casualties for fear of undermining an ally. American officials have previously said that Kyiv withholds this information from even the closest allies.</p><p>Rare estimates of Ukrainian losses provided by Western officials have far exceeded Kyiv’s official figures. U.S. officials told The Times in 2023 that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/us/politics/ukraine-russia-war-casualties.html" title="">70,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died by August of that year</a>. Many of the bloodiest battles of the war have been fought since. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Families and friends of missing Ukrainian soldiers protested in Kyiv in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Butusov’s losses figure excludes severe injuries, a crucial aspect of a military’s fighting ability.</p><h2 id="link-7f916875">Missing in action, and in statistics</h2><p>Adding to the obfuscation surrounding Ukraine’s casualties are the large number of soldiers it has declared missing in action.</p><p>About 59,000 Ukrainians were registered as missing in December, most of them soldiers, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs. Mr. Butusov said in December that 35,000 Armed Forces members were listed as missing.</p><p>The military analyst familiar with Western assessments said the vast majority of missing Ukrainian soldiers are believed to be dead.</p><p>Ukrainian law makes it difficult for the relatives of missing men to declare them dead, for inheritance or other purposes. This has created a legal purgatory for the families whose loved ones have not been recovered from the battlefield, keeping the casualty tallies artificially low.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Firing toward Russian targets in Ukraine’s Donbas region last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Alyona Bondar, a Ukrainian cafe worker, said she has received no information about her brother, a soldier, since he went missing on the battlefield in southern Ukraine in 2023.</p><p>“It would be better to tell the truth, including for the sake of my brother,” she said in a phone interview. “It would be better to have a grave to visit, instead of him lying somewhere in a field for a year and a half.”</p><p>Combat deaths are just one aspect of a military’s depletion. A more comprehensive measure is irreplaceable, or irreversible losses: a combined number of deaths and serious injuries that prevent a soldier fighting again.</p><h2 id="link-3a3cbf8">What it means</h2><p>Combining the estimates, with their caveats and shortcomings, analysts conclude that Russia loses slightly fewer than two soldiers to death and severe injury for every Ukrainian fighter who suffers the same fate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>This ratio has not allowed Ukraine to overcome Russia’s population and recruitment advantages. At current trends, Ukraine is losing a larger share of its smaller army.</p><p>There are currently more than 400,000 Russians facing about 250,000 Ukrainians on the front line, and the gap between the armies is growing, according to the military analyst familiar with Western assessments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Russian conscript soldiers waiting for lunch at an army position in Russia’s Kursk region in December.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Russia has been able to rebuild and even expand its battered invasion force by tapping into a population that is four times larger than Ukraine’s, carrying out its first draft since World War II and enlisting felons and debtors. The government of Russia’s autocratic president, Vladimir V. Putin, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-soldiers.html" title="">paying increasing bounties to new recruits</a>, and recently began pressing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-soldiers.html" title="">people accused of crimes to enlist</a> in exchange for dismissing charges.</p><p>.</p><p>These recruitment efforts brought Russia between 600 and 1,000 new fighters a day last year, according to Russian financial statistics. Kyiv matched this rate only briefly in that period.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>North Korea also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/world/europe/north-korea-soldiers-ukraine.html" title="">sent about 11,000 soldiers</a> to aid Moscow’s forces in the Kursk region of southern Russia, where the Ukrainians captured territory last summer.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky’s need to contend with public opinion has led his government to delay an unpopular draft, and then left it struggling to enforce it. Some men have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/world/europe/ukraine-war-draft-dodgers-conscription.html" title="">gone into hiding to evade conscription</a>, or bribed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/europe/ukraine-draft-scandal-conscription.html" title="">draft officers</a> to obtain an exemption. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/world/europe/ukraine-convicts-zelensky.html" title="">Ukraine’s tardy recruitment of convicts</a> has produced a small fraction of fighters who had enlisted from Russian prisons.</p><p>.</p><p>The recruitment gap ultimately shapes the battlefield.</p><p>Russia is losing more men.
