Putin of Russia on Thursday did not rule out a U.S. and Ukrainian proposal for a monthlong cease-fire, but he set down numerous conditions that would most likely delay any truce — or could make one impossible to achieve.</p><p>Mr. Putin’s comments during a news conference highlighted the balance he was trying to strike, exuding confidence in Russia’s position on the battlefield while seeking to continue talks with the United States and avoid upsetting President Trump. The U.S. president, having antagonized the country’s allies and realigned American foreign policy in Russia’s favor, has emerged as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/europe/russia-us-ukraine-trump-putin.html" title="">key geopolitical partner for Mr. Putin</a>.</p><p>In sharp remarks later in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said the Russian leader set so many conditions “that nothing will work out at all or that it will not work out for as long as possible.”</p><p>Mr. Putin’s comments came before he was to meet with Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, to discuss the cease-fire proposal that Ukraine had already agreed to. As of early Friday Moscow time, the Kremlin had not commented on how the meeting went. But the Kremlin said Mr. Putin had also spoken by phone with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, about Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Putin’s remarks also came as Russia kept up its momentum in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/europe/kursk-ukraine-russia-war.html" title="">key battle in the Kursk region</a> of Russia, where Moscow’s forces appeared close to pushing Ukraine out of the territory it seized last summer. Such a development would reduce Kyiv’s leverage in future peace talks.</p><p>“The idea itself is the right one, and we definitely support it,” Mr. Putin said, referring to the cease-fire proposal. “But there are questions that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to talk them through with our American colleagues and partners.”</p><p>Mr. Putin suggested that his conditions would include limits to Ukraine’s ability to mobilize more troops and import weaponry during a cease-fire — restrictions that would put Kyiv at a deeper disadvantage if the fighting restarted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Vladimir V.

They suggested that the Russian leader viewed that proposal as just a part of a broader negotiation between Washington and Moscow, and that he was eager to show that he was engaging with Mr. Trump’s efforts to end the war that Mr. Putin began with his full-scale invasion three years ago.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Putin said he might “have a call with President Trump and talk it over with him.” When asked later on Thursday if he would speak with the Russian president, Mr. Trump said he would “love to meet” and talk with him.</p><p>“We’d like to see a cease-fire from Russia,” Mr. Trump told reporters while meeting with the NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte, in the Oval Office.</p><p>Mr. Trump said the United States had discussed with Ukraine possible concessions as part of a peace agreement. “We’ve been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “A lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed.”</p><p>Mr. Putin appears keen to stay on Mr. Trump’s good side, given the geopolitical victories that the U.S. president has already delivered for the Kremlin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But Mr. Putin’s comments also showed that the Russian leader saw his forces as having the upper hand on the battlefield and that it would be to Russia’s advantage to draw out the negotiations.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protest in Kyiv this month against President Trump’s halt to military aid to Ukraine.

But there are nuances.”</p><p>He then listed those “nuances,” starting with the Ukrainian forces still in Kursk. He said that Russia would not allow those troops to peacefully withdraw and that the Ukrainian leadership could instead order them “to simply surrender.”</p><p>Ukraine stunned Russia in August with a cross-border incursion into Kursk, seizing several hundred square miles of territory. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian volunteers who collect the bodies of people killed in combat identified the remains of Russian soldiers in the Donetsk region of Ukraine last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>But Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Thursday that the country’s military had regained full control of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/europe/russia-sudzha-recapture-kursk-ukraine.html" title="">Sudzha, the main town in Kursk that Ukraine had seized</a>.
