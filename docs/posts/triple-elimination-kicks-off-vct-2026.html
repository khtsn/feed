		<p>The format for the 2026 Kickoff tournaments has been <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/status/1995910042797928692/photo/1" target="_blank">revealed</a>, featuring an all new triple elimination bracket.</p>

<p>The tournament will select three teams from each region to participate at the first masters tournament of the year, hosted in Santiago. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/search/r/event/2760/idx" target="_blank">Masters Santiago</a> will feature twelve teams across the four leagues, expanded from the typical eight teams that was seen at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025/swiss-stage" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1921/champions-tour-2024-masters-madrid/swiss-stage" target="_blank">Masters Madrid</a>.</p>

<p>All twelve teams will begin in the upper bracket, with the four teams that attended <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions 2025</a> given a one-round bye. The tournament contains an upper, middle, and lower bracket, with a loss sending teams down one bracket. A loss in the lower bracket eliminates a team, meaning that teams will need to lose three games before they are eliminated. </p>

<p>Notably absent from the bracket is the grand final. The tournament will instead end once the three qualified teams have been chosen, with one team coming from each of the upper, middle, and lower brackets.</p>

<p>The 2026 VCT season will begin in January, with each leagues Kickoff beginning on the following dates:</p>
