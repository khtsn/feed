Mr. al-Assad fled to Moscow, and U.S. officials have asked Russia to speak with him about Mr. Tice. They have also reached out to Lebanese officials who might have insights into some of the people on the list who escaped to Beirut, such as Mr. Mamlouk. Mr. al-Hassan’s location is unknown.</p><p>The United States also gave the rebels a list of possible places in Syria where Mr. Tice might be.</p><p>Journalists and nongovernmental workers have been searching prisons and other sites for clues about Mr. Tice but to no avail. The search has been complicated by Israeli bombings of Syrian military sites, which could contain clues about Mr. Tice.</p><p>The United States had previously asked Israeli officials to avoid striking prisons where Mr. Tice might have been held or that could have information about him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In a letter to Mr. Tice’s mother sent on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said he was coordinating with the Americans. He said the Israeli Army was not active in the area where Mr. Tice might be but did not provide details about the location.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The United States has asked Israeli officials to avoid striking prisons in Syria where Mr. Tice might have been held.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The United States is weighing sending Roger D. Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, to Damascus, but the decision is complicated by security concerns and the U.S. designation of the rebel group as a terrorist organization, officials said. Since the Syrian government fell, Mr. Carstens has traveled to Beirut and Amman, Jordan, trying to advance the Tice case.</p><p>Officials said if credible information surfaced, the U.S. government could move quickly, pointing to the military’s presence in Syria. Last week, when an American who had vanished nearly seven months ago emerged from a Syrian prison, the U.S. military flew him out of the country to Jordan.</p><p>Mr. Tice was abducted in August 2012. Weeks later, he appeared blindfolded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUwrEdDy1m0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a video</a> with masked men carrying assault rifles. Former American officials believe that the video was a ruse to blame militants for his abduction.</p><p>Investigators believe that Mr. Tice briefly escaped weeks after he was seized but was found by Syrian intelligence in a neighborhood in Damascus.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A witness who has spoken to the F.B.I. said Mr. al-Hassan was involved in Mr. Tice’s capture and imprisonment. The witness said Mr. al-Hassan was furious when Mr. Tice escaped.</p><p>After he was recaptured, Mr. Tice was placed in a detention facility under the control of Mr. al-Hassan, who was in charge of Mr. al-Assad’s security.</p><p>F.B.I. agents have worked for years to piece together what happened to Mr. Tice and perhaps bring criminal charges as it has in other hostage cases. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department recently charged Syrian officials with committing war crimes.</p><p>The Biden administration has tried repeatedly to pry information out of the Syrians but failed. In 2022 and 2023, Brett McGurk and Joshua Geltzer, senior White house officials, traveled to Oman to meet with <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-02-10/A-friend-in-need-is-a-friend-indeed-Syrian-scholar-Imad-Moustapha-1hjny60F9ss/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Imad Moustapha</a>, a former Syrian ambassador, U.S. officials said.</p><p>The U.S. officials confronted Mr. Moustapha with a document showing that the Syrians had Mr. Tice in their custody in 2012. The document, one of the U.S. officials said, was the equivalent of what is known in law enforcement circles as a “BOLO” — or be on the lookout — as Syrian officials combed Damascus looking for Mr. Tice after his escape.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Mamlouk has played a reoccurring role in U.S. efforts to learn more about what happened to Mr. Tice. In 2017, Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director at the time, spoke on the phone with Mr. Mamlouk about Mr. Tice. A senior C.I.A. official later traveled to Damascus during the Trump administration and spoke with Mr. Mamlouk.</p><p>Then in 2020, Mr. Carstens went to Damascus seeking answers from Mr. Mamlouk. As in previous encounters with U.S. officials, Mr. Mamlouk disclosed nothing about Mr. Tice.</p><p>Last week, the F.B.I. released an <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap/austin-bennett-tice" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">age-enhanced picture of Mr. Tice</a>, who would be 43 years old.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Goldman writes about the F.B.I. and national security.
