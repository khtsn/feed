The meetings have been among the first efforts by survivors of sexual assault to bring into the open one of the most painful aspects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine: what prosecutors and humanitarian workers say is widespread sexual assault of Ukrainian women under Russian occupation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Liudmyla and Tetyana asked that their surnames and village names not be published to protect their privacy. Ms. Kovalenko has long spoken openly about the assault on her, which occurred in 2014 during the war with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>Relatively few women in Ukraine have come forward to report cases of rape during the conflict because of the stigma attached to sexual assault in Ukrainian society, which is deeply religious and conservative, especially in rural areas. Prosecutors have registered more than 344 cases of conflict-related sexual violence in Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February 2022, 220 of them women, including 16 underage women.</p><p>But women’s groups estimate the real number runs into the thousands, with at least one case in almost every village that has been occupied by Russian troops. United Nations human rights reports have documented dozens of crimes of sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers but have not detailed evidence of any abuses by Ukrainian soldiers.

Her daughter, Olha, insisted she report the crime once she escaped from Russian-controlled territory. “I was against it,” Liudmyla recalled in an interview, “but Olha said the Russians have to pay. Of course she was right to expose this crime.”</p><p>The attack against her as she described it was particularly brutal. A soldier banged on her kitchen door at 10:30 p.m. one night in July 2022. Scared that he would break the door down, she opened it, and the soldier smashed her in the face with his rifle butt, knocking out her front teeth. He dragged her by the hair, hit her repeatedly with his rifle butt in the ribs and kidneys, and threw her on a couch, throttling her. He made cuts on her abdomen with a knife, and then raped her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I was helpless against him,” she said.

Then one night in April 2022, two soldiers broke into their house. They shot at Volodymyr — he managed to dodge the bullet and hide, she said — but they caught Tetyana as she tried to run away. They pinned her down in the yard, pulling her hair and beating her, and then one of the men raped her. They left only when an artillery attack began on the village.</p><p>After months of counseling, and stays in the hospital and refuges, Tetyana said she had discarded feelings of rage and hate but still could not bear the physical touch of a man, including that of her husband.
