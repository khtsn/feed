Mr. Georgescu has denounced Ukraine, NATO and the European Union, and has often sided with Russia, and he has praised Romania’s fascist leader during World War II.</p><p>Despite leading, however, Mr. Georgescu took only 22.9 percent of the vote on Sunday, which is far short of the majority needed to win outright. He will therefore compete in a runoff on Dec. 8 against the second-place finisher — likely to be Elena Lasconi, a liberal.</p><p>The results have roiled Romanian politics just a week before a parliamentary election that will set the shape of the next government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Romania’s president has limited powers, but they include a big say in military spending and foreign policy. Romania has been a firm supporter of Ukraine and has played a major role in strengthening NATO’s eastern flank. A new alliance air base near Mihai Kogalniceaunu, a village near the Black Sea, will be one of NATO’s biggest in Europe.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voting in Sintesti, near Bucharest, Romania, on Sunday.

His popularity slumped amid widespread discontent over Romania’s strong but uneven economic development, high inflation and other problems.</p><p>Mr. Georgescu’s win stunned not only Romania’s establishment parties but also George Simion, a right-wing populist and outspoken admirer of Donald J. Trump who had been expected to finish at least second. He came in fourth.</p><p>Mr. Georgescu, who campaigned mainly on social media and often spoke of his Christian faith, was largely ignored by mainstream media outlets. He cast himself as an avenger sent by God to serve Romanians, particularly those struggling to survive in rural areas. Many of those people feel betrayed by political elites since the collapse of communism in a bloody 1989 revolution that ousted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/nicolae-ceausescu" title="">the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Romania has flirted periodically with extreme nationalism, most notably in 2000, when Corneliu Vadim Tudor, a regime poet under Mr. Ceausescu who was known for virulent attacks on Hungarians, Jews and Roma, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/world/fears-voiced-over-prospect-romanian-racist-may-win.html" title="">won the first round</a> of a presidential election. He lost the runoff to a veteran former communist, Ion Iliescu, a senior official under Mr. Ceausescu.</p><p>Casting his ballot on Sunday, Mr. Georgescu declared the election a “prayer for the nation” that would give a voice to “the humiliated” and to “those who feel they do not matter and actually matter the most.”</p><p>A fervent champion of national sovereignty, he has frequently criticized the European Union and NATO, including an American missile defense facility at a base controlled by the alliance in the southern Romanian village of Deveselu, west of the capital, Bucharest.</p><p>That facility, along with a second missile defense system that recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/world/europe/poland-missile-base-russia-ukraine.html" title="">started operations in Poland</a>, has long been a major source of tension between Russia and the West.</p><p>Mr. Georgescu<span>  </span>has denounced Romania’s agreement to host the Deveselu base as a “diplomatic shame.”</p><p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia says that the Romanian and Polish facilities, both fitted with ballistic missiles, were built to intercept Russian rockets and, before launching his full-scale <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">invasion of Ukraine</a> in February 2022, he demanded that they be shut down. The Pentagon says that the facilities were built to intercept missiles fired by rogue states like Iran.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
