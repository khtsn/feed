These tariffs have had exactly the effect many economists predicted, although Trump insisted otherwise: higher prices for American buyers.</p><p>Let’s say you have a business that relies on imported parts — maybe from China, maybe from Mexico, maybe from somewhere else. What do you do?</p><p>Well, U.S. trade law gives the executive branch <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/opinion/trump-tariffs-economy.html" title="">broad discretion</a> in tariff-setting, including the ability to grant exemptions in special cases. So you apply for one of those exemptions. Will your request be granted?</p><p>In principle, the answer should depend on whether having to pay those tariffs imposes real hardship and threatens American jobs. In practice, you can safely guess that other criteria will play a role. How much money have you contributed to Republicans? When you hold business retreats, are they <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/president-trumps-3400-conflicts-of-interest/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at Trump golf courses and resorts</a>?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>I’m not engaging in idle speculation here. Trump imposed significant tariffs during his first term, and many businesses applied for exemptions. Who got them? A recently published <a href="https://jfqa.org/2024/07/30/the-political-economy-of-tariff-exemption-grants/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statistical analysis</a> found that companies with Republican ties, as measured by their 2016 campaign contributions, were significantly more likely (and those with Democratic ties less likely) to have their applications approved.</p><p>But that was only a small-scale rehearsal for what could be coming. While we don’t have specifics yet, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/trumps-tariffs-global-trade.html" title="">tariff proposals</a> Trump floated during the campaign were far wider in scope and, in the case of China, far higher than anything we saw the first time around; the potential for political favoritism will be an order of magnitude greater.</p><p>As I understand it, the term “<a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-night-i-invented-crony-capitalism/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crony capitalism</a>” was invented to describe how things worked in the Philippines under the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, who ruled from 1965 to 1986. It describes an economy in which business success depends less on good management than on having the right connections — often purchased by doing political or financial favors for those in power. In Viktor Orban’s Hungary, for example, Transparency International <a href="https://www.intellinews.com/orban-cronies-control-more-than-a-quarter-of-hungarian-economy-says-transparency-international-277029/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a> that more than a quarter of the economy is controlled by businesses with close ties to the ruling party.</p><p>Now it’s very likely that crony capitalism is coming to America.</p><p>There have been many analyses of the probable macroeconomic impact of Trump’s tariffs, which will, if they are anywhere near as big as he has suggested, be seriously inflationary. Arguably, however, their corrupting influence will, in the long run, be an even bigger story.</p><p>Why do tariffs create more potential for cronyism than other taxes? Because the way they operate under our laws offers so much room for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/opinion/trump-tariffs-economy.html" title="">discretionary enforcement</a>. The Treasury secretary can’t simply exempt his friends from income taxes (although Andrew Mellon handed out <a href="https://prospect.org/culture/books/the-rise-and-fall-of-andrew-mellon/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highly questionable rebates</a> in the 1920s). The president can, however, exempt allies from tariffs. And does anyone really believe that the Trump administration will be too ethical to do so? Trump himself has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9114565/donald-trump-debate-money" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bragged</a> about his ability to game the system; he has bragged that not paying his fair share of taxes makes him “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/trump-not-paying-taxes-makes-me-smart/77CB78EA-99EF-4C00-87F7-DAEE0C087708" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">smart</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Will tariffs be the only major potential engine of crony capitalism under the incoming administration? It’s doubtful. If you think about it, Trump’s deportation plans will also offer many opportunities for favoritism.</p><p>Some of Trump’s advisers, notably Stephen Miller, seem to imagine that they can quickly purge America of undocumented immigrants, rounding up millions of people and putting them in “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/trump-military-mass-deportation.html" title="">vast holding facilities</a>.” Even if you set aside legal issues, however, this is probably logistically impossible. What we’re much more likely to see are years of scattershot enforcement attempts, with raids on various businesses suspected of employing undocumented immigrants.</p><p>But what criteria will decide which businesses become priority targets for such raids and which will be left alone, effectively exempted, for years? What do you think?</p><p>And there’s more, of course. For example, Trump has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/22/nx-s1-5161480/trump-media-threats-abc-cbs-60-minutes-journalists" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> a willingness to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/business/media/trump-media-broadcast-licenses.html" title="">take away the licenses</a> of TV networks that provide, in his view, unfavorable coverage.</p><p>If crony capitalism is coming, what will it do to America? Obviously it will be bad for democracy, both by helping to lock in a large Republican financial advantage and by guaranteeing vocal business support for Trump, no matter how much damage his policies do. It will also enrich Trump and those around him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Beyond that, a system that rewards businesses based on their political connections will surely exert a drag on economic growth. Many attempts to explain Italy’s dismal economic record over the past generation attribute poor performance in part to <a href="https://theconversation.com/italys-economy-has-cronyism-disease-but-will-its-next-government-treat-it-92807" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pervasive cronyism</a>. One <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/cost-populism-evidence-history" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent study</a> found that populist regimes, whether of the left or the right — regimes that are generally crony capitalist as well — tend to suffer a long-run growth penalty of about one percentage point each year.</p><p>Time will tell. The evidence suggests that the rules for how to succeed in American business are about to change, and not in a good way.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Paul Krugman has been an Opinion columnist since 2000 and is also a distinguished professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center.
