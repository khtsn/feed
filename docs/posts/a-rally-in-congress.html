    <h1>A Rally in Congress</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><div id="top-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-top">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p><div></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Last night, President Trump gave what sounded like a campaign speech. He mocked Democrats, decried “wokeness,” bragged about his accomplishments and repeated falsehoods. Except this speech wasn’t delivered at a rally. It was in Congress, and the audience included Democrats. The mood was sour, and the parties jeered at each other. The evening showcased the chasm in our polarized politics.</p><p>Democrats repeatedly interrupted Trump. Representative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/al-green-trump-speech-heckling.html" title="">Al Green of Texas</a> waved his cane and shouted when Trump said he’d won a mandate. Green refused to sit down, and the House speaker ordered security to remove him. Democrats continued to yell throughout the speech. Many held signs saying “FALSE.”</p><p>Trump egged on the confrontation. He said Democrats wouldn’t clap or cheer at anything he said or did — even if he cured a deadly disease or eliminated crime. “They won’t do it, no matter what,” Trump said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Democratic lawmakers during the joint address.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>At one point, Trump pointed to Republicans to say, “It’s <em>our</em> presidency.” He called Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts “Pocahontas.” He derided Democrats for launching criminal investigations against him. “How did that work out?” he asked.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The back and forth would have been unthinkable during most of the formal, and typically stuffy, addresses that presidents have given to joint sessions of Congress for more than a century. Consider the outrage that milder displays drew in previous years: In 2005, pundits from both parties condemned Democrats for booing George W. Bush during his State of the Union speech. In 2009, a Republican congressman publicly apologized after interrupting Barack Obama’s speech by yelling, “You lie!”</p><p>Trump also embraced his role as a showman. He gave a Secret Service badge to Devarjaye Daniel, a 13-year-old with brain cancer who wants to be a cop and came to the speech wearing a police uniform. He unveiled an executive order to rename a Texas wildlife refuge for Jocelyn Nungaray, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/us/houston-venezuelan-immigrants-murder-jocelyn-nungaray.html" title="">a Houston 12-year-old</a> killed, the police say, by Venezuelan migrants. And the president surprised Jason Hartley, a high school senior whose family members served in the military, with admission to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Devarjaye Daniel holding his honorary Secret Service badge. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Today’s newsletter will break down Trump’s speech, with reporting from my colleagues.</p><h2 id="link-449e1da3">Trump’s policies</h2><p>Historically, presidents address Congress to urge lawmakers to work on specific legislation. Trump did little of that last night. For much of his speech, he boasted about how much he has done without Congress. He listed his accomplishments, often making misleading statements:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ukraine.</strong> Trump said he appreciated a conciliatory note from Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, that seemed to calm the dispute the two leaders had in the Oval Office last week. “They are ready for peace,” Trump said of Russia. “Wouldn’t that be beautiful?”</p></li><li><p><strong>Tariffs.</strong> He acknowledged that tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China might hurt American farmers, saying that there “may be a little bit of an adjustment period.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration.</strong> He cited a drop in illegal immigration. He also claimed that his administration was conducting rapid deportations. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/04/us/trump-speech-congress/president-trump-said-that-his-administration-has-been-removing-illegal-immigrants-from-the-country-and-getting-them-out-fast?smid=url-share" title="">This is misleading</a>: At the current pace, the Trump administration would deport half as many people as the Obama administration once did in a 12-month period.</p></li><li><p><strong>Government cuts.</strong> Trump recited a list of funding programs that Elon Musk’s DOGE team cut, including one in the African nation of Lesotho, a country he said “nobody has heard of.” He also said his administration had found “hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/04/us/trump-speech-congress/we-found-hundreds-of-billions-of-dollars-of-fraud?smid=url-share" title="">a claim that lacks evidence</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spending.</strong> Trump said Congress would balance the federal budget. But the proposal House Republicans advanced last week includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that would add to the deficit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Attacks on “wokeness.”</strong> Trump cited his efforts to eradicate D.E.I. and bar transgender athletes from women’s sports. “Wokeness is trouble, wokeness is bad, it’s gone,” he said.</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/05/us/trump-speech-congress" title="">Read The Times’s fact check</a>, which assessed more than two dozen of Trump’s claims.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h2 id="link-798efd88">More on the night</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><ul><li><p>Trump’s speech lasted over 100 minutes — the longest presidential address to Congress in modern history.</p></li><li><p>Senator Elissa Slotkin delivered the Democrats’ response. She argued that Trump’s agenda would hurt taxpayers and America’s reputation. Trump, she said, is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/elissa-slotkin-trump-speech-response.html" title="">going to make you pay</a> in every part of your life.”</p></li><li><p>Trump pressed for the United States to take control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. “We’re going to get it one way or the other,” he said of Greenland.</p></li><li><p>House Democrats’ guests included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/veteran-firings-trump-musk-democrats.html" title="">military veterans whom Trump fired from government jobs</a>.</p></li><li><p>Trump’s speech didn’t convey, or rationalize, the scale and intensity of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/trump-speech-ukraine-tariffs.html" title="">the disruption his presidency has caused</a>, David Sanger writes.</p></li><li><p>Trump stressed his support for Musk’s government overhaul and re-litigated the 2024 presidential campaign: Read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/trump-speech-takeaways.html" title="">six takeaways</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/transcript-trump-speech-congress.html" title="">the full transcript</a>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-42cec354">Commentary</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/opinion/trump-speech-al-green-protest.html" title="">Democrats were right to protest</a>, writes <strong>David Firestone</strong> of Times Opinion: “It’s hard to blame those who couldn’t stop themselves from shouting at the barrage of misinformation.”</p></li><li><p>The verbal sparring made up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/opinion/trump-congress-speech.html" title="">the best and worst moments</a> of a night long on theater, <strong>Times columnists</strong> write.</p></li><li><p><strong>Daniel Goldman</strong>, a Democratic congressman from New York, criticized the president for not making a stronger call for the <a href="https://x.com/danielsgoldman/status/1897151218700722461" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">release of the Israeli hostages</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Carlos Gimenez</strong>, a Republican congressman from Florida, supported Trump’s remarks on Panama, calling its canal an “<a href="https://x.com/RepCarlos/status/1897131039912517823" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American innovation.</a>”</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-56b11ade">Trump’s Tariffs</h2><ul><li><p>Trump, by imposing tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, has courted a trade war with America’s biggest trading partners. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/trump-trade-war-economy.html" title="">Economists are puzzled</a>.</p></li><li><p>Justin Trudeau said he found Trump’s intentions hard to determine, but suggested that the tariffs were motivated by territorial aggression. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/04/us/tariffs-us-canada-mexico-china/7c3278ea-a7d8-5980-b649-de1a6c91ea9e?smid=url-share" title="">We will never be the 51st state</a>,” he said.</p></li><li><p>The Trump administration said it would lift tariffs on Canada and Mexico once deaths from fentanyl fall. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/upshot/trump-fentanyl-tariffs.html" title="">They’ve already fallen</a>.</p></li><li><p>Mexico’s president did much of what Trump asked: She moved to secure the border, hunted down cartels and sent drug lords for prosecution in the U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/americas/trump-mexico-tariffs-sheinbaum.html" title="">He imposed tariffs anyway</a>.</p></li><li><p>Canadians are angry about how their neighbor is treating them.
