Russia’s defense ministry <a href="https://t.me/mod_russia/44241" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> on Monday that it had inflicted damage on infrastructure at two Ukrainian military airfields, but did not specify their locations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Earlier this year, the Kremlin suggested that Starokostiantyniv would house Western-supplied F-16 fighter jets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/europe/ukraine-russia-f-16s.html" title="">as the aircraft were en route to Ukraine</a>. The claim could not be independently verified, and Ukraine has kept secret where it bases the powerful jets.</p><p>Russian air attacks over the past month or so have mostly involved drones, in what military experts say is a strategy to probe and exhaust Ukrainian air defenses before launching more powerful air assaults involving a greater number missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=482651341443536&amp;rdid=uT8OyZEyFbaUx1x1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Sunday that Russia had launched about 20 missiles and nearly 400 drones in the past week.</p><p>Attacking daily with waves of drones has two main benefits for Russia. First, it compels Ukraine to use up some of its stocks of missiles to intercept the drones. Second, it exposes the location of Ukrainian air defenses by forcing Kyiv’s troops to fire their weapons to shoot down the drones, facilitating Moscow’s planning for future attacks.</p><p>Attack drones are relatively inexpensive and can cost only a few thousand dollars to produce. But the missile interceptors sometimes used to shoot them down are significantly more costly.</p><p>In recent months, Ukraine has received more air defense weapons from its Western allies, but its stocks remain limited. When Russia in the past launched massive air assaults combining waves of drones and missiles, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/13/world/europe/ukraine-missile-defenses.html" title="">often managed to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>To save its limited stocks of air defense missiles, Ukraine has increasingly used small mobile groups dispersed across the country and tasked with shooting down the drones with antiaircraft guns such as the German-made Gepards.</p><p>Still, each time Ukraine activates its radars to detect drones and then fires at them, it exposes the positions of its air defense systems to Russian forces, enabling Moscow to map them out and plan future attacks accordingly.</p><p>Andrii Cherniak, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said that Russia had started using a new type of cheap drone carrying a camera to identify the location of Ukraine’s air defenses. “They identify where our mobile groups are positioned, where the machine guns are that can destroy them,” he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-deploys-cheap-drones-locate-ukraines-air-defences-2024-07-26/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Reuters in July</a>.</p><p>Many in Ukraine expect Russia to launch large-scale missile attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure ahead of winter, seeking to plunge Ukrainians into cold and darkness as subzero temperatures set in.</p><p>To bolster its air defenses, Ukraine has been counting on the F-16s, which can shoot down incoming missiles. Ukrainian authorities announced in early August that a first batch of the jets had arrived, and some were used on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/world/europe/ukraine-f16-pilot-crash.html" title="">at least one occasion that month to shoot down Russian missiles and drones</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This has made the F-16s a high-value target for Russia. Over the summer, anticipating the arrival of the jets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/europe/ukraine-russia-f-16s.html" title="">Moscow intensified bombings on air bases</a> thought to be potential launch sites for them. The attack on the Starokostiantyniv airfield on Monday came just a day after Ruben Brekelmans, the Dutch defense minister, <a href="https://x.com/DefensieMin/status/1842981951034241030?fbclid=IwY2xjawFvtiJleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHcdYLHtoi2xuS1514nRVH0VTitXtCXVcNJNCK5j_9uRNpW-LhRjYZqiM6g_aem_VK8KvScBouQClCDCHbCFcA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that “the first Dutch F-16s have been delivered to Ukraine.”</p><p>At the same time, fighting on the battlefield continues unabated, with Ukrainian troops slowly but steadily losing ground to advancing Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>On Saturday, Ildar Dadin, a Russian anti-Kremlin activist who had been fighting for Ukraine, was killed in the eastern Kharkiv region, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10162007712310802&amp;set=a.188894265801&amp;type=3&amp;ref=embed_post" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Ilya Ponomarev</a>, an exiled former member of the Russian Parliament and a political leader of Russian dissidents fighting alongside Ukrainian forces.</p><p>Mr. Dadin was best known in Russia as an early victim of the Kremlin’s crackdown on dissent after President Vladimir V. Putin returned to the presidency in 2012. He was detained repeatedly for peaceful protests in 2014 and 2015, including a solitary picket in support of Aleksei A. Navalny and a rally with a handful of other activists in support of Ukraine’s pro-Western revolution.</p><p>After the series of arrests, Mr. Dadin became the first person to be tried under a new law that made repeated participation in unauthorized protests punishable by up to five years in prison — a statute that quickly became known as “Dadin’s Law.” Mr. Dadin spent more than a year in prison, but was released in 2017, when Russia’s Supreme Court overturned his conviction.</p><p>Anton Troianovski<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
