The officials have also asserted a vision for postwar Gaza in which Palestinians would move elsewhere — an idea vehemently rejected by much of the world.</p><p>Holding territory, Mr. Netanyahu said, was meant to push Hamas to return at least 59 remaining hostages the group and its allies captured on Oct. 7, 2023. “The pressure will increase until they hand them over,” he said in a filmed statement.</p><p>In the weeks after the cease-fire took hold, many Gazans returned home, but Israel resumed its attacks in mid-March.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Now, the military appears to be planning to station forces in captured territory. The defense minister, Israel Katz, on Wednesday said newly captured areas would be “added to the security zones” that the military currently maintains in Gaza, including a buffer along the enclave’s borders with Egypt and Israel, and much of a key road in the center of the enclave.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu said Israel would establish a corridor, which he hinted would cut off territory in the southern city of Rafah from the rest of the strip. The so-called Morag Corridor appeared to take its name from a former Israeli settlement in southern Gaza, from which Israel withdrew in 2005. </p><p>It was not clear how large the corridor was or how long Israel intended to hold it. The military said that it would not provide details beyond Mr. Netanyahu’s statement. </p><p>In the northern town of Beit Lahia, Palestinians took to the streets to protest against the war and call on Hamas to give up power.<span>   </span></p><p>“Hamas out,” protesters chanted Wednesday at the rally. “Enough death,” they shouted. </p><p>Earlier this week, Mr. Netanyahu’s set forth demands for a postwar Gaza, including Hamas laying down its arms, Israeli security control in Gaza and what he called voluntary migration for Gazans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It’s unclear whether the recent moves by Israeli amount to a bid to pressure Hamas to negotiate and make concessions, or indicate a more comprehensive plan for Gaza. Either way, Israel would face significant pushback, and it is uncertain whether either side could force the other to accept its terms for an agreement through military means.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly conditioned the end of the war on the dismantling of Hamas’s military wing and government, but his comments offered a detailed vision of how he thought that could be achieved.</p><p>For their part, Hamas officials have rejected ideas calling on them to give up their weapons, send their leaders into exile or accept the depopulation of Gaza. Hamas is demanding an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal in exchange for the release of all the hostages still held in Gaza.</p><p>Even if Palestinians were allowed to leave Gaza or were forced out, it’s not clear where they would be able to resettle. Arab countries, including neighboring Egypt, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-egypt-jordan.html" title="">have rejected proposals</a> first publicly floated by President Trump to relocate them to their soil, with some calling the ideas tantamount to ethnic cleansing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli military vehicles along the border with the Gaza Strip last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The Israeli military resumed its attacks against Hamas in Gaza on March 18 after Israel and Hamas failed to reach an agreement to extend the cease-fire that started in January. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Wednesday, Israeli forces struck a United Nations building in the northern city of Jabaliya where several hundred people were sheltering, said Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. The Israeli military said it had attacked Hamas militants hiding inside a “command-and-control” center, without providing evidence. Israel has accused Hamas of embedding in civilian areas.</p><p>The Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency rescue service under the Hamas-run interior ministry, said in a statement that seven people had been killed. The group does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.</p><p>Since the cease-fire collapsed, Israeli forces have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strip-netzarim.html" title="">advancing deeper into the Gaza Strip</a>, including in the southern city of Rafah, though they have not been sweeping through Palestinian cities as they did before the truce. Both sides have been speaking to mediators about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-gaza.html" title="">a potential deal</a> to halt the fighting — so far without success.</p><p>The Israeli military has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-rafah-evacuation-order.html?searchResultPosition=32" title="">issued sweeping evacuation orders</a> for parts of Gaza. More than 200,000 people in the enclave have been displaced since the cease-fire broke down, according to the United Nations.</p><p>Gaza health officials say that more than 50,000 people have been killed in the enclave since the war began after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That attack killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage to Gaza. </p><p>Gabby Sobelman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> and <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
