He added that the expanding operation involved “wide-scale evacuations of Gaza’s population from combat zones.”</p><p>The remarks — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages.html" title="">echoed a similar threat last month</a> from Mr. Katz — appeared to be an attempt to further pressure Hamas amid efforts to restore a shattered cease-fire. Both sides have been speaking to mediators about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-gaza.html" title="">a potential deal</a> to restore the truce, but a breakthrough has not been achieved.</p><p>It remained far from clear whether either side could force the other to accept its terms for an agreement. Hamas is demanding an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal in exchange for the release of all hostages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel laid out what appeared to be his demands for postwar Gaza — all of which are likely to be non-starters for Hamas. They include Hamas’s laying down its arms, comprehensive Israeli security control in Gaza and the implementation of President Trump’s proposal that Gazans leave en masse.</p><p>“That’s the plan. We aren’t hiding this. We’re ready to talk about it at any time,” Mr. Netanyahu said in remarks distributed by his office on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli military vehicles along the border with the Gaza Strip last month.

More than 1,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the truce’s collapse, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>Israeli forces have since advanced on the ground in central Gaza, taking over much of a key road that divides the enclave in half, as well as in the southern city of Rafah.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The military has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-rafah-evacuation-order.html?searchResultPosition=32" title="">issued sweeping evacuation orders</a> for parts of the enclave.</p><p>More than 140,000 people in Gaza have been displaced since the cease-fire broke down, <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-165-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the United Nations</a>. Many were only just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-offensive-palestinians-displaced.html" title="">beginning to resettle</a> into their old neighborhoods across the Gaza Strip before being forced to flee again.</p><p>Gaza health officials say that more than 50,000 people have been killed in the enclave since the war began after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That attack killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage to Gaza. At least 59 hostages remain in the enclave, although about 35 of those are presumed dead, according to the Israeli government.</p><p>Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Rehovot, Israel.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
