The Gazan Civil Defense, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/world/middleeast/gaza-war-rescuers-trauma.html" title="">emergency service</a>, announced that nearly half of its employees had been killed, wounded or detained during the war.</p><div><p>The scenes embodied the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-mood.html" title="">bittersweet emotions</a> felt on either side of the Israel-Gaza border. Palestinians celebrated Israel’s release of 90 Palestinian prisoners early Monday, hours after Hamas freed three Israeli hostages in Gaza, setting off joyous reunions with their families. The exchange capped the first of what is hoped will be a series of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/world/middleeast/what-we-know-hostage-release.html" title="">weekly hostage-for-prisoner swaps</a> over the next six weeks.</p><p>As the truce came into effect on Sunday, celebrations replaced explosions and hundreds of humanitarian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire/d7fc8bda-5bc0-5cfc-b95e-bc99c38a214a?smid=url-share" title="">aid trucks</a> began rolling into Gaza. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#hostages-emily-tamari-doron-steinbrecher-romi-gonen" title="">three hostages</a> returned to jubilant embraces with relatives and friends at an Israeli hospital, while fireworks and cheering crowds greeted the newly freed Palestinian prisoners in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p><p>But the joy was shadowed by uncertainty and expectations of prolonged hardship to come, with no comprehensive plan in place for how Gaza will be rebuilt. Gazans returning to Rafah, a southern city, found it mostly flattened by fighting; the mayor said that 60 percent of homes had been destroyed and 70 percent of the city’s sewage system.</p><p>And after months of restrictions and lawlessness in Gaza that reduced humanitarian aid to a trickle, aid agencies have warned that they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#aid-trucks-began-moving-into-gaza-as-part-of-the-cease-fire-deal" title="">need unimpeded access</a> for supplies to reach those in need.</p><p>In Israel, little was announced about the health of the hostages released on Sunday, while nothing is known about the identities of four hostages expected to be freed next weekend in exchange for additional Palestinian prisoners. If the deal holds, 33 of the roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#what-we-know-hostage-release" title="">100 remaining hostages still in Gaza</a>, living and dead, and more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#palestine-prisoners-release-israel-hamas-ceasefire" title="">1,000 imprisoned Palestinians</a> held in Israel will be released over the first six weeks of the cease-fire. But the fate of more than 60 other hostages and thousands of other Palestinian detainees depends on the deal’s extension.</p><p>“This is a moment of tremendous hope — fragile, yet vital,” Tom Fletcher, the United Nations undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, <a href="https://x.com/UNReliefChief/status/1881118836264718640" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on social media.</p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Trump inauguration:</strong> Some officials have suggested that a looming deadline helped close the gap to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/gaza-truce-negotiations.html" title="">reaching a cease-fire deal</a> after months of sputtering talks: President-elect Donald J. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/us/trump-inauguration-news" title="">inauguration on Monday</a>. That deadline helped negotiators put pressure on both Israel and Hamas to accelerate their decision-making after months of agonizing delay.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hostage and prisoner releases: </strong>One aspect of the cease-fire agreement was strikingly lopsided: the number of Israeli hostages released compared with the number of freed Palestinian prisoners. Further exchanges <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire/whats-behind-the-uneven-exchange-of-israeli-hostages-for-palestinian-prisoners?smid=url-share" title="">will likely follow a similar formula</a>.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Hamas projects strength:</strong> Armed Hamas fighters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#hamas-in-charge-gaza" title="">returned to the streets of Gaza on Sunday</a>. The Hamas-run police force, whose uniformed officers had all but disappeared to avoid Israeli attacks, said that it was deploying personnel across the territory to “preserve security and order.”.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza’s destruction:</strong> The cease-fire halted a 470-day conflict that has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians and injured more than 110,000 others, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Many of Gaza’s roughly two million people have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/26/world/middleeast/gaza-south-displaced-damage.html" title="">displaced at least once by the war</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzhhZTIyM2UwLTQwMjktNWQxMi05ZTQ0LTkzNWZlZDNlM2VjZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#relatives-of-freed-hostages-thank-trump-and-call-on-israel-to-win-the-freedom-of-remaining-captives" data-source-id="100000009938348"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/johnatan-reiss"><img alt="Johnatan Reiss" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/17/reader-center/author-johnatan-reiss/author-johnatan-reiss-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/17/reader-center/author-johnatan-reiss/author-johnatan-reiss-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/17/reader-center/author-johnatan-reiss/author-johnatan-reiss-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-20T21:40:52.563Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 20, 2025, 4:40 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The family of Emily Damari, one of three women newly freed from captivity in Gaza, at a news conference at Sheba Hospital in Ramat Gan, Israel, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Family members of three newly freed Israeli hostages, in their first public appearance since their loved ones were released by Hamas, on Monday thanked President Trump for his part in getting them back, and pressed Israeli leaders to extend the cease-fire agreement until all of the remaining hostages are returned.</p><p>“We reached this moment after far too long, and without Trump’s involvement, it would not have happened,” said Yamit Ashkenazi, whose sister, Doron Steinbrecher, 31, was released on Sunday after more than 15 months in captivity in the Gaza Strip.</p><div><p>At a news conference with other hostages’ relatives at Sheba Medical Center, where the three former captives are being treated, Ms. Ashkenazi said her sister was “doing well, strong and brave, but she has a long road of recovery ahead of her.”</p><p>Ms. Ashkenazi also conveyed a message from her sister: “To continue fighting, never give up, take to the streets, all phases of the deal must be implemented.”</p><p>Meirav Leshem Gonen, the mother of one of the released hostages, Romi Gonen, 24, thanked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for “bravely and ethically making the responsible decision to initiate this critically important process.”</p><p>Ms. Leshem Gonen also mentioned Mr. Trump, “whose courageous support of Israel and reinforcement of human good in the world helped drive and bring about this moment.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Meirav Leshem Gonen, mother of the former hostage Romi Gonen, speaks at the news conference on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>She has become a particularly familiar face in Israel, appearing frequently on television and in public gatherings to speak about her daughter and the plight of more than 200 hostages abducted from Israel in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>On Monday, after getting to embrace her daughter again, she teared up when she declared Romi was now a “former hostage.”</p><p>Mandy Damari, the mother of the third released hostage, Emily Damari, 28, a British-Israeli national, added a thank you to the British government.

The Israeli military, which has started pulling its forces out of some parts of the enclave, said in a statement responding to a request for comment that “several suspects were identified who posed a threat” to Israeli soldiers, who then “responded to with fire.” It said that “hits were identified” and that further details were being reviewed.</p><div><p>The Israeli military “is operating in accordance with the cease-fire agreement and will keep to the defensive lines as agreed,” the statement said, adding that its forces remain “prepared in defense and offense.” </p><p>Earlier in the day, Wafa reported that <a href="https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/153698" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four people were wounded</a> in Rafah when Israeli forces opened fire at people in the center and south of the city and that three others were wounded when an Israeli drone fired on people. The agency said that three children were wounded when a “suspicious object from the remnants of the Israeli military” exploded in Rafah.</p><p>The Israeli military, in response to a request for comment on those earlier reports of injuries, said in a statement that “several suspects” were identified approaching Israeli soldiers who were operating in Gaza in “accordance with the terms of the cease-fire agreement,” and that “the soldiers responded with warning shots.” It did not say whether anyone had been injured.</p><p>Some continued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-cease-fire-violations.html" title="">violence is typical after cease-fire agreements</a>, according to experts. In the case of the parallel war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, in which a truce went into effect in November,<span>  </span>both sides have claimed violations but neither has suggested the deal was over.</p><p>Breaches can be relatively minor, like going too far in a demilitarized zone, gunfire initiated by low-level commanders or combatants, or accidents. </p><p>Most signatories to a truce do not want to be seen as the ones blowing it up, said Dan Byman, director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. But even a minor or accidental violation can sometimes serve as a pretext for resuming fighting, he said.</p><p>“The real question is a political one, which is when does the violation reach the level where you want to end the agreement,” Mr. Byman said.</p><p>The deal between Israel and Hamas is fragile, Mr. Byman noted. Not only is it a phased agreement in its first stage, one that has barely begun, but there is also ambiguity about what will happen in subsequent phases, should they be reached, and the deal has strong opponents.</p><p>Hard-line elements of Israel’s coalition government have denounced the deal, saying that Hamas must be completely destroyed and that because it leaves Hamas in control of Gaza for now, the agreement threatens Israel’s long-term security.</p><p>Hamas has controlled the enclave since 2007, handling matters from health care to law enforcement, and so far, there is no alternative governing authority. Since the cease-fire went into effect, Hamas has shown that it is still a force, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/world/europe/gaza-war-fighting-ceasefire-hamas-israel.html" title="">members emerging openly</a> in the enclave. </p><p>The Ministry of Health in Gaza on Monday reported more than 120 deaths verified in the past day, including more than 60 missing people who had been missing, along with more than 340 injured. The ministry does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths. It said that the death toll in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023 had surpassed 47,000. </p><p>Civil Defense emergency responders in Gaza said on Monday that after more than 470 days of war, nearly half of its personnel had been killed, injured or detained, while 85 percent of its vehicles and 17 out of 21 facilities had been damaged or destroyed.</p><p>A significant element of the first phase of the cease-fire agreement is a series of swaps of Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinians jailed by Israel. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which on Sunday facilitated the exchange of three Israeli hostages for 90 Palestinian prisoners<span>  </span>on Monday stressed the urgency of both sides’ continued commitment to the agreement.</p><p>“More families are waiting anxiously for their loved ones to come home,” Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the I.C.R.C., <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/news-release/israel-and-occupied-territories-icrc-helps-facilitate-release-3-hostages-and-90-detainees?utm_source=twitter" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>. “We call on all parties to continue to adhere to their commitments to ensure the next operations can take place safely.”</p><p>Hiba Yazbek<!-- --> and <!-- -->Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzA3Y2IyYzllLTkyMDctNWIyNC05MjA3LWJkYzZlZjM4NmJhMQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#israel-tells-its-military-to-prevent-west-bank-celebrations-for-released-palestinians" data-source-id="100000009937897"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/johnatan-reiss"><img alt="Johnatan Reiss" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/17/reader-center/author-johnatan-reiss/author-johnatan-reiss-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/17/reader-center/author-johnatan-reiss/author-johnatan-reiss-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/17/reader-center/author-johnatan-reiss/author-johnatan-reiss-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-20T20:15:23.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 20, 2025, 3:15 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Khalida Jarrar, a Palestinian prisoner, a day after her release along with other detainees in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Laura Boushnak for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Israel’s defense minister instructed the military on Monday to prevent mass celebrations in the West Bank for Palestinian prisoners being released under a cease-fire deal with Hamas, and to “hit any armed Palestinian terrorist taking part in such parades.”</p><p>Israel released the first group of 90 people shortly after midnight on Monday in the West Bank, where they were greeted by cheering crowds and fireworks. More than 1,000 are to be set free over the course of the six-week cease-fire, in exchange for 33 Israelis held hostage in Gaza.</p><div><p>The prisoners to be released range from people detained in Gaza on suspicion of what Israel says are offenses related to its national security, to others who have been convicted of involvement in deadly attacks and are serving life prison sentences.</p><p>Defense Minister Israel Katz’s office said in a statement that he had directed the military to “take all measures to avoid the repeat of mass Palestinian release celebrations and parades for the releases of terrorists” in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p><p>“The victory celebrations for terrorists must not provide further encouragement to terrorism,” he added.</p><p>With Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon apparently concluded, Mr. Katz said, the West Bank is a top priority, now the primary “arena of friction” where “shootings and terrorism against Israel persist.”</p><p>During more than 15 months of war in Gaza, Israeli forces and settlers killed more than 800 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to Palestinian officials, in clashes and military raids on militants.

But Hamas has made some efforts to improve relations with Western governments, including by issuing a policy document in 2017 that took more moderate positions than its founding charter. The document called the establishment of a Palestinian state along the pre-1967 borders between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza a “formula of national consensus,” but it also rejected recognition of Israel.</p><p>The group has refused to renounce violence and recognize Israel, and after the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, it was forcefully condemned by the United States and European countries. The attack, analysts say, was a reflection of the ascendancy of hard-line leaders in the group advocating for violent conflict over long-term understandings with Israel.</p><p>President Trump, however, has previously demonstrated willingness to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/30/world/asia/trump-north-korea-dmz.html" title="">meet</a> with longtime foes of the United States such as Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.</p><p>Mr. Abu Marzouk, a native of Gaza and a former resident of Northern Virginia, is a member of Hamas’s political office, but it is not clear whether he speaks on behalf of all senior Hamas leaders, including Mohammed Sinwar and Izzeldin al-Haddad, hard-line military commanders in Gaza.</p><p>He is considered to be one of the more pragmatic voices in Hamas and leads Hamas’s foreign relations office. Other senior Hamas officials have invested more in developing ties with members of the so-called axis of resistance, including Iran, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, Iraqi militias, and the Houthis in Yemen.</p><p>Mr. Abu Marzouk, 74, said Hamas was also ready to welcome an envoy from the Trump administration in the coastal enclave, despite longstanding American policy to provide Israel with billions of dollars in weapons and defend it at international institutions. Hamas, he added, would even provide such a visitor with protection.</p><p>“He can come and see the people and try to understand their feelings and wishes so that the American position can be based on the interests of all the parties, and not only one party,” he said.</p><p>On Saturday, NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna188274" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, was weighing a visit to Gaza to help maintain the cease-fire agreement, citing an anonymous Trump transition official with direct knowledge of the cease-fire process.</p><p>The comments by the Hamas leader were in stark contrast to many Hamas statements during the first Trump administration that blasted the relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, cutting off aid to Palestinians, and a peace plan that heavily favored Israeli positions.</p><p>After the previous Trump administration presented its plan, Hamas referred to it as “the deal of shame.”</p><p>One reason Hamas may want to reach out to the United States is to secure the entry of materials needed to reconstruct Gaza without conditions that could undermine its ability to remain the most dominant Palestinian group in the territory.</p><p>Hamas will likely need to offer some compromises if it wants enough aid to rebuild Gaza to flow into the enclave. Until now, Hamas leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-peace-talks-gaza.html" title="">have expressed readiness</a> to give up civilian governance in Gaza, but without dismantling its military wing — a dynamic that analysts have said would be similar to Hezbollah’s role in Lebanon before its last conflict with Israel.</p><p>Steven Cheung, Mr. Trump’s incoming White House director of communications, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Abu Marzouk also offered high praise for Mr. Trump for his involvement in helping broker the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas and called him a “serious president.”</p><p>“If not for President Trump, his insistence on ending the war, and his dispatching of a decisive representative, the deal wouldn’t have happened,” said Mr. Abu Marzouk, referring to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/gaza-truce-negotiations.html" title="">Mr. Witkoff</a>.</p><p>While the deal calls for an eventual “cessation of military operations and hostilities permanently,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has repeatedly suggested that the Israeli military will resume attacking Hamas after some hostages held by militants are released.</p><p>Alongside Qatar and Egypt, members of the Biden administration, including White House official Brett McGurk and C.I.A. director Bill Burns, played critical roles in putting together the cease-fire deal. But Mr. Witkoff helped encourage Israel to approve it by telling Mr. Netanyahu that Mr. Trump wanted it completed, according to officials briefed on the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.</p><p>Still, Mr. Abu Marzouk insisted Mr. Trump’s role was crucial to getting the agreement across the finish, especially in applying pressure on Mr. Netanyahu.</p><p>“Truthfully, Trump gets the credit for ending the war,” he said.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM1NWQzOTI3LTk4NDctNTdmNi05NjY4LTJlYTJlMDAxNDJmOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#gaza-food-aid-surge" data-source-id="100000009936557"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hiba-yazbek"><img alt="Hiba Yazbek" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/09/reader-center/author-hiba-yazbek-copy/author-hiba-yazbek-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/09/reader-center/author-hiba-yazbek-copy/author-hiba-yazbek-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/09/reader-center/author-hiba-yazbek-copy/author-hiba-yazbek-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-20T16:07:18.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 20, 2025, 11:07 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Aid trucks driving through Rafah on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hatem Khaled/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza surged dramatically on Sunday, with more than 630 trucks entering the impoverished and hungry enclave on the first day of the cease-fire, according to United Nations officials — the highest figure since the start of the war more than 15 months ago.</p><p>The truce allowed the U.N. World Food Program to “bring in urgently needed food aid at scale and begin pulling the war-ravaged territory back from starvation,” the agency said in <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/first-wfp-trucks-cross-gaza-ceasefire-opens-window-hope-hungry-families" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> on Sunday.

Relief agencies accused Israel of overly restricting deliveries with stringent inspections and the closure of border crossings, which Israel denied, and have said that at least 200 trucks per day were required to provide food, medicines, fuel, clean water and other essentials.</p><p>With the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas taking effect, aid convoys seemed to enter Gaza without issues, and no attempts at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/world/middleeast/gaza-looting.html" title="">stealing or looting</a> the aid were reported on Sunday or Monday, according to Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for the main U.N. agency that assists Palestinians.

It was an apparent show by Hamas, which had controlled the enclave for years, that it is still in charge and plans to hold onto power.</p><p>Videos posted to social media showed convoys driving through Gaza on Sunday, as people gathered calmly on roadsides, refraining from approaching the trucks. It was a stark contrast to the apocalyptic scenes of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-convoy-looted-unrwa-israel.html" title="">wartime aid deliveries</a>, when desperate crowds swarmed and climbed onto the trucks in hopes of securing a food package or bag of flour, sometimes resulting in violence.</p><p>“What was very noticeable is that none of the trucks that entered yesterday were looted,” said Nebal Farsakh, a spokeswoman for the Palestinian Red Crescent. “And this was the first time in 15 months that this many trucks entered Gaza,” she added.</p><p>What was less clear was how efficiently and equitably aid was being distributed after it entered Gaza, and some residents said they have yet to receive or even see the aid. Ms. Touma said that UNRWA staff and aid workers from other agencies were still sorting through the aid that has come in since Sunday before it is eventually delivered to people.</p><p>“It’s the second day of the cease-fire and they said that aid and flour have come in but unfortunately we haven’t seen any of it yet,” said Moustafa al-Aloul, a 22-year-old from northern Gaza. “Currently, the markets literally have nothing,” he added.</p><p>The Gazan ministry of social development, a part of the Hamas-led administration, said in a statement on Monday that it had “made all preparations to receive aid” and will provide all the permits needed for aid organizations to receive and distribute the aid. “Work will be done in a coordinated manner between all partners to ensure the fair distribution of aid to all citizens,” the ministry said, adding that aid will be provided to families inside and outside shelter centers and tent encampments.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians rushed to take aid from trucks entering Rafah, southern Gaza, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohammed Salem/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Israeli officials have accused Hamas of hoarding essential supplies to serve its own members and to wield control over the population, and there have been reports of profiteers seizing aid and then selling it on the black market. Aid officials say the solution is to end the scarcity.</p><p>Ms. Touma said the convoys entering Gaza have included some trucks carrying commercial goods for sale, which have rarely reached Gaza during the war.</p><p>“There were several goods that people take for granted that were very much missing from the market,” Ms. Touma said in an interview on Monday. “So it’s very good that commercial supplies have also come in because you can’t turn the two million people in Gaza into a nation that is solely dependent on aid,” she added.</p><p>The World Food Program said that on Sunday it delivered ready-to-eat meals and bags of wheat flour. It aims to send at least 150 truckloads of food into Gaza every day, along with other supplies, as well as restocking bakeries and providing nutritional supplements for children facing malnutrition.</p><p>Ameera Harouda<!-- --> contributed reporting from Qatar, <!-- -->Matthew Mpoke Bigg<!-- --> from London and <!-- -->Vivian Yee<!-- --> from Cairo.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZDhlMmE3NzktMWQxYy01NWI5LTkzZmItYTkwMTZiYTNiODg4"><div id="d8e2a779-1d1c-55b9-93fb-a9016ba3b888" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#d8e2a779-1d1c-55b9-93fb-a9016ba3b888"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ismaeel-naar"><img alt="Ismaeel Naar" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-20T15:20:34.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 20, 2025, 10:20 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The Houthi rebels in Yemen said they are monitoring the cease-fire in Gaza and vowed to attack if Israel &#34;returns to escalation.&#34;</p><p>“We are in constant readiness and our hands are on the trigger,” Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the rebel group’s leader, said in a televised address.

Mr. Kozlov, a Russian Israeli, said he focused on surviving by reciting mantras to himself in Russian, such as “You are alive; every day a gift.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Amit Soussana</strong>, a lawyer abducted from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Azza, was the first Israeli hostage to speak publicly about being sexually assaulted during captivity. She said she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/middleeast/hamas-hostage-sexual-assault.html" title="">held alone</a> in a child’s bedroom, chained by her left ankle. Sometimes a guard would enter, sit beside her on the bed and touch her, and weeks into her captivity, she was forced at gunpoint to engage with him sexually, she said. Ms. Soussana, then 40, was later moved to another location, where she said different captors beat her. She was released as part of the first cease-fire agreement in November 2023.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chen Goldstein-Almog</strong> was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/15/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostage.html" title="">abducted along with three of her children</a> from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, while her husband and eldest daughter were killed in the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7, 2023. Ms. Goldstein-Almog, who was 48 at the time, later said that she and the children were treated “respectfully” and were not physically harmed. Even so, she said, “We were in daily danger. It was fear at a level we didn’t know existed.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Ofelia Adit Roitman</strong>, who was 77 when she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/world/middleeast/hostages-israel-hamas-tuesday.html?" title="">was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz</a>, described her captivity in a video statement shortly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/09/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-stories-videos.html" title="">after she was released</a> in the previous cease-fire. “I was very scared the first two weeks,” Ms. Roitman said. “I thought I was crazy because I was alone. There was barely any light. There was barely any food.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Mia Schem</strong> was shot and taken hostage after fleeing the Nova music festival. Released as part of the 2023 cease-fire, she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/world/middleeast/hostage-israel-hamas-gaza.html" title="">described her experience</a> to Israeli news media, saying she underwent surgery for her gunshot wound in her first days in Gaza, but received no painkillers afterward and had to replace her own bandages. Ms. Schem, then 21, was held by a family that sometimes withheld food from her for entire days, even as they ate, she said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Margalit Moses,</strong> who was 78 when she was taken, said she spoke to her captors in Arabic, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/08/14/admin/israel-hostages-released" title="">serving as an interpreter</a> for a group of hostages in poor health who were held together. She was released as part of the last cease-fire and invited her guards for coffee “when peace comes” as she left. After she was freed, she realized she had actually been relatively fortunate. “Now that I’ve heard the horror stories of those who came back,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/08/14/admin/israel-hostages-released" title="">she said</a>, “I understand I was kept in conditions others did not have.”</p></li></ul></div></div></div></section></div></div>
