The Gazan Civil Defense, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/world/middleeast/gaza-war-rescuers-trauma.html" title="">emergency service</a>, announced that nearly half of its employees had been killed, wounded or detained during the war.</p><div><p>The scenes embodied the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-mood.html" title="">bittersweet emotions</a> felt on either side of the Israel-Gaza border. Palestinians celebrated Israel’s release of 90 Palestinian prisoners early Monday, hours after Hamas freed three Israeli hostages in Gaza, setting off joyous reunions with their families. The exchange capped the first of what is hoped will be a series of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/world/middleeast/what-we-know-hostage-release.html" title="">weekly hostage-for-prisoner swaps</a> over the next six weeks.</p><p>As the truce came into effect on Sunday, celebrations replaced explosions and hundreds of humanitarian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire/d7fc8bda-5bc0-5cfc-b95e-bc99c38a214a?smid=url-share" title="">aid trucks</a> began rolling into Gaza. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#hostages-emily-tamari-doron-steinbrecher-romi-gonen" title="">three hostages</a> returned to jubilant embraces with relatives and friends at an Israeli hospital, while fireworks and cheering crowds greeted the newly freed Palestinian prisoners in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p><p>But the joy was shadowed by uncertainty and expectations of prolonged hardship to come, with no comprehensive plan in place for how Gaza will be rebuilt. Gazans returning to Rafah, a southern city, found it mostly flattened by fighting; the mayor said that 60 percent of homes had been destroyed and 70 percent of the city’s sewage system.</p><p>And after months of restrictions and lawlessness in Gaza that reduced humanitarian aid to a trickle, aid agencies have warned that they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#aid-trucks-began-moving-into-gaza-as-part-of-the-cease-fire-deal" title="">need unimpeded access</a> for supplies to reach those in need.</p><p>In Israel, little was announced about the health of the hostages released on Sunday, while nothing is known about the identities of four hostages expected to be freed next weekend in exchange for additional Palestinian prisoners. If the deal holds, 33 of the roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#what-we-know-hostage-release" title="">100 remaining hostages still in Gaza</a>, living and dead, and more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#palestine-prisoners-release-israel-hamas-ceasefire" title="">1,000 imprisoned Palestinians</a> held in Israel will be released over the first six weeks of the cease-fire. But the fate of more than 60 other hostages and thousands of other Palestinian detainees depends on the deal’s extension.</p><p>“This is a moment of tremendous hope — fragile, yet vital,” Tom Fletcher, the United Nations undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, <a href="https://x.com/UNReliefChief/status/1881118836264718640" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on social media.</p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Trump inauguration:</strong> Some officials have suggested that a looming deadline helped close the gap to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/gaza-truce-negotiations.html" title="">reaching a cease-fire deal</a> after months of sputtering talks: President-elect Donald J. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/us/trump-inauguration-news" title="">inauguration on Monday</a>. That deadline helped negotiators put pressure on both Israel and Hamas to accelerate their decision-making after months of agonizing delay.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hostage and prisoner releases: </strong>One aspect of the cease-fire agreement was strikingly lopsided: the number of Israeli hostages released compared with the number of freed Palestinian prisoners. Further exchanges <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire/whats-behind-the-uneven-exchange-of-israeli-hostages-for-palestinian-prisoners?smid=url-share" title="">will likely follow a similar formula</a>.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Hamas projects strength:</strong> Armed Hamas fighters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#hamas-in-charge-gaza" title="">returned to the streets of Gaza on Sunday</a>. The Hamas-run police force, whose uniformed officers had all but disappeared to avoid Israeli attacks, said that it was deploying personnel across the territory to “preserve security and order.”.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza’s destruction:</strong> The cease-fire halted a 470-day conflict that has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians and injured more than 110,000 others, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Many of Gaza’s roughly two million people have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/26/world/middleeast/gaza-south-displaced-damage.html" title="">displaced at least once by the war</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM1NWQzOTI3LTk4NDctNTdmNi05NjY4LTJlYTJlMDAxNDJmOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#food-and-other-vital-aid-surges-into-gaza-after-15-months-of-hunger-and-scarcity" data-source-id="100000009936557"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hiba-yazbek"><img alt="Hiba Yazbek" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/09/reader-center/author-hiba-yazbek-copy/author-hiba-yazbek-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/09/reader-center/author-hiba-yazbek-copy/author-hiba-yazbek-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/09/reader-center/author-hiba-yazbek-copy/author-hiba-yazbek-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-20T16:07:18.158Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 20, 2025, 11:07 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Aid trucks driving through Rafah on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hatem Khaled/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza surged dramatically on Sunday, with more than 630 trucks entering the impoverished and hungry enclave on the first day of the cease-fire, according to United Nations officials — the highest figure since the start of the war more than 15 months ago.</p><p>The truce allowed the U.N. World Food Program to “bring in urgently needed food aid at scale and begin pulling the war-ravaged territory back from starvation,” the agency said in <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/first-wfp-trucks-cross-gaza-ceasefire-opens-window-hope-hungry-families" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> on Sunday. Tom<strong> </strong>Fletcher, the U.N. relief chief, said in <a href="https://www.unocha.org/news/ceasefire-heralds-moment-tremendous-hope-says-un-relief-chief" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> on Monday that more than 300 of the trucks went to northern Gaza, where aid had been the most scarce and humanitarian officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/world/middleeast/un-panel-gaza-famine.html" title="">warned of a possible famine</a>.</p><div><p>During the war, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-us-israel.html" title="">fewer than</a> 100 trucks per day had been entering the enclave, and deliveries had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/unrwa-aid-gaza.html" title="">at times</a> been suspended. Relief agencies accused Israel of restricting deliveries with stringent inspections and the closure of border crossings, which Israel denied, and have said that at least 200 trucks per day were required to provide food, medicines, fuel, clean water and other essentials.</p><p>With the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas taking effect, aid convoys seemed to enter Gaza without issues, and no attempts at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/world/middleeast/gaza-looting.html" title="">stealing or looting</a> the aid were reported on Sunday or Monday, according to Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for the main U.N. agency that assists Palestinians. She added that local police officers were present in some parts of Gaza to secure the convoys, while in other areas security was not needed.</p><p>Videos posted to social media showed convoys driving through Gaza on Sunday, as people gathered calmly on roadsides, refraining from approaching the trucks. It was a stark contrast to the apocalyptic scenes of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-convoy-looted-unrwa-israel.html" title="">wartime aid deliveries</a>, when desperate crowds swarmed and climbed onto the trucks in hopes of securing a food package or bag of flour, sometimes resulting in violence.</p><p>“What was very noticeable is that none of the trucks that entered yesterday were looted,” said Nebal Farsakh, a spokeswoman for the Palestinian Red Crescent. “And this was the first time in 15 months that this many trucks entered Gaza,” she added.</p><p>What was less clear was how efficiently and equitably aid was being distributed after it entered Gaza, and some residents said they have yet to receive or even see the aid. Ms. Touma said that UNRWA staff and aid workers from other agencies were still sorting through the aid that has come in since Sunday before it is eventually delivered to people.</p><p>“It’s the second day of the cease-fire and they said that aid and flour have come in but unfortunately we haven’t seen any of it yet,” said Moustafa al-Aloul, a 22-year-old from northern Gaza. “Currently, the markets literally have nothing,” he added.</p><p>The Gazan ministry of social development, a part of the Hamas-led administration, said in a statement on Monday that it had “made all preparations to receive aid” and will provide all the permits needed for aid organizations to receive and distribute the aid. “Work will be done in a coordinated manner between all partners to ensure the fair distribution of aid to all citizens,” the ministry said, adding that aid will be provided to families inside and outside shelter centers and tent encampments.</p><p>Israeli officials have accused Hamas of hoarding essential supplies to serve its own members and to wield control over the population, and there have been reports of profiteers seizing aid and then selling it on the black market. Aid officials say the solution is to end the scarcity.</p><p>Ms. Touma said the convoys entering Gaza have included some trucks carrying commercial goods for sale, which have rarely reached Gaza during the war.</p><p>“There were several goods that people take for granted that were very much missing from the market,” Ms. Touma said in an interview on Monday. “So it’s very good that commercial supplies have also come in because you can’t turn the two million people in Gaza into a nation that is solely dependent on aid,” she added.</p><p>The World Food Program said that on Sunday it delivered ready-to-eat meals and bags of wheat flour. It aims to send at least 150 truckloads of food into Gaza every day, along with other supplies, as well as restocking bakeries and providing nutritional supplements for children facing malnutrition.</p><p>Ameera Harouda<!-- --> contributed reporting from Qatar, <!-- -->Matthew Mpoke Bigg<!-- --> from London and <!-- -->Vivian Yee<!-- --> from Cairo.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZDhlMmE3NzktMWQxYy01NWI5LTkzZmItYTkwMTZiYTNiODg4"><div id="d8e2a779-1d1c-55b9-93fb-a9016ba3b888" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#d8e2a779-1d1c-55b9-93fb-a9016ba3b888"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ismaeel-naar"><img alt="Ismaeel Naar" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-ismaeel-naar/author-ismaeel-naar-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-20T15:20:34.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 20, 2025, 10:20 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The Houthi rebels in Yemen said they are monitoring the cease-fire in Gaza and vowed to attack if Israel &#34;returns to escalation.&#34;</p><p>“We are in constant readiness and our hands are on the trigger,” Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the rebel group’s leader, said in a televised address.

It did not name the two.</p><p>The violence against Palestinians in the West Bank comes as many far-right Israelis have been protesting the cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel, hoping to disrupt implementation of the deal.</p><p>On Sunday, WhatsApp groups administered by Israeli settler groups were full of angry comments about the release of Palestinian prisoners to the West Bank and calls to block their entry with organized protests. Many users said that the released prisoners, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/world/middleeast/palestine-prisoners-release-israel-hamas-ceasefire.html" title="">some convicted of mass-casualty attacks</a> on Israelis, posed a threat to citizens of Israel.</p><p>In Sinjil, a village south of Nablus, dozens of men, some carrying slingshots, rampaged through the village throwing stones and setting houses on fire, according to residents and videos verified by the Times.

He said that several people were injured, including an 86-year-old man.</p><p>On Sunday morning, a WhatsApp group for settlers posted a video of an Israeli man outside a shop with shattered glass, in Funduq, a Palestinian town. </p><p>“The next stage is destroying it,” he declared.</p><p>In a video taken from a CCTV camera in Turmus Aya, at least 20 masked men can be seen throwing stones and entering the village, as Israeli police cars appear in the distance.

But hostages released before them — even those held for much shorter periods — have described harrowing ordeals.</p><p>Dr. Yael Frenkel Nir, the director of the general hospital at Sheba Medical Center, which received the hostages who were freed on Sunday, said in a brief, televised statement that their medical condition allowed them to focus on reuniting with their families, suggesting that none of them required emergency treatment.</p><div><p>Images and video released by the Israeli government showed the former captives, all young women, walking under their own power and embracing relatives, but no details have been made public yet about their condition or what they endured.</p><p>Hostages who have been released previously have described a wide range of experiences that have taken physical and psychological tolls on them. Here is what some have said:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Andrey Kozlov</strong> was one of four captives rescued in an Israeli military operation in June. He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-gaza-koslov-hamas.html" title="">held for eight months</a> along with two other hostages, and was moved to six locations in the first two months — sometimes with only a pail for a toilet and scarce food — while shackled at the wrists and ankles. For the next six months, Mr. Kozlov, 27, and the two others were kept in the apartment of a Hamas operative. There, they were unshackled and ate regularly, Mr. Kozlov said, but they were psychologically abused and threatened. Mr. Kozlov, a Russian Israeli, said he focused on surviving by reciting mantras to himself in Russian, such as “You are alive; every day a gift.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Amit Soussana</strong>, a lawyer abducted from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Azza, was the first Israeli hostage to speak publicly about being sexually assaulted during captivity. She said she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/middleeast/hamas-hostage-sexual-assault.html" title="">held alone</a> in a child’s bedroom, chained by her left ankle. Sometimes a guard would enter, sit beside her on the bed and touch her, and weeks into her captivity, she was forced at gunpoint to engage with him sexually, she said. Ms. Soussana, then 40, was later moved to another location, where she said different captors beat her. She was released as part of the first cease-fire agreement in November 2023.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chen Goldstein-Almog</strong> was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/15/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostage.html" title="">abducted along with three of her children</a> from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, while her husband and eldest daughter were killed in the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7, 2023. Ms. Goldstein-Almog, who was 48 at the time, later said that she and the children were treated “respectfully” and were not physically harmed. Even so, she said, “We were in daily danger. It was fear at a level we didn’t know existed.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Ofelia Adit Roitman</strong>, who was 77 when she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/world/middleeast/hostages-israel-hamas-tuesday.html?" title="">was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz</a>, described her captivity in a video statement shortly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/09/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-stories-videos.html" title="">after she was released</a> in the previous cease-fire. “I was very scared the first two weeks,” Ms. Roitman said. “I thought I was crazy because I was alone. There was barely any light. There was barely any food.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Mia Schem</strong> was shot and taken hostage after fleeing the Nova music festival. Released as part of the 2023 cease-fire, she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/world/middleeast/hostage-israel-hamas-gaza.html" title="">described her experience</a> to Israeli news media, saying she underwent surgery for her gunshot wound in her first days in Gaza, but received no painkillers afterward and had to replace her own bandages. Ms. Schem, then 21, was held by a family that sometimes withheld food from her for entire days, even as they ate, she said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Margalit Moses,</strong> who was 78 when she was taken, said she spoke to her captors in Arabic, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/08/14/admin/israel-hostages-released" title="">serving as an interpreter</a> for a group of hostages in poor health who were held together. She was released as part of the last cease-fire and invited her guards for coffee “when peace comes” as she left. After she was freed, she realized she had actually been relatively fortunate. “Now that I’ve heard the horror stories of those who came back,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/08/14/admin/israel-hostages-released" title="">she said</a>, “I understand I was kept in conditions others did not have.”</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2I0YzUxMzQ5LTYxMTgtNWQyMy1iMzFmLTZkMWVhMDllMDIwNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#a-father-and-son-return-to-their-gaza-neighborhood-to-find-their-home-destroyed" data-source-id="100000009937053"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman"><img alt="Aaron Boxerman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-20T11:12:09.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 20, 2025, 6:12 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/20/20visualUploader-22208-cover/20visualUploader-22208-cover-verticalTwoByThree735-v2.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Alhassan Bahja filmed the destruction on his street as he returned with his father to check on their home on the first day of the cease-fire.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Alhassan Bahja</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Montaser Bahja returned to the city of Jabaliya in northern Gaza on Sunday, the first day of the cease-fire, to find much of his neighborhood had been destroyed beyond recognition in Israel’s war against Hamas.</p><p>Among the ruined buildings: the home where Mr. Bahja, an English teacher, had lived with his wife and children for years.

Over the six-week first phase of the truce, Hamas is expected to release 33 captives and Israel is slated to free about 1,900 Palestinians.</p><div><p>Such an uneven swap is not unusual. Israeli governments have long been determined to bring back captured civilians and soldiers, including dead ones, even at steep costs. The terms of such trades have often prompted fierce criticism domestically, much as a hostage release deal in November 2023 — part of an earlier cease-fire — did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/world/middleeast/truce-israel-dispute-hamas.html" title="">within Israel’s governing coalition</a>.</p><p>The exchange of civilian hostages for prisoners, including some whom Israel has accused of terrorism, has also raised the ire of some Israelis. In a statement celebrating the release of the three Israeli hostages on Sunday, an Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, hinted at some of that underlying frustration, saying the latest trade was not “a true like-for-like exchange.”</p><p>Two of the women were abducted from their homes and one from a music festival, and “then brutally held since,” he said. “This is a huge difference when compared to the terrorists who are being released.”</p><p>Hamas officials have said one of the objectives of the group’s Oct. 7, 2023 attack in Israel was to win the release of some of the thousands of Palestinians jailed in Israel, many of them accused of violence against Israeli soldiers and civilians. Many Palestinians say such violence is legitimate resistance to Israel’s decades-long occupation of the West Bank and repeated military campaigns in Gaza. And many are also critical of Israel’s justice system, which they say falsely imprisons some Palestinians, including women and children.</p><p>During the last pause in the war in November 2023, Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in exchange for hostages. The majority of the prisoners released had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/01/world/middleeast/palestinian-prisoners-released-gaza.html" title="">not been convicted</a> of a crime, and nearly half were under 18.</p><p>Many Palestinians are prosecuted in Israeli military courts, which try them in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Nearly every Palestinian who is tried in the military courts is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/magazine/israel-west-bank-settler-violence-impunity.html" title="">convicted</a>. But many Palestinian prisoners are never even tried. Instead, Israel detains them indefinitely without charges and based on secret evidence, under what is called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/world/middleeast/palestinian-prisoners-hunger-strikes-israel.html" title="">administrative detention</a>.</p><p>Yahya Sinwar, the former political chief of Hamas, who was an architect of the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war, was intimately familiar with the formulas Israel has accepted in previous exchanges. He had spent years in an Israeli prison but was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/world/middleeast/israel-and-palestinians-begin-prisoner-exchange.html" title="">released in October 2011</a> along with more than 1,000 others as part of an exchange for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid in 2006.</p><p>Upon his release in 2011, Mr. Sinwar pledged “to work hard to free all prisoners, especially those who serve high sentences, whatever the price.” At the time, the lopsided trade raised questions of whether the exchange would encourage more abductions of Israelis.</p><p>Israeli troops killed Mr. Sinwar three months ago in fighting in Gaza.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians overlooking Ofer prison ahead of the prisoners’ release, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Laura Boushnak for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>There were also earlier precedents for uneven trades. In 2003, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/10/world/in-close-vote-israeli-cabinet-backs-trade-of-prisoners.html" title="">exchanged</a> a kidnapped former Israeli colonel and the bodies of three Israeli soldiers killed during a cross-border raid for more than 400 prisoners held in Israel and nearly 60 bodies.</p><p>Almost two decades earlier, in 1985, the Israeli government traded more than 1,100 prisoners — including some convicted of perpetrating or masterminding attacks on Israelis — for three Israeli soldiers captured during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Some of the released prisoners eventually became senior militant leaders.</p><p>During the last cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, a one-week truce in November 2023, Israel released roughly three prisoners — women and minors — for each hostage returned to Israel. Ultimately, Hamas freed about 100 hostages — including more than 20 who were not Israeli and were not included in the deal with Israel — in exchange for about 240 prisoners held by Israel.</p><p>The ratio frustrated some critics in Israel, including some relatives of hostages, while other captives’ family members have demanded that Israel pay any price to bring people back. When Israeli soldiers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/15/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news" title="">accidentally killed three hostages</a> in Gaza who had escaped their captors, Itzik Horn, whose adult sons were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, said Israel must immediately reach a deal to free all the captives, even if it means releasing Palestinians held in Israeli jails on terrorism charges.</p><p>“Let them free all the Palestinian prisoners we have here, all the terrorists — what do I care?” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/16/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news?smid=url-share#israel-hostage-killings-families-hamas" title="">Mr. Horn said more than a year ago</a>. “The most important thing isn’t to defeat Hamas. The only victory here is to bring back all the hostages.” Mr. Horn’s sons are still being held captive.</p><p>The families of hostages are split over this and other issues; a small minority have opposed a deal. The Tikva Forum, an Israeli group representing some captives’ families, opposed the latest cease-fire agreement. In a statement on Wednesday, when news of the deal emerged, the group said <a href="https://x.com/tikvaforumENG/status/1879615196748202032" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> on social media that it objected to an agreement with Hamas, which it called “a terror organization that should be destroyed.”</p><p>“This deal leaves dozens of hostages behind in Gaza,” the group said. “It also sets the stage for the next massacre and future kidnappings of Israelis.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2I4OTlkMTAwLTBhY2EtNWRiZi1iZTVkLWUzNzM1YzQyNGI5MQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#hamas-in-charge-gaza" data-source-id="100000009935913"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon"><img alt="Adam Rasgon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T17:01:19.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 12:01 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of Hamas’s military wing, in Deir al Balah, central Gaza, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bashar Taleb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>As the cease-fire in Gaza was coming into effect on Sunday, masked gunmen, crowded into white pickup trucks, paraded through the streets of Gaza while supporters chanted the name of Hamas’s military wing. By sending its fighters out in an unmistakable show of force, Hamas was trying to deliver an unequivocal message to Palestinians in Gaza, to Israel and to the international community: that despite heavy losses during the war among Hamas’s fighters, police officers, political leaders and government administrators, it remains the dominant Palestinian power in Gaza.</p><p>“The message is that Hamas is ‘the day after’ for the war,” said Ibrahim Madhoun, an analyst close to Hamas based in Turkey, using a phrase that refers to the future administration of Gaza.</p><div><p>“They’re conveying that Hamas must be a part of any future arrangements, or at least, be coordinated with,” he added.</p><p>On Sunday, the Hamas-run government media office announced that thousands of police officers were beginning to deploy throughout the territory to “preserve security and order.” Government ministries and institutions, the media office said, were prepared to start working “according to the government plan to implement all the measures that guarantee bringing back normal life.”</p><p>At the Nasser Medical Complex in the southern city of Khan Younis, at least three uniformed police officers were standing as the Palestinian national anthem played in the background, according to a video posted on social media and verified by The New York Times.</p><p>Later on Sunday, dozens of uniformed, gun-toting Hamas militants were seen in Saraya Square in Gaza City next to a car holding Israeli hostages before they were handed over to the Red Cross. The militants were attempting to push away crowds of people pressing toward the car.</p><p>Even as Hamas attempts to project that it still controls Gaza and plans to play a key role in its administration, its future there remains uncertain. Israeli officials have said they have not given up on their stated war goal of dismantling Hamas’s military wing and government, strongly suggesting that they could resume the war against the militant group after the freeing of some hostages.</p><p>Gideon Saar, the Israeli foreign minister, said on Sunday that Hamas’s rule was dangerous for Israel’s security and emphasized that Israel had not agreed to a permanent cease-fire that leaves Hamas in power.</p><p>“We are determined to achieve the objectives of the war,” he said.</p><p>While some analysts say Israel could eventually remove Hamas from power, others say it would struggle to resume the war in the face of international pressure. And even if it does, those analysts say, Israeli forces will face immense challenges in uprooting Hamas from Gaza without carrying out a direct occupation.</p><p>Ali Jarbawi, a political science professor at Birzeit University, said Hamas’s parades through Gaza on Sunday were more than a message to the international community that it was in control. They also reflect the reality on the ground, he said.</p><p>“Hamas was there before the war and they’re there now,” he said.</p><p>Aritz Parra<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzExYjhlYzIwLTYxOGMtNWEwYi1iYTY4LTQyZWViY2Q2ZGRmZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#israel-hamas-cease-fire-next-steps" data-source-id="100000009934896"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman"><img alt="Aaron Boxerman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T15:56:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 10:56 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced Palestinians walking past rubble in northern Gaza on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Israel and Hamas reached an agreement on an initial six-week truce in part by putting off their most intractable disputes to a nebulous second phase — which neither side is sure they will reach.</p><p>Under the agreement, 16 days into the initial cease-fire, Israeli and Hamas officials are expected to begin negotiating next steps: an end to the war, the release of the remaining living hostages from Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory.</p><div><p>Israeli leaders have long insisted that they will not end the war until Hamas is destroyed. That appeared far from reality on Sunday as Hamas militants, some waving rifles, fanned out in parts of Gaza in pickup trucks, in a show of authority to Palestinians and Israelis alike.</p><p>Israel and Hamas have both preserved some of their bargaining chips. At the end of the 42-day truce, Hamas will still have around two-thirds of the 98 remaining hostages, including dozens who are believed to be dead. And Israel will still occupy parts of Gaza, and hold major prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti, a militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure.</p><p>But as part of the talks, the Israeli government will then probably have to decide whether it is willing to choose one of its war aims, bringing home the hostages, over another, destroying Hamas. And choosing the hostages might threaten Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s grip on power in Israel.</p><p>In the meantime, both sides have agreed to postpone a decisive agreement as to the war’s end and the future of Gaza, and hope the 42-day cease-fire will play to their advantage, said Shlomo Brom, a retired Israeli brigadier general. Hamas, in particular, “hopes that the new dynamic will prevent Israel from returning to fighting,” he said.</p><p>The decision to accept a temporary cease-fire opened deep fissures within Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, which is stacked with hard-liners. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, resigned in protest from the cabinet and withdrew his Jewish Power party from the coalition on Sunday.</p><p>The Religious Zionism party, led by Bezalel Smotrich, threatened to bolt the coalition, too, if Mr. Netanyahu failed to renew the fighting after the end of the 42-day truce. If Mr. Smotrich’s party also left, Mr. Netanyahu’s government would hold fewer than half of the seats in the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, which could cause the government to fall and force new elections.</p><p>On Saturday night, Mr. Netanyahu stressed that the cease-fire was temporary for now. He argued that Israel retained the right to return to the war if “the second stage negotiations are ineffectual,” adding that President-elect Donald J. Trump would support Israel’s decision.</p><p>“We retain the right to return to the war, if necessary, with the backing of the United States,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a televised address.</p><p>The truce’s fragility was underscored on Sunday morning when Hamas did not immediately hand over a list of hostages to be released to Israel, prompting a nearly three-hour delay in the cease-fire. Analysts say the deal will probably see numerous similar tests over the next few weeks as both sides flex their muscles.</p><p>The families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have called on the Israeli government to bring home the remaining captives by fulfilling all the phases of the deal. Noa Argamani, a freed hostage whose boyfriend, Avinatan Or, remains in captivity, said that it broke her heart that he was not going to be freed in this round.</p><p>“The progress in the past few days is a very important step, but the deal must go through in full, completely, in all of its stages,” Ms. Argamani said in a speech in Miami on Thursday.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M1NzAyNWM4LWJiN2EtNTMyYS04ZTM1LWRjY2NhMTk5MjVmYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#hostages-emily-tamari-doron-steinbrecher-romi-gonen" data-source-id="100000009935840"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T11:29:13.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 6:29 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Undated handout photographs from the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters of the freed hostages Romi Gonen, left, Emily Damari, center, and Doron Steinbrecher.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Hostages Families Forum</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Three hostages have been freed in the first phase of the cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel.</p><p>The hostages, all women, were released into Red Cross custody in Gaza on Sunday and were transferred to Israeli forces, who took them to meet their mothers, the Israeli military said.</p><div><p>About 100 hostages, living and dead, are thought still to be held in Gaza, most of them taken in the deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.
