In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the second largest country in Africa, hundreds of people have died annually in recent years as a result of severe rains and flooding.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In 2024, Congo faced its worst flooding <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicef-strengthens-response-drcs-worst-floods-60-years-and-growing-cholera-outbreak" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in six decades</a>, according to Unicef and other United Nations agencies.

He blamed the high death toll on the illegal settlements that dot the city. Kinshasa’s rapid, largely unplanned growth has resulted in widespread construction on vulnerable hillsides, which lack effective drainage systems.</p><p>“We just managed to save our lives,” said Denise Sukali, 45, who has been sheltering in a church since Saturday with her children. “I’m safe with all my family, but my house is under water.”</p><p>Congo, a country of more than 100 million people, is already reeling from one of the most severe humanitarian crises in Africa. A 30-year-old conflict in its eastern regions has reignited since the beginning of the year, killing thousands and displacing nearly seven million people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>One of the biggest humanitarian programs in the world in 2024 was in Congo, where the United States spent $910 million on food, water, sanitation and shelter for displaced people, according to the United Nations’ Bureau for Humanitarian Affairs. After the United States ended most of its foreign assistance to the continent this year, about 7.8 million people stand to lose food aid, and 2.3 million children risk malnutrition.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The flooding on Sunday in Kinshasa, Congo’s capital, has displaced thousands of people.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hardy Bope/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Justin Makangara<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Saikou Jammeh is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Dakar, Senegal.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>11</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>As Rebels Attack in East, Flooding Inundates Congo’s West<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
