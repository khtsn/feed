Perhaps it is time to eat some crow.</p><p>Halloween, steeped in tradition, has transformed from a pagan feast to a celebration with lovingly homemade costumes and treats to one of the largest consumer spending holidays in the United States. Every October — or even earlier — millions of Americans are spending on costumes, decorating their homes and lawns with garish skeletons and spiders and doling out candy bars to little superheroes and witches. But how did this holiday with humble origins become an economic juggernaut with growing global appeal?</p><p>Halloween is a marketer’s dream, said Tom Arnold, a finance professor and retail expert at the University of Richmond. It falls on the same day every year, Halloween items are largely consumable (candy needs to be replenished every year and kids outgrow costumes), and pop culture trends can help predict which costumes will be the must-haves each season.</p><p>Professor Arnold said the 1970s brought mass-manufactured costumes and individually wrapped candy that made the holiday explode in popularity. It also shifted from a more religious holiday to a secular one.</p><p>Even when consumers are worried about their finances, they’ll still open their wallets for holidays like Halloween and Christmas, Professor Arnold said, because “it creates a unique experience at a particular time of the year.”</p><p>“Even during the pandemic, consumers went to great strides to preserve these two holidays,” he said.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Students, </strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/business/halloween-shopping-retail-costume-store-growth.html" title="">read the entire article</a></strong><strong> and then tell us:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Do you love Halloween? Do you look forward to it every fall?</p></li><li><p>The article explains how Americans spend billions of dollars on costumes, decorations and candy. Do you feel that Halloween has become too commercial? Why, or why not?</p></li><li><p>What is your favorite costume that you’ve ever worn? Did you, or someone else, make it? Or did you buy it at a big retail store like Spirit Halloween? Do you think something is lost when so many costumes today are mass-produced? Why, or why not?</p></li><li><p>What did you learn about how Halloween has changed over the years? Did anything surprise you?</p></li><li><p>Lisa Morton, the author of “Trick or Treat: A History of Halloween,” says, “One of the interesting things about Halloween is the way it continually morphs,” adding, “I’m fascinated to see where it’s going to go from here.” What do you think Halloween will look like in the future, when you might have your own kids who go trick-or-treating? Which traditions do you hope will continue, and which, if any, would you like to see change or even go away?</p></li></ul><hr/><p>Students 13 and older in the United States and Britain, and 16 and older elsewhere, are invited to comment.
