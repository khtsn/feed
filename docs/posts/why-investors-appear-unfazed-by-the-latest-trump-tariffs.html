Case in point: Banks have managed to sell off most of the $12.5 billion worth of debt owed by X, his social network, to eager buyers. Investors are essentially betting that the company’s future is brighter because of his role at the heart of government.</em></p><p><em>It’s a different situation from what worries many Musk skeptics — that he will use his vast influence to directly benefit companies like SpaceX. It’s also worth flagging that the scrutiny on Musk may have ended up costing Tesla that </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/business/dealbook/trump-inflation-egg-prices.html" title=""><em>potential State Department contract</em></a><em> we wrote about on Thursday.

Stocks have rallied in China, a major target on his tariffs hit list, while the dollar has fallen.</p><p>This is all playing out just hours after Trump unveiled his long-awaited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/trump-tariffs.html" title="">plan for reciprocal tariffs</a> against all trading partners, which, along with his levies on steel and aluminum imports and still-unresolved threats against Canada and Mexico, could still upend global trade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>What gives?</strong> To the seeming relief of investors, there was little detail in Trump’s latest executive order. And the measures won’t be enacted until early April at the earliest, giving federal agencies time to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-orders-federal-agencies-to-study-reciprocal-tariffs-9ce1475c?mod=hp_lead_pos1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study how to calibrate country-specific levies</a>.</p><p><strong>“Markets had to decide whether the president was being a protectionist or a pushover,</strong> and for now are erring toward pushover,” Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in an investor note on Friday. “The delay is seen as an opportunity to do ‘deals’.”</p><p><strong>Companies and countries are doing exactly that. </strong>French winemakers have been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-13/europe-s-wine-butter-sellers-rush-to-us-to-avoid-trump-tariffs?srnd=homepage-europe&amp;sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ramping up shipments</a> to the United States ahead of any levies. And to get in Trump’s good graces, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/vietnam-says-ready-import-more-us-farm-goods-trade-risks-rise-2025-02-14/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vietnam</a> says it will import more U.S. farm products, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/world/asia/taiwan-tariffs-trump.html" title="">Taiwan</a> and India say they are willing to buy more American oil and liquid natural gas.</p><p>At a news conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump said that he was unable to get India to lower its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-has-enormously-high-tariffs-white-house-economic-adviser-hassett-says-2025-02-10/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high levies on U.S. imports</a>. But now, Trump added, “We’re just going to say ‘Whatever you charge, we charge.’”</p><p>Maros Sefcovic, the E.U. trade commissioner, plans to fly to Washington to speak with Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for commerce secretary, to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ec8a7cf-28c9-44c0-8b8d-9ab390cebcbc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">potentially cut a deal</a>, The Financial Times reports. In the meantime, the trading bloc is readying countermeasures: “We have to respond — it’s better to negotiate from a position of strength,” Sefcovic said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Trump wants to fundamentally rewrite the rules of global trade. </strong>The U.S. typically sets trade terms and tariff levels through international bodies like the World Trade Organization. Instead the president has blown up those norms by pronouncing fresh demands or deadlines on his terms, forcing countries to scramble with a response.</p><p><strong>His administration has taken a broad view of what constitutes a trade barrier.</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/13/us/trump-news/823c8e67-4aec-519d-a7ba-d81fbaa6dc91" title="">Peter Navarro</a>, the president’s senior counselor for trade, called out value added taxes that are widely used in Europe as an “unfair” burden on American companies.</p><p>He has also criticized other governments’ subsidies to homegrown industries, as well as foreign exchange rates that punish the dollar — despite that largely being out of a country’s control.</p><p><strong>Trump may have more in store. </strong>He’s considering additional <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-news-conference.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">levies on automobile imports</a>. And White House officials hinted that Japan, India and the E.U. could be targeted with a future round of tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>But tariffs could be inflationary and that may spook investors.</strong> Some economists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/13/us/trump-news/b7ac3800-7b16-5beb-8dfc-29cafc5f96d7?smid=url-share" title="">predict</a> that the measures could add roughly 2 percent to consumer prices. Trump himself <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/13/us/trump-news/7f1b1d14-59db-5d36-a69b-46139fd7428e?smid=url-share" title="">conceded</a> that tariffs could force prices to “go up somewhat short term.”</p><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>The acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan resigns over the Eric Adams case.</strong> The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/danielle-sassoon-quit-eric-adams.html" title="">move by Danielle Sassoon</a> ended days of uncertainty about whether she would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/emil-bove-doj-trump.html" title="">follow orders from the Justice Department</a> to drop corruption charges against New York City’s mayor. (Five officials in the department’s public integrity section in Washington later resigned.) Sassoon’s opposition to the orders from Washington raise questions about how independent Jay Clayton, President Trump’s pick to lead the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office, would be.</p><p><strong>TikTok returns to the Apple and Google app stores.</strong> The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/technology/tiktok-apple-google-app-stores.html" title="">reappearance of the video app</a> came after the Justice Department assured the tech giants that they would not face fines for doing so, despite a law banning the Chinese-owned platform in the United States, The Times reports. It’s still unclear whether TikTok will be sold to a U.S. entity, as Trump wants; many legal experts also say the administration’s refusal to uphold the law is unconstitutional.</p><p><strong>Beijing reportedly invites DeepSeek’s chief to a high-level meeting of tech leaders.</strong> Liang Wenfeng is set to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/xi-to-meet-with-business-leaders-such-as-jack-ma-reuters-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">join President Xi Jinping</a>, the Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma and others for a symposium as soon as next week, according to Bloomberg.

Just two months ago, investors were negotiating to buy the debt at a loss of 10 to 20 percent for the banks, one person involved in the discussions said.</p><p>The latest sale represents the third round of X debt that banks have offloaded in the past few weeks after selling around $6.5 billion in the first two rounds. Creditors still hold about $1.3 billion, which could eventually be sold.</p><p><strong>Why are investors buying now?</strong> They’re betting on X’s improved business — but also on Musk himself. The billionaire has become one of the most powerful people in Washington with direct access to President Trump and billion-dollar government contracts for his SpaceX rocket company.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Questions still swirl around whether his companies could benefit from his newfound power.</p><p><strong>X’s revenue increased by 40 percent last year after </strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/business/x-elon-musk-advertisers.html" title="">a dismal 2023</a></strong>, according to the person familiar with the company’s finances. More subscribers are now paying for X’s premium service, and the platform gets additional revenue from xAI, Mr. Musk’s artificial intelligence venture, which pays X to license its data, according to the people familiar with X’s business. That increase in revenue comes on the back of extensive cost-cutting by Musk, including an 80 percent reduction in staff.</p><p>Last month, Musk told employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/technology/musk-doge-x-playbook.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20user%20growth%20is%20stagnant,more%20innovative%20and%20relentlessly%20focused.%E2%80%9D" title="">in an email</a> that user growth had stagnated and “we’re barely breaking even.” He added: “We need to be faster, more innovative and relentlessly focused.”</p><p>It may have worked. “More business seems to be coming in than it has in the last 2 years,” Brett Weitz, X’s head of content, wrote in an internal email in late January, which was seen by The Times.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-48e3d440">“You think there’s going to be consensus with a gun to our head?

She added, “Donald Trump was onto a real problem when he criticized Bank of America for its debanking practices.”</p><p><strong>But there’s a split in diagnoses of the problem. </strong>Bank C.E.O.s are blaming what they say is a thicket of regulations. Asked if banking rules were to blame, Dimon said on Thursday, “Pretty much, yeah,” pointing specifically to anti-money-laundering and financial crime reporting requirements:</p><blockquote><p>The AML/Fincen rules are extraordinary, and it does cause a lot of people to be pushed out of the system because banks were afraid of being sued, fined, because if after the fact something goes wrong — coulda, woulda, shoulda — you could pay a billion dollars.</p></blockquote><p>Senator Warren argued last week, however, that banks were taking shortcuts to comply with regulations, and that agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had a role to play.
