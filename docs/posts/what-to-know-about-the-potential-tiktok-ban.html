    <h1>What to Know About the Potential TikTok Ban</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TikTok faces a U.S. ban as soon as Sunday, a move that could have sweeping consequences for the social media landscape, popular culture, and millions of influencers and small businesses that rely on the platform to earn a living.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know.</p><h2 id="link-6c746b5d">Why is TikTok facing a ban?</h2><p>U.S. officials have long been concerned that the Chinese government could manipulate content or gain access to sensitive user data through TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. Those fears prompted Congress to pass legislation that would ban the social media platform unless it was sold to a government-approved buyer within 270 days.</p><h2 id="link-6b842eab">Who is responsible for the law?</h2><p>The concerns about TikTok have been bipartisan. The law was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/technology/tiktok-ban-congress.html" title="">crafted in secret</a> by a small group of lawmakers and congressional staff members last year. The Biden administration helped them write the legislation and sent national security officials to brief lawmakers about the threat from TikTok. The House overwhelmingly approved the bill, and it passed the Senate as part of a package that included aid for Ukraine and Israel. President Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/technology/bytedance-tiktok-ban-bill.html" title="">signed it</a> into law in April.</p><h2 id="link-637e7577">What happens next?</h2><p>The law doesn’t ban TikTok directly if ByteDance is unable or unwilling to sell the app. Instead, it says that app stores, like those operated by Apple and Google, and cloud providers like Oracle cannot distribute the app.</p></div></div>
