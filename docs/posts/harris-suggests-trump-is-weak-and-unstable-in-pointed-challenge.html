And he’s not — But here’s the thing, North Carolina — and he’s not being transparent with the voters. He’s not being transparent. So check this out. He refuses to release his medical records. I’ve done it. Every other presidential camp — every other presidential candidate in modern era has done it. He is unwilling to do a “60 Minutes” interview, like every other major-party candidate has done for more than half a century. He is unwilling to meet for a second debate. And here’s the thing. Here’s the thing. It makes you wonder. It makes you wonder why does his staff want him to hide away? One must question. One must question. Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable? To lead America.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/13/multimedia/13election-live-harris-nc-top-2-hlwz/13election-live-harris-nc-top-2-hlwz-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The vice president criticized former President Donald J.

Trump on Sunday for refusing to do what she has done in recent days: release a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/harris-medical-records-trump.html" title="">report</a> on his health, sit for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview-takeaways.html" title="">“60 Minutes” interview</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/us/politics/harris-trump-cnn-debate-october.html" title="">commit</a> to another presidential debate.</p><p>“It makes you wonder: Why does his staff want him to hide away?” Ms. Harris asked the crowd at a rally in a packed college basketball arena in Greenville, N.C. “One must question: Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America?”</p><p>Her line of attack marked an attempt to turn the tables on Mr. Trump, who for months had suggested that President Biden was too old to be president and accused him of hiding from the American people. And it underscored her efforts to present herself as the candidate of change and Mr. Trump as a relic of the past, as she forms a closing message in the final weeks of her campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“From him, we are just hearing from that same, old tired playbook,” she said. “He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people.

Early voting begins on Thursday in North Carolina. “The election is here,” she said.</p><p>It was also meant to mobilize Black voters, a critical Democratic constituency whose support for Ms. Harris is drifting compared to 2020, polls have found. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/poll-black-voters-harris-trump.html" title="">survey of Black likely voters from The New York Times/Siena College</a> found that roughly eight in 10 Black voters plan to vote for Ms. Harris — an overwhelming majority, but more than 10 points short of the support Mr. Biden had four years ago. The softening of support was especially pronounced among Black men — 70 percent of whom said they planned to support her.</p><p>Roughly four in 10 residents of Greenville are Black, and the city is surrounded by rural communities with significant Black populations that often say they are ignored by national campaigns. A Democratic presidential candidate has not won North Carolina since Barack Obama in 2008. A Times polling average shows Ms. Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president-north-carolina.html" title="">within one point</a> of Mr. Trump in the state, which he almost certainly must win to reclaim the White House.</p><p>The Trump campaign did not immediately respond on Sunday to a request for comment about Ms. Harris’s remarks. Mr. Trump, speaking at a rally in Prescott Valley, Ariz., on Sunday, cast himself as an indefatigable campaigner, who can give multiple long speeches each day and keep up with the rigors of political travel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Who the hell can do this two, three times a day?” Mr. Trump said. “So I speak for hours, mostly without a Teleprompter.” And he mocked reporters for seizing on any mispronunciation of a word to claim “he’s cognitively impaired” or “he’s getting old.”</p><p>After avoiding the media during the initial rollout of her truncated campaign, the vice president has embarked on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-interviews-the-view-stern-stephen-colbert.html" title="">blitz of interviews</a> recently, both with mainstream journalists and on nontraditional settings like podcasts. She appeared on a “60 Minutes” special last Monday; CBS said that Mr. Trump had agreed to be interviewed on the program as well, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/business/media/trump-cbs-60-minutes.html" title="">but then backed out.</a></p><p>Ms. Harris also released a letter from her doctor on Saturday declaring that she was in “excellent health” and possessed the “physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.”</p><p>Ms. Harris’s allies say the final three weeks of the campaign will focus on engaging the Black voters who have not yet committed to casting their ballots for her. Through town hall-style events, get-out-the-vote efforts geared toward Black men and the use of campaign surrogates, Democrats hope to consolidate their base of Black voters around the party once more.</p><p>They also plan to ramp up efforts to counter what they see as misinformation about Ms. Harris’s record on criminal justice, and they are holding events at historically Black colleges and universities to engage Black voters during their season of homecoming celebrations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Tuesday, Ms. Harris will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/harris-breakfast-club-charlamagne-tha-god.html" title="">sit for an interview</a> in Detroit with Charlamagne Tha God, one of the nation’s most popular Black radio hosts, on his nationally syndicated show.</p><p>“The job of any great candidate in their campaign is to, number one, listen, and I think the Harris campaign has been listening and is addressing that concern pretty aggressively,” said Quentin James, the co-founder and CEO of the Collective PAC, an organization that supports Black political candidates.</p><p>Last week, the Harris campaign unleashed one of its biggest weapons: Mr. Obama, the nation’s first Black president. At a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Mr. Obama suggested that, although some voters cite the economy or immigration for their skepticism of Ms. Harris, he suspected another factor was playing a role.</p><p>“Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,” Mr. Obama said, in blunt comments that represented a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/obama-harris-trump-speech.html" title="">remarkable, if calculated, risk</a> to win support with the election close at hand.</p><p>Jeffrey McIlwain, 59, who attended the Greenville rally on Sunday, said he had come to a similar conclusion after talking with some of his male friends and family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I think they have a problem with a woman in the White House,” said Mr. McIlwain, a retired bonds trader and banker who lives in Durham.</p><p>But polls also suggest a broader anxiety among some Black voters that Democrats have not made life measurably better for them, even though they back the party in overwhelming numbers. Forty percent of African American voters under 30 said the Republican Party was more likely to follow through on its campaign commitments than Democrats were.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vice President Kamala Harris attended services at Koinonia Christian Center, a predominantly Black church in Greenville, N.C., on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Harris’s weekend visit to North Carolina also included local outreach efforts as the state recovers from the devastation of Hurricane Helene last month.
