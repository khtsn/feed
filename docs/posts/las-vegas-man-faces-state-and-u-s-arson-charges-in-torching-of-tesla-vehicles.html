And in Colorado, federal prosecutors have accused a man of spray-painting the word “Nazi” on a Tesla dealership and of planting an incendiary device there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Last week, Mr. Musk described the attack on the Tesla repair center in Las Vegas as “<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1902038907392262633" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">terrorism</a>,” echoing Attorney General Pam Bondi’s calling the destruction of Tesla property “nothing short of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/tesla-vandalism-domestic-terrorism.html" title="">domestic terrorism</a>.” She has promised “severe consequences” for anyone who targets the company.</p><p>Mr. Kim, who was arrested on Wednesday, faces 15 state charges in Clark County Justice Court, including three counts of arson, four counts of destroying property worth more than $5,000 and three counts of unlawful possession of an incendiary device.</p><p>He was also charged separately in federal court with one count of arson and one count of possession of an unregistered firearm.</p><p>It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer.</p><p>Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Las Vegas office, said at a news conference on Thursday that the arrest should send a message. “There’s nothing courageous or noble about firebombing private property and terrorizing your local community,” Mr. Evans said.</p><p>President Trump has suggested that those convicted of damaging or destroying Tesla vehicles — including U.S. citizens — could be sent to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/world/americas/el-salvador-prisons-bukele-migrants.html" title="">prisons in El Salvador</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Las Vegas police said that investigators had linked Mr. Kim to the arson through surveillance video of the Hyundai that he drove to and from the Tesla repair center. After he was arrested, a DNA sample taken from his cheek matched DNA retrieved from the crime scene, the police said.</p><p>The police said they had also searched Mr. Kim’s apartment and had found several rifles, a shotgun and a handgun, as well as ammunition of the same caliber that was fired at the Tesla vehicles. Investigators also seized a gun belt and a backpack with pink paint residue, linking him to the spray paint used at the crime scene, the police said.</p><p>Investigators believe that Mr. Kim acted alone, the police said.</p><p>An intelligence bulletin from the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security dated March 21 and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/tesla-protests-vandalism-musk.html" title="">obtained by The New York Times</a> said recent attacks on Tesla vehicles and facilities “appear to have been conducted by lone offenders, and all known incidents occurred at night, making identification and arrest of the actors difficult.”</p><p>The bulletin encouraged law enforcement agencies to aggressively pursue those who have defaced or destroyed Tesla property.</p><p>But the bulletin also said that law enforcement agents should not investigate “constitutionally protected activity” directed at Mr. Musk. The warning came as Tesla dealerships have drawn protests in recent weeks. Some Tesla owners have also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/tesla-boycott-elon-musk.html" title="">sold their vehicles</a> to distance themselves from the polarizing billionaire.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Rise of Electric Vehicles</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tesla Wins California Permit:</strong> State regulators granted Tesla a permit to operate a ride service, an early step toward the carmaker’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/business/tesla-ride-service-california-permit.html">ambitions of having its own robot taxi fleet</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>An All-Electric Mercedes Sedan:</strong> Mercedes-Benz’s latest version of its most affordable sedan, the CLA, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/mercedes-cla-electric-vehicle.html">will be available first as an all-electric car</a> and then as a hybrid.
