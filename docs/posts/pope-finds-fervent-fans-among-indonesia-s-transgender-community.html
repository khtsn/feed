They wore feathers, silk, glitter and long eyelashes. Every one of them draped a rosary around their neck.</p><p>“Pope Francis deserves our best outfit,” Elvi Gondhoadjmodjo said, as the group got ready to catch a glimpse of the pope on Thursday during his visit to Indonesia.</p><p>For many trans women living on the fringes of society here, the Catholic Church is a safe haven, and Pope Francis, with his messages of tolerance and openness toward the L.G.B.T.Q. community, has become a personal hero. They were excited by his four-day visit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“When we got Francis as the Pope, I realized that God was really listening,” said Mami Yuli, the leader of the community and a devout Catholic who has a likeness of a rosary tattooed on her chest. “This is not the Pope but God himself visiting us.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“This is not the Pope but God himself visiting us,” said Mami Yuli, a leader of the trans community in Jakarta  and a devout Catholic.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ulet Ifansasti for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At the shelter where many of them live, the group of 10 trans women squeezed into two rental cars and drove to the Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta, where the pope was going to hold a Mass later on Thursday. They did not have tickets to enter but hoped they could at least get a glimpse of the pope outside.</p><p>Their excitement, and the yearslong closeness between the trans community and the Catholic Church in Jakarta, is a stark contrast with less-favorable attitudes from the Church in other countries, and with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904012754/http://www.obispadodecadizyceuta.org/noticia/comunicado-obispo-cadiz-ceuta" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">positions some church officials have expressed</a>. But it also showed how Francis’s message of tolerance has echoed in some corners of the Catholic world thousand of miles away from the Vatican.</p><p>“Pope Francis has called for us several times not to judge them,” said the Rev. Agustinus Kelik Pribadi the priest of the Saint Stephen Catholic Church in South Jakarta. He was referring to pope’s famous <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/30/world/europe/pope-francis-gay-priests.html" title="">“who am I to judge?” question</a> about gay priests, which many felt reflected his general attitude toward the L.G.B.T.Q. community. “We must listen.”</p><p>Catholics make up a very small minority in Muslim-predominant Indonesia. Still, dozens of trans women who were not born into the Church were baptized in Jakarta in recent years. They came from nearly every corner of the country, said the Rev. Adrianus Suyadi, a Jesuit priest at Jakarta’s Cathedral.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The ties between the Church and the Jakarta trans women community are a result of the work of the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, the priests said. The cardinal instructed priests to welcome transgender people into their parishes as part of a push to respect human dignity. Mami Yuli, the leader of the trans community, also lobbied the church.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A shrine in the shelter in South Jakarta.

Many are still homeless and others do sex work to survive, community members said.</p><p>Once a month, more than 50 trans women attend a prayer meeting at the Cathedral, Father Suyadi said. Many frequent cooking classes organized by the church and two have become instructors. .</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“When I go to the church nobody judges me,” said Ms. Gondhoadjmodjo, 40, who got baptized in 2022, and said that she has started volunteering as a teacher thanks to the Church. “That makes me more sure I want to be a Catholic.”</p><p>Mika Horulean, 26, another trans woman, attends Catholic trans-counseling meetings, in which they discuss their experiences, on Zoom every Friday. “Romo is amazing,” she said, addressing Father Suyadi with a word that means father in Javanese.</p><p>Church teachings oppose gender transition, but Francis has long urged clerics to welcome L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics into the Church. He <a href="https://www.newwaysministry.org/2023/11/22/pope-francis-hosts-transgender-women-for-vatican-luncheon/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hosted a group of transgender women</a> at the Vatican for lunch. He a<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/world/europe/pope-francis-transgender-people.html" title="">pproved a Vatican document that made clear</a> that transgender people can be baptized and declared laws that criminalize being gay to be “unjust.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Playing volleyball, with some teammates in hijabs, in Jakarta on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ulet Ifansasti for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>But Francis has also walked a tightrope between his personal urging for more openness by the Church and upholding church doctrine. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Recently the Vatican issued a document approved by Francis stating that the church believes that transition surgery is an affront to human dignity. The pope also recently used a slur word to refer to gay people, an episode that highlighted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/world/europe/pope-slur-church-lgbtq.html" title="">Church’s complicated relationship with gender and sexuality</a>.</p><p>Even so, South Jakarta’s transgender community has focused instead on Francis’ positive messaging and openness.</p><p>“For us, L.G.B.T. people in Indonesia, there is never someone as high profile who sends a message of inclusiveness,” Mami Yuli said.</p><p>“He is much braver than the other popes before him,” she said, as she stood by her small shrine in the shelter, with a statuette of Mary and a picture of Jesus. “His message is a message of love and to pay attention to the little people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Community members getting ready before going to the stadium on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ulet Ifansasti for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Some resistance remains among Catholic bishops in Indonesia. Father Suyadi said his proposal to the local bishops conference to let Mami Yuli meet the pope was rebuffed.</p><p>Bunda Mayora, 37, a trans woman in Maumere, a city in Flores, in the East<span>  </span>of Indonesia, is also involved with the local Church. She was watching on live TV as the Pope met with Indonesian bishops on Thursday.</p><p>She was disappointed because L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics had not been invited to the Mass led by the pope.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The trans women posing with a priest front of the stadium on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ulet Ifansasti for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The disappointment extended to the stadium on Thursday. A few hours after the group of trans women rallied in front of the stadium, policemen prevented them from standing at the stadium’s entrance with their banner of Francis and colorful clothes. The group headed home even before the pope arrived.</p><p>“They cannot receive us here,” said Devine Selviana Siahaan, one of the trans women who was at the stadium. “But<strong> </strong>I still can talk to Francis in my dreams.”</p><p>Muktita Suhartono<!-- --> and <!-- -->Sui-Lee Wee<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ulet Ifansasti<!-- --> contributed reporting from Jakarta.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
