Kathy Hochul, who has the authority to remove Mayor Adams from office, said she had called a meeting for Tuesday to discuss “the path forward.” In a statement, she acknowledged that the four officials’ resignations raised “serious questions about the long-term future of this mayoral administration.</p><p>“In the 235 years of New York State history, these powers have never been utilized to remove a duly-elected mayor; overturning the will of the voters is a serious step that should not be taken lightly,” she said. “That said, the alleged conduct at City Hall that has been reported over the past two weeks is troubling and cannot be ignored.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Increasingly, the deputy mayors felt that they were not merely working for an indicted mayor, but for someone whose personal interests risked outweighing the interests of New Yorkers, according to a person briefed on the matter. They found this untenable, the person said.</p><p>Three of the deputies told their staff members of their decisions in emails on Monday. They are expected to leave in coming weeks.</p><p>Mr. Adams, a Democrat, is forcefully resisting growing calls to resign, and the governor is under increasing pressure to remove him from office. </p><p>The four officials who are leaving office are all respected government veterans. Ms. Torres-Springer was elevated to the second most powerful job at City Hall in October in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/nyregion/eric-adams-administration.html" title="">effort to stabilize city government</a> and restore confidence in the Adams administration following the mayor’s federal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html" title="">indictment</a> in September on five counts, including bribery and fraud.</p><p>The departing deputy mayors met with Mr. Adams on Friday and told him that they had grave concerns about his predicament as a leader, according to two city officials. At that meeting, they told him they were planning to resign, one of the officials said. The meeting was first reported by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/16/eric-adams-deputy-mayors-express-grave-concerns-over-his-recent-predicaments-00204576" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Politico</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Sunday evening, the four deputy mayors met with Mr. Adams on Zoom, and he tried to persuade them to postpone the announcement of the resignations, one of the city officials said. The exact timing of the their departures has yet to be determined. The Sunday Zoom was <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/new-york-city/nyc-deputy-mayors-adams-administration-express-resignation-intent/6152782/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported by WNBC</a>.</p><p>“I am disappointed to see them go, but given the current challenges, I understand their decision and wish them nothing but success in the future,” said Mr. Adams, in a statement issued after<span>  </span>news of the resignations emerged. “But let me be crystal clear: New York City will keep moving forward, just as it does every day. All deputy mayors will remain in their roles for the time being to ensure a seamless transition. The people of New York City remain, without question, our top priority.”</p><p>On Monday, Ms. Joshi and Ms. Torres-Springer sent emails to their staff in which they announced that they and Ms. Williams-Isom were departing and shared a joint statement from all three.</p><p>“Due to the extraordinary events of the last few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from our roles,” they said in the statement, which was obtained by The New York Times.</p><p>“While our time in this administration will come to a close, our support for the incredible public servants across the administration with whom we have stood shoulder to shoulder and our championing of this great city and all it stands for will never cease,” the email said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The departure of the fourth official, Mr. Parker, is particularly notable because as the deputy mayor for public safety, he has been deeply involved in issues around the city’s role in the president’s deportation plans.</p><p>The planned exit of the four key officials means that half of New York City’s eight deputy mayors are leaving City Hall. It remains unclear who will replace them and if this will precipitate further departures from the commissioners who report to them.</p><p>“As we always say, if and when we have personnel announcements to make, we will make them,” said Kayla Mamelak Altus, a spokeswoman for the mayor.</p><p>The officials’ expected departure would cap five months of instability in an administration that at times has veered toward chaos. First the mayor was indicted on federal bribery and fraud charges, and then a deluge of other unrelated federal corruption investigations swept through City Hall.</p><p>Those inquiries led to the resignations of half a dozen of his most senior aides who had their phones seized by federal authorities: two successive police commissioners within three months of one another; his prior first deputy mayor and deputy mayor for public safety; his schools chancellor and a senior adviser who was one of his closest confidants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p> Then, in December, the mayor’s top adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, resigned shortly before the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/nyregion/ingrid-lewis-martin-corruption-charges.html" title="">obtained an indictment</a> charging her and her son with bribery and other crimes.</p><p>Ms. Torres-Springer, Ms. Joshi, Ms. Williams-Isom and Mr. Parker were understood to act as a counterweight to the perception that the mayor’s loyalists were running amok at City Hall.</p><p>Once Mr. Trump’s administration moved to dismiss the charges against the mayor, the presence of the four deputy mayors was viewed by people in and around city government as a bulwark against the president&#39;s influence at City Hall. Now it remains unclear who is left to serve in that role.</p><p>The president first entered the picture in the fall, when Mr. Adams publicly sidled up to him — both rhetorically and actually. The mayor met the president at a political gala in Manhattan and at a prize fight at Madison Square Garden. In the weeks preceding the November election, the mayor declined to name Kamala Harris as his choice for president, despite having endorsed her. He also chided his party colleagues for describing Mr. Trump as a fascist.</p><p>After the election, Mr. Adams traveled to Palm Beach, Fla., in January to lunch with Mr. Trump, and then traveled to Washington, D.C., to sit in the overflow room at Mr. Trump’s inauguration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Adams’s lawyers promptly sought a pardon from Mr. Trump once he took office. The pardon was not forthcoming.</p><p>But in February, just weeks after federal prosecutors in Manhattan said they had uncovered “additional criminal conduct” by the mayor, one of Mr. Trump’s top deputies at the Justice Department directed them to ask the judge presiding over the mayor’s case to dismiss his indictment.</p><p>The respected prosecutor whom Mr. Trump had appointed as U.S. attorney to oversee the office on an interim basis, Danielle R. Sassoon, chose to resign instead, after writing an explosive letter detailing what she characterized as an inappropriate backroom deal that prioritized politics over the interests of justice. She also wrote that the office had been planning to charge the mayor with obstruction of justice in a new indictment.</p><p>The mayor’s “advocacy should be called out for what it is: an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case,” Ms. Sassoon said.</p><p>The lead prosecutor in the case against Mr. Adams, Hagan Scotten, also resigned, issuing a blistering resignation letter suggesting only a “fool” or a “coward” would obey the Trump administration’s edict to seek the dismissal of the case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Then, five other Justice Department lawyers in Washington who either oversaw or prosecuted public corruption cases also stepped down rather than sign the court papers at the direction of the acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove III.</p><p>The episode “raises serious questions involving both the potential <em>quid pro quo</em> and prosecutorial weaponization of our justice system,” said the New York City Bar Association, <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/press-releases/new-york-city-bar-association-statement-on-united-states-v-eric-adams/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement issued Monday</a>.</p><p>Jeffery C.
