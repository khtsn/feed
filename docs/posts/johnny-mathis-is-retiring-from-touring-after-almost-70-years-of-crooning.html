Wonderful!” Mr. Mathis has been singing standards and soft rock since his teenage years, but he started touring professionally after his <a href="https://johnnymathis.com/wp2/index.php/project/johnny-mathis-1956/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">debut album</a> was released in 1956.</p><p>Mr. Mathis, 89, will pick up the microphone for shows in April and May, but his concerts scheduled for the summer and fall have been canceled.</p><p>“It’s with sincere regret that due to Mr. Mathis’s age and memory issues which have accelerated, we are announcing his retirement from touring and live concerts,” a statement <a href="https://johnnymathis.com/wp2/index.php/news-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on his website said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Mathis’s <a href="https://www.bergenpac.org/events/detail/johnny-mathis-the-voice-of-romance-tour" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">final concert</a> is scheduled for May 18 at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in Englewood, N.J. The other concerts are April 10 in Shippensburg, Pa.; April 26 in Shipshewana, Ind.; and May 10 in Santa Rosa, Calif.</p><p>Some tickets remain available for his final concerts, his website noted, and refunds will be issued for the ones that were canceled.</p><p>Mr. Mathis grew up in San Francisco, where in 1955 he got a job singing on the weekends at a club. Its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/arts/a-timeless-reminder-of-back-seats-in-57-buicks.html" title="">owner</a> eventually persuaded George Avakian, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/obituaries/george-avakian-dead-record-producer-and-talent-scout.html" title="">record producer and talent scout</a> with Columbia Records, to see him.</p><p>After he listened to Mr. Mathis sing, Mr. Avakian sent a telegram to Columbia that read, “Have found phenomenal 19 year old boy who could go all the way. Send blank contracts.”</p><p>Mr. Mathis is widely recognized as a pioneer of the romantic ballad style that emerged in the 1950s as a pop-music alternative to high-energy rock ’n’ roll. Mr. Mathis would go on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/03/archives/pop-mainstream-johnny-mathis.html" title="">to make</a> more top-selling albums than any other modern pop performer except Frank Sinatra, by the end of the 1970s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Forty years ago this month, the critic Stephen Holden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/17/arts/music-noted-in-brief-johnny-mathis-and-dionne-warwick.html" title="">wrote in The New York Times</a> that “Johnny Mathis is still the most compelling exponent of a time-honored crooning tradition carried forward in recent years by the Bee Gees, George Benson, Al Jarreau and Julio Iglesias.”</p><p>Mr. Holden noted in his review of a concert at Radio City Music Hall in New York that while Mr. Mathis’s “ethereal, androgynous tenor, with its built-in sob and breathy hesitations, has darkened perceptibly, it communicates the same aura of adolescent longing that it did in 1957.”</p><p>In 2003, Mr. Mathis received the Grammys’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/24/arts/newcomer-has-a-big-night-at-grammy-awards-ceremony.html" title="">lifetime achievement award</a>.</p><p>At his peak, he was booking some 200 concert dates a year.</p><p>“The road is my home,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/arts/a-timeless-reminder-of-back-seats-in-57-buicks.html" title="">once said</a>. “I carry my best friends with me. We work together, play together. I have no other life.”</p><p>But midway through his career, Mr. Mathis admitted that he was uncomfortable onstage. “I hate it,” he said. “But it’s something I’ll have to do all my life. I don’t know how to do anything else.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“There are moments when the emotion comes out and I get absolutely carried away, and I know that this is right, this is wonderful.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adeel Hassan is a reporter and editor on the National Desk.
