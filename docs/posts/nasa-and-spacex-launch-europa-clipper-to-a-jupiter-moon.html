At launch, it weighed about 12,500 pounds — nearly half of that is propellant. When unfurled a few hours after launch, its solar panels will span more than 100 feet — a bit longer than a basketball court.</p><p>The spacecraft is carrying a suite of nine scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, a magnetometer and radar. Researchers on Earth will use that tool kit to study the moon’s surface and interior in more detail than earlier missions to Jupiter could.</p><p>After a journey of five and a half years and 1.8 billion miles, Europa Clipper will enter orbit around Jupiter on April 11, 2030. It will then make 49 flybys of Europa over four years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Jupiter moon Europa captured by the Juno spacecraft during a flyby in 2022.

Its surface is bright and smooth, covered with ice with few craters. The smoothness suggested the possibility of an ocean below, that water periodically broke through the ice, spilled onto the surface and froze, filling in the geological scars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Measurements of Europa’s magnetic field by NASA’s Galileo spacecraft a couple of decades ago provided even more compelling evidence. The easiest and best explanation for that field is a salty ocean.</p><p>Indeed, planetary scientists now think Europa could have twice as much water as all of Earth’s oceans combined.</p><p>With water there, the next question is: Could something alive be swimming in the water?</p><p>The other essential ingredients of life are thought to be energy and carbon-based molecules. Europa Clipper’s mission is to look for signs of those.</p><p>“I think Europa is certainly the most likely place for life beyond Earth in our solar system,” said Robert Pappalardo, the project scientist for Europa Clipper. “And that’s because it is the most likely to have the ingredients for life in abundance and for there to be enough time for life to get going.”</p><h2 id="link-5d782c8a">How will the spacecraft study Europa?</h2><p>Using the spacecraft’s nine instruments, scientists expect to measure the depth of Europa’s ocean, identify some of the compounds at its icy surface and precisely map the magnetic field, which will give additional clues about what lies within.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A thermal imager will look for warm spots, which could indicate places where the ice is thinner and the ocean is closer to the surface.</p><p>That instrument, along with the radar, could spot lakes embedded within the ice and cryovolcanoes that erupt water, not molten rock. The Hubble Space Telescope has spotted what could be plumes of water vapor sporadically erupting from Europa’s surface.</p><p>During flybys of the moon, a tube-shaped instrument about the size of a baguette will scoop up and identify molecules from the thin atmosphere, including carbon-based molecules that could serve as the building blocks for life. With luck, Europa Clipper could fly through one of the erupting plumes, which could be material from the under-ice ocean.</p><p>Another instrument, an ultraviolet spectrometer, could also identify molecules within a plume when a distant star passes behind Europa. Stars are expected to be eclipsed by Europa in this way about 100 times during the mission. Looking at how the colors of ultraviolet light from the star dim will tell scientists the density of the gases and what they are made of.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
