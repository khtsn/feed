    <h1>Netanyahu Says Fighting in Gaza Will Resume if Hostages Are Not Freed Saturday</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Originally, three hostages were set to be freed on Saturday under the first phase of the cease-fire.</p><p>In a video posted after a four-hour meeting with his security cabinet, Mr. Netanyahu said that he and his top advisers had been shocked by the emaciated appearances of three Israeli men who were freed last Saturday, in the latest hostage-for-prisoner exchange required under the cease-fire deal.</p><p>“The decision I passed in the cabinet, unanimously, is this: If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the cease-fire will end, and the I.D.F. will resume intense fighting until Hamas is decisively defeated,” Mr. Netanyahu said in the video, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu also reiterated his order issued on Monday night to reinforce troops in and around Gaza but did not specifically say they were planning to recapture territory from which Israel had recently withdrawn. “This operation is currently underway,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “It will be completed as soon as possible.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/world/middleeast/hamas-hostages-israel-ceasefire.html" title="">In its threat on Monday</a> to delay the next round of hostages to be released, Hamas had accused Israel of violating parts of the cease-fire. It followed widespread anger among Arab states in the Middle East and even some American allies in Europe over a proposal by President Trump to relocate about two million Palestinians in Gaza and rebuild the war-torn territory into the “Riviera of the Middle East” without allowing its former residents to return. The forced deportation of a civilian population is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-takeover-illegal.html" title="">war crime</a> under international law.</p></div></div>
