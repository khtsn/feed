While the threat was clear, Mr. Netanyahu did not specify how many hostages would have to be freed to stop a renewed war.</p><p>The prime minister’s office, when asked for clarity, declined to confirm how many hostages Mr. Netanyahu was referring to.</p><p>His statements closely echoed President Trump’s ultimatum on Monday evening to Hamas that said if all remaining Israeli hostages were not released from Gaza by 12 o’clock on Saturday, then the cease-fire agreement with Israel should be canceled and “all hell is going to break out.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Originally, three Israelis were to be freed this week in the latest hostage-for-prisoner exchange as required by the cease-fire deal to end the war that began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Most of the exchanges so far have taken place on Saturdays.</p><p>So far, 16 of 33 Israeli hostages who were set to be released in the first phase of this cease-fire have been freed. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-deal.html" title="">About 60 other hostages</a>, some of whom are believed to be dead, were to be released later this spring under a second phase of the deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hamas handed over, from left, Ohad Ben-Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy to the Red Cross on Saturday as part of the cease-fire deal.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a video posted after a four-hour meeting with his security cabinet, Mr. Netanyahu said that he and his top advisers had been shocked by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-prisoners.html" title="">the emaciated appearances</a> of three Israeli men who were freed last Saturday.</p><p>“The decision I passed in the cabinet, unanimously, is this: If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the cease-fire will end, and the I.D.F. will resume intense fighting until Hamas is decisively defeated,” Mr. Netanyahu said in the video, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu also reiterated his order issued on Monday night to reinforce troops in and around Gaza but did not specifically say they were planning to recapture territory from which Israel had recently withdrawn.</p><p>“This operation is currently underway,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “It will be completed as soon as possible.”</p><p>In a statement Tuesday evening, the Israeli military said it was mobilizing reservists among the troops that would be part of the operation.</p><p>Hamas did not immediately respond to Mr. Netanyahu’s statements.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/world/middleeast/hamas-hostages-israel-ceasefire.html" title="">In its threat on Monday</a> to delay the next round of hostages to be released, the armed Palestinian group accused Israel of violating parts of the cease-fire agreement, including by slowing sufficient humanitarian aid in and around Gaza. Israel has denied the claim.</p><p>After Hamas’s 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 others abducted to Gaza, Israel had bombarded the territory, aiming to decimate the militants. At least 48,000 Palestinians have been killed during the fighting, according to Gazan health officials, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Millions of Palestinians have also been displaced in the enclave, and many are returning to neighborhoods in ruins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Hamas was infuriated by Mr. Trump’s proposal — which he announced with Mr. Netanyahu at the White House last week and then repeated several times — to relocate about two million Palestinians out of Gaza and rebuild the war-torn territory to turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East.” Mr. Trump also said its former residents would not be allowed to return. The forced deportation of a civilian population is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-takeover-illegal.html" title="">war crime</a> under international law.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A shelter amid the rubble in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Trump has said he would “make a deal” with Jordan and Egypt to take in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/middleeast/trump-israel-gaza-cease-fire-deal-jordan.html" title="">Palestinians — a move that</a> would destabilize both countries and that has been flatly rejected by their leaders.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s proposal ignited widespread anger among Arab states in the Middle East and even some American allies in Europe. It also raised concerns in Israel that Mr. Netanyahu now had a political escape hatch to end the cease-fire negotiations and, instead, return to war.</p><p>Responding to Mr. Netanyahu on Tuesday, a group representing the hostages’ families urged him to continue the diplomatic talks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“You made the decision to bring all our hostages home through an agreement,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. “We must not go backwards.
