data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The video falsely claiming that the United States Agency for International Development paid Ben Stiller, Angelina Jolie and other actors millions of dollars to travel to Ukraine appeared to be a clip from E!News, though it never appeared on the entertainment channel.</p><p>In fact, the video first surfaced on X in a post from an account that researchers have said spreads Russian disinformation. </p><p>Within hours it drew the attention of Elon Musk, who reposted it. So did President Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr.</p><p>They amplified the false video as Mr. Musk pressed a crusade to shut down U.S.A.I.D., the agency that has distributed much of the government’s foreign aid since 1961. Working with Mr. Trump’s blessing as the head of a government efficiency campaign, Mr. Musk and others in the administration have taken over the agency’s headquarters, frozen grants and notified employees that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/usaid-job-cuts.html" title="">nearly all</a> of them will be laid off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The dismantling of the agency has been accompanied by a torrent of anger online from right-wing influencers and accounts that are promoting false claims and conspiratorial thinking.</p><p>While some politicians and voters have long questioned the value of foreign aid, those attacking the agency have often distorted facts and, wittingly or unwittingly, embraced as true anything that could help justify targeting U.S.A.I.D.</p><p>That includes Mr. Musk himself, who has used the platform he took over in 2022 as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/technology/elon-musk-x-doge.html" title="">a megaphone</a> for the effort to slash the federal bureaucracy. On Sunday Mr. Musk called it “a criminal organization,” without explaining the basis for such an accusation.</p><p>“He’s exploiting ignorance about the way government works, and the lack of oversight over anything he’s doing,” said Mike Rothschild, a disinformation researcher and author of “Jewish Space Lasers,” a book about conspiracy theories. “All of it is incredibly dangerous, and happening right in front of us.”</p><p>The flurry of attacks also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/technology/russia-american-far-right-ukraine.html" title="">underscored once again</a> how much Republican views have increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/business/media/russia-tenet-media-tim-pool.html" title="">converged with propaganda</a> emanating from the Kremlin or with narratives aligned with its international goals, especially on Mr. Musk’s platform. The false video about the celebrities appeared to be the work of an influence campaign that has produced dozens of similar fakes about Russia’s war in Ukraine, according to Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Russian anti-Ukraine propaganda has thoroughly infiltrated certain communities on X,” said Darren L. Linvill, a researcher there, who traced the spread of the faked clip from its origin on X through a network of accounts that has distributed Russian fakes before.</p><p>“Given how much time Musk spends on his platform,” Dr. Linvill said, “it was probably inevitable that some fabricated Russian message would resonate with him, and this one seemed almost designed to do just that.”</p><p>Neither Mr. Musk nor Donald Trump Jr. responded immediately to requests for comment.</p><p>X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the spread of misinformation about U.S.A.I.D. on the platform, though it has added a note to posts sharing the video about the actors, noting that it is not real.</p><p>Much of the frenzy online this week has centered on U.S.A.I.D.’s many grants, information about which has been publicly available for years. </p><p>One viral claim, for example, started after an account on X with more than half a million followers suggested that Politico, the Washington news website, had received more than $8 million from U.S.A.I.D.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That wasn’t true. The website had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/business/trump-politico-usaid-spending-conspiracy.html" title="">received about $44,000</a> from U.S.A.I.D. for subscriptions to its premium environmental and energy publication over two years, and more than $8 million in subscription revenue from a variety of agencies, including the Department of Energy.</p><p>Even so, the claim shot rapidly across social media, as influencers and politicians with even more followers amplified the idea.</p><p>That set off a round of other misleading claims about U.S.A.I.D. granting money to the BBC and The New York Times. (The agency has instead granted money to an independent charity that shares a name <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mediaaction/press-release/4-feb-25" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with the BBC</a>. The most viral claim about The New York Times was based on an inaccurate search of government records that included grants to unrelated, but similar-sounding groups, like New York University. <a href="https://x.com/NYTimesPR/status/1887604934578712752" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a statement</a>, The Times said that the payments it had received were for subscriptions; <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=1c52a31366e909b012b06d036d389cc1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government data shows</a> it has also received some advertising revenue from the government. In a memo to staff, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/business/trump-politico-usaid-spending-conspiracy.html" title="">Politico’s leaders said</a> the publication had “never been a beneficiary of government programs or subsidies.”)</p><p>The facts failed to reach a significant audience online, but the misinformation was elevated by prominent podcasters, politicians and Trump allies within hours.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="disinfo-politico-tweets-lgupk" data-id="100000009975703" data-source-id="100000009975703"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Posts on X About Politico and U.S.A.I.D.</h2><p data-testid="leadin" id="interactive-leadin">Nearly 15,000 posts on X over two days mentioned U.S.A.I.D. and Politico, with many users falsely claiming that the humanitarian organization paid the news website millions of dollars.</p></header><div slug="disinfo-politico-tweets-lgupk" data-sourceid="100000009975703" id="embed-id-100000009975703">

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/business/media/politico-news-subscriptions-white-house.html" title="">canceled</a> its Politico subscriptions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>For Russia and China, the American conservative uproar over U.S.A.I.D. has been met with startled glee.</p><p>Both nations, echoing Mr. Orban’s complaint, have blamed the agency for supporting subversive programs in their countries.</p><p>Chen Weihua, a prominent bureau chief and columnist for the state news organization China Daily, cited reports about the agency’s funding as vindication for China’s previous claims. He suggested that the BBC’s reporters in China were “all bought” by the Central Intelligence Agency and the British secret service, MI6.</p><p>“If you have questions why BBC reporters in China keep smearing China all these years and talking BS, you might find answers now,” he wrote on X.</p><p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia banned U.S.A.I.D. grants in 2012 and expelled the agency’s workers, accusing the United States of funding opponents of his rule. (Officials from Republican and Democratic administrations have argued that the programs simply promoted civil society in Russia.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ridiculed a series of grants that have been criticized in the United States, too, and claimed the agency’s underlying purpose was to promote political uprisings, citing protests in Egypt in 2011, Ukraine in 2014 and Georgia last year.</p><p>The false video that went viral this week claiming U.S.A.I.D. funded celebrity travel overseas fit Russia’s recurring narrative that the United States furtively supports Ukraine with resources that American voters would rather spend at home.</p><p>The video appeared to be the work of an influence campaign known to researchers as Operation Overload or Matryoshka, after the Russian nesting dolls, according to Clemson’s Media Forensics Hub. That work is led by a private company with links to the Kremlin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-15"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="disinfo-usaid-video-ajraa" data-id="100000009975727" data-source-id="100000009975727"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Viral Disinformation About U.S.A.I.D.</h2><p data-testid="leadin" id="interactive-leadin">A false video, claiming that celebrities were paid by U.S.A.I.D. for visiting Ukraine, went viral online and was reposted by Elon Musk, X’s owner and most-followed user. It appeared to be part of a Russian influence campaign, according to Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub.</p></header></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The footage showed photographs or clips of a number of well-known actors meeting with Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, while a narrator with a British accent claimed the actors had received large payments from U.S.A.I.D. for the appearance.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Ms. Jolie, the narrator says, received $20 million; Orlando Bloom, $8 million; Sean Penn, $5 million; and so on. “This was done to increase Zelensky’s popularity among foreign audiences, particularly in the United States,” the narrator claims. “The involvement of celebrities made it easy to coordinate funding programs for Ukraine during the conflict.”</p><p>After the video appeared on the X account, articles about its claims appeared on the sites of at least two Russian news organizations, Tsargrad and Pravda. The video was picked up by a number of accounts that have previously shared Russian disinformation, but soon expanded beyond that to Americans cheering the Trump administration on. By Thursday, users on TikTok and Mr. Trump’s Truth Social platform had shared the video as commenters expressed outrage and called for U.S.A.I.D. to be eliminated.</p><p>There is no evidence of the payments in any of the agency’s programs. A spokesman for E!News also said in a statement that “the video is not authentic and did not originate from E!News.”</p><p>The actor Ben Stiller, said to have been paid $4 million for a visit to Ukraine, took to social media to try to refute the claim. “These are lies coming from Russian media,” he wrote on X. “I completely self-funded my humanitarian trip to Ukraine. There was no funding from USAID and certainly no payment of any kind.”</p><p>More conspiratorially minded supporters of Mr. Musk continue to cheer the billionaire on anyway.</p><p>They include a food service worker and Army National Guard veteran who was <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/article/unmasking-clandestine-figure-behind-viral-ukrainian-biolab-conspiracy-theory" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blamed</a> in 2022 for starting a conspiracy theory about American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. In attacking U.S.A.I.D., he wrote in posts on X and Telegram this week, Mr. Musk had exposed “an Orwellian dystopia” by detailing the agency’s supposed support for the media.</p><p>“We live on a foundation of lies,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Steven Lee Myers covers misinformation and disinformation from San Francisco.
