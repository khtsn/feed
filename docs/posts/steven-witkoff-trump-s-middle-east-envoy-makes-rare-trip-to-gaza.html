Israel Katz, Israel’s defense minister, was also at the meeting, according to a third Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the minister’s schedule.</p><p>Before the American envoy went to Israel, he had discussions on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia about a broader Middle East peace plan, one of the Israeli officials said. The White House official said Mr. Witkoff had met Hussein al-Sheikh, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Two Palestinian officials who requested anonymity to discuss a closed-door meeting said Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, was also at the meeting.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff’s visit to the region comes as the Trump administration seeks to broker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/19/us/politics/trump-president-promises.html" title="">a wider Middle East peace agreement</a> that would include normalizing diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a deal that President Trump sought during his first term. But that pact largely hinges on plans for Gaza’s future.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6367504293112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a Fox News interview last week</a> that he planned to visit both the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-philadelphi-corridor-gaza.html" title="">the Philadelphi Corridor</a>, which is farther south and on the border with Egypt, during the trip. But the timing was unclear as travel schedules are usually closely held to ensure security.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem declined to comment on Wednesday.</p><p>In the early days of the 15-month war, the Israeli military ordered a mass evacuation of northern Gaza, forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee south. For months, Israeli soldiers patrolled the Netzarim Corridor, in part to prevent Palestinians from heading back north.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Steven Witkoff, U.S. envoy to the Middle East, is the highest-ranking American official to visit Gaza in years.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But under the terms of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/israel-cabinet-ceasefire-gaza.html" title="">42-day cease-fire</a> agreement reached this month, Israeli troops withdrew on Monday from the two main roads along the Netzarim Corridor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/middleeast/northern-gaza-palestinians-return.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">to allow Gazans to head north</a>. By Tuesday, more than 376,000 people had reached northern Gaza, according to the <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-259-gaza-strip" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest data</a> from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.</p><p>The American firm Safe Reach Solutions is expected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/middleeast/gaza-us-contractors.html" title="">oversee the operational management</a> of the corridor, according to a person familiar with the plan, while two other firms — one American and one Egyptian — will handle the inspections of those heading north.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/middleeast/philadelphi-corridor-israel-gaza-egypt.html" title="">Philadelphi Corridor</a>, as it is known in Israel, is a roughly eight-mile border strip between Egypt and Gaza. Israeli troops currently maintain control of the area, but they are expected to withdraw during the second phase of the cease-fire, the <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2025/01/israel-hamas-reach-gaza-cease-fire-deal-what-happens-now" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">details of which are still being negotiated</a>.

The laws would require the agency, UNRWA, to cease its activities in East Jerusalem and bans any Israeli government contacts with the agency. UNRWA says the laws would hobble its operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza.</p><p>The agency’s commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, told ambassadors at the United Nations on Tuesday that curtailing the agency’s operations would “undermine the cease-fire.”</p><p>“It will sabotage Gaza’s recovery and political transition,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced Palestinians sheltering in an UNRWA-run school in the center of Khan Younis, Gaza, in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Dorothy Shea, the Trump administration’s interim representative to the U.N., on Tuesday dismissed the agency’s claims as exaggerated and said the United States supported “Israel’s sovereign decision” to close UNRWA’s offices on its soil.</p><p>Israel and UNRWA have long been at odds. Last year, Israel claimed that UNRWA employees participated in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. A U.N. investigation found that nine employees might have been involved in the attack, and the agency said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/world/middleeast/unrwa-oct-7-attack.html" title="">they had been fired</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Witkoff’s visit also comes ahead of the third round of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/middleeast/arbel-yehud-civilian-hostage-gaza.html" title="">hostage and prisoner exchanges</a> between Israel and Hamas that is expected on Thursday. An Israeli soldier, Agam Berger, and two Israeli civilians — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/middleeast/arbel-yehud-civilian-hostage-gaza.html" title="">Arbel Yehud</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-father-kidnap.html" title="">Gadi Moses</a> — are to be released on Thursday, along with five Thai citizens, said Omer Dostri, the prime minister’s spokesman.</p><p>David Mencer, a government spokesman, said three more hostages would be released on Saturday. Under the cease-fire deal, 33 Israeli hostages were to be released in the first phase in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Seven captives have already returned home, and eight of the remaining hostages are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-dead-hamas.html" title="">no longer alive</a>, according to Israeli officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Family members and supporters of hostages still in Gaza attended a  demonstration in Tel Aviv on Saturday calling for the captives’ release. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amit Elkayam for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu has been invited to meet with Mr. Trump on Feb. 4 at the White House.</p><p>On Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with the foreign ministers of Egypt and Qatar to discuss continued cooperation in Gaza. That would include “post-conflict planning to ensure Hamas can never govern Gaza or threaten Israel again,” according to a <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-rubios-call-with-egyptian-foreign-minister-abdelatty-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">State Department readout</a> of Mr. Rubio’s call with the Egyptian foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty.
