name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials are planning to meet next week to discuss the first steps of a deal that could seek an end to the war in Ukraine, after a week of U.S. moves casting doubt on its support for the country.</p><p>Both President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine confirmed the meeting, which is expected to take place in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The planned meeting was announced just under a week after an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-ukraine-military-aid.html" title="">Oval Office blowup</a> between the two men in which Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Zelensky as ungrateful for U.S. support and threatened to abandon Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion. Mr. Trump later paused <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/americas/ukraine-us-weapons-suspension.html" title="">all military aid</a> to Ukraine.</p><p>Since then, Mr. Zelensky has expressed regret in general terms over how that meeting went, and both sides have showed willingness to sign a deal in which the United States would share in revenue from Ukraine’s mineral resources.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Ukrainian and American teams have resumed work, and we hope that next week we will have a meaningful meeting,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement on Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said that Ukraine would send a delegation to meet with “military representatives of countries that are ready to make greater efforts to reliably guarantee security within the framework of ending this war.” He said the meeting was scheduled for Tuesday, but did not specify who would attend.</p><p>Russian officials met last month with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-diplomacy.html" title="">top Trump officials in Saudi Arabia</a> as Russia has signaled an openness to talks, though it has not said if it would accept a cease-fire or an agreement to end the war.</p><p>There remains significant doubt among <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/world/europe/europe-trump-ukraine-defense.html" title="">European leaders</a> as to whether they can serve as the ultimate security backstop for Ukraine if America abandons the war-torn country. The Trump administration suspended military assistance and intelligence sharing with Ukraine this week in a bid to pressure Kyiv to negotiate on its terms, although it has not outlined any specific peace plan.</p><p>Outside the White House on Thursday, Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s special envoy to the Middle East, told reporters that the negotiations would take place in Saudi Arabia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We are now in discussions to coordinate a meeting with the Ukrainians in Riyadh or even potentially Jeddah; the city is moving around a little bit,” Mr. Witkoff said. He added, “The idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial cease-fire as well.”</p><p>Mr. Witkoff said Mr. Zelensky’s comments after the Oval Office showdown, praising the strength of Mr. Trump’s leadership, had helped Ukraine’s standing with America. Last Friday, Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance lectured the Ukrainian president for not showing enough gratitude for the United States’ more than $100 billion in military support.</p><p>“He felt that Zelensky’s letter is a very positive first step,” Mr. Witkoff said, adding: “President Zelensky has demonstrated that he’s intent on that good-faith path back. He’s apologized. He’s said he’s grateful. He said he wants to work toward peace.” Mr. Witkoff added that he believed Mr. Zelensky was willing to sign a minerals deal to create a U.S.-controlled fund that would receive revenue from Ukraine’s natural resources.</p><p>At next week’s meeting, Mr. Zelensky said the Ukrainians would insist on a number of commitments from Russia to test whether a lasting peace could ultimately be reached. Those demands include Russian pledges not to attack Ukraine’s energy or other civilian infrastructure; a truce for missiles, bombs and long-range drones; and no military operations in the Black Sea.</p><p>“Ukrainians truly want peace, but not at the cost of giving up Ukraine,” Mr. Zelensky said. “The real question for any negotiations is whether Russia is capable of giving up the war.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Moscow has given no public indication it would accept any truce, cease-fire or end to the war it launched three years ago. But Mr. Witkoff said Russia had shown openness to continuing discussions.</p><p>Of the talks with Ukraine, Mr. Witkoff said: “Hopefully that will be a good signal to the Russians because they have been proactive too in wanting to get something done here.”</p><p>Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump noted that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/world/europe/europe-trump-ukraine-defense.html" title="">France was willing to put soldiers in Ukraine</a> “for safety reasons”; the country has suggested assembling a European peacekeeping force after the war’s end. He also said that U.S. negotiators had “made a lot of progress with Ukraine and a lot of progress with Russia over the last couple of days.”</p><p>He also expressed optimism about an eventual peace agreement.</p><p>“I think what’s going to happen is Ukraine wants to make a deal because I don’t think they have a choice,” Mr. Trump said. “I also think that Russia wants to make a deal because in a certain different way — a different way that only I know, only I know — they have no choice.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Luke Broadwater covers the White House for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater">More about Luke Broadwater</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia. He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.
