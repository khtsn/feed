That spike in threats coincided with a flood of harsh rhetoric — often from Mr. Trump himself — criticizing judges who have ruled against the administration and, in some cases, calling on Congress to impeach them.</p><p>Many judges have already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/trump-judges-threats.html" title="">spoken out</a>, worrying about the possibility of violence and urging political leaders to tone things down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since mid-April, the pace of the threats has slowed slightly, the data shows. Between April 14 and May 27, it shows 35 additional individual judges received threats. Still, the total number of judges threatened this fiscal year — 277 — represents roughly a third of the judiciary.</p><p>The threat data was not released publicly but was provided to The New York Times by Judge Esther Salas of Federal District Court for New Jersey, who said she obtained it from the Marshals Service, which is tasked by law with overseeing security for the judiciary.</p><p>In 2020, Judge Salas’ son, Daniel Anderl, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/opinion/esther-salas-murder-federal-judges.html" title="">shot and killed</a> at the entrance of her home by a self-described “anti-feminist” lawyer, and since then she has advocated judicial safety.</p><p>“This has nothing to do with hysteria or hyperbole,” she said in an interview. “These numbers tell a dramatic story. They show a spike that ought to be alarming and concerning to everyone.”</p><p>Spokesmen for the White House and the marshals did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The marshals define a threat as “any action or communication, whether explicit or implied, of intent to assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate or interfere” with any marshals-protected person, including federal judges, according to an internal document reviewed by The Times. That language mirrors a federal statute that treats as criminals those who interfere with federal officials performing their duties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Threats against judges have been rising in recent years, including before Mr. Trump took office.</p><p>Marshals Service data shows there were threats against more than 400 individual judges in 2023, the year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion. In June 2022, after the Supreme Court’s ruling on Roe leaked, an armed man <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/kavanaugh-assassination-attempt-guilty.html" title="">tried to assassinate</a> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh at his home.</p><p>A series of judges have blocked Mr. Trump’s sweeping executive actions, including his efforts to deliver on his campaign promise of mass deportations.</p><p>Last week, a federal judge in Boston ordered the United States to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-deportations-south-sudan.html" title="">maintain custody</a> of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/africa/trump-deportations-south-sudan.html" title="">group of deportees</a> whom the administration is trying to send to South Sudan, and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/politics/trump-deportation-court-mexico.html" title="">bring back</a> another deportee now in hiding in Guatemala.</p><p>In a statement, the White House called the judge, Brian E. Murphy, a “far-left activist.” Mr. Trump broadened the attack on Monday, condemning “USA hating judges who suffer from an ideology that is sick, and very dangerous for our country,” in a social media post rendered in all capital letters.</p><p>Some judges who have ruled against the administration have received unwelcome pizza deliveries at their homes, and at the homes of their family members. The authorities are investigating the matter. Judge Salas said she had learned from the marshals that 103 pizzas had been sent anonymously, including 20 in the name of her dead son.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Countering ICE in Nashville:</strong> With little official recourse in the liberal enclave, several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/americas/ice-nashville-volunteers.html">Nashville residents and immigration advocacy groups are now acting as an unofficial warning system</a> when Tennessee Highway Patrol and ICE agents have been spotted together.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crackdown on Aid</strong>: Republicans&#39; aggressive attempt to curb immigrant families’ use of safety net programs would largely be felt by children who are U.S. citizens but whose parents are undocumented or immigrants, say immigration experts and advocates for immigrant rights.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Decision to Leave</strong>: Yessica Rojas, a Venezuelan mother, risked everything to seek a better future for her two children in the United States. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/americas/mother-self-deportation-trump.html">This spring, they left Missouri because she feared losing them.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Seeking Return of Guatemalan Man to U.S.:</strong> A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of the man, known by the initials O.C.G., who had been deported to Mexico, despite fearing persecution and having told U.S. authorities about the violence he had experienced there. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/politics/trump-deportation-court-mexico.html">O.C.G. is gay and is now living in hiding in Guatemala</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘Sanctuary’ Policies:</strong> The Justice Department has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/new-jersey-sanctuary-city-lawsuit.html">sued four New Jersey cities and their leaders</a> over the policies, which federal lawyers say are hindering the Trump administration’s enforcement of U.S. immigration laws.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia:</strong> Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador set off a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/trump-abrego-garcia-el-salvador-deportation.html">fierce debate among officials in three cabinet agencies</a>, despite agreement there had been a mistake.</p></li><li><p><strong>Americans Applying for British Citizenship:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/world/europe/americans-british-citizenship-applications-record.html">A record number of Americans</a> applied for British citizenship in the first three months of this year, and for the right to live and work in Britain indefinitely, according to official data.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
