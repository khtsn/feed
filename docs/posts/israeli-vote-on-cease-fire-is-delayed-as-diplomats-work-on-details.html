The Israeli cabinet, whose approval is needed to move the cease-fire ahead, had been expected to vote on it on Thursday, but the vote was postponed. </p><p>The deal has reopened deep divides in Israel, where hard-line members of the governing coalition vehemently oppose a cease-fire. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right minister for national security, announced on Thursday night that his party would resign from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition should the cabinet approve the cease-fire deal.</p><p>The move threatens to destabilize the government at a critical time but should not, in and of itself, prevent the deal from moving ahead.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The United States, which spent months struggling to broker a deal alongside Qatar and Egypt, downplayed the delay and insisted that the cease-fire would take effect on Sunday as planned.</p><p>“I am confident and fully expect implementation will begin,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told reporters on Thursday. “It’s not exactly surprising that in a process, a negotiation, that has been this challenging — this fraught — we may get a loose end. We’re tying up that loose end as we speak.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Antony J.

The deal, she said, could “collapse for any reason.”</p><p>“My heart is broken,” she added. “I will probably stay in a tent. Hundreds of thousands will end up in tents.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>And deadly Israeli airstrikes went on in Gaza on Thursday, with the Israeli military saying it had hit about 50 targets across the territory over the past day.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli airstrikes continued in Gaza on Thursday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Menahem Kahana/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The reality in the Strip remains very difficult and catastrophic,” said Mahmoud Basal, a spokesman for Gaza’s Civil Defense, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/world/middleeast/gaza-war-rescuers-trauma.html" title="">emergency service</a> under the Hamas-run Interior Ministry.</p><p>Recent Israeli attacks in the territory killed at least 81 people and injured nearly 200 others, <a href="https://t.me/MOHMediaGaza/6236" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The Civil Defense said that Israeli strikes had killed at least 77 people since the deal had been announced. The claims could not be independently verified.</p><p>The Israeli military said its recent targets included militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, their compounds, weapons storage areas and other sites, adding that “numerous steps” were taken to prevent civilian harm before the strikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mediators hope the cease-fire deal — which would begin with a 42-day truce and the release of some hostages — will ultimately end the war that began with the Hamas-led attack in October 2023, when about 1,200 people in Israel were killed and 250 taken hostage. The subsequent Israeli military campaign has killed tens of thousands of Gazans and forced nearly the entire population of the enclave to flee their homes.</p><p>In Israel, Mr. Ben-Gvir and other hard-line members of Mr. Netanyahu’s government, the most right-wing and religiously conservative in Israel’s history, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/world/middleeast/ceasefire-netanyahu-israel.html" title="">opposed the deal</a> and pushed for the war to go on until Hamas is eliminated.</p><p>Mr. Ben-Gvir’s party, Jewish Power, holds six seats in the 120-seat Parliament, and the party’s withdrawal from the governing coalition would reduce its majority from 68 to a razor-thin 62. He said his party would offer to rejoin the government should it resume the war against Hamas.</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, dozens of demonstrators in Israel blocked a main highway in Jerusalem to protest the deal, eventually being dispersed by the police.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli Border Police officers clearing protesters against the proposed cease-fire deal from a highway in Jerusalem on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Peter van Agtmael for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>One of the protesters, Eliyahu Shahar, 21, said the agreement posed a threat to Israel’s safety and should be rejected, “even if it means more hostages will die.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>If it comes to a vote, the cease-fire agreement is expected to gain Israel’s approval even without the support of two far-right parties in the governing coalition. Families of hostages have hailed the deal, and opposition parties have broadly committed to propping up Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition, if necessary, to secure the implementation of an agreement that would free the Israelis still held in Gaza.</p><p>“This is more important than all the differences of opinion that there have ever been between us,” Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader, said in a statement.</p><p>Yona Schnitzer, 36, a marketing writer from Tel Aviv, said he felt “careful optimism” about the deal. “I hope the deal will actually happen this time,” he said. “If it’s confirmed and a done deal, I’ll feel relief, firstly because hostages will come home, and secondly because it will bring us closer to ending this war.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas.html?smid=url-share" title="">cease-fire deal</a> would begin with an initial phase lasting six weeks. It would involve the release of 33 hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and allow the entry into Gaza of 600 trucks carrying humanitarian relief daily, according to a copy of the agreement obtained by The New York Times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, described the cease-fire agreement as “the hope the region desperately needed.” But she added that the situation in Gaza remained grim. She <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_271" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that Europe would provide $123 million in aid for Gazans this year, along with in-kind aid such as food shipments.</p><p>Diplomats hope the first phase of the deal would then lead to more permanent conditions, a point Mr. Blinken stressed on Thursday.</p><p>“It’s going to take tremendous effort, political courage, compromise, to realize that possibility, to try to ensure the gains that have been achieved over the past 15 months at enormous, excruciating costs are actually enduring,” he said.</p><p>But in Gaza, where ruins dominate the landscape and huge questions remain over what a postwar future will look like, uncertainty and exhaustion reigned.</p><p>“It’s undoubtedly a good feeling to hear about the cease-fire,” said Nizar Hammad, a 31-year-old who lost his home in Gaza City. “But when I think about life after the war, I think about the suffering that will continue. The scale of destruction and loss is enormous.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“Honestly, I feel numb,” said Aseel Mutier, a 22-year-old from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, whose 16-year-old brother was killed during the war and whose house was destroyed last week.</p><p>“We are just waiting for Sunday,” she added. “We don’t know what will happen between now and then.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Palestinian man walking with a crutch through the rubble in Gaza City on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Issa/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> contributed reporting from Haifa, Israel, and <!-- -->Isabel Kershner<!-- --> and <!-- -->Natan Odenheimer<!-- --> from Jerusalem.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Hiba Yazbek covers the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a focus on Palestinian affairs and society in the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and Israel.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hiba-yazbek">More about Hiba Yazbek</a></span></p></div><div><p>Michael Crowley covers the State Department and U.S. foreign policy for The Times.
