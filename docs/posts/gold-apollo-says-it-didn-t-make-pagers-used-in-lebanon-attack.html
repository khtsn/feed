    <h1>Gold Apollo Says It Didn’t Make Pagers Used in Lebanon Attack</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of the officials briefed on the operation had said that the pagers, which Hezbollah had ordered, had been tampered with before they reached Lebanon, and that most were Gold Apollo’s AR924 model, though three other Gold Apollo models were also included in the shipment.</p><p>In a separate statement, Gold Apollo said that the AR924 model was produced and sold by B.A.C., with which it had a “long-term partnership.” “Our company only provides the brand trademark authorization and is not involved in the design or manufacturing of this product,” the company said.</p><p>Efforts to contact B.A.C. and verify Gold Apollo’s account were not immediately successful. Calls to a number listed on <a href="https://bacconsulting.org/contact-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">B.A.C. Consulting’s website</a>, which gave the same address provided by Gold Apollo, rang unanswered. </p><p>Tracing how and when the pagers were packed with explosive material could be complicated. Taiwan’s sprawling consumer electronics industry is a complex supply chain of brands, manufacturers and agents.</p><p>Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs, which oversees trade, said that its records showed “no direct exports to Lebanon” of such pagers from Gold Apollo. The company’s pagers were mainly exported to Europe and North America, the ministry said. The company reviewed news reports and photographs and judged that the pagers had been modified only after being exported from Taiwan, the ministry said. The New York Times could not independently verify the assessment.</p><p>Mr. Hsu said that he had a longstanding relationship with B.A.C. before they struck the brand licensing deal. Looking back, he said, there was one “odd” incident with B.A.C., when a local Taiwanese bank had delayed a bank transfer from the company because the local bank had suspicions about it. Mr. Hsu said the transfer might have come from a bank in the Middle East. He did not say which country.</p></div></div>
