Around 2,700 people were also injured by the attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But at Gold Apollo’s office on the outskirts of Taipei on Wednesday, Hsu Ching-Kuang, the company’s founder and president, said the pagers were made by another company. Gold Apollo later identified that company as B.A.C. Consulting, a firm it described as having an address in Budapest. </p><p>Mr. Hsu said he had agreed about three years ago to let B.A.C. sell its own products using the Gold Apollo brand, which he said had a good reputation in the niche market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pagers at the factory.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“That product isn’t ours. They just stick on our company brand,” Mr. Hsu told journalists, adding that in return his company received a share of the profits. </p><p>“We only provide brand trademark authorization and have no involvement in the design or manufacturing of this product,” Gold Apollo said in a written statement. Even so, the Gold Apollo website <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gapollo.com.tw%2Frugged-pager-ar924%2F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">displayed a picture of the pager model</a> until the web page was taken down on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some of the officials briefed on the operation had said that the pagers, which Hezbollah had ordered, had been tampered with before they reached Lebanon, and that most were Gold Apollo’s AR924 model, though three other Gold Apollo models were also included in the shipment.</p><p>In a separate statement, Gold Apollo said that the AR924 model was produced and sold by B.A.C., with which it had a “long-term partnership.” “Our company only provides the brand trademark authorization and is not involved in the design or manufacturing of this product,” the company said.</p><p>Efforts to contact B.A.C. and verify Gold Apollo’s account were not immediately successful. Calls to a number listed on <a href="https://bacconsulting.org/contact-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">B.A.C. Consulting’s website</a>, which gave the same address provided by Gold Apollo, rang unanswered. </p><p>Tracing how and when the pagers were packed with explosive material could be complicated. Taiwan’s sprawling consumer electronics industry is a complex supply chain of brands, manufacturers and agents.</p><p>Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs, which oversees trade, said that its records showed “no direct exports to Lebanon” of such pagers from Gold Apollo. The company’s pagers were mainly exported to Europe and North America, the ministry said. The company reviewed news reports and photographs and judged that the pagers had been modified only after being exported from Taiwan, the ministry said. The New York Times could not independently verify the assessment.</p><p>Mr. Hsu said that he had a longstanding relationship with B.A.C. before they struck the brand licensing deal. Looking back, he said, there was one “odd” incident with B.A.C., when a local Taiwanese bank had delayed a bank transfer from the company because the local bank had suspicions about it. Mr. Hsu said the transfer might have come from a bank in the Middle East. He did not say which country.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Buckley, the chief China correspondent for The Times, reports on China and Taiwan from Taipei, focused on politics, social change and security and military issues.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-buckley">More about Chris Buckley</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>China’s Risky Power Play: </strong>As China pushes to dominate the South China Sea, it is increasingly willing to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/15/world/asia/south-china-sea-philippines.html">use force to drive out the Philippines</a>, a treaty ally of the United States, raising fears of a superpower showdown.</p></li><li><p><strong>Endangering ‘Pura Vida’: </strong>Costa Rica’s lush rainforests were a tourist paradise.
