    <h1>The Future of Baseball</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>A new baseball season is underway, and the sport is enjoying a sort of renaissance.</p><p>Baseball is making more money than it ever has. The addition of a pitch clock has made games quicker and created more action on the field. Attendance and ratings are on the rise.</p><p>But the sport also faces a possible long-term problem: the widening gap between its haves and have-nots.</p><p>Baseball’s future, both good and bad, is on display in California.</p><p>It’s a glorious moment for the Los Angeles Dodgers, who won the World Series last year and have baseball’s biggest star, Shohei Ohtani. After winning the title, the Dodgers added even more talent to their roster — the team will spend well over $300 million this year on player salaries.</p><p>A few hundred miles up Interstate 5, in Sacramento, that kind of money feels almost unfathomable. There the Athletics, who left Oakland after 57 years, are playing their home games at a minor-league ballpark as they prepare to move to Las Vegas in three years. The A’s entire payroll is only slightly more than what Ohtani alone is owed each year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Money doesn’t win games. It’s baseball, after all. And the A’s are scrappy. Even if they aren’t as well compensated, they can beat anyone on any given day. But the imbalance of resources, over time, tends to offer richer teams an advantage.</p><p>For today’s newsletter, The Times spoke with the commissioner of Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred, about the state of the game.</p><h2 id="link-47fcc566">Payroll disparity</h2><p>Unlike other major American sports, baseball does not have a salary cap, which is used to narrow the gap between the richest and poorest teams. Some M.L.B. owners are pushing the league to adopt a salary cap as part of their next contract with the players’ union.</p><p>Manfred told us in an interview at his office in New York that he believes the financial imbalance is an existential problem for the sport. “We sell entertainment that’s based on competition,” he said. “If people don’t believe there’s competition, you’ve got a product problem.”</p><p>The problem: Players vehemently oppose a salary cap and many insist that they would never agree to play under one. Their union argues that players deserve to be compensated, without restriction, for the work they do.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Last time the owners made a real push for a cap, in 1994, it resulted in a 232-day strike, a canceled World Series and years of fan frustration. The current contract is set to expire after next season. If the owners make another push for a cap, another painful work stoppage could follow.</p><h2 id="link-2a5bc8c4">Baseball’s future</h2><p>In his interview with The Times, Manfred also spoke about a range of other topics concerning the present and future of the sport, including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Torpedo bats:</strong> The new, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6243085/2025/03/31/mlb-torpedo-bats-players-intrigued/" title="">oddly shaped bats</a> that caused a frenzy when the Yankees used them to hit several home runs are legal and “absolutely good for baseball,” Manfred said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Robot umpires: </strong>“The experiment was really successful,” Manfred said about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6144194/2025/02/20/abs-robot-umps-mlb-spring-training/" title="">computerized challenge system</a> for balls and strikes that the league tested during spring training. He hopes to use it in the regular season as soon as next year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pitching injuries: </strong>Manfred warned that pitching “is getting taught in a way that emphasizes velocity and spin rate,” which puts additional strain on pitchers’ elbows. “By the time we get guys,” he said, “they’re already damaged goods.”</p></li><li><p><strong>What would make the game better: </strong>Recent rule changes have led to more action on the field, which Manfred thinks is key to the sport’s future. “Action, movement, the ability to show how athletic you are,” he said. “Any changes that allow the showcasing of the athleticism of your players is huge.”</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/briefing/rob-manfred-interview-baseball.html" title="">Read the full interview with Manfred here</a>.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>At the Athletic, Keith Law <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6228542/2025/03/26/mlb-predictions-2025-season-world-series/" title="">offers his predictions for the season</a> and Tim Britton explains <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6227698/2025/03/25/mlb-preview-2025-each-team-make-playoffs/" title="">how each team could reach the playoffs</a>.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-3d79ad64">Government Overhaul</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Department of Justice building in Washington.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sarah Silbiger for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><ul><li><p>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/justice-dept-immigration-lawyer-leave.html" title="">suspended</a> a senior Justice Department immigration lawyer after he questioned the decision to deport a Maryland man to El Salvador.</p></li><li><p>President Trump’s firing of the head of the National Security Agency, on the advice of Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/nsa-director-haugh-trump-loomer.html" title="">rattled some lawmakers</a>.</p></li><li><p>The ousting of the N.S.A. chief is one of several moves that have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/trump-loomer-haugh-cyberattacks-elections.html" title="">eroded U.S. cyberdefenses</a> at a moment of rising danger.</p></li><li><p>Trump administration officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/aid-workers-myanmar-fired.html" title="">fired workers</a> for the main American aid agency who were sent to Myanmar after the deadly earthquake there.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-2b5fdde9">Trump Tariffs</h2><ul><li><p>Trump’s tariffs will wound global free trade, but the blow may not be fatal: Other countries could find a way to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/europe/trade-trump-tariffs-brexit.html" title="">maintain the system without the U.S.</a>, Mark Landler writes.</p></li><li><p>Trump vowed to help small businesses by reducing taxes and red tape, but some owners say his other policies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/business/economy/trump-tariffs-small-business.html" title="">have put them at a disadvantage</a>.</p></li><li><p>Vietnam, a manufacturing destination for U.S. brands, faces a potentially devastating 46 percent tariff.

Her story takes shape through journal entries written as letters to her mother. (Gaige used a version of the same device in her last novel, “Sea Wife,” to great effect. Who doesn’t love reading over a character’s shoulder?) And then we have the crew searching for her, including a game warden, a septuagenarian scientist, fellow hikers and Valerie’s husband, who is, as the kids might say, “sus.” Paths twist, outlooks bleaken and metaphors abound as Gaige guides readers ever closer to answers — which lead to questions worth pondering, even if you don’t own hiking boots.</p><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/books/review/heartwood-amity-gaige.html" title="">full review of “Heartwood.”</a></p></li><li><p>Liz Moore is another dependable purveyor of missing-person thrillers with soul, including “Long Bright River” and last year’s best-selling “The God of the Woods.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/books/long-bright-river-liz-moore.html" title="">Read our profile</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-420eedc"><span><strong>THE INTERVIEW</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Montgomery for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-marchese"><img alt="David Marchese" title="David Marchese" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/01/reader-center/author-david-marchese/author-david-marchese-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></a></p></div></div></div><p><em>This week’s subject for The Interview is Bill Murray, whose new movie, “The Friend,” is in theaters.
