Few are likely to come to pass.</p><p>Still, strange things happen to tax bills in the dead of night. You never know what changes aides could make in the hours before a vote, without much of Congress seeing them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>These are the things to watch for.</p><h2 id="link-410576c1">Provisions From Previous Bills That Are Set to Expire at the End of 2025</h2><h3 id="link-dccce02"><span>Tax Brackets</span></h3><p>The 2017 tax law reset â and lowered â the percentage of income that most people pay in federal income taxes. You can see where you stand currently on the Internal Revenue Serviceâs <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-releases-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>; the Tax Foundationâs <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/2017-tax-brackets/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> has a 2017 table, which uses dollar figures that are not adjusted for the inflation that has occurred since then.</p><p>If no new bill is passed to extend these cuts, the percentages <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60937" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will revert</a> to where they were in 2017, with new income bands in each tax bracket.</p><h3 id="link-7d600bd5"><span>Standard deduction</span></h3><p>The deduction that all taxpayers are generally eligible for (and actually use, unless they itemize their deductions) nearly doubled in the wake of the 2017 tax law. As a result, <a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-itemized-deductions-and-who-claims-them#:~:text=The%202017%20Tax%20Cuts%20and,ceiling%20of%20%2410%2C000%20on%20the" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fewer people itemized their deductions</a>, which made it simpler to file their returns. </p><p>Without any new legislation, the standard deduction would <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/blog/2026-tax-brackets-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-expires/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shrink dramatically</a>, though other tax breaks might return to their more generous levels from 2017 and earlier.</p><h3 id="link-5e014f96"><span>âSALTâ â State and Local Tax Deduction</span></h3><p>The 2017 legislation placed <a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc503" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a $10,000 cap</a> on the amount of state and local taxes you could deduct on your federal tax return when itemizing your deductions. This posed a big problem for higher-income people in states and local communities with high taxes of their own, since many of those people pay five figures in state income taxes and an additional five figures in property taxes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Without any change, the cap will expire. One possibility to watch for: a new, higher cap that satisfies members of Congress from both parties whose constituents are not happy with the $10,000 limit.</p><h3 id="link-50e8d04b"><span>Child Tax Credit</span></h3><p>The 2017 law doubled the <a href="https://www.eitc.irs.gov/other-refundable-credits-toolkit/what-you-need-to-know-about-ctc-and-actc/what-you-need-to-know" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">child tax credit</a> to $2,000 for each qualifying child for joint filers <a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income#modifiedagi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earning</a> up to $400,000 (and $200,000 for single filers). People with higher incomes may be able to claim a portion of it.</p><p>Up to $1,700 of that can be delivered in the form of a refundable credit, which means taxpayers can receive money back even if they have no tax liability. (Taxpayers may also reduce their tax bill by up to $500 for other dependents who are not children.)</p><p>Without any action, the credit â as well as the refundable portion â will revert to a maximum of $1,000 per child for joint filers who earn up to $110,000 (or $75,000 for single filers).</p><h3 id="link-71399b54"><span>Qualified Business Income</span></h3><p>The 2017 law created <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-provision-11011-section-199a-qualified-business-income-deduction-faqs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new system</a> whereby many self-employed people and small-business owners could deduct up to 20 percent of their business income.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Without an extension, this opportunity will disappear. Any extension could include modifications.</p><h3 id="link-2a122f8f"><span>Estate Tax Exemption</span></h3><p>The federal estate tax exemption sits at <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-tax" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$13.99 million</a>. Thatâs what you can hand over to someone (other than your spouse) when you die, without that personâs having to pay any taxes on the inheritance.</p><p>Without an extension, the exemption amount will fall by more than half.</p><h3 id="link-5d37e27e"><span>Other Changes</span></h3><p>Without any extensions or revisions in the current rules before the end of the year, the amount of <strong>mortgage interest</strong> you can deduct could rise by up to $250,000, and it could get easier to qualify for deductions for <strong>property and theft losses</strong>.</p><p>Many more people could be able to qualify for deductions related to the <strong>costs of moving</strong> for work-related reasons, and the dreaded <strong>alternative minimum tax</strong> <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/the-2025-tax-debate-the-alternative-minimum-tax-in-tcja/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">might apply</a> to more people.</p><p>You might have to pay taxes when converting 529 education savings accounts to so-called <strong>Able accounts, </strong>and some people would be able to deduct the cost of <strong>tax-preparation services</strong> again.
