    <h1>Hamas Suspends Hostage Release, Accusing Israel of Violating Cease-Fire Agreement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hamas has indefinitely postponed the release of Israeli hostages who were set to be freed from the Gaza Strip this weekend, a spokesman said on Monday, accusing Israel’s government of violating an already fragile cease-fire agreement.</p><p>In a statement on Telegram, Abu Obeida, the spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, accused Israel of a host of violations of the cease-fire agreement.</p><p>The move threatens to derail the cease-fire agreement reached last month. Widespread anger over the conditions some of the hostages who have been released so far — malnourished, buffeted by hostile crowds, paraded before cameras and in some cases made to read statements under duress — has drawn accusations in Israel that Hamas was not complying with the cease-fire agreement.</p><p>A spokesman for Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, called Hamas’s announcement “a complete violation of the cease-fire agreement and the hostage release deal.”</p></div></div>
