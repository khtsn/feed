as it pounded the Beirut strongholds of Hezbollah. Two Israeli officials confirmed that Israel had also struck near the Iranian Embassy in Syria’s capital.</p><p>The Iranian-backed Hezbollah forces launched their own aerial attack toward Israel, firing what the Israeli military said were 180 “projectiles,” most of which were intercepted.</p><p>Separately, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appeared to confirm in a video message released on Tuesday that Israeli airstrikes outside Beirut last week had killed the presumed successor of Hezbollah’s assassinated leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">Hassan Nasrallah</a>.</p><p>“We took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself and Nasrallah’s replacement,” Mr. Netanyahu said in an apparent reference to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/world/middleeast/hashem-safieddine-hezbollah-leader.html" title="">Hashem Safieddine</a>, a cousin of Mr. Nasrallah who was expected to replace him and had been targeted in last week’s attack in Lebanon. Neither Hezbollah nor Israel has confirmed Mr. Safieddine’s death.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For the past week, as fighting between Israel and Iran and its proxies has heated up, much of the region has braced for Israel’s avowed retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage last week. The strike in Syria’s capital, Damascus, was an attempt to assassinate a high-ranking Hezbollah official involved in weapons smuggling, according to the two Israeli officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence.</p><p>Israel fired three missiles from the area of the Golan Heights, targeting a residential building, Syria’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. The building was in the Mezzeh district of Damascus, a highly fortified neighborhood that houses embassies and security structures. The ministry’s statement said that seven people had been killed and 11 others injured in the strikes, including women and children.</p><p>It was not clear if the targeted official was among the dead, but the Iranian Embassy said in a statement on Tuesday that no Iranian citizens had been killed or wounded in the strikes. That could not be independently verified.</p><p>Trying desperately to ease the crisis, the United States and United Nations issued stark new warnings about the dangers of an expanded war in the Middle East, fearing further escalation of a war that has spilled out of the Gaza Strip with strikes and assassinations in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">Lebanon</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/israel-raid-syria-weapons.html" title="">Syria</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html" title="">Iran</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-houthis-yemen.html" title="">Yemen</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A damaged building in Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday night near the Iranian Embassy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Israeli and Hezbollah strikes and counter-strikes came a year and a day after Hamas, another Iran-backed group, led an attack into Israel that killed about 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 others, setting off the war in Gaza. Israeli leaders have vowed to dismantle Hamas and to push back its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, which began firing rockets into Israel just after the Hamas-led raids.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Israeli military has turned its focus on recent weeks to Hezbollah, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html" title="">exploding the group’s wireless devices</a> and bombarding parts of Lebanon. </p><p>In his video message, Mr. Netanyahu said Israel had not only killed Mr. Nasrallah’s presumed successor, but also the “replacement of the replacement.” It was not immediately clear who that was, and Hezbollah did not immediately respond to Mr. Netanyahu’s remarks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Portraits of Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader killed by Israel last week, in Dahiya, outside of Beirut.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>More than 2,000 people have been killed and nearly 10,000 injured in Lebanon over the past year as Israel and Hezbollah have attacked each other, according to Lebanon’s ministry of health. Most of the deaths and injuries have occurred <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/10/04/world/middleeast/lebanon-israel" title="">over the past three weeks</a>. The World Health Organization said that Israeli attacks in Lebanon had killed at least 65 health workers and injured 40 others since Sept. 17.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Since beginning its ground invasion into southern Lebanon on Sept. 30, Israeli troops have entered several Lebanese villages directly across Israel’s northern border. The Israeli military has said that its 36th, 98th, 91st, and 146th divisions have sent troops across the border into Lebanon, though it has not publicly disclosed how many soldiers are involved in the invasion or how many each division has contributed.</p><p>The Israeli military said its 98th Division had “eliminated hundreds of terrorists” in combat. It also said it had uncovered and “neutralized” a Hezbollah tunnel that crossed roughly 10 meters from Lebanon into Israeli territory near the town of Zar’it. Hezbollah had created such tunnels as part of an eventual plan to invade northern Israel, according to the military.</p><p>The military has declined to specify how many soldiers from the Israeli divisions have entered Lebanon since the invasion began, arguing that they do not want to publicize information that could benefit Hezbollah. Analysts estimate that they number in the thousands. A complete division in Israel, as in the United States, usually comprises 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers, with roughly a third being combat troops and the remainder playing supporting roles, including in logistics and intelligence.</p><p>Israeli military officials have repeatedly described the invasion as “limited, localized and targeted raids” against Hezbollah, suggesting the operation wouldn’t extend deep into Lebanon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli tanks near the border with Lebanon last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But it has called for the evacuation of dozens of villages in southern Lebanon and told residents to relocate north of the Awali River, which is more than 15 miles from the Israeli border at its nearest point.</p><p>Gershon Hacohen, a retired Israeli major general who served as a reservist in Israel’s northern command in the last year, estimated that the number of Israeli troops fighting in Lebanon was in the lower range of that in 2006, during the last full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah. News articles at the time put that figure at an estimated 10,000 to 30,000, depending on the phase of the 34-day war.</p><p>Israel’s expanded battlefield against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza has raised alarms about a spiraling conflict that would further engulf the region. William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, said at a conference in the United States on Monday that the Middle East faced “a very real danger” of further escalation, even though American intelligence agencies do not believe that the leaders of Iran or Israel want an all-out conflict.</p><p>But the White House has struggled to reduce tensions in the region, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/biden-israel-hezbollah-hamas-gaza.html" title="">relations have strained</a> between President Biden and Mr. Netanyahu. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, postponed a visit to Washington on Wednesday to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III to discuss Israel’s military response to Iran’s missile barrage, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.</p><p>Sabrina Singh, the deputy Pentagon press secretary, declined to say why Mr. Gallant postponed the visit, referring questions to the Israeli ministry of defense. President Biden has urged Israel to make a “proportionate” response to the Iranian attack, warning against attacks on nuclear or energy sites, and the United States has sent an array of weaponry to the region, including aircraft carriers and fighter squadrons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, told reporters on Tuesday that “the Middle East is a powder keg with many parties holding the match.”</p><p>Lebanon, he said, was on the verge of “an all-out war,” the situation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank was “boiling over,” and Gaza was “in a death spiral,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The aftermath of an Israeli strike on Tuesday in the Bureij area of central Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ramadan Abed/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Palestinian civil defense agency in Gaza said Tuesday that 12 people were killed and several others were wounded in Israeli airstrikes on a family home and tents housing displaced people in the Bureij area of central Gaza. The Israeli military said its troops were operating in Bureij, where they were “dismantling terrorist infrastructure sites and eliminating terrorists.”</p><p>Hospitals in Gaza City and other parts in the north of the enclave will soon stop providing services because of a lack of fuel, Gaza’s health ministry said on Tuesday. It called on humanitarian organizations to help with fuel deliveries. Fuel shortages have been common at Gaza’s health care facilities, many of which have been badly damaged during the war.</p><p>More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza during a year of war, and more than 97,000 injured, according to the local health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.
