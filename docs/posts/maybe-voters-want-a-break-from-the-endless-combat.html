That may be because of its general comity and more substantive nature, in addition to the splits on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/vice-presidential-debate-voter-poll/?itid=hp-top-table-main_p001_f002" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">different issues</a>.</p><p>Is agreeableness effective? Last month I was in North Carolina to do some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint/trump-abortion-dreamworld-protector" title="">reporting</a> on Donald Trump, but had some time to kill so I drove to a Kamala Harris field office in Goldsboro, N.C., unannounced. As it turned out, the people there were setting up for a small event with Representative Jeff Jackson, a Democrat known for his <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jeffjacksonnc?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earnest TikTok presence</a> who is now running for state attorney general.</p><p>The event was a fund-raiser, which Jackson let me observe on the fly, for probably 30 or 40 people, mostly older couples. One woman told me that it was interesting to see which of her neighbors were Democrats, because she felt people had pretty much stopped talking about politics in this tense era.</p><p>For this audience of Democrats, Jackson talked a fair amount about plans to tackle scams and other more practical issues as attorney general, but also generally about character and a “backlash of basic decency.” Either character counts in this election, he said, or it doesn’t count at all. That’s obviously pointed, but this was the week the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest round of Mark Robinson news</a> broke; Jackson also led his remarks by talking about how he had “really, really enjoyed working with people on both sides of the aisle. There was a lot to be gained in dropping my assumptions about who people are based on what I saw on the news.”</p><p>His parting thought along those lines was that voters needed to prepare themselves to take seriously an opportunity to unite people and to check their impulses for outrage:</p><blockquote><p>We want you in the right head space. When we get through this, to seize this moment we have to broaden the appeal, to show people who were on the fence but chose to support us that they were right to trust us with their vote. … I want us all to be on the right page with that, because I know how much outrage drives the current energy in politics, but we’re going to have an opportunity to emotionally reset. Which means we have to start doing that now. And for people whose anxiety levels are super high? If you get home tomorrow and some poll comes out and it spikes your anxiety, and you just can’t handle it, I want you to give your anxiety to me. I will carry it for you, because I don’t have anxiety, I have confidence. This isn’t going to be the most important election of our lifetimes; it’s going to be the best election of our lifetimes. Once we get through it, y’all, it’s going to feel wonderful.</p></blockquote><p>I am not sure if I’ve ever heard someone say, “This is going to be the best election of our lives.” It’s hard to know what kinds of messages work to make people vote or to change minds. While I do think there’s some evidence from the Trump/anti-Trump era that a scorched-earth strategy can form winning coalitions, this was an interesting glimpse at a different approach.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzBkOGQ1Y2QyLWIyMGItNTlhMi04MmI4LWJkZTZlZDNiY2E5Yw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/02/opinion/thepoint#jd-vance-debate-replace-trump" data-source-id="100000009736453"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tressie-mcmillan-cottom"><img alt="Tressie McMillan Cottom" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/13/reader-center/author-tressie-mcmillan-cottom/author-tressie-mcmillan-cottom-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/13/reader-center/author-tressie-mcmillan-cottom/author-tressie-mcmillan-cottom-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/13/reader-center/author-tressie-mcmillan-cottom/author-tressie-mcmillan-cottom-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-02T19:30:12.156Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 2, 2024, 3:30 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>What you saw on Tuesday in the vice-presidential debate was an audition for the leader of the post-Trump Republican Party.</p><p>Over and over again JD Vance successfully distanced himself from his long, well-documented track record of inflammatory statements on everything from reproductive health to immigrants. Those Americans who tuned in to the debate saw an affable, reasonable Vance (no matter how many times he lied). That should terrify anyone who cares about democracy.</p><p>In many ways, Vance proved that there will be another Donald Trump, one who is just as sinister but far better produced for middle-of-the road voters. It does not matter if Vance was only pretending to align with Trump’s combative politics and disastrous policy proposals. What matters is that Vance has proved that he will change all of his fundamental beliefs in order to win.</p><p>I don’t mean the dreaded “flip-flopping” that is too often applied to a politician who dares to change her mind. I mean a deliberate strategy of supporting any position in the name of procuring power. That was Trump’s best political innovation.</p><p>Trump has lied, cheated, misdirected and inflamed not out of ideology but for the bald pursuit of power. Only two things have blunted his worst impulses: the legal system and his own boorish behavior. His ongoing legal troubles show his weakness. He is gluttonous — for attention, for money, for privilege. His boorish behavior has turned off a lot of voters who would otherwise vote for him.</p><p>Vance is the perfect solution to Trump’s self-inflicted political frailties. He is just as starved for power but not nearly as desperate for attention. He sells dangerous policy positions better to the kinds of voters who are tired of being embarrassed.</p><p>His debate answers were full of racist, sexist and classist dog whistles. He pronounced “illegal alien” with the cultured disdain of an elitist who knows exactly what the term conjures but pretends he does not. He relished ascribing America’s addiction to gun violence to mental health and urban criminality. His every elocution hid a trope as dangerous as <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/crime-reshaped-criminal-justice" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that Willie Horton ad</a>, but his affable delivery sowed doubt that he means any harm.</p><p>Vance does mean harm. He means everything that Trump means. He absolutely does want to abolish abortion, in practice if not in ordinance. He absolutely does want to delegitimize the federal government, pillage protected lands and blame every social ill on people who cannot defend themselves.</p><p>But Vance proved that he can deliver that harm without paying the reputational cost that has made Trump an effective but toxic politician. If Vance demonstrated what an Ivy League education does for your rhetorical sleight of hand, then Tim Walz demonstrated what happens when you refuse to play the game as it is being played. Vance worked the rules and the refs. Walz let him, instead relying on meandering stories about individuals’ lives that lacked moral and emotional impact.</p><p>With 33 days until the election, that should worry the Democrats and anyone else who cares about fair, free elections.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM0ODkzYzI2LTFlNDctNTlkMS1iZWQ5LTQwNTQ1NDMwOWMxNg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/02/opinion/thepoint#pete-rose-baseball-gambling" data-source-id="100000009736738"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/daniel-j-wakin"><img alt="Daniel J.

Nary a betting booth was to be found in a stadium, game broadcasts had not a single FanDuel ad, and the leagues lacked an <a href="https://www.mlb.com/press-release/press-release-mlb-names-fanduel-a-new-official-sports-betting-partner-in-north-a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Official Sports Betting Partner.</a></p><p>Rose’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/sports/baseball/pete-rose-dead.html" title="">death</a> at 83 on Monday evoked that distant era and brought on a good dose of cognitive dissonance. His fame rested equally in being one of baseball’s greatest players and one of its most disgraced. He was barred for life from the game in 1989 for regularly betting on baseball, including on his own Cincinnati Reds while manager. The door slammed shut forever at the Baseball Hall of Fame, where his entry would have been a sure bet.</p><p>But baseball over the long decades has lost that innocence, acknowledging that many fans have a financial interest in the outcome of games. The professional sports world, including M.L.B., has become deeply entwined with the gambling industry. The explosion began with a 2018 Supreme Court ruling overturning a ban on organized sports betting in most states. Monthly wagering grew from less than $50 million to more than $1 billion last year, according to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/legal-sports-gambling-was-mistake/679925/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">figures cited by Charles Fain Lehman</a> in The Atlantic, who chronicled the terrible social and economic cost to ordinary people, mostly on the lower rungs of society, from sports betting.</p><p>In that light, should we think differently about Rose’s shame? It’s hard not to.</p><p>Rose or any other player would probably earn a substantial suspension today for betting on baseball — still a cardinal sin, said Marc Edelman, a law professor at Baruch College who studies gambling. But it’s also likely that given the 180-degree change in the sports world’s attitude toward gambling in general, Edelman said, Rose might have earned reinstatement.</p><p>Except for another sin: For years, Rose lied about his gambling. He only publicly admitted to betting on the Reds in a book released in 2004. He defended his honor by noting he never bet the Reds to lose — but that in itself was a signal to bookies on a game’s likely outcome.</p><p>Certainly betting on a game by its protagonists is a corrupt act — even worse in a way than taking performance-enhancing drugs. Both are betrayals. But juicing is more like cheating and lying to the fans, while betting is also selling out your fellow players and undermining the whole endeavor.</p><p>In the end, we probably should not forgive Rose just because baseball moguls are now seeing dollar signs. “He violated the holy law,” said the writer Dan Okrent, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/31/sports/backtalk-for-the-founding-father-of-fantasy-baseball-a-reality-check.html" title="">invented Rotisserie Baseball.</a> “It’s the one thing everybody knows you can’t do.” But thanks to baseball’s embrace of the gambling industry, we may soon find other players sharing Charlie Hustle’s shame. As Okrent said, “There’s no question they’ve invited the monster in.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2U2MDM4ZjAyLWZmZGQtNWQxNS1hNWE5LTc0ZGVkYTgxNTQ2YQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/02/opinion/thepoint#walz-vance-debate-loser" data-source-id="100000009735794"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-02T03:12:04.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 1, 2024, 11:12 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>JD Vance has always had the ability to switch on and off the outrageousness, to sound reasonable, to paper over a bitter and hollow core with a velvet patter learned at Yale and in countless television appearances. That was the version of himself that he presented to a national audience at the debate on Tuesday night, and it was a world away from how he sounds when campaigning in front of MAGA crowds.</p><p>If you saw only this performance, you wouldn’t know it was the same candidate who has viciously demonized Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio; who has railed against those American women who have chosen not to have children; who said as recently as Saturday that the mass deportation that he and Donald Trump have planned <a href="https://religionnews.com/2024/09/28/jd-vance-courage-tour/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is based on Christian principles</a>.</p><p>His long experience in tailoring his answers for his audience made him seem, at a superficial level, more polished than Tim Walz, who didn’t have the commanding performance his supporters had hoped for. The sly Midwestern charm that has been so effective in his speeches and campaign ads was missing, replaced by a nervous intensity that led to puzzling answers and missed opportunities to remind viewers of Trump’s unfitness for office.</p><p>When Vance provided a non sequitur rather than an answer on climate change, for example — “The best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people” — Walz could have taken a layup, explained that climate change really is about carbon emissions and reminded listeners of Trump’s multiple phony promises to save or build American factories. And he could have made clear that the Biden administration really has made an enormous investment in green energy and has saved far more manufacturing jobs than the Trump administration could have imagined doing.</p><p>He sped so quickly through his criticism of Vance’s vile comments about Haitian immigrants as criminals and pet eaters that he failed to explain that Vance and his boss have tried to drain legal immigrants of their humanity. And he let Vance get away with falsely claiming he never supported a national abortion ban or, bizarrely, that Trump “salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along.”</p><p>But Walz did have a few strong moments in the second half of the debate. He pointed out the nonsensical nature of the Trump-Vance plan to build housing on federal lands, most of which are nowhere near where denser housing is needed. And when Vance turned reality on its head by claiming that Trump “peacefully gave over power” upon leaving office, Walz at last rose to the moment and demonstrated the difference between Mike Pence and the man Vance was defending.</p><p>“This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen,” Walz said. “It manifested itself because of Donald Trump’s inability to say — he is still saying — he didn’t lose the election.”</p><p>In the end, despite Walz’s disappointing performance and Vance’s masquerade, the debate is not likely to change the minds of many voters. There wasn’t much truth or fire on the stage, but there also wasn’t much damage over a largely forgettable evening.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzA4OWMxMWFiLWZjMmMtNTU0Ni1iZTk3LWIwMzM5NzNmNTY0Yw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/02/opinion/thepoint#debate-vance-walz-family" data-source-id="100000009735572"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jessica-grose"><img alt="Jessica Grose" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/09/opinion/Jessica_Grose_newsletter/Jessica_Grose_newsletter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/09/opinion/Jessica_Grose_newsletter/Jessica_Grose_newsletter-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/09/opinion/Jessica_Grose_newsletter/Jessica_Grose_newsletter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-02T02:46:32.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 1, 2024, 10:46 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kena Betancur/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>JD Vance knows a woman. She’s dear to him. She’s from his Ohio hometown, and she had an unplanned pregnancy. “She felt like if she hadn’t had an abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship,” he said in Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. Vance said that he and Donald Trump want to earn “the American people’s trust back on this issue.”</p><p>He further explained that they’re going to earn that trust back by making life more affordable for American families and by letting states decide their own abortion policies, because what people want in California is different from what people want in Arizona.</p><p>While I must admit that Vance’s delivery was incredibly smooth all evening, I don’t know that I believe that he really supports his “dear” friend who had an abortion; if she were unfortunate enough to be living in Idaho right now, she would not be able to make the decision she made in Ohio. A states’ rights approach often means stripping millions of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/opinion/desantis-amendment-4-abortion.html" title="">women of their rights</a>.</p><p>When Norah O’Donnell, one of the moderators, pointed out that Vance previously supported a federal ban on abortion, he claimed he had done no such thing. “I never supported a national ban,” he said. “I did, when I was running for Senate, talk about a minimum national standard.” But O’Donnell was correct. You can hear Vance say, “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally</a>,” on a podcast in January 2022. He also said he was “sympathetic” to the idea that there might need to be some kind of federal response if, after the fall of Roe, George Soros were to send airplanes to fly women from states with abortion bans to places where abortion was legal.</p><p>Vance said he wanted to help Americans build families through pro-family policy, like “making child care more accessible.” But when he had the opportunity to vote for an expanded child tax credit over the summer — a policy he claims to support — <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/vance-calls-for-child-tax-credit-increase-after-skipping-senate-vote-to-expand-benefit/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he skipped the vote</a>.</p><p>It’s a shame Tim Walz did not do a better job articulating the Harris ticket’s positions on family policy. He was blustery and stilted all evening. Because even though Vance talked a very good game, I still don’t trust him — or Republicans in general — to help create a thriving America for mothers or their children. I don’t care how many women he claims to know.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzRmZWU3YTVkLTFmODctNWMwYi04MTk1LTgwMGY3NTdiMTE0YQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/02/opinion/thepoint#vance-winning-debate" data-source-id="100000009735604"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ross-douthat"><img alt="Ross Douthat" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/ross-douthat/ross-douthat-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/ross-douthat/ross-douthat-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/ross-douthat/ross-douthat-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-02T02:06:58.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 1, 2024, 10:06 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The first half of the vice-presidential debate has been the strongest illustration in this campaign so far of why it made sense for Donald Trump to pick JD Vance as his running mate. The Ohio senator is delivering one of the best debating performances by a Republican nominee for president or vice president in recent memory and making a case for Trump’s record far more effectively than Trump has ever been capable of doing.</p><p>Vance’s performance has included a dose of self-conscious humanization, an attempted reintroduction to his blue-collar background and striking personal biography after weeks of effective Democratic attacks on his right-wing podcast commentary. It’s included some careful rhetorical tap dancing and policy jujitsu on issues like climate change and abortion. But mostly it’s just been an effective prosecution of the case against the Biden-Harris administration, focusing relentlessly on encouraging viewers to be nostalgic for the economy, the immigration landscape and the relative foreign-policy calm of Trump’s term.</p><p>Tim Walz, on the other hand, seems affable, well meaning and, relative to Vance, largely out of his depth. He’s spending too much time partly agreeing with his rival while making a much more haphazard case against Trump than Vance is making against Kamala Harris.</p><p>I think one question raised by this performance so far is why the Harris campaign has basically kept Walz away from one-on-one interviews while Vance has been out there dealing with hostile questions from Day 1 of his candidacy. It feels as though the Minnesota governor would have benefited immensely from spending some more time being grilled on the Sunday shows before he was sent out to do battle with a Republican vice-presidential nominee, who, whatever his other weaknesses, clearly knows how to debate.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RiOTA5NjI3LWY1ODctNTU5MS05YmRkLWYwNTUyMzJiODdiYQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/02/opinion/thepoint#adams-punishment-campaign-finance" data-source-id="100000009732300"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-01T20:56:51.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 1, 2024, 4:56 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Last week, Mayor Eric Adams of New York was accused by federal prosecutors of fraudulently obtaining matching funds from the city for illegal campaign contributions. On Thursday, Councilman Lincoln Restler of Brooklyn, the chair of the </em><a href="https://council.nyc.gov/committees/governmental-operations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Committee on Governmental Operations</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://x.com/LincolnRestler/status/1839387442887208993" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>wrote to the city’s Campaign Finance Board</em></a><em>, urging that Adams be removed from the finance program. Restler explains why in this interview, which has been edited.</em></p><p><strong>Q: It’s striking that Adams is accused of abusing the very system designed to keep big money out of city politics.</strong></p><p>A: The New York City campaign finance system is nationally renowned. It has been a model for cities and states around the country to democratize our elections, to allow for immigrant New Yorkers and low- and moderate-income New Yorkers to run for public office and serve in the most powerful positions in our city. Our campaign finance system has leveled the playing field and meant that it’s not just those who are connected to the rich and powerful who are in the key elected offices.</p><p><strong>To what extent is the city’s campaign finance system based on the ability to trust candidates?</strong></p><p>Fortunately, we have seen the contributions move in overwhelming numbers to an online donation system where it’s much easier to verify the identity of the donor. But I’ve introduced legislation that would require certain types of donations — cash donations, for example — to require additional verification of the donor by the Campaign Finance Board. There are certain types of donations where we see fraud much more commonly taking place, including on Mayor Adams’s campaign, and we need greater oversight and accountability of those donations to preserve public trust in our very generous taxpayer-funded matching system.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lincoln Restler.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Roy Rochlin/Getty Images For Emirates And Us</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>What can the Campaign Finance Board do to a candidate who has lied to the city and cheated the system?</strong></p><p>These donations to Eric Adams from Turkish corporations and foreign agents and straw donors were flagged by the Campaign Finance Board during the 2021 campaign and he ignored all requests for information and documentation. There has to be meaningful accountability, and if you cheat the system as he has, you can’t continue to take taxpayer-funded dollars.</p><p>The integrity of our campaign finance system is at stake in how the C.F.B. holds Eric Adams accountable right now. If Eric Adams cheats the system repeatedly in the most flagrant ways and then continues to receive millions of dollars in taxpayer funding for his re-election campaign, what message does that send to every future candidate who’s intent on undermining the rules? I am hopeful that the decent people who run the C.F.B. will protect the credibility and reputation of our campaign finance system, and hold the mayor accountable and kick him out of our matching fund system once and for all.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE2ZWE1N2E5LTI1NTAtNTFkOC05NjUxLWU0ZjVkZjQxMGQ2Zg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/02/opinion/thepoint#iran-attack-israel" data-source-id="100000009733753"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-l-friedman"><img alt="Thomas L.

The Israeli antimissile system shot down almost all of them, Israeli sources said, and while there was some damage the attack was not considered particularly successful. There are no reports at this time of extensive casualties.</em></p><p><em>The attack was executed by the Air Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and was not an operation of the regular Iranian army or air force, according to Israeli sources. The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, was not informed of the attack until shortly before it began, the sources said, indicating that the Iranian regime is divided over the operation, which will probably add to the fractures in the government.</em></p><p><em>Israel’s ability to anticipate the Iranian strike and name the precise hour of the attack, and the fact that it was a revolutionary guards operation — not the regular Iranian armed forces under the command of the new president — demonstrates how deeply the Mossad, Israel’s cyber command, Unit 8200, and the Israeli Air Force have penetrated the Iranian regime and coordinated their defensive response. It means no Iranian leader can trust another anymore.</em></p><p>We may be about to enter what could be the most dangerous moment in the history of the modern Middle East: a ballistic missile war between Iran and Israel, which would almost certainly bring in the United States on Israel’s side and could culminate in a full-blown U.S.-Israeli effort to destroy Iran’s nuclear program.</p><p>That is the assessment I have gleaned from talking to Israeli intelligence sources, whose analysis is that Iran plans to launch a missile attack against Israel at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time, which is 7:30 p.m. in Israel. The attack is planned in two waves 15 minutes apart, and each wave will involve 110 ballistic missiles, the Israelis said.</p><p>The Iranian missiles are aimed at three targets. First, the headquarters of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service, near Tel Aviv. Second, the Israeli air base at Nevatim, and third, the Israeli air base at Khatzirim; both bases are in the south of Israel in the Negev Desert. The Israeli officials are particularly concerned about any strike on Mossad headquarters because it is in the densely populated north Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon. It is also not far from the Israeli defense intelligence headquarters, Unit 8200.</p><p>This information has been shared with me because the Israelis insist that they do not want a full-scale ballistic war with Iran, and want the United States to try to deter the Iranians by letting them know that if they do launch this missile attack, the United States will not be a bystander, and its response, unlike with the April 13 Iranian missile and drone attack on Israel, will not be purely defensive. In other words, Iran could be risking its entire nuclear program if this missile attack goes ahead.</p><p>I have not been able to speak to any senior U.S. officials to gauge their reactions, but will update this blog post as I do.</p><p>One might think that Israel is itching for this kind of war with Iran to finally take out its nuclear program and involve the United States. That is not my impression. A war of ballistic missiles could do enormous damage to Israel’s infrastructure unless virtually every missile is intercepted.</p><p>Could the Iranians be bluffing and intending to land the missiles in open areas in Israel? That is not the impression the Israelis have gleaned from their intelligence.</p><p>The Israeli intelligence assessment is that the Iranian people by and large do not want this war with Israel. There has long been discontent in Iran over the billions of dollars the regime has spent supporting Hamas and Hezbollah at a time when Iranian infrastructure is so dilapidated and the country’s economy is on its back. The message the Israelis hope the U.S. can convey to Iran is also that if they start this war and it leads to great destruction and death of Iranian civilians, it could also trigger an uprising against the regime.</p><p>In the last year we have seen red lines crossed left and right — from the savage Hamas onslaught on Israel on Oct. 7 to the Israeli pager attack against Hezbollah’s leadership and the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The Iranians feel their deterrence has been eroded and need to respond.</p><p>This is Code Red time. Because once you start crossing red lines, they all disappear.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzViMGViZjcwLWNlNmMtNTI0Yy04YjZmLTE5NzAyNzViM2NhYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/02/opinion/thepoint#california-legacy-admissions" data-source-id="100000009732059"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/pamela-paul"><img alt="Pamela Paul" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-01T09:03:40.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 1, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Madison/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Every time California takes a big step on education, you have to brace yourself: Is this going to lead the country in the right direction, as it did with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/02/magazine/the-class-of-prop-209.html" title="">eliminating racial preferences</a> in college admissions in the ’90s?

Asked in private, they will admit to what everyone already knows: Legacies are about money. Wealthy alumni often give to their alma mater with the tacit expectation that it will propel their borderline offspring over the finish line to Ivy League admission. It amounts to a significant source of fund-raising.</p><p>In other words, legacy admissions stand in opposition to ideals that most selective colleges and universities profess to espouse: Education as a force for social and cultural progress. Equality of opportunity and American egalitarianism. A significant driver of social and economic mobility for first-generation college students.</p><p>Some have referred to legacy admissions as “<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/6/30/23778906/affirmative-action-white-applicants-legacy-athletic-recruitment" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">white affirmative action</a>” and believe its elimination <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/9/22/harvard-without-legacy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could help foster</a> racial, ethnic and economic diversity.

After he rode down the Trump Tower escalator, I needed some relief and found it by returning to the library. For the next five years, I found that turning the pages of the Carter documents brushed away some of the Trump toxins.</p><p>As Carter celebrates his 100th birthday on Tuesday, we shouldn’t think of him as a saint. No politician is humble and self-effacing. But Carter is a global humanitarian icon, a moral exemplar and the ultimate un-Trump.</p><p>The two former presidents know each other only slightly. In the early 1980s, Carter traveled to Trump Tower and asked Trump to contribute to the Carter Center. Trump said he respected Carter’s “nerve and guts” in asking for $5 million but gave him nothing. After Trump was elected, Carter, at age 93, hoped Trump would dispatch him to North Korea and offered Trump advice on dealing with China. But Trump predictably began trashing Carter, who later concluded that Trump “was put into office through Russian efforts.”</p><p>The contrast could not be starker. Trump is corrupt, chaotic and vulgar; Carter is honest, disciplined and respectful. Trump is a physically big man who acts small; Carter is a physically small man who acts big. Trump appeals to the worst in us; Carter to the best in us.</p><p>Trump is a nationalist and an authoritarian. Carter is an internationalist and devoted to the promotion of democracy. Trump has told thousands of well-documented lies; Carter promised in his 1976 campaign not to lie to the American people and — despite plenty of exaggerations — never did.</p><p>Trump’s a grifter who is selling gold watches; Carter’s an uplifter who lives in a modest home in Plains, Ga. Trump thinks he’s really smart; Carter actually is. Trump is on wife No. 3 and was found liable for sexual assault; Carter was married for 77 years and lusted only in his heart.</p><p>Trump refused to release his tax returns; Carter originated the practice. Trump botched his handling of the Covid pandemic; Carter (with the help of his wife, Rosalynn) convinced most states to require vaccination before children can enter school and has spent his post-presidency eradicating diseases and otherwise advancing global health.</p><p>Even the superficial similarities don’t bear scrutiny. Both Trump and Carter used racial code words in the past. But while Trump ditched dog whistles in favor of rank racism, Carter compensated for his absence from the civil rights movement by beginning the effort to bring diversity to the federal government. Both have been criticized for cozying up to dictators. But while Trump does it because the strongmen flatter him and share their tips on autocratic rule, Carter met often with dictators to broker peace, free political prisoners and — in Nicaragua and Haiti — persuade them to do what Trump would not: peacefully transfer power.</p><p>Carter recently told his grandson that he wants to stay alive so he can vote for Kamala Harris. Let’s hope his core decency and moral courage can help light our way forward in a direction that would make him proud.</p><p><em>Jonathan Alter is the author of “</em><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/His-Very-Best/Jonathan-Alter/9781501125546" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life</em></a><em>.”</em></p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdmMWU0NDlhLTUzZGMtNWY2Mi1iYzY1LWUxNDY1Mzc0NWJmNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/02/opinion/thepoint#stevie-nicks-abortion-song" data-source-id="100000009729380"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/frank-bruni"><img alt="Frank Bruni" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/frank-bruni/frank-bruni-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/frank-bruni/frank-bruni-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/frank-bruni/frank-bruni-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-30T09:06:31.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 30, 2024, 5:06 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stevie Nicks in Brooklyn in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chad Batka for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>I’ve spent many contented decades listening to Stevie Nicks sing about gypsies, witches and white-winged doves, her gossamer lyrics and onstage twirls imported from some dream world gloriously estranged from the real one.</p><p>So I was jolted, to say the least, by her new song about abortion.</p><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJDCYh5iWQs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It’s called “The Lighthouse,” <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/stevie-nicks-new-song-the-lighthouse-womens-rights-listen-1235786229/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it came out Friday</a> and it doesn’t specifically mention the medical procedure.

And in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAaAyr0tqcc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">written statement</a> released with the song, Nicks explained that she wrote it in response to the repeal of Roe v. Wade, as a rallying cry for women.</p><p>“This is an anthem,” she said.</p><p>It’s also an emblem — of a furious era in which even unlikely recruits are pulled into the political fray and politics spills into entertainment in ever odder and more frequent ways.</p><p>On the musical front, the most obvious example is Taylor Swift, whose romance with Travis Kelce has been cast as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/us/politics/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-trump.html" title="">some kind of liberal political plot</a>, whose image was used by Donald Trump in a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-taylor-swift-fake-endorsement-ai-fec99c412d960932839e3eab8d49fd5f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media post that falsely claimed</a> that she’d endorsed him, and whose backing of Kamala Harris three weeks ago ended many months of speculation about when and how Swift would make her feelings about the 2024 election explicit. That she’d do so was considered an inevitability, although <a href="https://www.billboard.com/lists/taylor-swift-politics-timeline/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">before 2018, Swift floated above politics</a>.</p><p>Such floating is harder and harder. In just the past week, music megastars as different as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/arts/music/janet-jackson-kamala-harris-apology.html" title="">Janet Jackson</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/arts/music/chappell-roan-cancels-festival.html" title="">Chappell Roan</a> ended up in the middle of stories about the presidential campaign. Roan canceled gigs in New York and Maryland after being savaged online for her comments about finding fault with both the Democratic and Republican Parties. In mid-September, Linda Ronstadt <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/linda-ronstadt-donald-trump-toxic-politics.html" title="">felt compelled</a> to issue a statement denouncing Trump and endorsing Harris after she learned that a Tucson, Ariz., <a href="https://www.tucsonsymphony.org/plan-your-visit/linda-ronstadt-music-hall/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">music hall</a> named after her was being used for a Trump rally.</p><p>Now comes Nicks, 76, with a new song inspired by … the Supreme Court.
