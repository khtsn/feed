    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><div id="in-story-masthead"><div><p><span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/newsletters">Briefing</a></span><span>|</span><span>Trump Backed Down on China Tariffs</span></p><div><p><span>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/briefing/trump-china-tariffs-sean-combs-trial.html</span></p></div></div></div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The U.S. and China announced today <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/china-us-tariffs.html" title="">that they were temporarily reducing the triple-digit tariffs</a> that had shaken the global economy. For the next 90 days, imports from China are set to face a minimum fee of 30 percent, down from 145 percent. American goods will be subject to a 10 percent tariff in China, down from 125 percent.</p><p>U.S. officials described the agreement as an attempt to defuse an escalating confrontation that had essentially halted trade between the world’s two largest economies. “We concluded that we have a shared interest,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. Both sides agreed to more talks in search of a more permanent arrangement. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/business/us-china-trade-stock-market.html" title="">Stock markets surged</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/economy/trump-trade-china-tariffs.html" title="">The deal also illustrated the limitations</a> of President Trump’s aggressive tariffs. He had defended them to Americans as a short period of financial pain in return for a stronger economy in the long run. But it is so far unclear if Trump’s decision to impose, and then walk back, sky-high tariffs on Chinese products — which forced companies in both countries to alter their strategies and contemplate bankruptcy — will end up resulting in any major concessions from China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Edan Alexander was reunited with his parents in south Israel today. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Israeli Government, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-52d3dc39">Hamas released an American hostage ahead of Trump’s trip</h2><p>Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage held by Hamas in Gaza, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/middleeast/edan-alexander-israel-hamas-hostage-released.html" title="">was released today</a> in a deal that largely circumvented Israeli officials. Hamas portrayed it as an attempt to secure U.S. support for an end to the war in Gaza.</p><p>Trump, whose administration pressured the Palestinian militant group to release Alexander, left this morning for a visit to the Middle East. The four-day swing through Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates is the first major overseas trip of his second term. And the president is in search of one thing above all else: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-middle-east-visit-saudi-arabia-qatar-uae.html" title="">business deals</a>.</p><p>Trump is expected to use America’s dominance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/economy/trump-middle-east-trip-semiconductor-deals.html" title="">over A.I. chips as leverage</a> to extract U.S. investment commitments from governments in the Gulf region. He is pushing Saudi leaders to invest $1 trillion — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-investment.html" title="">a sum that economists say is unrealistic</a> because it is equivalent to Saudi Arabia’s annual gross domestic product.</p><p>The Qataris went to great lengths to court Trump. The president is poised to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family to be used as a new Air Force One, possibly the biggest foreign gift ever received by the U.S. government. The plan raises substantial ethical issues, but Trump said today that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-qatar-plane-jet.html" title="">only a “stupid person” would turn down such an offer</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Governor Gavin Newsom helped clear out a homeless encampment in Los Angeles in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-46c4b61">Newsom asked cities to ban homeless encampments</h2><p>Gov.

They accused him of orchestrating drug-fueled sex marathons called “freak-offs” and of using his vast wealth to try to cover them up.</p><p>The jury <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/12/arts/sean-combs-diddy-trial" title="">heard explicit testimony</a> from a man who said he was paid to have sex with Combs’s former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, in front of the music mogul.</p><p>If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers argued in court today that he was “flawed” and violent, but that his behavior did not amount to racketeering and sex trafficking.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-55bd377a">More top news</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Air travel: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/newark-airport-delays-staffing-shortage.html" title="">Staffing shortages forced more delays</a> at Newark Liberty International Airport.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vatican: </strong>Pope Leo XIV used his first audience with the media to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/europe/pope-leo-vatican-journalists.html" title="">call for the release of journalists who had been imprisoned for their work</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Russia:</strong> E.U. leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/europe/russia-ukraine-putin-ceasefire.html" title="">threatened new sanctions on Moscow</a> if it did not accept an unconditional cease-fire by the end of the day.</p></li><li><p><strong>South Asia: </strong>Civilian flights were returning to normal, and stocks jumped in India and Pakistan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/asia/india-pakistan-cease-fire-extended.html" title="">signs that their cease-fire could continue</a> beyond the weekend.</p></li><li><p><strong>New York City: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/nyregion/cuomo-denied-matching-funds.html" title="">Former Gov.
