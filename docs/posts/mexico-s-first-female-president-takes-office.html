At times, she pulled away from his policies. During the pandemic, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/05/world/americas/mexico-mayor-amlo-sheinbaum.html" title="">she tested aggressively</a> while he trusted in good-luck charms; when fighting crime, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-organized-crime-us-assistance-a8e9d15c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she invested in intelligence and the police</a> while he relied on the military.</p><p>But during the campaign, she supported many of Mr. López Obrador’s most contentious policies, including a slate of constitutional changes that critics say would severely undermine democratic checks and balances. As a result, the new president has battled the perception among some Mexicans that she could be little more than a pawn of her mentor.</p><p>In her own words, Ms. Sheinbaum has said she represents a new direction for Mexico but remains true to the values of Mr. López Obrador and the governing Morena party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“It is change because I am a different person, because I am a woman, because I was born in Mexico City, because I am a scientist,” Ms. Sheinbaum <a href="https://youtu.be/ePcvgpngcFI?si=m00VMIlnIXgILWMh" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a recent video message. “But there is no change in principles.”</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers securing the perimeter of a clandestine fentanyl lab that the Sinaloa cartel is suspected of operating in Lomas del Valle, Mexico.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Meridith Kohut for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-2b595926">What challenges will she confront?</h2><p>Ms. Sheinbaum will face pressure to show progress in the fight against increasingly powerful drug cartels, which retain their sway over large swaths of Mexico. While homicides declined modestly during the López Obrador administration, reports of extortion and disappearances have shot up since 2018. Killings, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/world/americas/violence-mexico-killings.html" title="">spates of mass murders</a>, are still near the highest levels recorded. And once peaceful regions, such as the southern state of Chiapas, have witnessed massive displacements caused by the invasion of organized crime.</p><p>In recent weeks, violence between warring factions of the Sinaloa Cartel has caused a spike in deaths and kidnappings in northwest Mexico, bringing people’s lives to a standstill in cities such as Culiacán.</p><p>Ms. Sheinbaum will have little financial maneuvering room to fulfill her campaign pledges. Mexico’s budget deficit is nearing 6 percent of gross domestic product, the largest shortfall in the past 24 years. Pemex, the state-controlled oil giant, is now the world’s most indebted oil company, requiring multibillion-dollar bailouts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>And, experts say, it will be up to Ms. Sheinbaum to deal with the consequences of the constitutional amendments that Mr. López Obrador pushed through in the last weeks of his administration. Critics warn that one of them, under which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/world/americas/mexico-courts-overhaul-states-approve.html" title="">thousands of judges are to be elected by popular vote</a> as soon as next year, could erode judicial independence.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-14"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-2bcf214e">What are her plans?</h2><p>Besides continuing Mr. López Obrador’s infrastructure projects and keeping his popular antipoverty programs, including a yearly increase in the minimum wage, Ms. Sheinbaum comes to office with her own plans.</p><p>She has announced that all women ages 60 to 64 will receive a cash payment; currently, old-age pensions are given to anyone 65 and older. She has said most children will receive a stay-in-school scholarship, which would be an expansion of a current social program. And starting next year, she said, 20,000 doctors and nurses would begin visiting the homes of senior Mexicans — an effort to reverse the <a href="https://mexicocomovamos.mx/publicaciones/2023/08/pobreza-en-2022#:~:text=Pobreza%20en%202022%20menor%20que,salud%20%E2%80%93%20M%C3%A9xico%20%C2%BFc%C3%B3mo%20vamos%3F&amp;text=De%20acuerdo%20con%20los%20datos,puntos%20porcentuales%20respecto%20a%202018." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">massive drop</a> in access to public health care seen in the past few years.</p><p>Unlike her predecessor, Ms. Sheinbaum also wants to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/climate/claudia-sheinbaum-climate-scientist-mexico.html" title="">expand renewable energy infrastructure</a> and increase green technology. At the same time, she has vowed to rescue Mexico’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/world/americas/mexico-oil-sheinbaum-pemex.html" title="">massively indebted oil company</a> and support a costly $16 billion oil refinery that remains far from fully operational.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Then there’s security. Ms. Sheinbaum has signaled she will allow the armed forces to keep the power Mr. López Obrador granted them during his administration. But she also plans to create a new intelligence agency, with the ability to investigate criminal cases, and replicate the law-and-order approach she adopted in Mexico City.</p><p>Two other innovations, which both critics and supporters have applauded — her elevation of the national women’s institute and Mexico’s science agency to ministries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador at the National Palace in Mexico City last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-6e2f32aa">What will her relationship to the U.S. look like?</h2><p>A real test for Ms. Sheinbaum’s leadership might come later this year once the outcome of the U.S. presidential election becomes clear.</p><p>A victory by Vice President Kamala Harris would likely represent an extension of the Biden administration’s relationship with Mexico, which has been marked by a tense yet sustained cooperation to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/americas/mexico-biden-migration-border.html" title="">beef up migration enforcement</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/27/us/biden-trump-debate/mexico-is-working-with-us-to-make-sure-they-dont-have-the-technology-to-be-able-to-put-it-together?smid=url-share" title="">counter drug trafficking</a> and <a href="https://mx.usembassy.gov/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administrations-ongoing-efforts-to-stem-firearms-trafficking-to-mexico/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stanch the flow of U.S. guns</a> that are fueling bloodshed south of the border. And some American officials have said privately that they believe security coordination <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/world/americas/mexico-sheinbaum-us.html" title="">could improve</a> with Ms. Sheinbaum.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>But a second term by former President Donald J. Trump could ratchet up tensions between the two countries. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs if he wins the election. And he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/us/politics/trump-mexico-cartels-republican.html" title="">proposed using U.S. military force</a> against the drug cartels on Mexican soil — without the consent of Mexico’s government.</p><p>The plans risk rupturing the United States’ relationship with the Sheinbaum administration and curtailing other types of cooperation. Still, Ms. Sheinbaum and members of her government have told The New York Times that she is prepared to work with whichever candidate wins the U.S. election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A young Sheinbaum supporter in Mexico City on election night in June.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fred Ramos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><h2 id="link-c38a2f2">What does a female president mean for Mexico?</h2><p>Ms. Sheinbaum’s victory has given hope to many Mexican women, but it has also disillusioned others who say her feminist statements contrast with her pledge to protect her predecessor’s vision.</p><p>Although Mr. López Obrador embraced gender parity and women’s rights — his cabinet had more women than any other before it — he often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/world/americas/violence-women-mexico-president.html" title="">dismissed record-high levels of violence</a> against women.
