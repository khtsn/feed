Looking for American researchers.</p><p>As President Trump cuts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/business/trump-science-funding-cuts-economy.html" title="">billions of federal dollars</a> from science institutes and universities, restricts what can be studied and pushes out immigrants, rival nations are hoping to pick up talent that has been cast aside or become disenchanted.</p><p>For decades, trying to compete with American institutions and companies has been difficult. The United States was a magnet for top researchers, scientists and academics. In general, budgets were bigger, pay was bigger, labs and equipment were bigger. So were ambitions.</p><p>In 2024, the United States spent nearly $1 trillion — roughly 3.5 percent of total economic output — on research and development. When it came to the kind of long-term <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20243/discovery-u-s-and-global-r-d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">basic research</a> that underpins American technological and scientific advancements, the government accounted for about <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf24332" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">40 percent</a> of the spending.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>That’s the reason political, education and business leaders in advanced countries and emerging economies have long fretted over a brain drain from their own shores. Now they are seizing a chance to reverse the flow.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In 2024, the United States invested nearly $1 trillion in research and development.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hilary Swift for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This is a once-in-a-century brain gain opportunity,” the Australian Strategic Policy Institute <a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/tag/technology/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declared</a>, as it encouraged its government to act.</p><p>Last week, at the urging of more than a dozen members, the European Union announced it would spend an additional <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/europe/eu-us-scientists-trump.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">500 million euros</a>, or $556 million, over the next two years to “make Europe a magnet for researchers.”</p><p>Such a sum is paltry when compared with U.S. budgets. So it’s understandable if their appeals are met with a request to “show me the money.”</p><p>After all, <a href="https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/content_migration/document/RAPPORT_FINAL_GT2_Attractivite_des_emplois_et_des_carrieres_1178464.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">salaries tend to be much lower</a> in Europe. In France, for example, a 35-year-old researcher can expect to earn around €3,600 (about $4,000) a month before taxes, according to the <a href="https://publication.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/eesr/FR/T512/les_salaires_des_personnels_des_epscp_et_des_epst/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">French Education and Research ministry</a>.

Of 1,600 people who responded to a March poll in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00938-y" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">journal Nature</a> — many of them Ph.D. or postdoctoral students in the United States — three out of four said they were considering leaving the country because of the Trump administration’s policies.</p><p>And Europe’s more generous social safety net can make up for a large part of the salary differential, said Patrick Lemaire, the president of the College de Sociétés Savantes Académiques de France, an arm of an international council that represents about 50,000 academics in France.</p><p>“There is much less money in Europe, and the salaries are much lower,” he said. “But you also have very good social security and health care, which is free; school and university tuition are free.”</p><p>Here are some of the pitches offered by countries and universities around the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The University of Paris-Saclay is establishing five new positions for American researchers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anne-Christine Poujoulat/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h3 id="link-67438c1"><span><strong>France</strong></span></h3><p>In addition to the European Union, France pledged to put cash on the table last week.

In Denmark, we value science. We believe in facts.” He said the chamber and the society of engineers were asking to fast-track 200 positions for researchers over the next three years.
