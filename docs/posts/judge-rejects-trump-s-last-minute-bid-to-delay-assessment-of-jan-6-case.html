Trump’s lawyers to push off until after November an assessment of whether the indictment accusing Mr. Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election can survive the Supreme Court’s ruling granting him broad immunity from prosecution.</p><p>In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258148/gov.uscourts.dcd.258148.243.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a brief order</a>, the judge, Tanya S. Chutkan, said that by Thursday evening, the special counsel, Jack Smith, should file his written presentation about why the Supreme Court’s immunity decision should not lead to the dismissal of the charges he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/politics/trump-indictment-election-jan-6.html" title="">brought against Mr. Trump in a revised indictment last month</a>.</p><p>Moreover, the judge granted Mr. Smith’s request to have that presentation, which will be filed under seal and therefore not publicly accessible, run as long as 180 pages.</p><p>Nearly half of those pages, Mr. Smith’s deputies have said in court papers, would contain detailed evidence — from things like grand jury testimony and F.B.I. interviews — about how Mr. Trump’s attempts to overturn the election are fair game despite the Supreme Court ruling, which granted him significant protections for official acts he took as president. Mr. Smith’s team is arguing that Mr. Trump’s efforts were undertaken in his private role as a candidate seeking office, not in his protected role as a president performing official duties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The election interference case — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/trump-investigations-charges-indictments.html" title="">one of four prosecutions</a> Mr. Trump has faced in the past two years — has been bogged down in the debate about presidential immunity for nearly a year. But the current ordeal of sorting out which parts of the indictment can survive and which will have to be tossed out began only after the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-immunity.html" title="">issued its opinion in July</a> granting Mr. Trump significant protections for official acts he undertook as president.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s lawyers had initially tried to delay the process of applying the immunity ruling to his case at a hearing in Federal District Court in Washington this month. At the hearing, they suggested that surfacing evidence behind the charges would be unfair to the former president with the election looming.</p><p>Even though Judge Chutkan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/05/us/trump-election-interference-hearing" title="">rejected those concerns in the courtroom</a>, the lawyers tried to raise them again in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/us/politics/trump-jan-6-case-chutkan.html" title="">an unusual filing late last week</a> — and then for a third time on Monday in yet another filing, ostensibly meant to complain about the length of Mr. Smith’s own submission.</p><p>But in her order on Tuesday, Judge Chutkan swatted the argument away once more, reiterating her position that she was not going to let a presidential campaign affect her handling of Mr. Trump’s criminal case.</p><p>“Defendant’s concern with the political consequences of these proceedings does not bear on the pretrial schedule,” she wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In seeking to delay the immunity assessment, Mr. Trump’s lawyers had essentially accused Mr. Smith of using his upcoming filing as a way to sneak potentially damaging new information about Mr. Trump into the public record in the homestretch of the election.</p><p>The lawyers said that Mr. Smith’s lengthy immunity brief was “tantamount to a premature and improper special counsel report” — the sort of document that all special counsels are required to submit at the conclusion of their work.</p><p>But Judge Chutkan rejected these arguments too, dismissively noting that she “need not address the substance of those claims.”</p><p>In the short run, Mr. Trump will not have to worry about Mr. Smith’s filing causing him any political problems because the special counsel has already said he intends to file his brief — and its numerous factual exhibits — under seal.</p><p>Parts of the filing could eventually become public — perhaps even before voters go to the polls. But it will be up to Judge Chutkan, in consultation with the defense and prosecution, to determine how much, if any, new information about Mr. Trump will be revealed in the papers and when those revelations will be made.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
