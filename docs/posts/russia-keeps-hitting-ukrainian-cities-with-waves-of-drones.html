Debris rained down over businesses and apartment buildings, sparking several fires.</p><p>Though air-defense teams have limited the casualties in Kyiv — one 14-year-old girl was killed in October and more than 20 people injured, officials said — the Russians continue to unleash punishing bombardments with drones, bombs and missiles on other towns and cities across the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian soldiers rely on machine guns to shoot down enemy drones.

He also called for tougher sanctions that would prevent Russia from importing critical components for its drone and missile production.</p><p>“Ukraine deserves the same strong security as all our partners in the free world,” he said.</p><p>As Kyiv continues to plead with its allies to provide more sophisticated air-defense systems, scores of air-defense teams using heavy guns and other weapons form a chain stretching to the Russian border to combat drones as they fly in from Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It’s like bees swarming from a hive in spring to gather honey,” Senior Pvt. Yurii, 37, the leader of mobile air-defense team with the 27th Brigade of National Guard, said at the end of a 16-hour shift. Russia had directed 96 drones at targets across the country during that time.</p><p>“If we make visual or acoustic contact, we open fire,” he said, providing only his first name according to military protocol. “We use as much ammunition as we have. If we can’t handle it alone, we call for backup and another unit joins us.”</p><p>In recent weeks, he and other soldiers said, the Russians have been flying drones low to evade radar detection, frequently changing course to confuse air-defense teams, using decoy drones with no warheads to overwhelm defenses and sending surveillance drones along with strike drones to gather intelligence.</p><p>It takes about 50 rounds fired from the team’s Turkish-made Browning machine gun to take down an Iranian-style Shaheed drone, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In a nearby field, golden ears of corn torn from their husks lay scattered among the broken and blackened stalks and the debris from a drone his team brought down in early October — a testament to the drones’ destructive power even when they are shot out of the sky.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ukrainian corn field showing damage and debris from a drone.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A woman who gave only her first name, Khrystyna, and who lives on the 15th floor of an apartment building in downtown Kyiv, said she heard the distinctive whir of a strike drone drawing closer before dawn one recent day, like a moped speeding in her direction.</p><p>“We started getting ready to run out, and within literally five to 10 seconds, there was an explosion,” she said.</p><p>She had managed to get to an interior room before the drone crashed into her home, she said, most likely saving her life.</p><p>“My room was completely burned out,” she said, as she looked up at the charred remains of her home.</p><p>Andriy Kovalenko, a senior government official focused on Russian disinformation operations, said Moscow was seeking to use “around the clock” drone attacks to exhaust Ukraine’s air-defense systems, as well as to collect intelligence and “exert constant psychological pressure on the population in order to break the motivation to resist.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The drone strikes are also most likely a prelude to the kind of large-scale saturation attacks using missiles and drones that have been a feature of the war, according to Ukrainian officials.</p><p>The stepped-up drone assaults are part of a deadly and unrelenting campaign that has been playing out for years as the Russians continue to try to batter Ukrainians into submission. The Kremlin is using not just drones, but also nearly every conventional weapon in its arsenal to hit both military and civilian targets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An apartment in Kyiv sustained damage in a drone strike on Saturday.

More than a dozen <a href="https://ukraine.ohchr.org/en/Attacks-in-Odesa-Cause-Civilian-Harm-Amid-Rising-Monthly-Casualty-Numbers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">people were killed</a> in the strikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>At least six people were killed and 16 more injured on Tuesday morning in a missile strike in Zaporizhzhia, in southern Ukraine, according to local officials.</p><p>And in Kherson, Russian soldiers are hunting Ukrainian civilians with small piloted drones laden with explosives, according to local officials.

Private Yurii said that instead of combating Russian attacks one drone or missile at a time, Ukraine ultimately must find a way to take out the Russian weapons at their source.</p><p>He recalled how his team once worked 16-hour shifts for 42 days without a break.</p><p>“They wear us down this way,” he said. “When people don’t get enough sleep, after a while, their efficiency drops.”</p><p>Some missile and drone attacks have had specific targets, like power plants and substations. But Private Yurii said it was not always clear now what the drones were aiming at. Regardless, the Russians are forcing Ukrainian air-defense teams to stay on constant alert, a key part of their strategy, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“They just fly around in circles, sometimes without even a warhead, just a dummy drone, to exhaust resources,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Municipal workers cleaning an apartment in Kyiv that was damaged in a drone strike.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The constant attacks cannot help but take a toll on both soldiers and civilians.</p><p>“Only a fool wouldn’t be afraid,” Private Yurii said.
