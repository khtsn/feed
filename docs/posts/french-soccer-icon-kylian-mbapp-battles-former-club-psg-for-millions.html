And for a while it was.</p><p>Kylian Mbappé was the star attraction that France’s premier team, Paris Saint-Germain, planned to build around for years to come. Its owners, an arm of the Qatari government, brought him back to Paris from Monaco in 2017 for about $200 million, a record deal for a teenager, and at the time the second-highest fee ever in soccer.</p><p>Goals were scored, trophies were secured, Mbappé became one of the most famous athletes in the world, and the bond between player and club was forged. Then came the trouble.</p><p>Mbappé, now 26, had since childhood dreamed of playing for Spain’s Real Madrid — soccer royalty — and his chance came in 2022 with his contract expiring. Ultimately, he stayed put, but only after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/21/sports/soccer/mbappe-psg-real-madrid.html" title="">a herculean effort</a> that involved cajoling by President Emmanuel Macron of France and what the club claims was the richest contract in European soccer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But just as quickly as things fell into place, they started to unravel. Mbappé left Paris after just two seasons, a year earlier than his deal had been widely understood to run. His move unleashed a bitter and protracted legal dispute, with Mbappé accusing his former club of harassment and demanding it pay him 55 million euros (about $61 million) he says he is owed. Paris Saint-Germain, in turn, has refused to pay, saying Mbappé had a verbal agreement, to cede that money and leave on good terms, with the team’s president and Qatar’s emissary to global soccer, Nasser al-Khelaifi.</p><p>The disagreement provides a rare public glimpse of the global market for soccer talent, pitting one of the world’s most prominent and influential athletes against a small but powerful and resource-rich Persian Gulf country. Qatar has emerged over the past decade as one of the biggest players in global sports, using its investments to raise its profile and hosting the 2022 World Cup.</p><p>At an unusual news conference on Thursday in Paris, lawyers for Mbappé said they had escalated their case, filing complaints in multiple venues. They asked a court to partially freeze P.S.G. bank accounts for the money their client believes he is owed and petitioned the French soccer federation to block the team from playing in the elite Champions League.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mbappé’s lawyers Frederique Cassereau, Delphine Verheyden, Thomas Clay and Pierre-Olivier Sur during a news conference in Paris on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Franck Fife/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“The club is not above the law and the law is on the side of the player,” said Thomas Clay, one of Mbappé’s lawyers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Paris Saint-Germain dismissed the claims as the “latest parallel universe of fanciful storytelling.”</p><h2 id="link-1392af26">A stinging rift</h2><p>After becoming the player P.S.G. believed it would build its team around, Mbappé’s resolve to remain in Paris proved short-lived. The lure of Madrid, the power of childhood dreams, proved too big to resist.</p><p>Within a year of re-signing with P.S.G., Mbappé informed the team that he wanted to leave as a free agent, declining to exercise an option to stay for a third season. It was an especially difficult revelation for fans, because when Mbappé had agreed in 2022 to stay with the team, he wore a jersey with 2025 on the back to signify the year the option ran through. Many assumed that meant he was committing to the team for three years.</p><p>Mbappé’s departure in 2024 deprived P.S.G. not just of a generational talent but also the opportunity to claw back the 180 million euros it had originally paid his former team to bring him to Paris in 2017.</p><p>The team tried to work out a deal with Mbappé. They asked him to consider two options, both that would allow him to leave but also keep the team from losing so much money.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Under the first, Mbappé would sign a contract extension that included a guaranteed sale should another club that he wanted to play for — obviously, Real Madrid — pay a nine-figure fee; the second involved Mbappé committing to waive tens of millions of euros in salary and bonus commitments, amounting to 55 million euros, to leave as a free agent on good terms.</p><p>Contracts were drawn up, but nothing signed, and P.S.G. has described the offering of the two options as a “gentlemen’s agreement” between Mbappé and al-Khelaifi.</p><p>The deal quickly devolved into dispute. Mbappé accused P.S.G. of harassment after he declared he wanted to leave, including leaving him home for a preseason tour. P.S.G. questioned Mbappé’s integrity because the letter he eventually sent to the club declining the option for a third season was dated July 2022, just weeks after he had recommitted to the team.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Paris Saint-Germain’s CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi and Mr. Mbappé in Paris in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Franck Fife/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>French soccer authorities called for mediation to settle the dispute. That hasn’t happened.</p><h2 id="link-568de478">An enduring fight</h2><p>In a 10th-floor hotel conference room on Thursday, the Eiffel Tower looming behind them, four lawyers for Mbappé outlined a raft of cases they have brought in recent days, before sports governing bodies as well as civil and criminal courts, after waiting for P.S.G. to engage for a year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mbappé had tired both of waiting for money he felt he was owed and of inaccurate stories about the saga over his contract, his lawyers said. The explanation, Mbappé’s longtime lawyer, Delphine Verheyden, was simple: Mbappé had a contract and P.S.G. had not honored it.</p><p>She and the other lawyers also described how club officials pressured Mbappé — threatening to bench him for a season and damaging his reputation — in its efforts to get him to sign an amendment to his contract that would have helped the club not only save money but also face in the event that he left.</p><p>P.S.G. denounced the news conference, accusing Mbappé of rejecting “an amicable solution” and refusing to take the case to a labor court. One of Mbappé’s lawyers countered that such cases typically take years to resolve.</p><p>Mbappé’s lawyers said he was taking on Paris Saint-Germain not simply for personal gain but also to help lesser-known players who could find themselves in the same situation. His fight, they added, apparently without irony, was even on behalf of the French people, who they said would benefit from tens of millions of euros in taxes he and the club would pay should the dispute be resolved in his favor.</p><p>“If we want to fear the club’s reaction that the club is all-powerful then we will never make it,” said Clay, an arbitration specialist hired by Mbappé. “The club is not going to be happy and Qatar is not going to be happy, that’s for sure.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The saga also underlines how reliance on personal relationships still dominates the soccer industry. According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, Mbappé and his advisers had both spoken and put in writing an intention to agree to an amendment. But in the end, none was signed.</p><p>Badly bruised by the saga, P.S.G. has resolved to never repeat its strategy of building its team around a singular figure, no matter how talented or famous.</p><p>That new posture — a departure from a system that predated Mbappé to the earliest days of Qatari ownership that began in 2011 — appears to be serving it well. The club has won praise for performing as the sum of its parts, and is well-placed to achieve its owners’ dreams of winning the Champions League, the biggest prize in European soccer, after comfortably beating English opposition in the first of a two-game quarterfinal on Wednesday night.</p><p>An awkward encounter with Mbappé in the competition might have to wait. His new team, Real Madrid, suffered a shock 3-0 defeat to London-based Arsenal in its first quarterfinal match the night before, leaving it in need of a major reversal when they meet again next week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mbappé during Real Madrid’s match against Arsenal in London, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adrian Dennis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tariq Panja is a global sports correspondent, focusing on stories where money, geopolitics and crime intersect with the sports world.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
