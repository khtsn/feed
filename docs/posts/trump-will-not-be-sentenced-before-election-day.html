The decision was a major victory for Trump, who had argued that the previous Sept. 18 sentencing date would unfairly influence the election.</p><p>The judge, Juan Merchan, cited the case’s unprecedented nature. “This is not a decision this court makes lightly,” he said. “But it is the decision which, in this court’s view, best advances the interests of justice.”</p><p>Trump’s campaign did not celebrate the delay. Instead, it issued a statement saying “there should be no sentencing” at all in what it called an “election interference witch hunt.”</p><p>Though the decision will avert a courtroom spectacle in the campaign’s final stretch, the delay could still affect the election. Voters will now be left in the dark about whether the Republican presidential nominee will eventually spend time behind bars. Trump faces up to four years in prison. However, Merchan could impose a shorter sentence or only probation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Colin Gray, the father of the Apalachee High School shooter, in court today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Brynn Anderson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2fb271e4">The Georgia school shooter and his father appeared in court</h2><p>The 14-year-old boy who is accused of killing two students and two teachers at his high school in Winder, Ga., this week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/us/georgia-school-shooting.html" title="">made his first court appearance today</a>, just 30 minutes before his father sat at the same defense table. </p><p>The teen faces four counts of felony murder, and could serve life in prison if convicted.
