Parts of southern New York State, including the city, have been in a severe drought for about a week. About a quarter of New Jersey has been in an extreme drought for two weeks.</p><p>A severe drought is the second level of a four-level scale, according to the National Integrated Drought Information System, and an extreme drought is the third. The highest level is an exceptional drought.</p><p>Moderate to heavy rain would fall in the region into the day, before becoming lighter, the Weather Service said. Strong winds, with gusts of up to 30 miles her hour, were also expected early Thursday.</p><p>The Northeast is also expected to see its first snowfall of the season this week. The first flurries were forecast for Pennsylvania and New Jersey on Thursday.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
