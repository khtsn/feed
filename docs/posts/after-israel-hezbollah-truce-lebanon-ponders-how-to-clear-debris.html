Substantial reconstruction cannot begin until all of that is cleaned up. In Gaza, where Israel has been fighting a war to root out Hamas militants, nearly 60 percent of buildings have been damaged or destroyed in the besieged enclave. Hezbollah rocket attacks in Israel have also destroyed or damaged homes in border communities and caused wildfires in farmland.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
