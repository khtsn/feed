President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had repeatedly pressed for security guarantees for his country in exchange for mineral rights, as Russia’s war has entered its fourth year.</p><p>Previous draft agreements reviewed by The New York Times included no such security commitment. Mr. Trump had insisted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/europe/trump-us-ukraine-mineral-deal.html" title="">he wanted “payback”</a> for past military aid to Kyiv, shifting America’s alliance with Ukraine to a nakedly mercantile footing.</p><p>A final translated draft of the agreement was sent to Ukraine on Tuesday, according to the American official. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Ukrainian counterpart, the American official said, are expected to sign the agreement first and then Mr. Zelensky is expected to go to Washington for a signing with Mr. Trump. The American and Ukrainian officials insisted on speaking anonymously in order to describe private negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump, <a href="https://x.com/rt_com/status/1894509512503050703?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speaking from the Oval Office in Washington</a>, said of Mr. Zelensky: “I hear that he’s coming on Friday. Certainly, it’s OK with me if he’d like to. And he would like to sign it together with me. And I understand that’s a big deal, very big deal.”</p><p>Mr. Zelensky has been pressing for days to finalize any agreement with Mr. Trump in person. But the Ukrainian leader had rejected at least one other draft of an agreement because it lacked specific U.S. security guarantees and because Mr. Trump was requesting mineral rights worth $500 billion, along with other provisions that Ukraine considered unacceptable.</p><p>The Ukrainians became more comfortable with the deal in the past few days after the Americans removed some of the more onerous conditions.</p><p>While the final terms of the deal are not clear, a draft agreement discussed on Tuesday no longer included the demand that Ukraine contribute $500 billion to a fund owned by the United States. It also did not include a request that Ukraine pay back the United States twice the amount on any future American aid — a demand that Mr. Zelensky had compared to imposing a long-term debt on Ukraine.</p><p>Instead, the draft agreement said Ukraine would contribute to a fund half of its revenues from the future monetization of natural resources, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/europe/ukraine-trump-minerals-explain.html" title="">including critical minerals, oil and gas</a>. The United States would own the maximum financial interest in the fund allowed under American law, though not necessarily all. And the fund would be designed to reinvest some revenues into Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The United States would also commit to supporting Ukraine’s future economic development.</p><p>The discussions about mineral rights have occurred as Russia has seized the advantage on the battlefield. Mr. Trump has also aligned himself with President Vladimir V. Putin while excoriating Mr. Zelensky.</p><p>Mr. Trump has called the Ukrainian president a “dictator” and falsely said that Ukraine had started the war, though the conflict began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p><p>He has prodded Mr. Zelensky to sign a deal, saying he “better move fast or he is not going to have a country left.” In response, Mr. Zelensky said that Mr. Trump was trapped in a Russian “disinformation bubble.”</p><p>A testament to Mr. Trump’s transactional approach to foreign affairs, the deal follows similar moves by the American president to leverage the United States’ economic power in pressuring allies like Canada and Colombia to comply with, or at least negotiate on, his demands.</p><p>Critics say a previous draft of the deal gave no consideration to the cost in lives that Ukraine has already paid toward Europe’s broader security — by defeating Russia’s initial invasion, preventing a Russian military presence on NATO borders farther west and by grinding down Moscow’s army over three years of fierce fighting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky floated the idea of a resources deal last fall to provide an incentive for more U.S. military support. But he balked at the terms presented by the Trump administration when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/scott-bessent-us-ukraine.html" title="">Mr. Bessent visited Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, on Feb. 12</a>.</p><p>“I am not signing something that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to repay,” he told a news conference. Still, the Ukrainian leader acknowledged that he might, ultimately, have little choice.</p><p>“If we are forced and we cannot do without it, then we should probably go for it,” he said, amid intensifying pressure.</p><p>The White House has argued that even without specific security guarantees, the mere presence of American economic interests in Ukraine would deter future Russian aggression.</p><p>“What better could you have for Ukraine than to be in an economic partnership with the United States?” Mike Waltz, the U.S. national security adviser said last week.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div><div><p>Andrew E.
