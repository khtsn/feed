    <h1>The Best Thanksgiving Pie Recipes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Is there anything more joyful to feed people than pie? Custardy, creamy, jammy, nutty, tart — whatever its flavor and texture, pie is celebratory, often nostalgic and deeply delicious. It makes everyone happy. That’s why I believe having a slice of pie with the people in your life who make you feel whole is the perfect way to end Thanksgiving. </p><p>It wasn’t always this way. I always liked eating pie, but it didn’t excite me and I didn’t enjoy baking it. No matter the recipe or approach I used, I was never as confident in my skills as I was in making other sweets. So when my editors asked me to come up with six new pie recipes in honor of the holiday, I made it my mission to fall in love.</p><h2 id="link-23c8c65"><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/119721654-thanksgivingpies2024" title="">Our 2024 Thanksgiving Pies</a></h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>I wanted flavors that were chic and cozy in equal measure, enticing enough to inspire you to try something new, but not too intimidating for bakers who break out the rolling pins only once a year. I wanted to both embrace and update the pies we’ve come to associate with Thanksgiving, and for there to be at least one option for everyone, regardless of how much effort you want to put in or what flavors speak to you and your crew. </p><p>I baked about five dozen pies to create the six recipes below — and yes, I fell head over heels in the process. I reveled in how soothing and tactile it is to make pie, and how wonderful it was to share it with others and see them sink into bliss at first bite. </p><h2 id="link-694b5ad1">Watch Vaughn Make All Six Pies</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>This delightfully tart pie is an autumnal twist on a classic lemon meringue as bright, tangy citrus curd is topped with cranberry Swiss meringue. The egg white mixture can take a while to temper, slowly warming up over simmering water, then cooling as it’s whisked. But patience will pay off as it results in a luxurious marshmallow consistency that holds its shape even after days in the refrigerator. Don’t feel limited to lemon and orange for the curd filling: A mix of any tart and sweet citrus — grapefruit and blood orange, for example — will work nicely.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The addition of sesame in two forms — as oil and in tahini — results in a sumptuous spin on a Thanksgiving staple. Toasted sesame oil lends a nutty savoriness that makes this longtime favorite feel new and exciting, and a slightly sweetened tahini mixture, swirled into the pumpkin custard, creates a striking marbled surface. Gently cooling the pie in the oven will help prevent cracking, though depending on your tahini’s fat content, it may end up splitting slightly along the swirl lines. (It will still be beautiful and delicious.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>This is grown-up banana pudding in pie form. One bite, and you may never want banana pudding any other way. Rich, complex salted butterscotch pudding pairs with ripe, sweet bananas for a balanced (and slightly boozy, if using rum) filling. A crunchy pistachio and vanilla wafer crust nestles the thick custard, while a not-too-sweet crème fraîche topping lightens the whole thing. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Eating this tart is like biting into a grown-up Girl Scout cookie. A crisp chocolate shortbread shell is filled with a creamy, slightly nutty frangipane, and topped with coconut caramel, drizzled chocolate and flaky sea salt. While making your own caramel may seem like a daunting task, the “wet” method of dissolving sugar in a little water before caramelizing it is approachable and foolproof. Take care to keep an eye on its color to ensure it doesn’t burn and end up bitter. Add the cream when the caramel is amber and you’ll be in for a real treat.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>This pie is like enjoying maple-soaked pancakes with a cup of coffee, but it’s great any time of day. A hint of bourbon, or vanilla if you please, enhances a custardy chess pie base that’s then topped with a slightly sweetened espresso-infused whipped cream. Candied orange, while optional, makes for an especially festive, sparkly finish. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><p>Like most good things, terrific apple pie takes a little bit of time, but it’s worth the anticipation. In this variation, sweet and tart apples are cooked first in a fragrant, jewel-toned pomegranate reduction so they all bake more evenly. Placing the pie on the bottom rack ensures that the bottom crust cooks through before the top crust gets too dark. You may be tempted to cut into it warm, but the pie needs to cool for at least four hours to be sliceable.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
