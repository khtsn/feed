The impact killed Paul Martin, 53, a Mercer County sheriff’s deputy who was standing behind the car when it was struck.</p><p>Mr. Cramer pleaded guilty to all nine counts against him in September, including homicide while fleeing a peace officer, fleeing arrest; reckless endangerment and other drug- and driving-related offenses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After the arrest, Senator Cramer issued a statement saying that his son had suffered from “serious mental disorders which manifest in severe paranoia and hallucinations.” </p><p>In handing down the sentence, Judge Bobbi Weiler of the South Central Judicial District of North Dakota told Mr. Cramer that he had ample support to get help. “You had resources, more resources than 99 percent of the people that I’ve seen,” she said, according to footage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsCntNbrk6c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of the sentencing published</a> by The Bismarck Tribune.</p><p>Judge Weiler sentenced Mr. Cramer to 38 years with 10 years suspended, three years of probation and credit for more than a year served in jail. The Associated Press reported that Judge Weiler said that Mr. Cramer was unlikely to serve all 28 years because there are no mandatory minimums for the charges, and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has its own policy on how much time he’ll serve.</p><p> The A.P. reported thatMr. Cramer apologized to the Martin family in a statement at his sentencing.</p><p>“I had no intention to do any of this,” Mr. Cramer said. “It was an accident, and I just hope that someday they can forgive me, and I think the best thing for me is to go to a hospital and just get more help.”</p><p>Kevin McCabe, the public defender who is representing Mr. Cramer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The A.P. reported that Kris Cramer, Mr. Cramer’s mother, also gave a statement at the sentencing, apologizing and saying her son “has hurt his brain a lot on his own” and was dealing with a mental illness. “I really do feel responsible for what happened,” she said.</p><p>Todd A. Schwarz, Mercer County’s state’s attorney, whose office handled the case, also did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Senator Kevin Cramer did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.</p><p>According to the senator’s 2023 statement, Kris Cramer drove their son to an emergency room in Bismarck because he was experiencing a mental health crisis. When they arrived at the hospital, Mr. Cramer jumped into the driver’s seat of the car and fled the hospital.</p><p>The authorities were able to locate him and the vehicle, a black 2017 Chevrolet S.U.V., in Hazen because his mother’s phone had been left inside and its location was being tracked by his sister, according to the senator.</p><p>The A.P. reported that Mr. Cramer had hit speeds of over 100 miles per hour, and that law enforcement had deployed spike strips that flattened his tires, but Mr. Cramer kept driving.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He crashed head-on into the patrol vehicle, and the impact pushed the patrol car into Mr. Martin, killing him, the authorities said. The North Dakota State Highway Patrol said that Mr. Martin, who had worked at the Mercer County Sheriff’s Office for 18 years, was struck while preparing to deploy a “tire deflation device” to stop Mr. Cramer.</p><p>The Bismarck Tribune reported that Mr. Cramer had been in custody in the McLean County Jail since his arrest last year. He will receive credit for time already served, Judge Weiler said at the sentencing.</p><p>Judge Weiler also recommended treatment for his addiction and mental health struggles, according to The A.P.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
