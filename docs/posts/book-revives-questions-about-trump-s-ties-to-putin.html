Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia?</p><p>Eight years almost to the day after American intelligence agencies publicly warned voters that Russia was trying to interfere in the 2016 campaign, a new attention-grabbing book on Tuesday revived the mystery of the relationship between the two by reporting that they secretly have been in touch over the last few years.</p><p>The book by the journalist Bob Woodward cited an unnamed aide saying that the former president and current Republican nominee had spoken with Mr. Putin as many as seven times since leaving office in 2021, even as Mr. Trump was pressuring Republicans to block military aid to Ukraine to fight Russian invaders. The book also said that Mr. Trump, while still in office in 2020, sent Covid-19 testing equipment to Mr. Putin early in the pandemic for his personal use.</p><p>While other journalists were not able to confirm the post-White House contacts on Tuesday, the report roiled the presidential campaign and set Washington buzzing. Former presidents often speak with foreign leaders, but it would be highly unusual for one to talk with an avowed adversary of the United States on the opposite side of a war without clearing it with the White House or State Department first.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump has long courted and embraced Mr. Putin, even praising him as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/world/europe/trump-putin-russia-ukraine.html" title="">“genius”</a> just before a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and then afterward praising the military attack as “very smart.” Mr. Trump has refused to say that Ukraine should win the war, resisted more U.S. arms for Ukraine to defend itself and publicly said that he would “encourage” Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/11/us/politics/trump-nato.html" title="">“to do whatever the hell they want”</a> to NATO allies that do not spend enough on their own militaries.</p><p>As recently as a week ago, Mr. Trump boasted that he has “a very good relationship” with Mr. Putin, one that would enable him if he wins to negotiate a peace deal within 24 hours, even before his inauguration — on terms that, as described by his running mate, would be favorable to the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has mentioned the Russian leader by name during 41 campaign rallies this year, far more often than in any year since he first became a presidential candidate in 2015, according to a database search.</p><p>Whether Mr. Trump has stayed in touch with Mr. Putin since leaving office remained unconfirmed. Mr. Woodward based his report on a single Trump aide he did not identify in his book, titled “War” and obtained by The New York Times and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/08/bob-woodward-new-book-war-trump-putin-biden/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/politics/bob-woodward-book-war-joe-biden-putin-netanyahu-trump/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news outlets</a> on Tuesday in advance of its publication next week.</p><p>The aide described being ordered out of Mr. Trump’s office at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in early 2024 so that the former president could take a call with Mr. Putin. The aide told Mr. Woodward that Mr. Trump had spoken with Mr. Putin multiple other times since leaving office, perhaps as many as seven, according to the book.</p><p>The aide offered no further details and Mr. Woodward acknowledged in his book that he could not verify it with other sources. Twenty current and former Trump and Biden administration officials and career intelligence officials reached by The Times on Tuesday said they had no knowledge of any contacts between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin in the years since Mr. Trump left office, although several said it was not inconceivable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s campaign dismissed Mr. Woodward’s book in a statement by assailing the author with typically personal insults — “a total sleazebag” who is “slow, lethargic, incompetent and overall a boring person with no personality” — without addressing any of the specifics reported in it.</p><p>“None of these made-up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,” Steven Cheung, the campaign communications director, said in the statement.</p><p>Mr. Cheung said Mr. Trump had not given Mr. Woodward access for “War” and noted that the former president was suing the author over a previous book. But the statement did not explicitly say whether or not the former president had spoken with Mr. Putin since leaving office, and the campaign did not respond to a message asking that directly.</p><p>The Kremlin for its part denied the reporting in Mr. Woodward’s book about conversations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. “This is not true,” Dmitri Peskov, a spokesman, said in a text message. “It’s a typical bogus story in the context of the pre-election political campaign.”</p><p>Mr. Woodward, who rose to fame with his Watergate reporting that helped bring down President Richard M. Nixon, regularly produces best-selling books with explosive reporting relying on access to high-level government officials from both parties. Some of his most sensational stories over the years, often attributed to anonymous sources, have drawn denials by the people cited in them and some fellow journalists have questioned his methods. At the same time, many of his most memorable scoops over the years have been borne out in large part by later reporting or memoirs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Woodward’s latest book includes other tantalizing stories that had Washington talking on Tuesday too, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/world/middleeast/biden-netanyahu-israel-woodward-book.html" title="">profanity-laced tirades by President Biden</a> about and to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel over the war in Gaza over the last year.</p><p>Among the episodes Mr. Woodward recounts is a July 4 private lunch after Mr. Biden’s disastrous debate performance in which Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, a longtime confidant, tried to gently broach the idea that the president drop out of the race.</p><p>“I don’t want to see your legacy jeopardized,” Mr. Blinken reportedly told Mr. Biden, saying that any president gets “one sentence” as his legacy in history. “If this decision leads you to staying in and winning re-election, great,” Mr. Blinken said. “If it leads to you staying in and losing re-election, that’s the sentence.”</p><p>The book also reports that Mr. Biden came to regret appointing Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, expressing fury after he appointed a special counsel to investigate the president’s son, Hunter Biden. “Should never have picked Garland,” Mr. Biden told an associate, according to the book.</p><p>After the botched troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, the book reported, Mr. Biden received commiseration from a surprising source, former President George W. Bush. “Oh boy, I can understand what you’re going through,” Mr. Bush was said to have told Mr. Biden, saying that he too had felt ill-advised by intelligence officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As for Russia, Mr. Biden faulted his own former ticket mate, President Barack Obama, for mishandling the response to Russia’s initial, more limited invasion of Ukraine in 2014. “That’s why we are here,” Mr. Biden is quoted telling a friend. The Obama-Biden administration messed up, he added. “Barack never took Putin seriously.”</p><p>Much attention focused on the book’s report about Mr. Trump sending Mr. Putin what were then rare Abbott Point of Care Covid test machines. Mr. Putin, who has been described as particularly anxious about being infected at the time, urged Mr. Trump to not publicly reveal the gesture because it could damage the American president politically, according to the book. “I don’t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me,” Mr. Putin reportedly told him.</p><p>U.S. and Russian officials did <a href="http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/63311" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly announce</a> in 2020 that Covid supplies had been sent to Russia shortly after a May 7 telephone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the time that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/1118964/pompeo-tells-salena-zito-the-world-must-impose-costs-on-china-for-coronavirus/#google_vignette" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“some testing equipment as well as ventilators”</a> had been sent. But officials did not say that any of the equipment was for Mr. Putin’s personal use or disclose that the Russian president had advised Mr. Trump to keep their conversation secret.</p><p>After reports about Mr. Woodward’s book on Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris criticized Mr. Trump for being too close to Mr. Putin, citing the provision of Covid testing equipment. “Everybody was scrambling to get these kits,” she said during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/08/us/harris-trump-election/heres-the-latest-on-the-presidential-race?smid=url-share" title="">an interview on Howard Stern’s satellite radio show</a>. “This guy who is president of the United States is sending them to Russia, to a murderous dictator, for his personal use.” By the end of the day, her campaign had put out a social media ad pointing to the reports.</p><p>Senator JD Vance of Ohio, Mr. Trump’s running mate, responded to questions about the former president’s possible contacts with Mr. Putin by insulting Mr. Woodward before saying he had not discussed the matter with Mr. Trump. “Even if it’s true,” Mr. Vance added, there would be nothing wrong with speaking to world leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In fact, Mr. Trump has openly hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and others at Mar-a-Lago. Just last month, he had dinner in New York with Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain. But those meetings were publicly known, Mr. Trump posed for pictures with his guests and all of the leaders are allies of the United States.</p><p>The release of Mr. Woodward’s book produced a déjà vu feeling for some in Washington. On Oct. 7, 2016, just weeks before the presidential election, American intelligence agency directors released a statement about Russian election interference.</p><p>U.S. intelligence agencies later concluded that Mr. Putin had ordered the Russian government to intervene in the 2016 election to help Mr. Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump rejected that conclusion, suggesting that he believed Mr. Putin’s denial. While the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III did not find a criminal conspiracy that could be proved in court, he documented an unusual number of contacts between Russia and people in Mr. Trump’s circle during that campaign.</p><p>Mr. Woodward’s book leaves as many questions as it does answers. It quotes Jason Miller, a top campaign aide to Mr. Trump, saying that he had “not heard that they’re talking, so I’d push back on that.” But Mr. Miller also said that “I’m sure they’d know how to get in touch with each other” if they did want to talk.</p><p>Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence appointed by Mr. Biden, hedged on the question when asked by Mr. Woodward. “I would not purport to be aware of all contacts with Putin,” she told him. “I wouldn’t purport to speak to what President Trump may or may not have done.”</p><p>Maggie Haberman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jonathan Swan<!-- -->, <!-- -->Julian E.
