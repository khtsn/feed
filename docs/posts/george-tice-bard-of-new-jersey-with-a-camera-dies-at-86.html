The Navy said the accident was caused when one helicopter engine “overspeeded” and exploded during testing, consuming it and two other helicopters in flames. Two men died and 21 were injured.</p><p>One of Mr. Tice’s dramatic pictures of the scene was syndicated by The Associated Press and ran on the front page of The New York Times. It was noticed by the renowned photographer Edward Steichen, then the director of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, who asked the Navy for a print for its collection.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Tice’s 1959 photograph of a burning helicopter aboard an aircraft carrier caught the attention of Edward Steichen of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">George Tice/U.S. Navy, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Broad recognition for his artistry — his work, most of it in black and white, would be compared to Walker Evans’s documentary photos and the urban realism of Edward Hopper’s paintings — would not come for a while. After being discharged from the Navy, Mr. Tice became a portrait photographer of children and families.</p><p>On the side, though, he had begun spending time in Paterson, N.J., a down-at-the-heels industrial city, where he found beauty in the prosaic: A barbershop with a man behind its window, waiting to snip. The Passaic Falls. A car for sale in a driveway. Rooftops.</p><p>Mr. Tice was attracted to Paterson as a subject after he stood on Garret Mountain, which rises above the city out of parkland. From there, Paterson looked like a “miniature model of a city,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/21/nyregion/uncommon-views-of-the-everyday.html" title="">he told The Times in 2002.</a> “It’s isolated — the mountain on one side, the Passaic River on the other side. It’s all enclosed. It’s a place unto itself.”</p><p>He was able to leave portrait photography in 1970, when his prints of Paterson and the people of Amish country in Lancaster County, Pa., where he had also moonlighted, began to sell at the Witkin Gallery in Manhattan, which he helped establish.</p><p>His reputation quickly grew, with his photographs appearing in magazines and in exhibitions around the country. His Paterson photos were shown at the New Jersey Historical Society in Newark in 1971 and were then the subject of a solo exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art a year later. The pictures were also reproduced that year in a book, “Paterson.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Over the next half century, Mr. Tice came to be seen as a photographic bard of New Jersey, traveling the state with his bulky 8x10 view camera and shooting pieces of its urban landscape. These included a phone booth in Rahway, lit up at 3 a.m. but shrouded in darkness; a White Castle, also in Rahway, captured from the back at night and looking like a desolate little burger outpost; and, in his most famous photo, also taken at night, a Mobil station in Cherry Hill with a massive water tower looming in the background like an alien spaceship.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Petit’s Mobil Station and Watertower, Cherry Hill, New Jersey,” 1974.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">George Tice, Nailya Alexander Gallery, New York</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“White Castle, Route #1, Rahway, 1973”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">George Tice</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Now 42, Mr. Tice has done so much of his greatest work in New Jersey that he has become a metaphor for the state — a photographic equivalent of William Carlos Williams,” Vivien Raynor wrote in her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/04/nyregion/art-the-magic-lens-of-george-tice.html" title="">Times review</a> of an exhibition of Mr. Tice’s work at the Woodman Gallery in Morristown, N.J., in 1981.</p><p>Mr. Tice lived in Middletown, and he died there, at his home, on Jan. 16 at 86. His daughter Jennifer Tice-Spagnoli said the cause was complications of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p>Until a few days before he died, Mr. Tice, who was a master printer, was still hoping to revise his book “Lifework” (2022), a career retrospective.</p><p>“He took me aside,” Ms. Tice-Spagnoli said, “and he said, ‘I want to look at my book one more time.’ He was still critiquing it, and he wanted to perfect it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>It was typical of his darkroom work ethic.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Tice published a book chronicling his photographic career in 2002.

His parents divorced when he was very young, and he was raised by his mother, Margaret (Robertson) Tice, a member of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Irish-Travellers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Irish Traveler</a>s ethnic community. His mother peddled Irish linens door to door, and the family lived largely in trailer parks, in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida. She later remarried.</p><p>From age 6 to age 16, George sold crepe paper roses, both on his own and with relatives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Tice at an exhibition of his work in 2022.

He was also an amateur photographer, and his albums ignited George’s passion for storytelling through photography.</p><p>“He could show with 12 albums his whole life, from the time he was born until his death,” Mr. Tice said in <a href="https://www.johnpaulcaponigro.com/blog/photographer-convos/george-tice/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview</a> with the visual artist John Paul Caponigro in 1996 for View Camera magazine. “I thought that was an incredible thing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>As a teenager, George traded up from a Kodak Brownie camera to a 35-millimeter Kodak Pony; joined a camera club in Carteret, N.J., where he impressed the other members, all of them adult men; turned his family’s trailer into a darkroom, to the chagrin of his stepfather, John Hahn; photographed downtrodden men on the Bowery in Manhattan; and worked as a darkroom assistant at a photo studio.</p><p>At 17, he joined the Navy He was sent for training in a photo lab before being assigned to the carrier Wasp.</p><p>The photo of the Wasp explosion’s aftermath — a frame full of frantic sailors in the throes of an emergency — would be an unusual entry in Mr. Tice’s oeuvre; people do not appear in most of his photos from New Jersey and beyond. There were exceptions, though: Amish boys dressed in black and playing in the snow; a little boy standing on a corner in Tallinn, Estonia, looking wary as a man in a cap approaches him; a couple on their houseboat in Jersey City.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Charlie &amp; Violet on Their Houseboat, Jersey City, N.J.,” 1979.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">George Tice</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Tice made his living by selling prints and his many books, including “Fields of Peace: A Pennsylvania German Album” (1970), mostly about the Amish and Mennonites; “Lincoln” (1984), a homage for which he photographed statues of the 16th president and motels, cars and other objects named for him; and “Stone Walls, Grey Skies: A Vision of Yorkshire” (1993), documenting a sojourn in England.</p><p>“That I would do a Lincoln book didn’t occur to me until the night I came upon the <a href="https://susanspiritusgallery.com/artist/george-tice/untitled/lincoln-motel-abes-disco-newark-nj-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lincoln Motel and Abe’s Disco</a>,” Mr. Tice told The Central New Jersey Home News in 1984. “There he was, right in the heart of Newark, all lit up in neon and flashing lights.
