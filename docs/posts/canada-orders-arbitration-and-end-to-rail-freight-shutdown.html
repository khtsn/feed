The moves followed months of contract talks that had failed to reach an agreement.</p><p>Steve MacKinnon, Canada’s labor minister, said at a news conference in Ottawa on Thursday that he had told the Canada Industrial Relations Board to formally order the railways to restart service. He said that he expected trains would be rolling “within days.”</p><p>He also told the labor board to extend the contracts between the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference — the union that represents the workers locked out — and the railway companies: Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Kansas City. The contracts expired at the end of the last year.</p></div></div><div><p>“The impacts of the current impasse are being borne by all Canadians,” Mr. MacKinnon said at the news conference. “Millions of Canadians rely on our railways every day.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Steve MacKinnon, the labor minister, ordered arbitration talks and a restart of rail service.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ismail Shakil/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Last week, the two railway companies had asked Mr. MacKinnon to impose arbitration before a Thursday deadline for a strike or lockout. Mr. MacKinnon turned them down then, but he said on Thursday that the situation had changed.</p><p>“We gave negotiations every possible opportunity to succeed,” Mr. MacKinnon said. “But we have an impasse here.”</p><p>For Canada’s export-dependent economy, a prolonged shutdown could have brought severe economic repercussions. The railway association estimates that half of all Canadian exports are moved on trains and that railroads carried 380 billion Canadian dollars, about $279 billion, worth of goods during 2022.</p></div></div><div><div><p>About 6,500 containers enter the United States by rail from Canada every day along with other cargo, according to the Railway Association of Canada, an industry lobbying group. Many of those containers have come from Asia and Europe and landed at Canadian ports.</p><p>The effects of a protracted strike would have been felt throughout the world. Canada is a major exporter of several globally important commodities. Canadian mines are the world’s largest source of potash, an important fertilizer, and virtually all of their production moves by train at some point.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A potash mine near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

And while the railways move grains and other farm products for global export, they transport relatively few of the food products found in Canadian grocery stores.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In 2015, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/business/canadian-rail-strike-ends-as-parties-agree-to-arbitration.html" title="">a two-day strike</a> by 3,000 locomotive engineers at Canadian Pacific — as the company was known before it acquired <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/15/business/canadian-pacific-kansas-city-southern-merger.html" title="">an American competitor, Kansas City Southern</a>, last year — ended with the two sides agreeing to arbitration hours before the then-Conservative government introduced back-to-work legislation. In 2019, workers at Canadian National struck for eight days before negotiating a deal.</p><p>In recent decades, the two companies’ labor contracts had previously expired on alternating years, which avoided a near-total rail shutdown. But to accommodate changing federal regulations, Canadian National secured a one-year extension of its last agreement. The contracts with both companies expired at the end of last year. Negotiations began last September.</p><p>The main points of contention for the railway workers appear to be scheduling, work hours and fatigue management. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/19/business/freight-rail.html" title="">Hunter Harrison</a>, a longtime American railway executive who ran both railways at separate times, introduced a system known as precision-scheduled railroading. To boost efficiency, he put trains on rigid, consistent schedules and cut back on equipment and employees through steps like running extremely long trains.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Canadian Pacific Kansas City rail yard in British Columbia.

It said that would mean “train crews would be forced to stay awake even longer, increasing the risk of derailments and other accidents.”</p><p>“The railroads don’t care about farmers, small businesses, supply chains or their own employees,” Paul Boucher, the rail conference’s president, said in a statement on Thursday. “Their sole focus is boosting their bottom line, even if it means jeopardizing the entire economy.”</p><p><a href="https://www.cn.ca/en/media/cn-and-tcrc-bargaining-updates-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian National said in a recent statement</a> that it had proposed “a modernized agreement that improved safety, wages and work/life balance.” Canadian Pacific Kansas City said its offer<span>  </span>“does not in any way compromise safety.”</p><p>In a brief statement after the government’s orders, <a href="https://www.cn.ca/en/media/cn-and-tcrc-bargaining-updates-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian National</a> also said that while it was satisfied that the shutdown was ending, it was “disappointed that a negotiated deal could not be achieved at the bargaining table.”</p></div></div><div><p>The Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau keeps its hold on power in the House of Commons with the voting support of the New Democratic Party, which was partly founded by organized labor. Meeting with rail workers in Montreal on Thursday, Jagmeet Singh, that party’s leader, again warned Mr. Trudeau against passing legislation that would force rail employees to return to work or imposing arbitration.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The New Democratic Party’s leader, Jagmeet Singh, met with striking rail workers in Montreal on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Singh condemned the government’s arbitration announcement in a social media post.</p><p>“Justin Trudeau’s actions are cowardly, anti-worker, &amp; proof that he will always cave to corporate greed,” <a href="https://x.com/theJagmeetSingh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.</a></p><p>The effects of a long shutdown would have most likely stretched across several sectors of Canada’s economy, including agriculture, mining, forestry, oil and manufacturing.</p><p>Many shippers who use rail freight in Canada cannot simply move their cargo to trucks. Ships are not an alternative outside of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River system. And the overwhelming majority of cars and trucks made in Canada are sent to the United States largely by train.</p><p>“Parts and components come into the plants largely via trucks, and finished vehicles go out largely on rails,” said David Adams, the president and chief executive of Global Automakers of Canada, a group that includes Honda and Toyota. Both companies have major operations in Canada. “There would be very limited, if any, capability to transfer finished vehicle shipments from rail to truck.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Wade Sobkowich, the executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, said before the government’s action that the shutdown had come just as his members were starting to purchase this year’s grain harvest from farmers. The job action, he said, meant farmers had to stockpile their grain and wait to be paid.</p><p>“We tend not to bring in grain unless we know we can load it onto a train and get it out,” he said from Winnipeg. “It’s terrible timing, right at the start of harvest. We’ll be playing catch up for the rest of the year.”</p><p>Via Rail Canada, the government-owned passenger system, said in an email that most of its trains, which run mainly on Canadian National’s tracks, would be unaffected. Dispatchers at Canadian National remain on the job, unlike their counterparts at Canadian Pacific Kansas City.</p><p>Exo, a commuter rail service in the Montreal area, shut down service on three lines owned by Canadian Pacific Kansas City that carry about 24,000 passengers a day.</p><p>Metrolinx, which runs commuter services in the Toronto area, had said that most of its trains travel on Canadian National’s lines and would not be affected by the lockout. It canceled service, however, on a single route that carries about 6,000 passengers a day.</p><p>In British Columbia, commuter rail service is suspended on a line that runs to and from the <a href="https://historicplacesdays.ca/places/the-waterfront-station/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former Canadian Pacific station</a> on Vancouver’s waterfront. TransLink, its operator, estimates that the route carries 3,000 passengers on weekdays.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Aug. 22, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the value in U.S. dollars of the goods carried by Canadian railroads in 2022, according to an industry group.
