The bank’s governor, Kazuo Ueda, has indicated he plans to continue increasing rates, though it is unclear how quickly that might happen.</p><p>This month, the Bank of Japan held rates steady, with some suggesting it was waiting for political dynamics related to the L.D.P. election and other factors to stabilize.</p><p>In recent years, the significant gap between Japan’s rock-bottom interest rates and higher rates in the United States has led investors to seek higher returns outside Japan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The headquarters of Bank of Japan, in Tokyo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Issei Kato/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>This has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/japan-yen-nikkei-stocks.html" title="">weakened the yen</a>, which in turn lifted the share prices of major Japanese companies that benefited from the bump up in their profits overseas.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some economists and analysts have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/business/japan-stocks-yen-interest-rates.html" title="">questioned</a> whether the rise in Japanese stocks over the past two years was a bubble driven by the weak yen. Share price declines on Monday were led by Japan’s big exporters including Toyota Motor, which fell nearly 8 percent.</p><p>Given Ms. Takaichi’s criticism of the Bank of Japan’s rate increases, the stock market rally seemed poised to continue. On Friday, after Ms. Takaichi took the lead in the first round of voting, the yen quickly weakened and Japan’s benchmark stock index rose.</p><p>The movements in the yen began to reverse when Mr. Ishiba was elected after Tokyo markets closed for the day. The yen was trading at around 142 to the dollar on Monday, compared to more than 146 on Friday.</p><p>In comments on Friday evening, Mr. Ishiba reiterated his belief that to bolster Japan’s economy, interest rate increases, rather than cuts, would be necessary to help bring down inflation and stimulate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/business/japan-inflation-rates.html" title="">sluggish consumer spending</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Ishiba, who is set to take office on Tuesday, also addressed other major focuses, including supporting Japan’s regional economies and encouraging the relocation of production bases back to Japan. On Monday he announced that a general election will be held on Oct. 27, allowing the public to vote on the members of the legislature’s lower house.</p><p>Major banks believe that the market movements may represent the extent of big reactions to the L.D.P. election. Mr. Ishiba appeared to attempt to calm investors over the weekend by saying that borrowing in Japan should remain relatively low-cost.</p><p>Barclays researchers wrote in a note that Mr. Ishiba is likely to respect the independence of the Bank of Japan’s interest rate decisions. They maintained their forecast for a bump up in interest rates in January.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div></section><div><div><div><p>River Akira Davis covers Japan, including its economy and businesses, and is based in Tokyo.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/river-akira-davis">More about River Akira Davis</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/bank-of-japan">Bank of Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/liberal-democratic-party-japan">Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Mark Zuckerberg’s Political Evolution: </strong>Meta’s chief executive, once a backer of liberal causes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/technology/mark-zuckerberg-trump-politics.html">wants to stay away from politics</a>, and his company has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/technology/meta-election-politics.html">de-emphasized political content</a> on Facebook, Instagram and Threads.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chasing Readers on WhatsApp: </strong>News outlets are experimenting with a feature in the world’s most popular messaging app that allows them to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/business/media/whatsapp-news-outlets.html">send links and headlines directly to followers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jony Ive After Apple: </strong>Five years after leaving the company, the iPhone designer is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/technology/jony-ive-apple-lovefrom.html">forging a new life in San Francisco</a>, one imaginative building at a time.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Birkin Bag of the Book World: </strong>Assouline has made its name <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/business/assouline-books.html">publishing tomes that sell for $1,000 or more</a>.
