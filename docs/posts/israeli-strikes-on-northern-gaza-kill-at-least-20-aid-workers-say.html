    <h1>Israeli Strikes on Northern Gaza Kill at Least 20, Aid Workers Say</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jabaliya was once a large town with an adjoining refugee camp, composed of dense urban dwellings, that shared its name. But it has largely been destroyed by ground combat and repeated Israeli bombardments of the area since the war began last year after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel.</p><p>This past week, the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for the area, and a new one was issued on Saturday morning. Avichay Adraee, the military’s Arabic-language spokesman, said on X that the military was <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1844966449091100695" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“operating with great force” against Hamas</a> and other allied groups, “and will continue to do so for a long period of time.”</p><p>“The designated area, including the shelters located there, is considered a dangerous combat zone,” he added.</p><p>Israel has routinely struck areas of Gaza that it has described as safe humanitarian zones, and buildings that house displaced civilians, including schools being used as shelters. The Israeli military has said that such strikes are targeting Hamas and other militants who operated from those areas, using the civilians as human shields — which Hamas has denied doing.</p><p>In its statements, Doctors Without Borders called on Israel to protect civilians and hospitals and to “allow desperately needed humanitarian supplies to enter the north as a matter of extreme urgency.”</p></div></div>
