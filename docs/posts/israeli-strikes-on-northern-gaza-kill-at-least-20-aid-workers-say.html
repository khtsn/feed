The Palestinian health ministry said that at least 49 people had been killed across Gaza since Friday, and that 219 wounded people had arrived at hospitals in the enclave.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel’s military has issued evacuation warnings for the area in recent days, but aid workers said the fighting made it difficult to follow those instructions.</p><p>“Nobody is allowed to get in or out,” Sarah Vuylsteke, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, said in the group’s statement. “Anyone who tries is getting shot.”</p><p>Jabaliya was once a large town with an adjoining refugee camp, composed of dense urban dwellings, that shared its name. But it has largely been destroyed by ground combat and repeated Israeli bombardments of the area since the war began last year after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel.</p><p>This past week, the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for the area, and a new one was issued on Saturday morning. Avichay Adraee, the military’s Arabic-language spokesman, said on X that the military was <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1844966449091100695" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“operating with great force” against Hamas</a> and other allied groups, “and will continue to do so for a long period of time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“The designated area, including the shelters located there, is considered a dangerous combat zone,” he added.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians fleeing areas north of Gaza City on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Al-Qattaa/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Jonathan Crickx, a spokesman for UNICEF in the Palestinian territories, described Israel’s evacuation order in northern Gaza as “extremely concerning,” because it explicitly warned that shelters would not be safe and included sites like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-kamal-adwan-hospital.html" title="">Kamal Adwan Hospital</a>.</p><p>On Saturday, Gaza’s government media office said that the hospital’s intensive care unit was facing a “catastrophic situation.”</p><p>“The coming hours will be decisive for the lives of many children in the intensive care unit, because fuel is running out and the occupation is preventing it from reaching hospitals in the north, and because of overcrowding,” the media office said.</p><p>Mr. Crickx said in an interview that he had visited that hospital three weeks ago, including its pediatric intensive care unit, one of the few left in the Gaza Strip.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I remember seeing a baby, around eight or nine months old, whose body had been hit by shrapnel,” he said. “I’m wondering what’s happening to that child now. These evacuation orders put already vulnerable children, struggling for their lives, at even greater risk.”</p><p>Israel has routinely struck areas of Gaza that it has described as safe humanitarian zones, and buildings that house displaced civilians, including schools being used as shelters. The Israeli military has said that such strikes are targeting Hamas and other militants who operated from those areas, using the civilians as human shields — which Hamas has denied doing.</p><p>On Saturday, Mr. Adraee, the Israeli military spokesman, also posted <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1845026806874644945" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evacuation warnings</a> for almost two dozen towns in southern Lebanon, saying that Israel would strike them as part of its war against Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group.</p><p>He accused Hezbollah of using ambulances to transport weapons and fighters, and said that Israel would strike ambulances if it believed them to be used for that purpose.</p><p>“We call on medical teams to avoid dealing with Hezbollah members and not to cooperate with them,” <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1844996442701562184" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Adraee said</a>, adding that the Israeli military “confirms that necessary measures will be taken against any vehicle transporting gunmen, regardless of its type.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atef Safadi/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In its statements, Doctors Without Borders called on Israel to protect civilians and hospitals in the Gaza Strip and to “allow desperately needed humanitarian supplies to enter the north as a matter of extreme urgency.”</p><p>“Forced evacuations of homes and bombing of neighborhoods by the Israeli forces is turning north Gaza into uninhabitable ruins,” it added.</p><p>WAFA, the official news media of the Palestinian Authority, a rival to Hamas, <a href="https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/150261" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a report on Saturday</a> that Israeli airstrikes had also caused deaths and injuries in the areas of Al-Safatay and Al-Tawam, close to Jabaliya.</p><p>The news agency said the humanitarian situation there was “deteriorating rapidly,” with the military operations blocking the entry of food, medical supplies and potable water into the area.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
