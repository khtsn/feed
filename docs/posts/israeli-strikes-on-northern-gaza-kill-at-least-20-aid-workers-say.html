Avichay Adraee, the military’s Arabic-language spokesman, said on X that the military was <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1844966449091100695" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“operating with great force” against Hamas</a> and other allied groups, “and will continue to do so for a long period of time.”</p><p>“The designated area, including the shelters located there, is considered a dangerous combat zone,” he added.</p><p>Israel has routinely struck areas of Gaza that it has described as safe humanitarian zones, and buildings that house displaced civilians, including schools being used as shelters. The Israeli military has said that such strikes are targeting Hamas and other militants who operated from those areas, using the civilians as human shields — which Hamas has denied doing.</p><p>In its statements, Doctors Without Borders called on Israel to protect civilians and hospitals and to “allow desperately needed humanitarian supplies to enter the north as a matter of extreme urgency.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Forced evacuations of homes and bombing of neighborhoods by the Israeli forces is turning north Gaza into uninhabitable ruins,” it added.</p><p>WAFA, the official news media of the Palestinian Authority, a rival to Hamas, <a href="https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/150261" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a report on Saturday</a> that Israeli airstrikes had also caused deaths and injuries in the areas of Al-Safatay and Al-Tawam, close to Jabaliya.</p><p>The news agency said the humanitarian situation there was “deteriorating rapidly,” with the military operations blocking the entry of food, medical supplies and potable water into the area.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
