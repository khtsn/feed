So running her business requires careful projections about demand.</p><p>Those calculations have become harder of late. With the U.S. presidential election looming, many businesses around the world are facing uncertainty about the future of American trade policy and the tariffs that products will face in global markets.</p><p>For the whiskey industry, the stakes are particularly high. In March, a 50 percent tariff on American whiskey exports to Europe will snap into effect unless the European Union and the United States can come to an agreement to stop the levies.</p><p>The outcome may depend on who is in office. Both former President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have embraced tariffs, but their plans differ significantly. Ms. Harris’s campaign has said she would use tariffs in a “targeted” fashion — possibly mirroring the approach of President Biden, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/biden-tariffs-chinese-goods-clothing.html" title="">recently imposed</a> tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, silicon chips and solar panels. Like Mr. Biden, she has emphasized working closely with allies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Trump, in contrast, has said his approach to trade would be even more aggressive than the trade wars of his first term, when he imposed stiff tariffs on allies and rivals to obtain concessions and try to bolster American manufacturing. He has proposed a 60 percent tariff on products from China and a tariff of more than 10 percent on other goods from around the world.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A 50 percent tariff on American whiskey exports to Europe will take effect in March unless the United States and European Union reach an agreement.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Taylor Glascock for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations. Instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,” Mr. Trump said in Georgia last week, as he threatened to put 100 percent tariffs on every car coming over the U.S. border from Mexico.</p><p>“The word tariff properly used is a beautiful word,” he added.</p><p>The remnants of Mr. Trump’s first trade war continues to reverberate across the globe.</p><p>The European Union imposed tariffs on American whiskey in 2018 after Mr. Trump put a tax on steel and aluminum imports from Europe. The Biden administration reached an agreement with E.U. officials to pause the tariff, but that suspension will expire next year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In 2026, a separate set of tariffs that the European Union, Britain and the United States imposed on one another’s spirits as a result of a different trade spat over airplanes are also set to snap back into effect, unless an agreement is struck.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A pallet of bourbon, ready for shipping to Europe.

Swonger, the president of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group, said the industry expected Mr. Trump to aggressively use tariffs if re-elected. He said some craft distillers, facing the prospect of new trade battles, were holding off on investing in expanding in Europe. “That may be a bad investment for that small business,” he said.</p><p>Foreign governments have also been quietly trying to shield themselves against the trade disruption that could come with a return to Mr. Trump’s “America First” policies. In Washington, dignitaries have been expanding their contacts among both Mr. Trump’s and Ms. Harris’s advisers, and emphasizing their strategic and economic partnerships with the United States.</p><p>In <a href="https://features.csis.org/2024-us-election-global-impact/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report</a> published last week about the views of foreign governments on the presidential election, experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said governments in Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, China and the European Union all shared concerns about higher tariffs under a second Trump presidency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“As Americans go to the polls, their choices have ramifications for the world,” Victor Cha, the center’s senior vice president for Asia, said at an event marking the report’s release.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A car factory in Hangzhou Bay, China.

While both Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump are likely to try to change certain aspects of the deal, foreign officials believe a renegotiation under Mr. Trump could be much more contentious and include large tariffs.</p><p>Senator JD Vance of Ohio, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, said during a debate on Tuesday that the “heart” of Mr. Trump’s economic plan was putting tariffs on foreign countries and businesses that moved jobs overseas, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/politics/trump-enthusiasm-tariffs.html&#39;" title="">using that money</a> to cut taxes and provide services like child care.</p><p>He also argued that Mr. Trump had made the world a more stable place by inspiring fear in other governments. “People were afraid of stepping out of line,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>David Page, the head of macro research at AXA Investment Managers, who is based in Britain, said he had seen “immense interest” among clients in the U.S. election and its spillover effects on the rest of the world.</p><p>Mr. Page said he was telling clients that, while Ms. Harris might introduce some tariffs and sanctions, the large tariffs that Mr. Trump was discussing were “a totally different ballgame.” While investment was strong in the first half of the year, Mr. Page said, he expects it to soften in the third quarter because businesses are uncertain how policies would affect their businesses.</p><p>“I think it is having quite a material effect on all levels of government and within companies as well,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soybeans being harvested in Stuttgart, Ark.
