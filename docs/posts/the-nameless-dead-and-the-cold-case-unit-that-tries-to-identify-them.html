And thus another body bag tagged “Name Unknown” was delivered to a little-known squad of investigators from the city’s medical examiner’s office who identify New York City’s nameless dead.</p><p>The cold-case unit works out of a faded building on First Avenue that houses the city’s Manhattan morgue, trying every day to identify the roughly 1,250 nameless corpses that have been found in the city dating back to the late 1980s.</p><p>“Everybody deserves to have their name in death,” said Dr. Angela Soler, a scientist with the agency’s forensic anthropology unit. “They are unidentified, but they are not forgotten.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a wired age, it is rare that someone dies whose identify is truly unknown. With advances in forensic science, genetic and fingerprint matching, as well as national databases and online search methods, the problem has declined to historically low levels.</p><p>But in New York these advances cannot eradicate the problem. In a city of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/nyregion/nyc-population-decline.html" title="">8.2 million</a>, even one that’s a panopticon of video cameras, some people come to get lost and, in death, they succeed. There are a dozen or two stubbornly unidentified bodies each year and a dozen equally stubborn investigators trying to find their names.</p><p>The Brooklyn body had been brought to the agency’s headquarters and laid out on an examining table in a cramped lab room. On three tables nearby, anthropologists had reassembled other skeletons, all tagged “Name Unknown.” Around them, bones were stored on shelves along with clay facial recreations based on unidentified skulls staring out blank-eyed.</p><p>All three of the skeletons were homicide victims: one man found in 1990 in the air shaft of a Harlem building; another found in 1990 in a wooded area of Jamaica, Queens; and the torso of a woman pulled in 1988 from the Hudson River in Upper Manhattan.</p><p>Their bones were darkened by decades in the dirt, having been recently exhumed for more testing from the city’s potter’s field on <a href="https://www.hartisland.net/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hart Island</a>, where the bodies go if the unit’s exhaustive efforts fail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This year, at least 10 unidentified bodies have been sent there, agency officials said. Last year saw 14, compared with 28 in 2022 and 31 the year before that. They are placed in pine boxes stacked together in long trenches.</p><p>The goal is to keep the unidentified bodies off — or move them from — the island. The cold case team solves roughly 20 long-term unidentified cases a year.</p><p>In April, investigators helped solve a case that had its roots in a 55-year-old case. Construction workers excavating a Manhattan basement in 2003 had unearthed a rug wrapped around the remains of a young woman. She had been entombed in cement in a West 46th Street building that once housed the Scene rock club, where the likes of Jimi Hendrix and the Doors once played.</p><p>DNA taken from a bone sample matched a relative of someone who had died on 9/11, which led them to the identification of the remains as those of Patricia McGlone, who was 16 when she disappeared in Midtown in 1969.</p><p>Some unsolved cases haunt the unit, like that of a little boy whose body was found by dog walkers in 2005 on Rockaway Beach, headless and wrapped in a Disney sheet. The unit recently had his remains exhumed for genetic genealogy testing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Along with her scientific expertise, Dr. Soler also has a knack for intimate detail.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Angela Soler, a forensic anthropologist, knows not only science, but has encyclopedic knowledge of case details.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">James Estrin/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>There was the decomposed skateboarder found in a Queens marsh in 2021, dressed in campy clothes — giraffe print socks and red sneakers with mismatched shoelaces — that she connected with a man listed in a national database and found that his social media showed him to be a skater. The agency’s lab confirmed his identity with a DNA test.</p><p>There was the case of a young man who was pulled out of a waterway in 1993. Years later, Dr. Soler saw on his X-rays that he still had two baby teeth. She recalled seeing that same detail recorded for a man reported missing outside the city. Her agency’s forensic odontologists soon confirmed the dental comparison and the match.</p><p>There was the case of Valerie Smith, a petite young woman who had disappeared from her Queens home in 1981 after she called her brother to say she was depressed. Despite press coverage, the hiring of private detectives and teams of neighbors canvassing the neighborhood, the investigation yielded no answers.</p><p>Decades later, her relatives showed Dr. Soler her photo. She noticed that Ms. Smith’s new jeans with a stylish side zipper were similar to those worn by a petite woman who had been pulled out of the East River in 1981.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Dental records confirmed her intuition. It was Ms. Smith.</p><p>More than 50,000 people die in New York annually. More than 9,000 are initially sent to the medical examiner to confirm their identity and determine the cause and manner of death.</p><p>Fingerprints, X-rays and dental records are checked, and there are full body and clothing exams. Hospitals, homeless service agencies and families are called, as well as the police. An identification usually happens within days.</p><p>Only after several weeks are bodies sent to the cold case unit, which digs deeper.</p><p>Investigators submit cases to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, a clearinghouse of databases known as NamUs that is a hub for medical examiners, law enforcement and advocacy groups and relatives of missing persons.</p><p>Samples are taken at the agency’s bone grinding lab, where fragments are crushed into fine powder for DNA extraction. Some techniques were gleaned from the lab’s years of work confirming victims of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.</p><p>Those gathering more remains from a scene may search using the agency’s cadaver dog, whose handler is the first deputy chief medical examiner, Dr. Michele Slone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>These deaths often follow a life on the margins, whether homeless, undocumented, using an alias, estranged from family or plagued by addiction. Troubled lives end in waterways, under bridges or in woods.</p><p>The unit’s mission is especially complicated in a city with a constant flux of unhoused, undocumented and transient populations who cycle through from all over the country and the world, not to mention immigrants, tourists and commuters.</p><p>“Anyone who comes into our office can come from anywhere in the world,” Dr. Soler said.</p><p>A team of anthropology, identification, forensics and biology experts meets every Friday to review cold case progress — and to make sure they have exhausted all options. They speak in detail to people who contact the agency to find loved ones who disappeared in New York.</p><p>The city only began routinely taking DNA samples from unidentified bodies in 2006, so some older cases require a trip to Hart Island to have bodies exhumed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>In some cases, the unit may use descriptions of decedents and collaborate with specialists to create renderings. In rare cases, DNA samples have been used to create facial reconstructions. A 3-D printer may be used to recreate skulls so that fine arts students can sculpt clay-model approximations of faces.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fine arts students mold facial features to skull models created with 3-D printers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">James Estrin/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For the body found floating in August, anthropologists assembled the bones into a skeleton on an examining table to help determine the person’s age, sex and ancestry, said Dr. Bradley Adams, the agency’s director of forensic anthropology.</p><p>The narrow pelvis indicated this was a male and, based on measurements from his leg bones, that he was only 5 feet tall. His skeleton showed no trauma.</p><p>The unit extracted a DNA sample and uploaded it to a national database. “There are no obvious leads yet,” Dr. Adams said.</p><p>The case may be with the team for a while. But Dr. Soler said that its commitment would not flag.</p><p>“Every deceased New Yorker deserves to be memorialized with a name and a story, even if decades after death,” she said. “And every family deserves to know what happened.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In 2021, after Dr. Soler recognized the side zipper that led to the identification of Valerie Smith, she made a phone call that for decades had been longed for.</p><p>“We finally have a match on your sister,” she told Barry Smith, he recalled in an interview.</p><p>After finding her burial site on Hart Island, he organized a group of a dozen relatives and friends to visit. They walked out on a grassy field where his sister had been buried for four decades in anonymity.</p><p>He knelt and wept.</p><p>“I thought, ‘Valerie, we’re so happy we found you,’” he said. “It was just an overwhelming feeling, to know she’s at peace someplace on this earth.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Corey Kilgannon is a Times reporter who writes about crime and criminal justice in and around New York City, as well as breaking news and other feature stories.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/corey-kilgannon">More about Corey Kilgannon</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Priest, the Power Broker and the Pop Star: </strong>A monsignor is in hot water with his diocese as prosecutors look into his dealings with Mayor Eric Adams’s top adviser. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/nyregion/sabrina-carpenter-church-frank-carone.html">It all started with Sabrina Carpenter</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disappearing Dining Sheds: </strong>Street side sheds helped keep New York restaurants afloat during the coronavirus pandemic.
