On Wednesday, the medical examiner in Dane County identified the two victims who died: Rubi P. Vergara, 14, a resident of Madison, and Erin M. West, 42, who lived in nearby DeForest, Wis., and was listed in a staff directory as the substitute coordinator at Abundant Life.</p><p>The surviving victims, two of whom remained hospitalized in critical condition as of the latest police update, have not been publicly identified.</p><p>The attack at Abundant Life Christian School took place during the last week of classes before Christmas break, and it sent emergency responders scrambling to the small, close-knit school on Madison’s east side. Much about the shooting remained unclear as investigators looked for a motive and detectives searched a home that they believed was connected to the attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s what we know:</p><h2 id="link-50796733">When did the attack happen?</h2><p>A second-grade teacher called 911 at 10:57 a.m. to report a shooting inside the school, Chief Shon F. Barnes of the Madison police said, and law enforcement officers began arriving three minutes later. (The chief had earlier said it was a second-grade student who made the call, an error he corrected on Tuesday afternoon.)</p><p>Chief Barnes said officers immediately went inside and began searching for the shooter, who was found wounded at 11:05 a.m. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/16/us/abundant-life-school-shooting-wi/emergency-workers-were-mobilized-quickly-dispatch-audio-indicates?smid=url-share" title="">Audio</a> that was archived online captured dispatchers scrambling to send emergency crews to the scene as the scope of the attack became clearer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Law enforcement secured a perimeter around the school.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kaleb Autman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“OK, I’m hearing multiple things — possibly one deceased, maybe six people injured, at least two shot,” the dispatcher said. </p><p>Chris Carbon, the Madison fire chief, said that 15 ambulances and several fire engines ultimately responded, and that the injured were quickly taken to two local hospitals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-6ab3d469">Who was killed and injured?</h2><p>On Wednesday, the medical examiner in Dane County identified Rubi and Ms. West as the two victims who died.</p><p>Little was publicly shared about the victims, who the medical examiner said “died as a result of homicidal firearm-related trauma.”</p><p>An obituary for Rubi published online by a local funeral home said she was a freshman at Abundant Life who enjoyed reading and art, had a special bond with her pet dog and cat, and played keyboard in a family worship band.</p><p>Six other people, one teacher and five students, were injured. As of the most recent police update, two victims had been released from the hospital, and of the four still hospitalized, two were in critical condition with life-threatening wounds.</p><h2 id="link-23c27ea9">What do we know about the shooter?</h2><p>The authorities identified the shooter as Natalie Rupnow, 15, who went by Samantha and was a student at Abundant Life. Officials said she used a handgun in the attack. It was not clear how she acquired the gun.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Chief Barnes said that he was not aware of the suspect having any prior contact with law enforcement. He said her parents were cooperating with investigators, and “we have no reason to believe that they have committed a crime at this time.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chief Shon F.

In interviews, people with ties to Abundant Life described a family-focused school with strong academics and an emphasis on Christian faith.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Barbara Wiers, an official at the school, said students and staff members had trained regularly to know how to respond to an attack. She said cameras in the building were regularly monitored, but the school did not have metal detectors or a police officer on campus.</p><p>She said students were “visually scanned” as they arrived on campus each day, and that Abundant Life had participated in government programs to “harden our school” against potential threats.</p><p>Ms. Wiers said she had spoken with parents at the reunification center who offered prayers and “were amazingly patient and kind.” She added: “We also have a very strong faith in our community that, in spite of tragedy, God is working.”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Julie Bosman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Annie Correal<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ernesto Londoño<!-- --> and <!-- -->Kate Selig<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Dec. 17, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article, relying on information from the Madison police chief, misidentified the person who called 911 to report a shooting at Abundant Life Christian School.
