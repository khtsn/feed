West, 42, who lived in nearby DeForest, Wis., and was listed in a staff directory as the substitute coordinator at Abundant Life.</p><p>The surviving victims, two of whom remained hospitalized in critical condition as of the latest police update, have not been publicly identified.</p><p>An Abundant Life student, a 15-year-old girl, carried out the attack on Monday, which also left six people wounded, officials said. The authorities said she died of a self-inflicted gunshot.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The shooting took place during the last week of classes before Christmas break, and it sent emergency responders scrambling to the small, close-knit school on Madison’s east side. Much about the shooting remained unclear as investigators looked for a motive and detectives searched a home that they believed was connected to the attack.</p><p>Here’s what we know:</p><h2 id="link-50796733">When did the attack happen?</h2><p>A second-grade teacher called 911 at 10:57 a.m. to report a shooting inside the school, Chief Shon F. Barnes of the Madison police said, and law enforcement officers began arriving three minutes later. (The chief had earlier said it was a second-grade student who made the call, an error he corrected on Tuesday afternoon.)</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
