    <h1>FNATIC sends G2 packing to reach top three</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>In a clash between the number one seeds from Americas and EMEA, FNATIC has come out on top, eliminating G2 Esports from Masters Toronto in a 2-0 victory. With G2&#39;s loss, Americas is the first region to be fully eliminated from the tournament.</p>

<p>These two teams faced off once before, in Champions 2024. Back then, FNATIC cut G2&#39;s run short, sending them home early in a 2-0 victory. Almost a year later, and it&#39;s the same story.</p>

<p>FNATIC took G2&#39;s map pick of Lotus 13-10, then won their own map pick of Split in another 13-10.</p>

<p>G2 have been eliminated from Masters Toronto, exiting the tournament in fourth place. An international trophy still eludes Americas&#39; best team, but their performance thus far has already secured them a spot in Champions.</p>

<p>FNATIC move on to top three in the tournament, their highest placement since their win in Masters Tokyo. They will face Wolves Esports in the lower final for the chance to battle Paper Rex in the grand final.</p>
