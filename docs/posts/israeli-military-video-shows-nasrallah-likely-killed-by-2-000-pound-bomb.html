These bombs, a type of munition known as bunker busters, can penetrate underground before detonating.</p><p>Wes Bryant, a former U.S. Air Force targeting specialist who also reviewed the video, agreed with the analysis. In text messages with The Times, he said the bombs were “exactly what I would expect” to be used in what Israel has said was an attack on Mr. Nasrallah in Hezbollah’s underground headquarters.</p><p>In May, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/07/us/politics/israel-biden-arms.html" title="">announced it had paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel</a> because of concerns over civilian safety in Gaza.</p><p>The video, published Saturday on the Israeli military’s official Telegram channel with the caption “Israeli Air Force Fighter Jets Involved in the Elimination of Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah’s Central Headquarters in Lebanon,” shows at least eight planes in a row armed with 2,000-pound bombs. Some are too far away to clearly identify the exact model, but the closer planes are seen armed with BLU-109 bombs. That model of bomb is also identifiable when the video shows two planes taking off, with one plane carrying six of those munitions. Then the video shows a plane returning at dusk to the Israeli air base without any bombs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/28/28vid-israel-defense-forces-52168-cover/28vid-israel-defense-forces-52168-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Israel Defense Forces</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While the video does not show the planes dropping the bombs, Mr. Ball said that videos showing the explosions in the densely populated southern suburbs of Beirut, as well as the damage caused, are consistent with the 2,000-pound bombs carried by the Israeli jets in the video. A New York Times analysis of verified videos, photos and satellite imagery showed that the attack destroyed at least four apartment buildings that were each at least seven stories tall.</p><p>Two senior Israeli defense officials told The Times that more than 80 bombs were dropped over a period of several minutes to kill Mr. Nasrallah, but did not confirm the type of munitions used. The Israeli military did not answer questions from The Times on the bombs seen in this video or used on the attack on Mr. Nasrallah. U.S. government officials referred questions on the munitions to the Israeli military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Israel continued to pound Beirut’s southern suburbs on Saturday. Visual evidence analyzed by The Times shows at least 13 sites were struck on Friday and Saturday across at least three miles of densely developed city. The full extent of the strikes is unclear.</p><p>Lebanon’s health ministry said on Saturday that at least 33 people had been killed and more than 195 people injured by the strikes, and the toll is expected to rise with many still buried under rubble.</p><p>Mr. Nasrallah’s assassination was a stunning escalation of Israel’s campaign against Hezbollah in a conflict that has gone on for nearly a year. Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel on Oct. 8 in solidarity with Hamas, which is also supported by Iran, and Israel frequently responded, intensifying its attacks dramatically over the last two weeks. That has fueled fears of an all-out regional war that could draw in bigger players like Iran.</p><p>Devon Lum<!-- -->, <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Eric Schmitt<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ronen Bergman<!-- --> contributed reporting. <!-- -->McKinnon de Kuyper<!-- --> contributed video editing.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aric Toler is a reporter on the Visual Investigations team at The Times where he uses emerging techniques of discovery to analyze open source information.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aric-toler">More about Aric Toler</a></span></p></div><div><p>Riley Mellen is a reporter on The Times’s visual investigations team, which combines traditional reporting with advanced digital forensics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/riley-mellen">More about Riley Mellen</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
