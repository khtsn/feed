Wednesday’s ruling served as a warning to the ambitions of Mr. Thaksin, himself a former prime minister and long a foil to Thailand’s royalist-military establishment.</p><p>Mr. Srettha’s removal is likely to increase the disillusionment of many Thais, who already see the case as the latest proof of intervention by an unelected establishment that is quashing the people’s will. Last week, the same court ordered the disbandment of the Move Forward Party, a progressive party that won last year’s election but was blocked from forming a government.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Constitutional Court made the ruling on Wednesday afternoon in a 5-4 decision.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sui-Lee Wee is the Southeast Asia bureau chief for The Times, overseeing coverage of 11 countries in the region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sui-lee-wee">More about Sui-Lee Wee</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
