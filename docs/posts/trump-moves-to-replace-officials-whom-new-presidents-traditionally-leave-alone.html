Trump has moved to install loyalists in jobs that Congress did not intend for new presidents to replace at the start of their terms, eroding a traditional constraint on executive power even before he takes office.</p><p>In announcing his choices for roles in his administration, Mr. Trump has declared his plan to replace officials in three positions — so far — that do not traditionally turn over as part of a transition: the director of the F.B.I., the commissioner of the I.R.S. and the director of Voice of America, an overseas news service.</p><p>Under federal law, none are supposed to be treated like ordinary political appointees whom incoming presidents immediately replace with their own selections as a matter of course. While Mr. Trump has the legal power to do so, he is violating a norm of self-restraint that past presidents, including himself, adhered to.</p><p>Particularly striking is Mr. Trump’s plan to oust and replace the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, and the I.R.S. commissioner, Danny Werfel, in light of his repeated vow to use the levers of government to pursue his adversaries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Both agencies have the power to open investigations, either criminal inquiries or tax audits. And because of the potential for abuses — and past instances of them — Congress structured the positions to emphasize that they are not supposed to operate as just another member of a president’s political team.</p><p>Instead, the leaders of the F.B.I. and the I.R.S. serve a fixed term that does not align with a change in administrations.</p><p>The terms of both expire in 2027. By statute, F.B.I. directors serve for 10 years, and Mr. Wray was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2017. Mr. Werfel was appointed by President Biden in 2023 for <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7803" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a five-year term</a>, with the clock already running by the time he started.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Christopher A. Wray has said he will resign as F.B.I. director when Mr. Trump takes office, rather than waiting to get fired.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kent Nishimura for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>While presidents have the legal authority to remove such officials whenever they want, as a matter of tradition, incoming presidents have generally adhered to the norm Congress established and allowed them to finish their terms. Even Mr. Trump followed that practice at the start of his first administration.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After taking office in January 2017, Mr. Trump allowed the existing I.R.S. commissioner, John Koskinen, to stay on until his term ended that November before appointing Charles P. Rettig as his successor. When Mr. Biden took office four years later, he allowed Mr. Rettig to remain until his term finished in November 2022.</p><p>Mr. Trump also adhered to that norm with the F.B.I. in his first term, allowing James B. Comey, appointed under President Barack Obama, to stay on after his inauguration. But months later, as the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia heated up, Mr. Trump abruptly fired him — prompting a political uproar — and appointed Mr. Wray to the role. By contrast, Mr. Biden allowed Mr. Wray to stay on.</p><p>But Mr. Trump has continued to treat the F.B.I. as his enemy, partly because of its role in multiple criminal investigations against him. Those involve his attempt to overturn his loss of the 2020 election and his retention of classified documents after he left office and obstruction of efforts to retrieve them.</p><p>Congress established a 10-year term for F.B.I. directors in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/94/statute/STATUTE-90/STATUTE-90-Pg2407.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 1976 law</a>, during a period of reform after the death of the bureau’s longtime director J. Edgar Hoover, Watergate and revelations of past abuses by the F.B.I.</p><p>A Senate report explained that the fixed term served a dual purpose. It would prevent directors from becoming entrenched yet allow them to outlast the president who appointed them, showing that the “position is not an ordinary cabinet appointment, which is usually considered a politically oriented member of the president’s ‘team.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Enforcing that norm against any president who fires or otherwise forces out an F.B.I. director early, however, is tricky. While the Senate report affirmed that presidents can remove F.B.I. directors at will, it warned that lawmakers would not look kindly upon a nominee to replace a director who had been ousted for no good reason.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>F.B.I. directors serve 10-year terms, a change enacted into law after the death of the longtime director J. Edgar Hoover.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Neal Boenzi/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Akhil Reed Amar, a Yale Law School professor, said the Senate’s threat to reject nominees if presidents abused their removal power “is actually the best they can do, given Supreme Court case law” about the scope of presidential authority to fire senior executive officials.</p><p>“The question is how you put teeth in a norm,” he added. “And one real problem is that the statute can’t really bind a future Senate that wants to be a lap dog.”</p><p>Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the Trump transition, defended Mr. Trump’s moves.</p><p>“President Donald Trump won an Electoral College and popular vote mandate,” Mr. Pfeiffer said. “Voters elected him to enact his America First agenda to restore prosperity and security. President Trump is nominating top-notch individuals to fulfill his agenda and Make America Great Again.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump started to challenge the limits late last month, when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/politics/trump-replace-christopher-wray.html" title="">said he would make Kash Patel</a>, a loyalist who rose in Mr. Trump’s orbit by trying to delegitimize the Russia investigation, the new F.B.I. director. Days later, Mr. Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113596942661402416" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declared that he would appoint Billy Long</a>, a former Republican congressman, as I.R.S. commissioner.</p><p>To some controversy, Mr. Wray <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/wray-trump-fbi-director.html" title="">has acquiesced</a>, stating that he will resign when Mr. Trump takes office, rather than waiting to get fired. For his part, Mr. Werfel <a href="https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/werfel-lawmakers-react-to-trumps-irs-commissioner-pick/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has demurred</a> about his intentions, saying only that he was “laser focused” on preparing for the tax season.</p><p>The practice by incoming presidents of letting officials in positions with legally defined terms finish serving them out does not adhere to all positions in the executive branch. Even though a federal law says U.S. attorneys <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/541" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are appointed to four-year terms</a>, it is routine for all of them to offer their resignations when new presidents take over, no matter how long they have served.</p><p>But beyond that, it is difficult to identify any clear modern precedent for Mr. Trump’s actions.</p><p>Former senior transition and early White House officials under each of the past seven administrations — dating back to Ronald Reagan’s transition in 1981 — contacted for this article could not recall instances in which other officials with fixed terms by law were replaced when their president took office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“I can’t think of one,” said Fred Fielding, who was Mr. Reagan’s first White House counsel and President George W. Bush’s final one. “I was involved in the Reagan transition and also Bush 43’s, and I don’t recall in either instance that that was a subject of any discussion.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump plans to oust Danny Werfel, the I.R.S. commissioner, and replace him with a former congressman.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>There were a few notable exceptions identified by The New York Times involving allegations of misconduct or a significant difference in approach to policy.</p><p>In January 1993, officials in President Bill Clinton’s administration immediately <a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc/page/file/1085346/dl?inline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">started exploring what to do about the F.B.I. director</a>, William S. Sessions, after <a href="https://www.governmentattic.org/3docs/DOJ-OPR-WlliamSessions_1992-1993.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a critical report by the Justice Department</a> under the departing Bush administration had accused him of misusing public resources for personal benefit. Mr. Sessions refused to resign, and Mr. Clinton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/20/us/defiant-fbi-chief-removed-from-job-by-the-president.html" title="">removed him</a> that July, cutting short his term by about four years.</p><p>In January 2021, Mr. Biden’s incoming team <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/politics/peter-robb-nlrb-fired.html" title="">ousted the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, Peter B. Robb</a>, a Trump appointee whose term had been set to last until that November. Mr. Robb had substantial discretion over what cases the agency brought, and his pro-management approach made him deeply unpopular with prominent labor unions.</p><p>Also in January 2021, Mr. Biden’s incoming team swiftly <a href="https://www.usagm.gov/2021/01/21/biden-administration-requests-usagm-ceo-packs-resignation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sought to remove Michael Pack</a>, the Trump-appointed chief of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, an independent agency that oversees government-funded news services abroad. The services, like Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, aim to counter propaganda from authoritarian governments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At the time of his ouster, Mr. Pack was only about six months into a three-year term. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/us/politics/trump-voice-of-america.html" title="">his brief tenure had been turbulent</a> and scandal-ridden. An independent investigation <a href="https://osc.gov/Documents/Public%20Files/FY23/DI-20-1086/Redacted%20Agency%20Report%20of%20Investigation%20DI-20-1086%20et%20al_.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later found</a> that he had “abused his authority” and “engaged in gross mismanagement” in multiple ways, including wasting $1.6 million in public funds.</p><p>Notably, the third instance in which Mr. Trump signaled his plan to replace an official in a job that does not traditionally turn over concerns that same agency and Voice of America.</p><p>This month, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/voice-of-america-journalists-trump.html" title="">announced that he intends to name Kari Lake</a> as the director of Voice of America. Ms. Lake gained notoriety after peddling Mr. Trump’s lie that he won the 2020 election as she made her own failed bids for Arizona governor in 2022 and for a Senate seat this year.</p><p>Since April, the director of Voice of America has been Michael Abramowitz, a former longtime reporter and editor at The Washington Post and a former head of the pro-democracy organization Freedom House.</p><p>The job is not meant to turn over just because a new administration is taking office — and under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/6205" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a federal statute</a>, Congress did not give presidents any role in hiring and firing decisions for it. By law, those decisions are instead made by a bipartisan advisory board of the independent umbrella agency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The board consists of seven members — four from the president’s party and three from the opposing party. And under the statute, while it takes only four members to appoint the chief of a service, five votes are required to remove one — meaning that a Democratic member would need to concur in firing Mr. Abramowitz if he declines to resign and create a vacancy for Ms. Lake to fill.</p><p>Mr. Abramowitz has issued an ambiguous <a href="https://x.com/davidfolkenflik/status/1867319379303837783" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> about his intentions. He said that he intended to “cooperate with the new administration,” but also that he would “follow the process put in place for the appointment of the director of V.O.A.” He did not respond to a request for clarity about whether that means he will resign or stay and see how the process for removing a director plays out.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
