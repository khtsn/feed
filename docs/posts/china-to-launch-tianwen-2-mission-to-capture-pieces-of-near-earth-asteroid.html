And as asteroids <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/science/asteroid-2024-yr4-impact.html" title="">can pose an impact risk</a> to Earth, missions to study the structures and mineral makeups of these objects can aid planning to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/science/nasa-crash-asteroid-dart-study.html" title="">deflect</a> or <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/14/1114306/space-nuclear-explosion-asteroid-protection-research/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vaporize</a> them.</p><p>“A sample return mission is a gift that keeps on giving,” said <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/people/sara-russell.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sara Russell</a>, a planetary scientist at London’s Natural History Museum.</p><p>While fragments of asteroids reach Earth’s surface periodically, they are contaminated and altered when they plummet through the atmosphere.

NASA’s sample return mission to the asteroid Bennu, Osiris-Rex, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/24/science/nasa-osiris-rex-asteroid-sample-landing.html" title="">pulled off the same feat</a> in 2020.</p><p>China’s space agency has executed two successful <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/science/change-6-china-earth-moon.html" title="">sample return missions to the moon</a> — in 2020 and 2024. But Tianwen-2 (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/science/china-mars.html" title="">Tianwen</a> is often translated as “Questions to Heaven”) is China’s first foray into asteroid sample return.</p><p>Kamoʻoalewa, the asteroid it will visit, is somewhat peculiar. As a <a href="https://theconversation.com/companions-of-earth-minimoons-quasi-satellites-and-horseshoes-62111" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quasi-satellite</a> earlier known as 2016 HO3, it loops around Earth, but it is not a true moon, because it is gravitationally bound to the sun. Recent telescopic observations, though, suggest it is made of the same volcanic matter found on the moon, implying that it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/science/moon-kamooalewa-asteroid.html" title="">a piece of the lunar surface</a> shorn off by a meteor impact.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Kamoʻoalewa, therefore, potentially holds key information about the formation and evolution of the Earth-moon system,” Dr. King said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>However “its origins remain an open question,” said <a href="https://www.astro.umd.edu/people/sharkey.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Benjamin Sharkey</a>, a planetary astronomer at the University of Maryland who made those recent telescopic observations. He said he was excited that Tianwen-2 was going to bring some of the asteroid home for study, which should close the case of Kamoʻoalewa’s origins.</p><p>China has revealed few details about how Tianwen-2 will work. An academic <a href="https://jdse.bit.edu.cn/sktcxb/cn/article/doi/10.15982/j.issn.2096-9287.2024.20230185" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paper</a> posted last year offers some clues. A variety of cameras and infrared imagers will ascertain Kamoʻoalewa’s shape, size, spin and mineral makeup, while a radar system will map its internal structure.</p><p>By looking at the thermal properties of Kamoʻoalewa, Tianwen-2 will also help study the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDmlB2_BCN8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yarkovsky effect</a>. When sunlight hits a rotating asteroid, its sunward side heats up. As it continues to spin, it cools down, which nudges the asteroid, like a small thruster. Over time, escaping heat can push a harmless asteroid onto an Earth-impacting orbit.</p><p>Kamoʻoalewa can get within nine million miles of Earth, making it an easy target to reach. But diving down to sample it is risky. “The sample collection and return are hardest,” Dr. Russell said, “because humans have only a very limited amount of experience in doing both.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The asteroid may be only 130 feet across — a small target. Its rapid rotation, about once every 28 minutes, poses additional challenges. “You need to find ways to either grab the sample without landing or a way to hang on as it spins,” Dr. King said.</p><p>China’s spacecraft may try doing both. “Tianwen-2 will use two methods to collect samples from Kamoʻoalewa,” Dr. Qian said.</p><p>The first is “Touch and Go,” a method employed by the U.S. and Japanese asteroid missions: The spacecraft briefly makes contact with the object, kicks up the surface (using compressed gas, or a fired projectile) and captures jettisoned rocks before the spacecraft flees the scene.</p><p>The second method, “Anchor and Attach,” has never been tested. Using a series of drills, Tianwen-2 will try to adhere to the asteroid before retrieving both shallow and deeper samples.</p><p>If Tianwen-2 navigates those dangers and eventually drops its bits of Kamoʻoalewa to Earth, it will then fly to the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acf31c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comet 311P/PanSTARRS</a>, arriving in the early 2030s to study it remotely.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>While most comets witnessed from Earth travel on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/science/comet-largest-ever-seen.html#:~:text=But%20earlier%20this%20month%2C%20they,62%20and%20125%20miles%20long." title="">long-haul journeys</a> around the sun, 311P is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/science/comet-asteroid-belt-space.html" title="">main belt comet</a>. These icy curiosities stay within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.</p><p>“These types of objects remain very mysterious,” Dr. Sharkey said, not least because icy rocks should not exist this close to the sun’s warm glow. But they may help explain how Earth became a planet with vast oceans.</p><p>Tianwen-2 is more than just a scientific sleuth. It is also a technological steppingstone for China’s ambitious <a href="https://spacenews.com/china-opens-2028-mars-sample-return-mission-to-international-cooperation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tianwen-3 mission</a>. Due to launch in 2028, it aims to retrieve rock samples from Mars and return them to Earth. A comparable effort led by the United States to achieve the same goal is facing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/science/trump-nasa-mars-sample-return.html" title="">major hurdles</a>.</p><p>But the race for the red planet should not overshadow China’s first bid to acquire shards of an asteroid.</p><p>“This is very exciting,” said <a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/richard-p-binzel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Richard Binzel</a>, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “But asteroids present their own challenges.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
