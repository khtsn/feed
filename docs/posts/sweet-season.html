    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Cookie hive, assemble. Why? Because it’s the most wonderful time of the year.</p><p>I’m Vaughn! You may remember me from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/briefing/cookie-week.html" title="">last year</a>, but if not, I’m the emcee of this tradition my colleagues and I at New York Times Cooking call Cookie Week. It’s a larger-than-life celebration of one of those little things that make the holidays so sweet — cookies! This year we rolled out seven cookies, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYG6O_GQCZwgU2nGqqC80jNz9f-ripNZy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">along with fun video tutorials</a>, from all-stars like Sohla El-Waylly, Melissa Clark and Eric Kim. I might be in there, too — you never know.</p><p>A big part of our process is thinking about how to modernize the classics: colorful takes on classic shortbread, interesting yet festive flavor combinations, shapes beyond your classic circle. Cookie Week is as much a visual experience as it is a taste experience, and this year we wanted our collection of recipes to have something for everyone. In July, when we started planning this year’s cookies, we leaned heavily into nostalgia for inspiration. Yule logs, rocky road and hot buttered rum all came to us like visions of sugarplums.</p><p>After months of planning, testing, filming, photographing, designing and eating (I live for quality control), our cookies finally made their debut last week. They go together like Elphaba and Glinda, and much like our favorite witches of Oz, I have been changed for good by this year’s lineup.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Julia Gartland for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>I don’t play favorites, but I have found myself gravitating to Sohla’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026327-holiday-rocky-road" title="">holiday rocky road</a>, a no-bake confection that’s essentially marshmallows, nuts and other fun things enrobed in chocolate and sliced into bars. She adds cookie butter to the melted chocolate so that it slices more like fudge, giving it a hint of spice and a lovely melt-in-your-mouth quality. It’s also beautiful — bejeweled with gumdrops and adorned with fun sprinkles — and comes together in minutes, making it perfect for gifting and even better for snacking.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Julia Gartland for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>I’m also leaning toward Samantha Seneviratne’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026326-ginger-cheesecake-cookies?q=ginger%20cheeseca" title="">ginger cheesecake cookies</a>. They’re chewy, spicy and sparkly with a tangy little surprise inside. Need I go on? OK, I will. Three kinds of ginger — crystallized, ground and freshly chopped — infuse the simple dough, which is stuffed with a frozen dollop of cheesecake filling, rolled in sanding sugar and baked to perfection. I love how they glitter in the glow of my Christmas lights and perfume my apartment with warm spices.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Julia Gartland for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>I’ve been baking for Cookie Week since I helped start it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQDNDcpgPe4&amp;list=PLYG6O_GQCZwgU2nGqqC80jNz9f-ripNZy&amp;index=32&amp;t=9s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five years ago,</a> and working on my yearly offering is the only thing I love about turning my oven on in July. My <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026334-rum-buttered-almond-cookies?q=rum%20butt" title="">rum-buttered almond cookies</a> are pillowy mounds of fragrant marzipan-like dough that are covered in toasted almonds and lathered in a buttery rum glaze that infuses into the cookies. I love all my cookie children, but this one might be my favorite (don’t tell the others). They also go from tablespoon to tabletop in about 30 minutes, which means you can keep making them over and over. Plus, they’re gluten-free!</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Timothée Chalamet in “A Complete Unknown.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Macall Polay/Searchlight Pictures, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><ul><li><p>“A Complete Unknown,” the Bob Dylan biopic starring Timothée Chalamet, premiered. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/a-complete-unknown-review-a-flimsy-slice-of-bob-dylan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reviews are mixed</a>.

They’re both union towns. They can get dreary in winter. And they live and die by their long-suffering N.F.L. teams. This season, though, one of them might finally win a Super Bowl. The Lions are 12-1 and the league’s clear front-runner. The Bills are 10-3, and quarterback Josh Allen is having an M.V.P. season. The Lions are the top-scoring team in the N.F.L.; the Bills are a close second. <em>Sunday at 4:25 p.m. Eastern on CBS</em></p></div></section></article></div>
