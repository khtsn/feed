But they never seem to entirely go away. That’s been the pattern of this Trump administration. </p><p>Staying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/business/investing-international-stocks-bonds.html" title="">calm</a> and taking a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/20/business/stock-market-peak-investing.html" title="">long view</a> is what you are supposed to do in investing. But with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/29/us/trump-news" title="">on-again-off-again Trump tariffs</a> disrupting world markets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/bond-market-debt-deficit.html" title="">big budget deficit</a>s looming and a fickle stock market, there’s been plenty to worry about. Add to all that <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/05/25/soaring-bond-yields-threaten-trouble" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">soaring</a> global <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/business/stock-markets-moodys-sp500.html" title="">bond yields</a> and you’ve got a recipe for sleepless nights.</p><p>Climbing global bond yields are just beginning to attract widespread attention. Bonds have never been as sexy as stocks in the United States, but the bond market has always had the quiet capacity to dominate the economy and instill fear around the world, and its awesome powers are evident once again.</p><p>As James Carville, the Democratic political strategist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/your-money/29stra.html" title="">said</a> in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/weekinreview/ideas-trends-the-bondholders-are-winning-why-america-won-t-boom.html" title="">1990s</a> during the Bill Clinton administration: “I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For the record, I’d like to come back as the world’s No. 1 tennis player. But in other respects, I agree with Mr. Carville. Ructions in fixed-income markets are capable of transfixing wayward politicians in ways that sports legends never can.</p><p>What’s happened lately is that long bond yields — the interest rates that investors demand to buy bonds with a maturity of 20 years or more — jumped to their highest levels in decades, in both Tokyo and in New York. They’ve dropped a bit, but remain relatively high. Most headlines in the United States have focused on U.S. bond yields. Japan’s bond problems have received coverage, too, but largely because difficult government bond auctions in Tokyo set off increases in U.S. Treasury yields.</p><p>Rising bond yields demand to be noticed because they have a range of negative consequences: Mortgage rates rise, economic activity can slow, stock markets tend to sputter and the cost of doing business steepens throughout the economy. When yields get high enough, a government that finances much of its activities through borrowing, as the United States does, may eventually find that it can’t function without imposing painful budget cuts, or raising taxes, or both — and outcomes like these will thwart any politician’s dreams. Moreover, because Treasuries and the dollar are the fulcrums for the global financial system, tremors in the U.S. Treasury market reverberate around the world.</p><p>In fact, yields have been high in other large, critically important financial centers as well — in Germany, Britain and France, for example. Yields and the cost of doing business have risen in many other countries as well, including Mexico, Chile, Indonesia, the Philippines, Nigeria and South Africa.</p><p>All countries are idiosyncratic. But despite the fraying of global ties — accelerated by Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/business/trump-tariffs-blocked-federal-court.html" title="">attempts to impose</a> unilateral tariffs on allies — no country is immune from movements in the world’s financial markets. All else equal, shifts in yields and prices in the biggest money centers tend to move yields and prices in other countries, too.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-995f3bc">How Serious?</h2><p>What’s most important about the recent yield surge is the trend, not the level that bond yields have already reached. One reason that the rise in U.S. yields alarmed many people is trivial. It is that 30-year Treasuries breached a seemingly meaningful level: 5 percent, a nice round number.</p><p>What’s the difference between 4.99 percent and 5 percent, though? Practically nothing. Nobody cared when the yield moved from 4.88 to 4.89 percent. But like other thresholds in economics and financial markets — like new peaks and troughs in the stock market, or round numbers in the rate of unemployment or gross national product — 5 percent seemed salient.</p><p>Furthermore, this higher yield occurred for a bond that hasn’t served as the main benchmark for the fixed-income market for years. Purchasers of 30-year bonds are a limited group nowadays. They include large institutions, like insurance companies, that need instruments with long duration because they must match their liabilities — say, life insurance contracts — with their assets. And 30-year bonds are prized by traders who believe they know where the market is going. As a matter of fixed-income math, a bond’s price and its yield move in opposite direction, and the longer a bond’s duration, the more its price shifts when yields change.</p><p>That’s why those who have held the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond exchange-traded fund this year have lost about 1 percent, including interest and dividends, while investors with a more traditional middle-of-the road investment-grade bond fund, like the iShares Core Total USD Bond Market E.T.F., are up about 2 percent, according to FactSet. Because their prices whipsaw with yield changes, bonds with a duration of 20 or 30 years are riskier than shorter-term bonds if you need to sell them before they mature.</p><p>This is technical stuff. Basically, most people can hold shorter-duration bonds and safely ignore the relatively high level of these long-term bonds — which, really, aren’t that high, when you take a longer perspective. The average yield on 30-year Treasuries since 1981 is 5.9 percent, according to Bloomberg. That’s much higher than the yields reached in the recent kerfuffle. The economy has prospered in the past with higher yields.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Yet I’m not claiming that all is fine and there’s nothing to worry about in the bond world. Not at all.</p><h2 id="link-26244643">But There’s More</h2><p>In some respects, it’s a good thing that bond market rates have risen.</p><p>After all, bond interest rates had been held artificially low by the Federal Reserve and other central banks since at least the financial crisis of 2007-9. The first major experiments in quantitative easing — unorthodox monetary policy involving bond purchases to drive down long-term yields — started in Japan in 2001. <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.110.4.943" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ben S. Bernanke</a>, the Fed chair, <a href="https://www.bis.org/review/r030606d.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imported</a> Japan’s innovation to the United States. The goal of those experiments was to stimulate the economy, avoid a depression and price deflation.</p><p>For the last few years, the central banks have reversed course: They have been reducing their bond holdings. Yet debt burdens have been rising as governments have run big deficits. Under these circumstances, it was only natural that global bond yields would rise.</p><p>The problem is being able to service the debt, year after year, if you keep running big deficits. It’s easier for governments that have their own currency, and whose debt is held mainly by domestic investors — which is the case for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/business/japan-debt.html" title="">Japan</a>. Its government debt is more than twice the size of its economy — a ratio far higher than that of any other major nation — and its recent difficulties in selling long-term bonds could augur profound problems in the future.</p><p>The United States is in a different position. It, too, has its own currency, but a special one, what Washington Irving called “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/quotes/Washington-Irving" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the almighty dollar,</a>” the global reserve currency. U.S. debt is held around the world, with <a href="https://ticdata.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/slt_table5.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Japanese</a> investors the largest single group of owners, followed by the British and the Chinese. Small shifts in the Japanese bond market can affect U.S. yields, as Japanese investors and institutions move money. Quick trades can upset the global bond markets but such short-term disruptions are not usually a big problem.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The deeper questions revolve around the<span>  </span>amount of debt being issued and the market’s willingness to absorb it. U.S. debt already exceeds the size of the U.S. economy and it will keep climbing under the legislation recently passed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/upshot/record-debt-republicans-bill.html" title="">House</a>, to as high as 129 percent of the economy by 2034, according to <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/adding-house-reconciliation-bill" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a> by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that favors debt reduction.</p><p>Debt can be a great thing when used for productive purposes or to stimulate an economy that is faltering. But increasing budget deficits and adding fiscal stimulus to a strong economy is not what the great British economist John Maynard Keynes recommended.</p><p>The three main U.S. bond rating agencies have already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/business/us-credit-downgrade-moodys.html" title="">declared</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/02/business/treasuries-safe-debt-crisis.html" title="">the United States</a> is no longer a triple-A credit risk because of political dysfunction and an irrational budget process. At some point, every country can reach a level of debt so high that the markets will no longer finance it at a reasonable rate. Problems in one market can easily flow to others.</p><p>The United States, and other major countries, still have many options that can allow them to avoid a truly grave global financial crisis. Unless such a crisis is reached, most investors will be better off ignoring these problems and holding diversified portfolios, including stocks as well as bonds. But the world has gotten riskier, and the bond markets have begun to notice.</p><p>It would be best not to test the bond market’s powers of intimidation much further. They can be fearsome to behold.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeff Sommer writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/business-strategies">Strategies</a>, a weekly column on markets, finance and the economy.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>BU</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>5</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Bond Market Showcases Its Power to Intimidate<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
