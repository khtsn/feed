No injuries were reported, and Mr. Ishiba was away from Tokyo in southern Japan on Saturday.</p><p>The episode is the latest in a series of violent acts targeting officials in Japan, a country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/world/asia/shinzo-abe-assassination-japan.html" title="">known</a> as having low rates of violent crime.</p><p>In 2022, Japan was shaken by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/shinzo-abe-assassination-japan.html" title="">assassination</a> of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who had held the office longer than anyone else. The following year, a man <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/world/asia/japan-prime-minister-blast-fumio-kishida.html" title="">threw a pipe bomb</a> at Fumio Kishida, then prime minister, while he was delivering a speech in a small port city near Osaka. Mr. Kishida was unharmed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The suspect in Saturday’s attack has been identified as a 49-year-old resident of Saitama Prefecture near Tokyo, investigators told NHK. Several more incendiary devices and plastic containers probably containing kerosene were found in his vehicle, it said. Further details on the suspect or his motivations were not known.</p><p>Mr. Ishiba <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/world/asia/japan-new-prime-minister-shigeru-ishiba.html" title="">took office</a> this month, succeeding the unpopular Mr. Kishida, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/asia/fumio-kishida-japan-prime-minister.html" title="">resigned</a> after leading the Liberal Democrats for three years amid corruption scandals.</p><p>In its early weeks, Mr. Ishiba’s administration has also been deeply unpopular, with a poll from the local news agency Jiji Press reporting an approval rating of 28 percent — the lowest for the start of any administration since 2000.</p><p>Mr. Ishiba, a former defense minister, has gained a reputation for muddled policies, including a proposal to form an “Asian NATO,” which left policy experts scrambling for clarity. He has also appeared to shift from his pre-election stance on issues including interest rates and nuclear energy.</p><p>Mr. Ishiba dissolved the lower house of Japan’s Parliament this month, a decision that angered opposition parties. Some critics said the move, made the day before his confirmation as prime minister, could be unconstitutional.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>A snap election is scheduled for Oct. 27, which will determine whether the Liberal Democrats secure a majority in the more powerful chamber of Japan’s Parliament.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hisako Ueno is a reporter and researcher based in Tokyo, writing on Japanese politics, business, labor, gender and culture.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hisako-ueno">More about Hisako Ueno</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Lifeline in Lebanon: </strong>Thousands have fled the town of Baalbek amid a barrage of Israeli airstrikes.
