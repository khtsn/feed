But at about 10 a.m. more problems arose, and there were 41,000 reports of outages on X, according to Downdetector. Shortly after 11 a.m., a third spike of reported outages emerged, and the site remained down for many users.</p><p>The cause of the disruption was not immediately clear. Mr. Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1899149509407473825" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a post</a> on the platform that X had been the target of a “massive cyberattack,” possibly conducted by “a large, coordinated group” or a country. He did not provide details.</p><p>More than half of the outage reports were from users of the app, Downdetector’s data showed.</p><p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, referred a request on Monday for comment on the matter to X. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Representatives for X did not immediately respond to questions about what had happened or whether the social media platform had returned to full operability.</p><p>In a post on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, a group known as Dark Storm took credit on Monday for causing the outage.</p><p>While it not was clear whether the outages were connected to the public backlash that Mr. Musk has been experiencing because of his cost-cutting role in the Trump administration, the disruption occurred at a particularly tumultuous time for the world’s richest man. </p><p>It compounded a rocky few weeks of double-digit stock losses for Tesla, protests outside the electric vehicle dealerships, vandalism and a group of Mr. Musk’s critics <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/tesla-boycott-elon-musk.html" title="">ditching their E.V.s.</a> to protest his values and politics. Some of those same people have abandoned X for other social media platforms, including Bluesky. </p><p>Neil Vigdor<!-- --> and <!-- -->Kate Conger<!-- --> contributed reporting. </p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>How Altman Won Over Trump: </strong>After helping President Trump get elected, Elon Musk was poised to dominate America’s A.I. policies.
