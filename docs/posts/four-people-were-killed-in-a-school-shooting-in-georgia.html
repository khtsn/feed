The shooting — the deadliest episode of school violence in Georgia’s history — took place at Apalachee High School in Winder, roughly 50 miles from the center of Atlanta. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/04/us/georgia-shooting-apalachee-high-school" title="">Here’s the latest on what we know</a>.</p><p>Students inside the school described a chaotic atmosphere after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/04/us/georgia-shooting-apalachee-high-school#at-first-students-thought-lockdown-was-a-drill-then-they-heard-gunshots" title="">they realized that a lockdown was not a drill</a>. They barricaded themselves inside classrooms as gunshots rang out, and some students called their parents in fear. “They prepare you for these things,” one student said. “But in the moment, I started crying. I got nervous.”</p><p>The suspect surrendered when he was confronted by law enforcement and is in custody, officials said. He will be charged with murder as an adult. President Biden called the shooting “another horrific reminder of how gun violence continues to tear our communities apart.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The number of arrests at the U.S. southern border has dropped significantly in recent months.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Ratje for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-18f6dab3">Biden is considering more permanent asylum limits</h2><p>The Biden administration is weighing policy changes that would make the president’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/us/politics/biden-asylum-restrictions.html" title="">temporary asylum restrictions almost impossible to lift</a>, people familiar with the plans said.</p><p>The changes would build on the executive order President Biden issued in June to block a vast majority of asylum claims at the southern border. Under that order, the restrictions would be lifted if the number of people trying to cross illegally each day dropped below 1,500 for one week. Now, the administration wants to require that border crossings remain low for several consecutive weeks, a change which would make it extraordinarily unlikely that the restrictions would lift any time soon.</p><hr/><p>🇺🇸 2024</p><p><em>The presidential election is </em><strong><em>62 days away.</em></strong><em> Here’s the latest from the campaign trail.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The U.S. said that Russia has been using RT, the state-owned broadcaster, to spread disinformation.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Misha Friedman/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sergei Chuzavkov/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-1658103d">Zelensky is preparing to shake-up his cabinet</h2><p>Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, said today that he would overhaul the leadership of his government in an effort to bring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/world/europe/ukraine-reshuffle-zelensky.html" title="">“a new energy” as Russia steps up its attacks</a> on the nation.
