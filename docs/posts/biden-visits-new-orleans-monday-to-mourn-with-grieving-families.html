In October, he visited states hit hard by Hurricane Helene’s devastating sweep through the Southeast.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This is his first trip to New Orleans in that capacity. The Bidens on Monday went directly from Air Force One to the presidential motorcade and did not take questions on the tarmac.</p><p>Mr. Biden last visited the city in August <a href="https://news.tulane.edu/news/president-biden-announces-nearly-23-million-tulane-develop-revolutionary-cancer-moonshot" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to announce funding</a> for a cancer treatment project at Tulane University.

Bush <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/02/national/nationalspecial/bush-says-results-of-aid-efforts-were-not.html" title="">traveled</a> to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, one of the deadliest hurricanes in U.S. history, overwhelmed the city’s levees and drainage pumps in 2005, causing catastrophic flooding and killing more than 1,000 people.</p><p>His trip followed mounting criticism for his decision not to visit the devastated city immediately. <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/08/images/20050831_p083105pm-0117jas-515h.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A photograph</a> of Mr. Bush looking out the window of Air Force One as it flew over the city without stopping on his way to Washington from Texas became a defining image of his presidency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>President <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/us/politics/29obama.html" title="">Barack Obama visited New Orleans and other parts of Louisiana</a> affected by the most damaging oil spill in American history, the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore rig in 2010, which released more than 200 million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s visit on Monday falls on the anniversary of the 2021 attack on the Capitol by an angry mob seeking to prevent the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Biden has taken note of the anniversary each year, most recently calling it “day that we nearly lost America.”</p><p>While Mr. Biden is in New Orleans on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris, as president of the Senate, will oversee the counting and certification of the 2024 election. The Capitol Police have <a href="https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/security-enhancements-road-closures-counting-certification-electoral" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stepped up</a> security for the event, closing roads and increasing patrols around the Capitol grounds.</p><p>Monday is also Twelfth Night, the start of Carnival season in New Orleans. The night is traditionally celebrated with parades and king cake. The New Orleans Police Department has announced increased security in response to the Jan. 1 attack.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
