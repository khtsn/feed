Two years ago, they held a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/world/americas/gustavo-petro-nicolas-maduro-venezuela.html" title="">high-profile meeting</a> in Caracas, where the two promised to work together on issues of mutual interest.</p><p>That included the security of their 1,300-mile shared border.</p><p>Then in July, Mr. Maduro <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/americas/venezuela-election-results.html" title="">declared himself the winner</a> of a tainted presidential election, refusing to produce tallies to back up this claim and imprisoning roughly 2,000 people amid a wave of protest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The United Nations and other independent monitors questioned the result. The United States recognized the opposition candidate as the winner.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Soon, Mr. Petro, one of few leaders to still be somewhat amicable with Mr. Maduro, took a more critical tone, publicly urging him to publish election results and release political prisoners. Mr. Maduro responded by ordering a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax2tOYIofxc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">punch in the face</a>” to anyone who meddled in Venezuela’s affairs.</p><p>When Mr. Maduro was sworn in for a third term on Jan. 10, Mr. Petro <a href="https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1876993689379033308" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refused</a> to attend the ceremony or to recognize the Venezuelan as president.</p><p>Five days later,the ELN sent fighters from southern Colombia into northern Colombia, to a strategically important region called Catatumbo, <a href="https://x.com/CAMIL_FGNO/status/1881136695615332767" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying on X</a> that it sought to oust a rival armed group called the 33rd Front.</p><p>The two groups had long divided control of the region, home to vast fields of coca, the base product in cocaine. Now, a fragile power-sharing accord had broken.</p><p>The violence has crushed Mr. Petro’s chances at accomplishing one of his most important policy goals: a peace deal with the ELN, a key part of an ambitious campaign promise — “total peace,” he called it — that he made to end all conflict in Colombia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The country has suffered decades of internal violence that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.</p><p>“‘Total peace’ was already in a bad spot,” said Kyle Johnson, co-founder of Foundation Conflict Responses, a nonprofit research group in Bogotá. “With this outbreak of violence it feels politically like the final nail in the coffin.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Preparing arepas for breakfast for displaced members of the community in Tibú.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Children forced to flee their homes sleeping at the shelter in Tibú.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Today, tens of thousands of civilians are trapped in the middle of the violence. Some families in Catatumbo have sought refuge in the forest, surviving on whatever they managed to carry with them.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Others have streamed into Tibú, a small Colombian town on the Venezuelan border, sleeping in a school that has become a shelter. Still others have crowded into a coliseum in Cúcuta, the region’s main city, lining up each morning for food and assistance.</p><p>On a recent day at the school in Tibú, classrooms had become bedrooms, and children played while a young woman, overcome with emotion, cried and wheezed until she fainted on a patio floor.</p><p>“Sow what you dream,” read a mural on one wall. Military helicopters buzzed overhead.</p><p>Venezuela’s powerful interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, had just paid a visit to the border, while a new wave of Colombian troops were moving in to fight the ELN.</p><p>As the sun set, Luz, 45, and her husband Francisco, 40, sat in the doorway of one of the classrooms, describing the home they had abandoned: dirt floor, wood construction, a small patio, a barrel for collecting rainwater.</p><p>Just days before, as armed men had stormed the region, a man had arrived at the school where Francisco worked and told him that he had five minutes to leave.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The couple and their two sons ran.</p><p>The Times is publishing only their first names, out of concern for their safety.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Luz and her family fled their home as violence broke out. “What are they fighting for?” she asked.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Her husband, Francisco, at a shelter in Tibú. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>That night in Tibú, Luz was struggling to understand how they had gotten there.</p><p>“All of us civilians are saying: What are they fighting for?&#34; she said. “What are they looking for? What is the reason for this?”</p><p>At his office in Cúcuta, Gen. Mario Contreras, the regional commander for the Colombian Army, said the violence had begun with the killing of a single family, which angered the ELN. The following day, he said, the ELN entered town centers — “because they know people are defenseless there” — armed with pistols and dressed as civilians, looking for suspected collaborators of the 33rd Front.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>A generation ago, the ELN was so weak it was near extinction, battered by the Colombian state and paramilitaries.
