    <h1>Biden Renewed Efforts to Reach a Cease-Fire in Gaza</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Biden said today that the killing of the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar offered “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/18/world/israel-hamas-yahya-sinwar-news" title="">an opportunity to seek a path to peace</a>” in the Middle East. Speaking in Berlin, where he met with European leaders, Biden said he would send Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel in the coming days to discuss a plan to end the war in Gaza.</p><p>Biden also spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, whose office said that both leaders had agreed there was an “opportunity to advance the release of the hostages” as part of a cease-fire deal. However, Sinwar’s longtime deputy insisted that Hamas’s demands were unchanged.</p><p>For Biden, who has only three months left in office, getting a cease-fire deal done is a big reach, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/us/politics/sinwar-israel-biden-harris.html" title="">my colleague David Sanger writes</a>. </p><p>An autopsy conducted by Israel found that Sinwar was killed by a gunshot wound to the head. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/how-yahya-sinwar-killed.html" title="">Here’s what we know about his death</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tim Sheehy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tailyr Irvine for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-ff4d062">A Senate candidate’s war story raised questions</h2><p>Tim Sheehy, a Republican from Montana running in one of the country’s most closely watched Senate races, has often talked about a bullet lodged in his forearm. He says he suffered the injury in 2012 as a Navy SEAL during a firefight in Afghanistan.</p><p>But two people who had close interactions with Sheehy have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/us/tim-sheehy-gunshot-wound-montana-senate.html" title="">come forward to dispute his account</a>. A former SEAL colleague said Sheehy had never mentioned the wound, and he remembered no visible evidence of an injury. A park ranger said he was certain Sheehy shot himself at Glacier National Park in 2015, when the ranger spoke to him at the hospital.</p><section data-id="100000009683024" data-testid="capsule-block"><h2 id="link-4291416d">On the campaign trail</h2><p><em>The presidential election is </em><strong><em>18 days away</em></strong><em>.</em></p><ul><li><p>Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigned today in Michigan, where they are effectively <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president-michigan.html" title="">tied in the polls</a>.</p></li><li><p>A judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/us/politics/trump-election-case-evidence.html" title="">released a redacted trove of evidence</a> in Trump’s federal election case, rejecting the former president’s objections.</p></li><li><p>Trump and his campaign have blamed illegal immigration as the cause of many of the country’s problems. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/us/politics/trump-immigration-fact-check.html" title="">That is rarely the case</a>.</p></li><li><p>Residents of western North Carolina began early voting.

Earlier this week, Canada expelled six Indian diplomats, accusing them of being part of a broad criminal network to intimidate Sikhs.</p><p>In both cases, India’s government is likely to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/world/asia/india-sikh-murder-plots-canada-us.html" title="">face increased pressure to explain its actions</a>. So far, only the Canadian accusations have caused a rift. India has been far more accommodating of requests from the U.S., perhaps out of fear of alienating Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People waiting at a bus station today in Matanzas, Cuba, after a power outage across the entire country.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Antonio Levi/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eisa Davis and Lin-Manuel Miranda.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Weiss for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-1dd4c476">Lin-Manuel Miranda knows his new project is old-fashioned</h2><p>Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of “Hamilton,” released today an 80-minute concept album inspired by the 1979 movie “The Warriors” and co-written by Eisa Davis. The story follows a gang of women who fight their way through New York City.</p><p>The very notion of such an album, which is a bit like a musical without much dialogue or any visuals, is old-fashioned, Miranda acknowledged. But he said he was trying to recapture the feeling of listening to cast albums as a child.
