Some tornadoes could be strong.</p><p>Forecasters also warned of very large hail, up to three inches in diameter, that would most likely fall across northeastern Texas, northwestern Louisiana, Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, Southern Illinois and western Ohio. Parts of western Kentucky and Tennessee may also be at risk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Widespread damaging winds are also another concern on Sunday, particularly from eastern Arkansas and northern Mississippi to Southern Illinois, Indiana and western Ohio.</p><h2 id="link-2261df8c">Threats will move east on Monday.</h2><p>The severe weather risk will shift east on Monday.
