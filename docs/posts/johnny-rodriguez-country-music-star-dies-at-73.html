He was 73.</p><p>His daughter, Aubry Rodriguez, announced his death <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJdGef6Mlio/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> on Saturday. The post did not cite a cause of death.</p><p>Mr. Rodriguez rose to fame in the 1970s and was best known for the hits “Ridin’ My Thumb to Mexico” and “You Always Come Back (to Hurting Me).” He released six singles that reached No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart, and nine others reached the Top 10.</p><p>In 2007, Mr. Rodriguez was inducted into the <a href="https://www.tcmhof.com/latest-inductees/8-inductees-2007" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Texas Country Music Hall of Fame</a>, which described him as the “greatest and most memorable Chicano Country singer of all time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Juan Raoul Davis Rodriguez was born to Andres Rodriguez and Isabel Davis on Dec. 10, 1951, in Sabinal, Texas, around 65 miles west of San Antonio. Mr. Rodriguez, the second youngest of 10 children, started playing guitar at the age of 7 when his older brother, Andres, bought him one.</p><p>Their father died of cancer when Mr. Rodriguez was 16, around the time Mr. Rodriguez formed a band, and the younger Andres died the next year in a car crash. The losses sent Mr. Rodriguez “spiraling,” according to the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.</p><p>Mr. Rodriguez had been in jail by the time he was 18 for what is said to be an unpaid fine. He would pass time in the cell by singing and was overheard by Joaquin Jackson, a Texas Ranger, who eventually helped find Mr. Rodriguez a job as a singer and stagecoach driver at the Alamo Village, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/movies/the-set-for-the-alamo-hopes-to-live-again-as-a-theme-park.html" title="">then a popular tourist attraction</a> in Texas.</p><p>The country musicians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/arts/music/tom-t-hall-country-musics-storyteller-is-dead-at-85.html" title="">Tom T. Hall</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/arts/music/a-country-singer-returns-to-what-made-him-a-star.html" title="">Bobby Bare</a> heard Mr. Rodriguez performing at the Alamo in 1971 and invited him to Nashville. Mr. Rodriguez, then 20, brought just his guitar and $14. Shortly after his arrival, he became a lead guitarist in Mr. Hall’s band.</p><p>In 1973, Mr. Rodriguez released his debut single and first Top 10 single, “Pass Me By (If You’re Only Passing Through).” His next three singles — “You Always Come Back (to Hurting Me),” “Ridin’ My Thumb to Mexico” and “That’s the Way Love Goes” — all topped the chart.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He was also nominated for the Country Music Association’s male vocalist of the year award in 1973 and won the Billboard Trend Setter Award for first Mexican American to capture a national audience.</p><p>In 1979, Mr. Rodriguez parted ways with his record label, Mercury, and signed with Epic. Three more of his songs — “Down on the Rio Grande,” “Foolin’” and “How Could I Love Her So Much” — later reached the Top 10. He continued making music into the 1990s.</p><p>In 1999, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/14/us/national-news-briefs-country-singer-acquitted-in-acquaintance-s-death.html" title="">a jury acquitted Mr. Rodriguez</a> of murder in the killing of an acquaintance he said was a burglar. The acquaintance, Israel Borrego, 26, was fatally shot once in the abdomen in 1998 at Mr. Rodriguez’s home in Sabinal. Lawyers for Mr. Rodriguez argued that he was justified under Texas law to defend himself and his property.</p><p>The singer, who was facing life in prison, rested his face in his hands as the verdict was announced. “I’m just sorry that the whole incident took place,” he said. “I don’t want to go through anything like this again.”</p><p>In 2010, he received the Pioneer Award from the Institute of Hispanic Culture, and in 2019, he was given the Living Legend Award from the Country Music Association of Texas. He released 35 albums in his four-decade career.</p><p>Mr. Rodriguez is survived by his two sisters, Antonia and Eloisa, and by his daughter, Aubry Rodriguez. His marriage to Debbie McNeely ended in divorce.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmaVAQaU6SU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">During an interview</a> in 2019, Mr. Rodriguez advised young artists to write their own material.</p><p>“It separates you from everybody else,” he said. “If you’re really honest about it, that’s the hardest part,” he added. “It’s like taking your clothes off in front of somebody.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Livia Albeck-Ripka is a Times reporter based in Los Angeles, covering breaking news, California and other subjects.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
