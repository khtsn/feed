Hegseth is being backed by a coalition of outside groups who have pressured Republican senators to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/us/politics/pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-trump.html" title="">confirm him or face a daunting political fallout</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-6aeb5e0e">Traffic eased after New York began congestion pricing</h2><p>It has been just over a week since New York City began charging drivers $9 to enter Manhattan’s busiest streets.
