In anticipation, fire crews were deployed to at-risk areas.</p><p>The National Weather Service said the winds could lead to “explosive fire growth” and put in place <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/weather/la-winds-fire-forecast.html" title="">a rare fire danger alert</a>. The same warning was issued last week when intense winds stoked two of the deadliest fires in California history; the flames decimated entire neighborhoods and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/palisades-wildfires.html" title="">left evacuees with no communities to return to</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/08/weather/los-angeles-fire-maps-california.html" title="">Here are the latest maps</a> of the blazes.
