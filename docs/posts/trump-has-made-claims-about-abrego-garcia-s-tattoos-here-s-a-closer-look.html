Many times, they actually say MS-13, those experts said.</p><p>“I can tell you, MS-13 does not equivocate; they don’t leave any ambiguity when it comes to their tattoos,” said Jorja Leap, an anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has been working with and studying MS-13 members for more than two decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia’s tattoos leave room for interpretation, Ms. Leap said, which does not align with the bold way MS-13 operates. The gang, she said, is proud of the reputation that it is violent and lethal, and members often showcase their association through their tattoos.</p><p>Sometimes, Ms. Leap said, the gang’s full name, Mara Salvatrucha, is tattooed in large letters on the chests of its members, or featured across their backs and down their arms. It also is not uncommon for the gang’s members to have MS-13 tattooed onto their cheeks and necks, she said, or to have tattoos of a devil-horns hand gesture — index and pinkie fingers up, everything else closed in a fist — because it’s the gang’s symbol.</p><p>“They are very clear, again, about their brand, and they espouse pride in it,” she said.</p><p>José Miguel Cruz, an expert in transnational gangs who has interviewed more than 2,000 members of Central American gangs, including members of MS-13, said nothing about Mr. Abrego Garcia’s tattoos signals MS-13 membership.</p><p>Mr. Cruz has seen MS-13 members with many versions of elaborate tattoos: full-face ones of MS-13 and also ones like 666 or a beast that represents Satan. But he said he has never seen the combination of tattoos that are on Mr. Abrego Garcia’s knuckles.</p><p>“The basic message here is that we cannot infer that he’s MS-13 just because of those tattoos,” said Mr. Cruz, an associate professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida International University.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Paul Bradley, the owner of Titan Ink, a tattoo shop in suburban Washington, where Mr. Abrego Garcia lived, has worked as a tattoo artist for 20 years. Referring to the tattoos on Mr. Abrego Garcia’s knuckles, he said he has tattooed each of those images on people countless times.</p><p>“I’ve pretty much done those tattoos on almost every spectrum of person: man, woman, young, old,” Mr. Bradley said. They are “just symbols that people like for one reason or another.”</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia’s tattoos helped his wife, Ms. Vasquez Sura, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/el-salvador-deportation-migrant-trump.html" title="">recognize him in photos</a> posted online of men at a prison in El Salvador, where migrants were sent after being deported from the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In this photograph released by El Salvador’s government on Facebook, Mr. Abrego Garcia is the second person down in the row on the right.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Secretaria De Prensa De La Presidencia</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Since Mr. Abrego Garcia’s deportation, the Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his release. The president has dug in, calling him a dangerous gang member who should not be let back into the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Law enforcement officials say the tattoos on Mr. Abrego Garcia’s hands do not qualify as singular and definitive evidence of membership in MS-13. While many police departments consider tattoos when trying to determine whether someone is a member of a gang, they also weigh other factors, including the use of hand signs or symbols linked to gangs and known association with gang members.</p><p>David C. Pyrooz, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder and an expert on gangs and criminal networks, said even a blatant MS-13 tattoo on someone’s neck or face would not guarantee active gang membership because that membership doesn’t last forever and tattoos are hard to remove. It might have been a tattoo that they had inked 10-15 years ago, long before they dropped out of a gang to get a job or start a family, as many gang members do, he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Juliet Macur is a national reporter at The Times, based in Washington, D.C., who often writes about America through the lens of sports.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>North Carolina Supreme Court Race:</strong> The Republican challenger has embarked on an extraordinary effort to reverse his election loss that critics say is testing the boundaries of post-election litigation. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/north-carolina-supreme-court-race-explainer.html">Here’s what to know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Starbase, Texas:</strong> It has been a rough patch for Elon Musk, but he is about to realize a dream for SpaceX, its employees and for himself: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/elon-musk-town-starbase-texas.html">His own town on the southern tip of Texas</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rigging of the Texas Lottery:</strong> Texas lottery executives blessed a scheme that ensured one player would win a $95 million jackpot in 2023.
