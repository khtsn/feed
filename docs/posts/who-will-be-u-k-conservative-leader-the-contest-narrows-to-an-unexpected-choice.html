It set off a whirlwind of theories about how Tory lawmakers, renowned for their Machiavellian instincts, managed to produce an outcome that almost none of them had predicted.</p><p>James Cleverly, a centrist former minister who was buoyed by a well-received performance at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/europe/uk-conservative-party-conference.html" title="">party’s recent conference</a>, had surged to the front of the field in Tuesday’s voting. But Mr. Cleverly, whose pitch to his party was that it should be “more normal,” was unexpectedly eliminated on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Whoever wins will face a prolonged, painful job of rebuilding a party that suffered the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/magazine/uk-politics-tories-conservatives.html" title="">worst electoral defeat</a> of its modern history in July — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/24/world/europe/uk-conservatives.html" title="">losing voters</a> not just to the victorious Labour Party but also to a hard-right, anti-immigrant party, Reform U.K., and the more centrist Liberal Democrats.</p><p>The new leader will be selected in the next few weeks by the party’s dues-paying members, who number fewer than 170,000 and are generally older, wealthier and less ethnically diverse than the broader British population. The winning candidate is set to be announced on Nov. 2.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Jenrick finished one vote behind Kemi Badenoch, center, a favorite of the right who has said the party needs to fight against “nasty identity politics.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Henry Nicholls/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Jenrick and Ms. Badenoch are vying to replace Rishi Sunak, the former prime minister, who has stayed in a caretaker capacity as party leader since July’s general election. </p><p>The choice offered to party members presents an early road map for how the Tories plan to set about rebuilding the party. Both candidates hope to secure right-wing voters and prevent further losses to Reform, which is led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/world/europe/nigel-farage-reform-uk-conference.html" title="">Nigel Farage</a>, the veteran political insurgent and ally of former President Donald J. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the final knockout round of voting, Ms. Badenoch won with 42 votes, ahead of Mr. Jenrick, who got 41. That pushed Mr. Cleverly, who won just 37 votes, out of the contest. Another candidate seen as a centrist, Tom Tugendhat, was eliminated in an earlier round on Tuesday.</p><p>While the leadership race has been lively and lifted the spirits of party members, the long-term outlook for the Tories remains bleak. They have only 121 seats in the House of Commons, compared with 403 for Labour, and their path back to power is complicated by the rise of Reform. Mr. Farage has seized on immigration, which the Conservatives were judged to have handled poorly during their 14 years in government.</p><p>For Tories, the only consolation since their defeat has been the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/world/europe/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-public-opinion.html" title="">rocky debut</a> of the Labour government. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been hobbled by internal feuding, which led this past week to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/world/europe/uk-pm-sue-gray-resigns.html" title="">the departure of his chief of staff</a>, Sue Gray, as well as by disclosures that he and his wife, as well as other senior Labour figures, accepted freebies from party donors.</p><p>However, the latest twist in the Tory race probably plays to Labour’s advantage, political analysts said. Labour officials professed happiness that Conservative Party members will now be given a choice between two right-wingers, suggesting that the Tories will focus more on reuniting the splintered right of British politics and less on trying to capture the center ground.</p><p>“After months of gaffes, wild unfunded policies and infighting, Tory members now have the unenviable task of choosing between two of the architects of Tory failure,” said the chair of the Labour Party, Ellie Reeves. “Both Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick are central figures in 14 years of hapless leadership and decline.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Voting by Conservative lawmakers was by a secret ballot. The outcome was so close that rumors swirled that the balloting had been skewed by some lawmakers trying to manipulate the outcome by eliminating a specific candidate.</p><p>Sometimes called the world’s most sophisticated electorate, Tory lawmakers have a reputation for skulduggery in leadership contests and of lending votes to one candidate in order to eliminate another. But such tactics can backfire, and there were suggestions that might have happened on Wednesday.</p><p>“Clearly there has been some vote lending going on and somebody — presumably James Cleverly or one of his supporters — has miscalculated pretty badly,” said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.</p><p>“The fact that the contest has come down to two avowedly Thatcherite culture warriors suggests we’re in for a few years of a Conservative Party obsessing about immigration, the trans issue, and the supposedly exorbitant cost of action on climate change, rather than what most voters really care about,” Professor Bale said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
