</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Conservatives and Wall Street investors had already expressed grave concerns that the measure would swell federal deficits, and some Senate Republicans have said they cannot back the legislation in its current form for that reason. That could derail the bill’s progress, given that the party can afford to lose no more than three votes in the Senate if all Democrats vote against it.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The United States government currently has roughly $29 trillion in public debt, and <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the budget office had previously forecast</a> that it would grow by roughly $21 trillion over the next decade, reaching nearly $50 trillion in 2034, as a growing share of Americans take advantage of government retirement support. With a roughly $3.8 trillion tax cut at its core, the Republican bill had long been expected to significantly add to that debt and make a precarious situation worse.</p><p>Hard-right lawmakers in the House demanded that the G.O.P. use its total control of Washington to also slash spending and contain the cost of the legislation. The cuts it included were ultimately significant, with changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act that the budget office projected would save roughly $1 trillion over a decade while also resulting in nearly 11 million Americans losing their health insurance.</p><p>But even with the bill’s cuts, which also include substantial reductions to food stamps, Republicans have fallen well short of their stated goal of covering the cost of the legislation and improving the nation’s fiscal standing.</p><p>That has drawn cries of protest from some in the party, highlighting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/republican-divide-spending-debt.html" title="">a fundamental disconnect between fiscal conservatives in the Republican Party and Mr. Trump</a>, who does not share their aversion to debt and has pledged not to pursue the kind of structural changes that would rein it in.</p><p>That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-rand-paul-republicans-policy-bill.html" title="">divide became clear this week</a> as the president attacked Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of the Republicans opposing the bill because of its cost. Elon Musk, the billionaire technology executive who had led Mr. Trump’s effort to slash government spending, echoed Mr. Paul’s concerns, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/technology/elon-musk-criticizes-republican-legislation.html" title="">blasting the legislation as an “abomination”</a> that would “burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>To defend the measure, some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/trump-budget-bill-republicans-tax-cuts.html" title="">Republicans and White House aides have taken to attacking the budget office</a> as politically motivated and unreliable, though several other nonpartisan, independent groups have also concluded that the bill would add significantly the debt.</p><p>Some administration officials have also trotted out a series of other familiar arguments to discount concerns about the bill’s effects on the debt. Chief among them is that the tax cuts would help the economy grow, thus paying for themselves.</p><p>Under this thinking, the tax cuts help people make more money and therefore pay more in taxes, even if their tax rates are lower. The budget office analysis released on Wednesday did not explore the possible economic effects of the legislation, but a previous estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation, another nonpartisan office, showed that the tax cuts would generate almost no additional economic growth.</p><p>The budget office’s analysis also may not fully account for the costs of the bill. The borrowing that would be necessary to finance it would cost the government roughly $560 billion in additional interest payments, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</p><p>On top of that, several of the tax cuts — including Mr. Trump’s campaign pledges to not tax tips and overtime pay — would last for only a few years. Those cuts would become far more costly if, as almost always happens with major tax reductions, they were eventually extended. A Joint Committee on Taxation analysis requested by Democrats found that extending those measures would add an additional $1.7 trillion in debt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Republicans last used this strategy in 2017, when they first put into place many of the tax cuts they are now seeking to make permanent. Back then, they scheduled many of the largest tax cuts, like lower individual income rates and a larger standard deduction, to end this year so that the overall cost of the legislation would fall under $1.5 trillion.</p><p>The ultimate judge of America’s debt problem is Wall Street. Global investors have long been happy to keep lending the government money, even as Congress increased spending and cut taxes. But in recent weeks, some analysts have started to question whether investor appetite for American debt could start to wane, a change that could raise borrowing costs across the economy, including for the government itself.</p><p>Moody’s downgraded the credit rating of the United States last month, the last of the major rating firms to cast some doubt on the country’s ability to pay its bills.</p><p>Margot Sanger-Katz<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Duehren covers tax policy for The Times from Washington.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>G.O.P.’s Bill Would Swell U.S. Debt by $2.4 Trillion<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Emergency Abortions</strong><strong>:</strong> The Trump administration announced that it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-emergency-abortion-rule.html">revoked a Biden administration requirement</a> that hospitals provide emergency abortions to women whose health is in peril, including in states where abortion is restricted or banned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crucial Global Vaccination Programs: </strong>The Trump administration’s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/health/trump-budget-global-health-polio.html">eliminates funding for programs that provide lifesaving vaccines</a> around the world, including immunizations for polio.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump and Antisemitism:</strong> President Trump’s effort to punish Harvard over antisemitism is complicated by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-antisemitism.html">extensive history of amplifying white supremacist figures and symbols</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Science Funding: </strong>Thousands of scientists, academics, physicians and researchers have responded to the administration’s executive order about “restoring a gold standard for science,” which puts Trump’s political appointees in charge of vetting scientific research and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/climate/executive-order-gold-standard-science.html">gives them the authority to “correct scientific information</a>.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Kennedy Center: </strong>Ticket sales and subscription revenue at the John F.
