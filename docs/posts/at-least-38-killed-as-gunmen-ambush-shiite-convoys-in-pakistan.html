The violence highlights the government’s persistent struggle to maintain control in the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Javedullah Mehsud, a senior district government officer, and Hidayat Pasdar, a journalist from Kurram, said that the latest attack involved separate ambushes of two convoys passing through Sunni-majority villages.</p><p>The vehicles had been traveling in opposite directions on the main road connecting Parachinar, a Shiite-majority town in Kurram, to Peshawar, the provincial capital 135 miles away.</p><p>The road, a vital lifeline for the district, had only recently reopened after being closed for three weeks because of an ambush on Oct. 12 that left at least 16 people dead.</p><p>During the closure, residents of Parachinar were cut off from essential supplies, including food and fuel, leading to a growing humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Earlier this month, thousands of people from Parachinar staged a peaceful 10-mile march demanding the road’s reopening and guarantees of security. The authorities responded by temporarily restoring access and promising government-protected convoys three times a week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but various militant groups, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/world/asia/pakistani-taliban-claim-deadly-market-bombing-in-parachinar.html" title="">Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or T.T.P</a>., have a history of targeting Shiite Muslims in the district.</p><p>Ali Amin Gandapur, the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, which includes Kurram, condemned the attack and directed the authorities to establish a provincial highway police force to secure key transport routes.</p><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent rights body, said that the repeated attacks in Kurram showed the federal and provincial governments’ failure to protect citizens.</p><p>“We demand immediate and decisive steps from both governments to permanently break this cycle of violence,” the commission said in a statement.</p><p>This year has been particularly deadly in Kurram. In late July, a weeklong clash between Sunni and Shiite communities left 46 dead and hundreds injured. Another bout of violence in September claimed 45 lives and wounded dozens.</p><p>“This violence has become a cycle that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/04/world/asia/pakistan-school-shootings.html" title="">authorities seem unable to break</a>,” said Sharif Hussain, a university student from Parachinar who had planned to travel to Peshawar in the coming days. “The state has abandoned us. Even in security-escorted convoys, we are left to die at the hands of terrorists.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
