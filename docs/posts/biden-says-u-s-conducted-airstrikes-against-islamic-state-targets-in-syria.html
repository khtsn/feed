    <h1>Biden Says U.S. Conducted Airstrikes Against Islamic State Targets in Syria</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“We’re cleareyed about the fact that ISIS will try to take advantage of any vacuum to reestablish its capability, to create a safe haven,” Mr. Biden said. “We will not let that happen. Just today, U.S. forces conducted a dozen precision strikes, airstrikes, within Syria targeting ISIS camps and ISIS operatives.”</p><p>Mr. Biden did not elaborate on the military actions, but U.S. officials planned to brief reporters later in the day.</p><p>After years of trying to manage foreign crises that cost his party in last month’s election, won by President-elect Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden sought to take a measure of credit for Mr. Assad’s downfall.</p><p>He said the victory of the rebel forces over Mr. Assad’s government was made possible by the collapse of his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/europe/russia-syria-assad-putin.html" title="">support from Russia</a>, Iran and Hezbollah, all of which the United States had a hand in. He noted that U.S. military aid and diplomatic support for Ukraine and Israel have bogged down Russian forces in Europe, helped destroy Hezbollah in Lebanon and thwarted two attacks by Iran on Israel. As a result, none could help Mr. Assad survive.</p><p>“Over the last week, their support collapsed, all three of them, because all three of them are far weaker today than they were when I took office,” Mr. Biden said.</p></div></div>
