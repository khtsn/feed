But he warned of the dangers of instability and vowed to prevent terrorists from regaining traction.</p><p>“At long last, the Assad regime has fallen,” he said in his televised remarks from the Roosevelt Room. “This regime brutalized and tortured and killed literally hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians. The fall of the regime is a fundamental act of justice. It’s a moment of historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a better future for their proud county. It’s also a moment of risk and uncertainty.”</p><p>To that end, Mr. Biden said U.S. forces had taken action on Sunday to wipe out pockets of the Islamic State, the ferocious radical group also known as ISIS that for a time took over broad swaths of Syria and Iraq until beaten back by a U.S.-led coalition. Experts in the region worry that the chaos of the coming days could provide an opening to the Islamic State to reconstitute itself as a major force in Syria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We’re cleareyed about the fact that ISIS will try to take advantage of any vacuum to reestablish its capability, to create a safe haven,” Mr. Biden said. “We will not let that happen. Just today, U.S. forces conducted a dozen precision strikes, airstrikes, within Syria targeting ISIS camps and ISIS operatives.”</p><p>Mr. Biden did not elaborate on the military actions, but U.S. officials planned to brief reporters later in the day.</p><p>After years of trying to manage foreign crises that cost his party in last month’s election, won by President-elect Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden sought to take a measure of credit for Mr. Assad’s downfall.</p><p>He said the victory of the rebel forces over Mr. Assad’s government was made possible by the collapse of his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/europe/russia-syria-assad-putin.html" title="">support from Russia</a>, Iran and Hezbollah, all of which the United States had a hand in. He noted that U.S. military aid and diplomatic support for Ukraine and Israel have bogged down Russian forces in Europe, helped destroy Hezbollah in Lebanon and thwarted two attacks by Iran on Israel. As a result, none could help Mr. Assad survive.</p><p>“Over the last week, their support collapsed, all three of them, because all three of them are far weaker today than they were when I took office,” Mr. Biden said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The upshot of this is for the first time ever, neither Russia nor Iran nor Hezbollah could defend this horrible regime in Syria,” he added. “This is a direct result of the blows” inflicted by Ukraine and Israel “with the support of the United States.”</p><p>In his remarks, Mr. Biden mentioned Austin Tice, the American journalist who has been held in Syria for a dozen years. Asked about Mr. Tice’s fate, Mr. Biden paused as he was walking out to say: “We believe he’s alive. We think we can get him back.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
