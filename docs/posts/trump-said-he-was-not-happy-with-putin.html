However, Trump declined to suggest any potential consequences for the Kremlin.</p><p>Instead, the president said that he would wait to see the results of negotiations over the next two weeks to establish whether President Vladimir Putin of Russia was stringing him along. Some of Trump’s allies in Congress have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-strikes.html" title="">urged him to impose new sanctions on Russia</a>. But he said that he hadn’t done so because he felt he was close to a deal to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Trump also argued that his recent criticism of Putin — who he said had “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/us/politics/trump-putin.html" title="">gone absolutely CRAZY</a>” over the weekend — spoke “pretty loud.”</p><p>In the Oval Office today, Trump issued a warning to another foreign leader he has spoken approvingly of: He said he had told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel that it would be inappropriate to take action against Iran right now, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-israel.html" title="">during negotiations for a nuclear deal</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A World Food Program warehouse in central Gaza today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-5e23e1a8">The U.N. condemned Israel’s new aid program in Gaza</h2><p>A senior U.N. official denounced Israel’s new aid system in Gaza as “an assault” on the dignity of Palestinians there. The U.N. and many other humanitarian groups <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/world/middleeast/israel-un-aid-gaza.html" title="">have boycotted the initiative</a>, which got off to a chaotic start yesterday.</p><p>The U.N. World Food Program said that crowds “of hungry people broke into” its warehouse in central Gaza today, and that at least two people had died.</p><p>“Israel says the new system makes it harder for Hamas to steal and hoard food,” Patrick Kingsley, our Jerusalem bureau chief, said. “The U.N. warns it will put civilians at risk by forcing them to walk for miles to a handful of sites in Israeli-controlled areas.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Tabarre neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jean Feguens Regala/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-5ddff2a0">Haiti hired an American contractor to fight gangs</h2><p>Erik Prince, a private military contractor and prominent ally of Trump, is working with Haiti’s government to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/haiti-erik-prince-blackwater-gangs.html" title="">conduct lethal operations against gangs that are terrorizing the nation</a>.</p><p>Prince’s team has deployed attack drones in Haiti that are meant to kill gang members, and he recently shipped a large cache of weapons to the country.
