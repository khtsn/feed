The declaration restricts social activities and allows police and military to enter homes without permission.</p><p>The president said the measure was in response to violence in certain parts of Ecuador. Ms. González described it as an attempt to curb political participation.</p><p>“Declaring a state of emergency in the middle of an electoral process due to alleged serious internal unrest is very questionable,” said Mauricio Alarcón Salvador, the director of Transparency International’s chapter in Ecuador, who added that the decision should be reviewed by the Supreme Court.</p><p>But he said that any claims of electoral fraud “must be substantiated,” something he saw as less likely given Mr. Noboa’s large margin of victory. “It cannot and should not be simply an assertion thrown into the air.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Noboa has positioned himself as a law-and-order president but has so far achieved minimal results in tackling the nation’s persistent drug violence and unemployment.</p><p>In the past five years, Ecuador has experienced an explosion in violence linked to drug trafficking. A justice system plagued by overcrowding in jails, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/13/world/americas/ecuador-drug-gangs-unrest.html" title="">corruption</a> and underfunding has become fertile ground for prison gangs allied with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/12/world/americas/ecuador-drug-cartels.html" title="">powerful international drug cartels</a>.</p><p>This shift has turned the once-peaceful nation of 18 million into a significant player in the global drug trade, disrupting the lives of Ecuadoreans and altering the country’s status in a volatile region.</p><p>At the same time, just <a href="https://www.mites.gob.es/mundo/consejerias/ecuador/es/trabajar/condiciones-laborales/index.html#:~:text=La%20tasa%20de%20empleo%20es,%2C%20empleo%20no%20pleno%2C%20etc." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">36 percent of Ecuadoreans</a> are adequately employed, according to government data, making the economy a top concern.</p><p>Mr. Noboa received 56 percent of the vote, compared with Ms. González’s 44 percent, with more than 97 percent of votes counted on Sunday evening, according to official figures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a race that was expected to be tight, Mr. Noboa took a decisive lead early in the night. By 8 p.m., hundreds of his supporters were gathered outside of the national electoral council in Quito blowing horns, waving flags and holding the emblematic cardboard cutouts of his likeness.</p><p>At the nearby headquarters of Ms. González’s party, hundreds of supporters were shouting “recount.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Daniel Noboa waves to supporters after a visit to a local market.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Alarcón for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Since 2023, the country has been shaken by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/10/world/americas/ecuador-fernando-villavicencio-assassination.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">the assassination of a presidential candidate</a> and the prison killings of six men accused of murdering him, as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/world/americas/ecuador-gang-prison-emergency.html" title="">several prison riots and the on-air siege of a TV station</a>.</p><p>To address the escalating crisis, Mr. Noboa <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/world/americas/ecuador-presidential-election-noboa.html" title="">declared a state of internal armed conflict</a> last year, authorizing the military to patrol both the streets and the prisons. Rights groups condemned his hard-line tactics as excessive and harmful.</p><p>But the increased security presence was short-lived, and many voters — even some who oppose Mr. Noboa — say they want more action from the authorities, not less. Homicides declined early in his presidency but soon began rising again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Noboa projected an image of himself on social media as the law-and-order candidate, but that posture wasn’t reflected in reality, according to Caroline Ávila, an Ecuadorean political analyst.</p><p>“On a day-to-day basis, you won’t find people on the streets doing surveillance,” she said. “But you will have a TikTok video reminding you of the last raid.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers guarding the Ismael Perez Pazmiño School in Machala, where the electoral material for the presidential elections was kept.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Alarcón for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Noboa also sought to cast himself as Ecuador’s best representative on the world stage, emphasizing his ability to build relationships with global leaders, including President Trump.</p><p>Mr. Noboa, a Harvard-educated heir to a multibillion-dollar banana empire, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/world/americas/ecuador-election-president.html" title="">took office in 2023</a> after his predecessor called for early elections amid impeachment proceedings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>He first entered politics just four years ago, when he ran for a seat in the national legislature. In the 2023 presidential contest, he managed to rise from the bottom of the polls to second place in the first round of voting after a strong debate performance. He then beat Ms. González in the runoff.</p><p>Ms. González, who served in various positions in the leftist Correa government, is largely seen as the representative of the former president, a divisive figure in Ecuador who led from 2007 to 2017. Many revere Mr. Correa for the booming economy, low crime rates and investment in health and education that Ecuador experienced under his government. But others condemn him for his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/world/americas/ecuador-correa-corruption-verdict.html" title="">corruption conviction in 2020</a> and his authoritarian tendencies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. González of the Citizen Revolution Party campaigning on Wednesday in Quito, Ecuador’s capital. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karen Toro/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Noboa has also been accused of having authoritarian leanings.
