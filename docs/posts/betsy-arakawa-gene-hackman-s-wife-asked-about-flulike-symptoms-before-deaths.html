Funeral services for the couple were held in Santa Fe this past weekend.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Police records released in the case on Tuesday included Ms. Arakawa’s Google searches a couple of days before her death, including “can Covid cause dizziness?” and “Flu and nosebleeds” on Feb. 10.</p><p>The next day, she emailed her massage therapist to cancel an appointment, writing that her husband woke up that morning with “flu/cold-like symptoms” but had tested negative for Covid. That day, she ordered oxygen canisters from Amazon for “respiratory support.”</p><p>The couple’s family had asked a court in New Mexico to prevent the authorities from releasing records related to their death, citing a desire for privacy. Mr. Hackman, known for his roles in “The French Connection” and “Hoosiers,” and Ms. Arakawa had lived for many years in a secluded neighborhood east of Santa Fe, at the top of a large hill. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-death-new-mexico.html" title="">They were frequently described as reclusive</a> and had grown even more isolated in recent years, particularly after the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Some news organizations opposed the family’s request, and a judge ordered that officials could release photographs and body camera footage as long as the couple’s bodies were not visible.</p><p>Multiple officers’ body camera footage that was released blurs out their bodies.</p><p>Mr. Hackman and Ms. Arakawa’s bodies were discovered on Feb. 26 after a maintenance worker who was working for the couple grew concerned when communication with Ms. Arakawa about fireproofing materials for the home suddenly ceased. When the worker went to the home with a neighborhood security guard, the two men found a partially open door leading to the bathroom where Ms. Arakawa was found lying on the floor; the security guard then called 9-1-1.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Investigators who responded found Mr. Hackman on the floor of the mudroom on the opposite end of the house. “He showed signs of active decay, including blackened hands with tissue breakdown,” Detective Joel Cano wrote in a report released on Tuesday.</p><p>One of the couple’s dogs, an Australian Kelpie named Zinna, was found dead in a crate, where she had been recovering from gallbladder and spleen surgery. A report from a veterinary lab determined that the dog most likely died from dehydration and starvation.</p><p>Footage from the room where Ms. Arakawa was found showed a counter scattered with pills, which were found to be unrelated to her death. Zinna was found in a crate in an adjoining room with dressers and a sofa.</p><p>The New Mexico Department of Health identified rodent feces in three garages and two smaller guest homes. Three sheds were also accessible to rodents, according to the department. On the day the couple’s bodies were found, a pest control worker was visiting the home to complete his monthly visit to treat the perimeter.</p><p>The extent of Ms. Arakawa’s symptoms ahead of her death are still unclear. On Feb. 11, security footage showed her visiting shops, including a pet food store and a grocery store, while wearing a medical mask. The next day, she called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/movies/gene-hackman-betsy-arakawa-died-later.html" title="">to schedule an appointment</a> with a concierge medical service, reporting symptoms of congestion, but did not show up. The autopsy found inflammation in her lungs.</p><p>The chief medical examiner overseeing the case has said that because Mr. Hackman, who tested negative for hantavirus, had advanced Alzheimer’s disease, it was unclear whether he was aware that his wife had died. There were no indications he had called for help.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a police interview with Mr. Hackman’s two daughters — whom he had with his first wife — they said he did not know how to operate a cellphone and could not send emails. They said they were aware their father had memory issues, according to the report by Detective Cano.</p><p>“They recalled that on Jan. 30, 2024, Gene had to be reminded three times that it was his birthday,” he wrote.</p><p>Matt Stevens<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs reports on national stories across the United States with a focus on criminal justice.
