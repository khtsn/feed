I’ve known him for a long time now. When we make a deal, I think the deal is going to hold. Now they’re going to have security. You’re going to have security. You’re going to have soldiers. I know France wants to be there. He’s — the president has said he wants to have soldiers there. I don’t think we’re going to even be necessary, but I don’t think there’ll be any problem with keeping the deal with the security.” “If there’s a deal in, we’ve got to make sure it’s a deal that lasts. And that is not temporary — that lasts. And that’s why we need to make sure that it’s secure. And we’ve went in and said, we’ll play our part and we’ve talked, and we will talk about how we work with yourself, Mr. President, to ensure that this deal is something which is not violated because it’s very important.” “It sounds as though one of you completely trusts President Putin, and one of you doesn’t trust him an inch. Have I got that right? Why do you trust him?” “Look it’s trust and verify, let’s call it that. And I think we both can be that way. You have to verify because you never know what’s going to happen.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/27vid-ukraine-trump-full-cover-qljc/27vid-ukraine-trump-full-cover-qljc-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">During a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, President Trump said repeatedly that he trusted President Vladimir V.

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/europe/trump-macron-starmer-ukraine.html" title="">visited earlier</a> this week.</p><p>“History must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,” Mr. Starmer said as he stood next to Mr. Trump in the East Room of the White House. The comments were sharper than those by Mr. Macron and other leaders, who have been hesitant to even subtly push back against Mr. Trump when visiting the White House.</p><p>“The U.K. is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal, working closely with our allies,” Mr. Starmer said. “Because that is the only way that peace will last.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The British prime minister used the visit to deliver a letter from King Charles III inviting Mr. Trump for a state visit, making it the first time an American president has been offered the honor twice. (Queen Elizabeth II hosted Mr. Trump for a state dinner during his first term.)</p><p>After opening the letter from the king, Mr. Trump called him “a great, great gentleman.”</p><p>But Mr. Starmer’s efforts to nudge Mr. Trump in Ukraine’s direction — even with the promise of a historic state visit — appeared not to have worked. Mr. Trump made no mention of U.S. forces supporting a peacekeeping mission that included British troops.</p><p>The prime minister’s attitude toward Mr. Putin could hardly be more different from that of Mr. Trump.</p><p>In the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Trump was asked what would happen if Britain sent peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, only for Russia to renege on a peace deal. Would the Americans come to the aid of the British in Ukraine if Russia went on the attack again?</p><p>In the span of one minute, Mr. Trump seemed to say no (“They can take care of themselves very well”), and then yes (“If they need help, I’ll always be with the British”), before landing back on no (“They don’t need help”).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Could you take on Russia by yourselves?” Mr. Trump asked Mr. Starmer, with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio sitting nearby. Uneasy laughter broke out in the room. Ukraine has felt the consequences of weak security agreements before: In December 1994, it gave up its Soviet nuclear weapons, which were still controlled from Moscow, and the United States, Britain and Russia agreed to respect the existing borders of Ukraine.</p><p>The agreement proved worthless when Russia seized Crimea in 2014. And while the agreement brought the Ukrainians arms and intelligence support in 2022 at the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, neither Britain nor the United States provided troops.</p><p>Beyond the diplomatic pleasantries of the day, the two men had been expected to have some difficult conversations about Ukraine’s future and whether a peace agreement results in concessions to Russia.</p><p>Mr. Starmer was prepared to urge Mr. Trump not to rush into a diplomatic resolution to the conflict without ensuring that Ukraine was given security guarantees that would prevent Russia from invading again.</p><p>But White House officials said Thursday morning before the meeting that discussions about the deal on rare-earth minerals — which Mr. Trump has said the United States needs — do not include such guarantees.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael D.
