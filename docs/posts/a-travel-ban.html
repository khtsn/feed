He cited the recent arrest of an Egyptian man who overstayed a tourist visa and was charged with attacking Jewish protesters in Colorado. (The restrictions don’t cover Egypt.)</p></li></ul><p>There’s also a list of exceptions, including green card holders, dual citizens, athletes traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup or the Olympics, and others. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-exceptions.html" title="">See who’s exempted</a>.</p><h2 id="link-484f05db">More immigration news</h2><p><strong>Harvard:</strong> Trump said he would prevent Harvard’s international students from entering the country.

For years, Tesla seemed like a window into the future as it grew larger than the Big Three automakers in Detroit. But during — and partly because of — Musk’s stint slashing government programs and laying off workers, Tesla has withered.</p><p>Its stock has tumbled since President Trump’s inauguration. Global sales have cratered. One blue state is nixing contracts. In Los Angeles, where I live, sheepish Tesla owners place “Bought Before the Plot Twist” stickers on their bumpers. Today’s newsletter is about how one of America’s great avatars of futurism broke.</p><h2 id="link-5bee62f6">A decline</h2><p>Tesla had a few troubles before Musk jumped into politics. The company was losing market share around the world to Chinese electric automakers like BYD, and it had abandoned plans to manufacture a completely new and cheaper model. Instead, Musk was hyping humanoid robots and self-driving taxis, technologies that seem a long way off from mainstream use.</p><p>But Musk’s sojourn in politics extracted a steep cost, partly by polarizing Tesla’s clients.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: LSEG Data &amp; Analytics | Data is through June 4. | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><ul><li><p>The <strong>stock price</strong> <strong>is down</strong> more than 17 percent since the start of the year, and <strong>profit fell</strong> 71 percent in the first three months of 2025.</p></li><li><p>Protesters have <strong>picketed Tesla showrooms</strong> around the world. They say they intend to expand their demonstrations.</p></li><li><p>People have <strong>vandalized Tesla vehicles</strong> and charging stations. A Colorado resident spray-painted “Nazi” onto a dealership sign.</p></li><li><p>In Germany (where Musk backed a far-right party) and Britain (where he said a civil war driven by migration was “inevitable”), <strong>registrations in April of new Teslas fell</strong> to their lowest points in more than two years. Elsewhere in Europe, the story is the same.</p></li><li><p>Last Friday, the agency that runs the New Jersey Turnpike said it would <strong>replace more than 60 Tesla-made electric vehicle chargers</strong> with another company’s chargers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Signs of distraction abound</strong>: Musk waited for months after the Trump administration imposed tariffs to ask for a briefing at Tesla about their impact on the firm, worrying some executives. In recent months, a board member has stepped in to fill him in on day-to-day operations.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-4b874484">Back to business</h2><p>Musk says he’s entering a new phase. He posted on X last month that he’s back to “spending 24/7 at work.” One sign of distance from Trump: He flayed the Republicans’ deficit-fattening policy bill as a “disgusting abomination” this week. (The current proposal would end financial perks for people who buy electric cars.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Musk, who has a Forbes-estimated net worth of $415 billion, is arguably the most successful businessman of his generation. He has spent his career overcoming obstacles (few took Tesla seriously as a competitor for the Big Three when he first invested in the company in 2004) and proving doubters wrong (SpaceX invented reusable rockets).</p><p>But Tesla is now the only publicly traded company in Musk’s empire, and during his season in politics he wiped out about $220 billion from the company’s market valuation.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/musk-house-republicans-trump.html" title="">are scrambling to appease Musk</a>, who is furious at them for voting for a bill to deliver Trump’s domestic policy agenda.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-5bbc5c69">War in Gaza</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gad Haggai and his wife, Judi Weinstein-Haggai, in an undated photograph.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Iris Weinstein Haggai, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><ul><li><p>Israel said its forces had recovered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-haggai.html" title="">the bodies of two Israeli Americans</a> who were killed in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7.</p></li><li><p>The U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/world/middleeast/un-security-council-gaza-cease-fire.html" title="">vetoed a U.N. resolution</a> that demanded an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.</p></li><li><p>Video of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000010207629/gaza-israeli-strike-palestinian-girl-silhouette-fire.html" title="">a Palestinian girl escaping a burning building</a> after an Israeli airstrike went viral online.

My colleagues at The Upshot <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/04/upshot/no-tax-on-tips.html" title="">examined it</a>. Among their findings:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Roughly 3 percent of U.S. employees work for tips: </strong>They include bartenders and blackjack dealers, waiters and delivery drivers. But the policy would create a huge incentive for workers like cashiers and retail salespeople to start earning tips.</p></li><li><p><strong>How much will tipped employees gain?</strong> It depends on how much they earn in tips. Though most would see some benefit, many — about a third — wouldn’t. Those who make enough to receive the break might typically pay around $1,800 less in taxes.</p></li><li><p><strong>More tips, more benefits:</strong> Workers who earn more in tips — at expensive restaurants or Vegas casino tables — stand to save more. This fits a broader theme of the bill: Higher earners have the most to gain.</p></li><li><p><strong>That has a limit, though: </strong>The legislation would halt the exemption for tipped workers who make more than $160,000. It’s a hard cutoff: A tipped worker making $160,001 would receive nothing and pay thousands in additional taxes.</p></li></ul><p>The tip policy would <strong>add $40 billion to the federal debt</strong> over four years, experts estimate. The Senate has taken up Trump’s legislation and aims to vote on it before the July 4 holiday. Republicans have a narrow margin in the chamber, and several members have criticized the size of the bill. Still, party leadership has deftly flipped holdouts in the past.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Late night hosts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/arts/television/stephen-colbert-elon-musk-ketamine.html" title="">joked about the bill</a>. </p><h3 id="link-2cf4eba6"><span><strong>IN ONE CHART</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: New York Times analysis of data compiled by @unitedstates project on GitHub | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Congress is getting older.
