But the revelation that not only the mayor but also many of the city’s most senior officials are embroiled in federal investigations further destabilizes an administration that is already reeling from other legal problems.</p><p>The investigations also raise questions about Mr. Adams’s ability to continue managing the nation’s largest city. And they threatened to further weaken his political standing as he faces a hotly contested Democratic primary next year in which he already was set to face several serious challengers.</p><p>Among the other officials the federal investigators sought information from were the deputy mayor for public safety and a senior adviser to the mayor, one of his closest confidants, the people said. Both men have had other legal challenges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The agents also searched the home and seized the phone of a consultant who is the brother of both the schools chancellor and one of the deputy mayors, the people said.</p><p>The nature of the investigations is unclear, but it appears that one is focused on the senior City Hall officials and the other touches on the police commissioner, the people said.</p><p>In an interview on Fox 5 New York on Thursday evening, Mr. Adams denied that the various federal investigations were a distraction.</p><p>“Everyone has heard me from time to time: Stay focused, no distraction, and grind,” the mayor said. “My job is to make sure I’m fighting on behalf of New Yorkers, and that’s exactly what I’m doing.”</p><p>Representatives of the City Hall officials — the first deputy mayor, Sheena Wright; her partner, Schools Chancellor David C. Banks; the deputy mayor for public safety, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/nyregion/philip-banks-corruption-investigation.html" title="">Philip Banks III</a>; and a senior adviser to the mayor, Timothy Pearson — could not be reached or declined to comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The consultant, Terence Banks, a brother of Philip Banks and David Banks, recently opened a government and community relations firm aimed at closing a gap “between New York’s intricate infrastructure and political landscape.” He, too, could not be reached for comment.</p><p>Several of the officials had their phones seized or records of their communications subpoenaed.</p><p>None has been accused of any crime.</p><p>In addition to the police commissioner, Edward A. Caban, several other department officials, including Mr. Caban’s chief of staff and two Queens precinct commanders, also had their phones taken by federal agents, two of the people said.</p><p>Tarik Sheppard, the Police Department’s chief spokesman, said he could not confirm the agents had subpoenaed the commissioner’s phone, but he said: “We will cooperate with the U.S. attorney’s office, and any of these questions on what was done need to be referred to them because this is not a joint investigation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police Commissioner Edward Caban was appointed last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Lisa Zornberg, City Hall’s chief counsel, said in a statement that the investigators had not indicated that the mayor or his staff were “targets of any investigation.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“As a former member of law enforcement, the mayor has repeatedly made clear that all members of the team need to follow the law,” said Ms. Zornberg, referring to Mr. Adams’s career in the Police Department, from which he retired as a captain.</p><p>The seizures of the phones belonging to David Banks and Ms. Wright and Philip Banks were <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/09/05/fbi-raids-homes-of-two-top-eric-adams-aides/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported by The City</a>, a nonprofit news site.</p><p>The investigations were being conducted by prosecutors from the office of the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, which is separately investigating the mayor and his campaign fund-raising along with the F.B.I.</p><p>The full scope of the fund-raising investigation into the mayor also remains unclear. But it has focused at least in part on whether Mr. Adams and his campaign conspired with the Turkish government to collect illegal foreign donations and whether Mr. Adams, in return, pressured the Fire Department to sign off on a new high-rise Turkish Consulate in Manhattan, despite safety concerns. It has also looked at free flight upgrades Mr. Adams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/05/nyregion/eric-adams-turkish-airlines-upgrades.html" title="">received</a> from Turkish Airlines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Representatives of the U.S. attorney’s office and the F.B.I. declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Adams has consistently denied wrongdoing, and the federal authorities have not accused him of any crimes.</p><p>His first deputy mayor, Ms. Wright, whose phone was seized, is outranked by few people in City Hall. A trusted adviser, she led Mr. Adams’s transition team before taking a position at City Hall as deputy mayor for strategic initiatives.</p><p>Ms. Wright was promoted to first deputy mayor in December 2022 and is responsible for the day-to-day management of the largest municipal government in the country, which employs close to 300,000 people. She often sits next to the mayor during his weekly press briefing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Wright, left, is a trusted member of the mayor’s inner circle.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Before joining Mr. Adams’s campaign, Ms. Wright, an attorney, was chief executive of United Way of New York City and also served as president and chief executive of Abyssinian Development Corporation, which was the community development arm of Abyssinian Baptist Church.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In 2013, Ms. Wright and David and Philip Banks were involved in an incident that raised ethical questions. Ms. Wright and Gregg Walker, her then husband, had a dispute that led to mutual allegations of domestic abuse and the arrest of both people. The City reported that David Banks called his brother Philip, then a high-ranking police official. The charges were dropped.</p><p>Ms. Wright has denied any wrongdoing in the case, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/06/nyregion/mayor-adams-women-promotions.html" title="">telling The New York Times in 2022</a> that she “never asked anyone to make any phone calls” on her behalf and that she was released “almost immediately not because of any outside influence, but because the facts of the case were so obvious.”</p><p>After taking office in 2022, Mr. Adams selected Philip Banks as his top aide overseeing public safety, though Mr. Banks himself had previously been ensnared in a federal criminal investigation.</p><p>Years earlier, the same federal prosecutors’ office conducting the current investigations named him an unindicted co-conspirator in an expansive corruption case that led to prison time for Mr. Banks’s then close friend Norman Seabrook, at the time a leader of the city’s correction officers’ union, among others.</p><p>Over the course of two years, prosecutors scrutinized Mr. Banks’s acceptance of gifts in 2013 and 2014 while he was chief of department, the city’s top uniformed police official. The gifts included paid vacations to the Dominican Republic and Los Angeles, cigars and a ring worn by Muhammad Ali. He received gifts from and socialized with two businessmen who were trying to curry favor with city leaders. One later pleaded guilty to criminal charges, cooperating with prosecutors, while the other was convicted at trial.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Philip Banks III, seen here in 2013, was named deputy mayor for public safety in 2021 despite being an unindicted co-conspirator in an expansive federal corruption case years earlier.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robert Wright for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But prosecutors did not charge Mr. Banks, concluding that they did not have sufficient evidence to prove that he had taken official action in exchange for the gifts he received, people familiar with the case have said.</p><p>After Mr. Adams appointed him, Mr. Banks tried to publicly assuage concerns about his past, apologizing in a <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2022/01/07/my-call-to-protect-and-serve-nyc-philip-banks-eric-adams-newly-appointed-deputy-mayor-for-public-safety-defends-himself/?clearUserState=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daily News column</a> for associating with the two businessmen because “even the appearance of our friendship was damaging to my profession.”</p><p>On Thursday, the first day of school, Schools Chancellor Banks, carrying a purple folder into his home, appeared bemused by the presence of reporters milling about.</p><p>As he punched in a code on a panel above the doorknob, he looked over his shoulder and asked, “What, was there a shooting or something?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>For his part, Terence Banks opened his consulting firm, the Pearl Alliance, after retiring from a position with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It was not clear whether the firm is a focus of the investigation that led to the search of his home on Wednesday — or whom the firm’s clients were. Mr. Banks does not appear to be a registered lobbyist with New York State.</p><p>The origins of the firm’s name are also unclear. But his brother Philip, the deputy mayor for public safety, and Mr. Pearson, the senior adviser to the mayor, both have had offices at 375 Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan.</p><p>Mr. Pearson, the senior adviser and close friend of the mayor, has this year been named a defendant in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/nypd-pearson-adams-lawsuit.html" title="">four sexual harassment suits</a> filed by former subordinates, three of them men who said they were appalled by his behavior toward women in the small unit Mr. Pearson oversaw.

Ms. Abbasova is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/nyregion/adams-fbi-corruption-investigation-aide.html" title="">cooperating</a> with authorities.</p><p>Days after the raids on the homes of Ms. Suggs, Mr. Öcal and Ms. Abbasova, federal officials stopped Mr. Adams after an event at New York University, asked his security to step aside, joined him inside his vehicle and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/nyregion/adams-fbi-investigation-phones.html" title="">seized</a> his electronic devices.</p><p>In July, prosecutors served federal grand jury <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/nyregion/eric-adams-fbi-investigation.html" title="">subpoenas</a> on Mr. Adams, City Hall and his campaign.</p><p>Separately, in February the Eastern District of New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/nyregion/fbi-adams-greco-investigation-nyc.html" title="">searched</a> two homes owned by Winnie Greco, the mayor’s director of Asian affairs.</p><p>On Thursday, political fallout from news of the search and phone seizures was swift, with several of Mr. Adams’s likely opponents in the Democratic primary pointing to the investigations as an unacceptable distraction.</p><p>“You can’t clean up this city’s problems when your own house is a mess,” said one of the opponents, Scott M.
