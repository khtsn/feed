And some of these events have become so intense that scientists have coined a new term: <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL108369" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">super marine heat waves</a>.</p><p>“The marine ecosystems where the super marine heat waves occur have never experienced such a high sea surface temperature in the past,” said Boyin Huang, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in an email.</p><p>The seas off the coasts of the <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/blog/2025/uk-waters-gripped-by-prolonged-marine-heatwave" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Kingdom and Ireland</a> experienced an unusually intense marine heat wave, one of the longest on record, starting in April and the temperature rise happened much earlier in the year than usual. Australia and its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/23/ningaloo-and-great-barrier-reef-hit-by-profoundly-distressing-simultaneous-coral-bleaching-events" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iconic coral reefs were recently struck</a> by heat waves on two coasts.</p><p>Scientists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00924-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">define marine heat waves in different ways</a>. But it’s clear that as the planet’s climate changes, the oceans are being fundamentally altered as they absorb excess heat trapped in the atmosphere from greenhouse gases, which are emitted when fossil fuels are burned.</p><p>Hotter oceans are causing drastic changes to marine life, sea levels and weather patterns.</p><p>Some of the most visible casualties of ocean warming have been coral reefs. When ocean temperatures rise too much, corals can bleach and die.<span>  </span>About <a href="https://icriforum.org/4gbe-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">84 percent</a> of reefs worldwide experienced bleaching-level heat stress at some point between January 2023 and March 2025, according to a recent report.</p><p>Last year, the warmest on record, sea levels rose faster than scientists expected. Research showed that most of that rise in sea levels <a href="https://sealevel.nasa.gov/news/282/nasa-analysis-shows-unexpected-amount-of-sea-level-rise-in-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">came from ocean water expanding as it warms, which is known as thermal expansion</a>, not from melting glaciers and ice sheets, which in past years were the biggest contributors to rising seas.</p><p>Excess heat in the oceans can also affect weather patterns, making hurricanes more likely to rapidly intensify and become more destructive. In <a href="https://wmo.int/media/news/ocean-heat-and-sea-level-rise-threaten-communities-south-west-pacific" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the southwest Pacific</a>, last year’s ocean heat contributed to a record-breaking streak of tropical cyclones hitting the Philippines.</p><p>“If we understand how global warming is affecting extreme events, that is essential information to try to anticipate what’s going on, what’s next,” said Marta Marcos, a physicist at the University of the Balearic Islands in Spain.</p><p>Dr. Marcos was the lead author of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413505122" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent study</a> published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that found that climate change has been responsible for the overwhelming majority of marine heat waves in recent decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/13/climate/00cli-turtle-cam-poster/00cli-turtle-cam-poster-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/13/climate/00cli-turtle-cam-poster/00cli-turtle-cam-poster-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/05/13/139944_1_00cli-turtle-cam_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Shark Bay off of Western Australia has the world’s largest sea grass meadows.

Joaquim Garrabou, a marine conservation ecologist at the Institut de Ciencies del Mar in Barcelona, started studying these events after witnessing a <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/11098401" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">die-off of sponges and coral</a> in 1999.</p><p>He and other scientists believed that with climate change, these die-offs would reoccur. “The reality is moving even faster than what we thought,” he said. “Having these mass mortality events is the new normal, instead of something infrequent, which it should be.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In 2012, a marine heat wave in the Gulf of Maine highlighted the risk these events pose to fisheries.

By 2023, the Northern shrimp population was estimated to have dropped to around 200 million.</p><p>Commercial fishing has always been difficult, but now, “climate change is taking that to another level,” said Kathy Mills, a senior scientist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute.</p><p>Complicating matters is the fact that much of the research on marine heat waves comes from just a few countries, including Australia, the United States, China, Canada, Spain and the United Kingdom.</p><p>“There are lots of regions around the world where monitoring isn’t as good as other places, and so we don’t really know what’s happening,” said Dan Smale, a community ecologist at the United Kingdom’s Marine Biological Association.</p><p>Rising ocean temperatures can also set off a domino effect through the marine food web, starting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/climate/plankton-ocean-warming.html" title="">at the bottom with plankton</a>.</p><p>Since the end of most commercial whaling in the 1970s and ’80s, humpback whales in the North Pacific had been recovering, reaching a peak population of about 33,000 in 2012.</p><p>But then came <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/climate/california-farallones-ocean-warming.html" title="">the heat event known as “the Blob”</a> that blanketed much of region from 2014 to 2017. The heat wave diminished wind and waves, limiting the nutrients that typically get churned up to the sea surface.

Mr. Cheeseman found a sharp drop in humpback whale sightings by 2021.</p><p>The decrease was so significant, at first he thought the Happywhale team was doing the math wrong. They spent several years checking, and <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.231462" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last year published a study</a> that concluded the humpback whale population in the North Pacific had fallen by 20 percent from 2012 to 2021. They attributed the decline to the loss of food like krill during and after the Blob.</p><p>With “an estimate of 7,000 whales having disappeared and not showing up anywhere else,” Mr. Cheeseman said, “there’s really no other explanation.”</p><h2 id="link-7f2faeaa">Looking Ahead</h2><p>Eventually, parts of the ocean might enter a constant state of marine heat wave, at least by today’s common definition. Some scientists see today’s shorter-term spikes as practice for this future.</p><p>Alistair Hobday, a biological oceanographer at Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, has been conducting public briefings with marine heat wave forecasts months ahead of time.</p><p>People are tuning in — and responding.</p><p>The critically endangered red handfish lives off the coast of Tasmania, crawling along the seafloor on fins shaped like hands. These unusual fish have only been found within two small patches of rocky reef and sea grass meadow.</p><p>In late 2023, Dr. Hobday’s forecast predicted potentially deadly marine heat waves. Researchers from the University of Tasmania’s Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, with support from the Australian Department of Climate Change, took a drastic step. They transferred 25 red handfish to an aquarium until the temperatures fell.</p><p>Jemina Stuart-Smith, an ecologist at the University of Tasmania, described those weeks as the most stressful time of her life. “If it all went wrong,” she said, “you’re talking about the potential extinction of an entire species.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-13"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="map-tasmania" data-id="100000010194685" data-source-id="100000010194685"><div slug="map-tasmania" data-sourceid="100000010194685" id="embed-id-100000010194685">
