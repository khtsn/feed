More than 11,500 service members in elaborate uniforms shouted, “Hurrah!” as they marched past the Kremlin’s walls. And a formation of bomber jets exuded exhaust that painted the sky above the onion domes of St. Basil’s Cathedral in the red, white and blue of the Russian flag.</p><p>“This is very impressive — you should be proud,” Badr Abdelatty, Egypt’s foreign minister, told me as he walked from the spectator stand.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A part of me was.</p><p>I was born in Siberia in the final years of the Soviet Union and was raised watching classic Soviet movies about World War II and attending the much more humble Victory Day parades in my hometown, where I earned my first pocket money collecting empty beer bottles on the street. The Soviet defeat of the Nazis has been Russia’s core nation-building myth since it emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Military vehicles, including some of Russia’s armored vehicles used in its invasion of Ukraine, were on display during the parade.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kirill Kudryavtsev/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>My peers and I believed, and continue to believe, that the 27 million Soviet citizens who died in World War II had made an incomparable contribution to the preservation of democracy in Europe. This view unites Russians, regardless of their political views or age.</p><p>Standing in the press area during the parade on Red Square for the first time and listening to a World War II song that I knew by heart from childhood — “Get up, immense nation, get up for a mortal fight” — ignited my pride in the sacrifices of my ancestors. But I don’t conflate the memory of World War II with Russia’s militarism today, a central aim of Kremlin propaganda and the core topic of my reporting.</p><p>The guests on the stands behind me underlined the Kremlin’s dual public relations message: Russia stands united with its own partners against what it presents as a standoff with the West in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>World War II veterans weighed down with medals rubbed shoulders with Russian celebrities in designer outfits, diplomats in suits with grizzled Russian soldiers on leave from Ukraine, the glamorous partners of Russian officials with African officers in desert fatigues and aviator sunglasses.</p><p>I don’t remember the last time I saw such diverse headwear at a public event: imitation World War II garrison caps, Cossack high hats, embroidered Iranian baseball caps with oversized visors and the dashing burgundy berets of Burkina Faso soldiers, who took power in a coup three years ago.</p><p>On the square, marching Russian soldiers and cadets were joined by visiting detachments from 13 allied nations, including China, Vietnam and Myanmar. On the central covered stand, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sat near the heads of over 20 countries, more than double the number who attended the parade last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir V.

Mr. Dmitriev is leading talks with the Trump administration to lift American sanctions and secure new American investment.</p><p>As a public relations stunt, the parade was a pricey one. Beyond the cost of transporting and housing tens of thousands of guests and participants, the parade brought economic activity in central Moscow, a city of 20 million, close to a standstill for days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Spectators lined up for the movement of Russian Yars intercontinental ballistic missile systems that were part of the parade.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yulia Morozova/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The parade was notable not only for those who came, but also for those who didn’t. In 2005, political leaders who attended included President George W. Bush; President Jacques Chirac of France; Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany; and the U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>This year, Slovakia’s prime minister, Robert Fico, was the only European Union leader in attendance.</p><p>The mix of nostalgia and patriotism was notable among some members of Russia’s cultural elite in the stands, who before the war traveled the world and hobnobbed with Western celebrities.</p><p>“Not the whole world came, of course,” said Sergey Mazaev, the dapper frontman of the prominent 1990s Russian rock jazz band Moral Codex. “But the most adequate ones came, because I tell you what: Moscow is the best place for partying in the world.”</p><p>The stone-faced officers from Asian countries standing at attention on the square as he spoke seemed unlikely candidates for Moscow’s nightclubs, but Mr. Mazaev’s point was taken.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The columns of soldiers and armored vehicles on the square played up the stereotypes of Russia’s inexhaustible resources and will at the heart of the country’s national identity and global projection. From an early age, we were taught in schools and by popular culture that Russia’s vastness, mixed with time, had swallowed up Nazi invaders, Napoleon’s armies and Teutonic knights — the great military powers of their eras.</p><p>The spectacle on parade signified to Russians watching on television and foreign visitors in the stands that no matter how many Russian soldiers are killed or maimed in Ukraine, Russia will raise and train more; no matter how many sanctions strangle its economy or Ukrainian drones blow up Russian warehouses, new tanks and howitzers will keep rolling from its factories.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fighter jets releasing contrails in the colors of the Russian tricolor flag.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kirill Kudryavtsev/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Though a powerful display, it masked Russia’s difficulties on the battlefield and in the economy.</p><p>After the parade ended, I spotted Grigoriy Ponomarenko, one of the few hundred surviving Soviet veterans who saw combat in World War II.</p><p>“The Russian people are the most tenacious people in the world,” said Mr. Ponomarenko, 99, who fought all the way to Berlin and shortly after Germany’s capitulation served as a bodyguard during the Potsdam Conference talks between Allied leaders. He said he saw Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill. “I wouldn’t eat for two days on end; all I cared about was that my pockets were filled with bullets.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mr. Ponomarenko came to the parade from the occupied Ukrainian city of Luhansk, where he was born and was drafted at 18 into the Soviet Army following the Nazi invasion.</p><p>“I am very happy that we are Russia now, because we speak Russian, we are Russian,” he said about his hometown, as a tear formed in his eye.</p><p>A push for what the Kremlin sees as ethnic unity between Russian and Ukrainian people, at least those in the country’s east, is one of Moscow’s central justifications for invading Ukraine.</p><p>Speaking to Mr. Ponomarenko made me realize the power of the Kremlin’s exploitation of World War II’s historical memory: Many in Russia believe they are once again defending their own.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anatoly Kurmanaev covers Russia and its transformation following the invasion of Ukraine.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>10</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>A Parade Intended to Stimulate Russian Pride in Sacrifice and Final Victory<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping Rebuke U.S.</strong><strong>: </strong>The two leaders, meeting in Moscow, rejected what they described as Washington’s attempt to contain them. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/putin-xi-meeting-trump.html">They also hailed their friendship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sanctions on Russia?:</strong> President Trump said the United States would impose sanctions on Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-trump-peace-talks.html">if it did not accept an extended cease-fire in its war with Ukraine</a>, writing on social media after a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p></li><li><p><strong>Odesa&#39;s Cultural Battle:</strong> A push to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/europe/odesa-ukraine-russia-culture.html">rename streets and remove statues associated with imperial Russia</a> is dividing Odesa, Ukraine, whose identity is tied up in its history.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Community Blown Apart</strong><strong>: </strong>The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/kyiv-russia-missile-strike.html">talked to more than a dozen family members, neighbors and friends of the victims</a> of the deadliest attack in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, since last summer.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘</strong><strong>We Lost Your Son’</strong><strong>: </strong>Russia lacks any formal, organized effort to account for legions of missing soldiers. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/russia-missing-soldiers-ukraine-war.html">That often leaves relatives in limbo</a>, fending for themselves with scant government information.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Verify Our Reporting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Our team of visual journalists analyzes satellite images, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/insider/verifying-images-of-the-war-in-ukraine.html">photographs</a>, videos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/28/world/europe/reskin-russian-radio-ukraine-war.html">radio transmissions</a> to independently confirm troop movements and other details.</p></li><li><p>We monitor and authenticate reports on social media, corroborating these with eyewitness accounts and interviews. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html">Read more about our reporting efforts</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
