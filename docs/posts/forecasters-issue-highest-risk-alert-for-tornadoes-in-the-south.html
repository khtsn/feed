They have the potential to form numerous significant tornadoes, some of which could be potentially violent, damaging hurricane-force (greater than 74 miles per hour) winds and golf ball- or even baseball-sized hail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>According to the Storm Prediction Center, Saturday is likely to be the third time in history that the Storm Prediction Center has issued a high-risk warning on the second day of a storm. Central Mississippi and Alabama face the highest risk level, 5, in the center’s rating system. The Gulf Coast states and Georgia face a high risk level of 4 on Saturday.</p><p>Storms at this highest level of alert can often produce intense long-track tornadoes, meaning they stay on the ground for a very long time. A slow storm will typically only affect one or two communities, but a faster-moving storm such as this one can cross multiple states, leaving a long trail of damage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Tornadoes typically occur across the South from the middle of March until late April, when the risk shifts to the Plains.</p><p>The threat of severe weather is expected to continue into the weekend, as the front pushes eastward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“There is a slight chance of severe weather anywhere from north Florida all the way up along the East Coast to the Washington, D.C., area, Philadelphia and just outside New York City,” Mr. Oravec said. “It’s not going to be as great a risk as areas farther to the west.”</p><p>The storm is expected to move offshore on Monday.</p><p>Hank Sanders<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
