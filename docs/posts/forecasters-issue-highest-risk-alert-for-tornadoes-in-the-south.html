Central Mississippi and Alabama face the highest risk level, 5, in the center’s rating system. The Gulf Coast states and Georgia face a high risk level of 4 on Saturday.</p><p>Storms at this highest level of alert can often produce intense long-track tornadoes, meaning they stay on the ground for a very long time. A slow storm will typically only affect one or two communities, but a faster-moving storm such as this one can cross multiple states, leaving a long trail of damage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Tornadoes typically occur across the South from the middle of March until late April, when the risk shifts to the Plains.</p><p>The threat of severe weather is expected to continue into the weekend, as the front pushes eastward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“There is a slight chance of severe weather anywhere from north Florida all the way up along the East Coast to the Washington, D.C., area, Philadelphia and just outside New York City,” Mr. Oravec said. “It’s not going to be as great a risk as areas farther to the west.”</p><p>The storm is expected to move offshore on Monday.</p><p>Hank Sanders<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Weather Coverage</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Extreme Weather Maps: </strong>Track the possibility of extreme weather <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/us/extreme-weather-forecast-maps.html">in the places that are important to you</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Snow Predictions: </strong>How much snow will fall where you live? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/upshot/snow-forecast-totals-lookup.html">See the full range of possibilities in the next few days</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Freezing Temperatures: </strong>A blast of Arctic air can be dangerous, especially when combined with blustery winds. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/freezing-temperatures-cold-weather-map.html">Track cold weather in the United States here</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cold Weather Safety: </strong>Experts offer tips to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/cold-weather-safety-frostbite-hypothermia.html">protect against common health hazards</a> in freezing temperatures.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protecting Pets From the Cold: </strong>When biting cold hits, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/well/family/pet-care-cold-weather-safety.html">a few simple precautions</a> can help pet owners mitigate the risks to their animals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Walking in Icy Weather: </strong>These tips can help you <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/well/live/walking-ice-snow-falling.html">avoid a fall on slick sidewalks</a> this winter.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
