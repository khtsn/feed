Each year, they identify climate change as a one of the top risks that the world faces.</p><p>And then, for a few days, they make pledges, speeches and impassioned calls to take rapid action and save the planet.</p><p>But does it do any good?</p><p>I’ve been coming to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum for a decade now.</p><p>I’ve heard presidents pledge to “<a href="https://www.edie.net/davos-2023-who-said-what-on-climate-and-environment/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keep 1.5 alive</a>,” a reference to the dangerous global warming threshold.

Last year was the hottest in recorded history, the first year in which global temperatures <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/09/climate/2024-heat-record-climate-goal.html" title="">averaged more than</a> 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than preindustrial times. And now, many of the corporations that made big climate pledges are walking back their commitments.</p><h3 id="link-bf7a10a"><span><strong>The mood at Davos</strong></span></h3><p>This year, the dissonance in Davos is particularly acute.</p><p>The conference opened on Monday, the same day that President Trump was sworn into office and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html" title="">withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement</a>. In a speech broadcast live to the W.E.F. conference Thursday, Trump called the Paris Agreement “one-sided,” attacked Biden’s “ridiculous and wasteful” climate programs and unapologetically promoted fossil fuels.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
