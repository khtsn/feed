Mr. Flynn also started making his own product: <a href="https://www.bronxhoney.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boogie Down Bronx Honey</a>. As his passion grew, he was moved to teach beekeeping to children in the neighborhood.</p><p>“Hearing kids talking, they think the ticket out of the hood is with a basketball or a microphone,” he said. He wanted to expand their range. His work caught the attention of Hannah Rafkin, a documentary filmmaker, and last week, “Keeper,” the beautifully moving short film she made about his work against the backdrop of his struggles with cancer, made the <a href="https://press.oscars.org/news/97th-oscarsr-shortlists-10-award-categories-announced" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oscar shortlist</a>.</p><h2 id="link-5c241e29">Clara Wu Tsai</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Clara Wu Tsai, center, with her husband, Joe Tsai, and Ellie the Elephant, the mascot of the New York Liberty.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Seth Wenig/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On Oct. 24, the New York Liberty celebrated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/nyregion/new-york-liberty-win-wnba-parade.html" title="">their first W.N.B.A. championship</a> with a parade in Lower Manhattan.

Flaco, as you will recall, gained international fame after someone mysteriously cut loose his mesh enclosure at Central Park Zoo, setting him free. Later, fascination fell on a male coyote in the park. But it wasn’t until the presence of a female coyote was confirmed this past summer that the paparazzi started paying attention.
