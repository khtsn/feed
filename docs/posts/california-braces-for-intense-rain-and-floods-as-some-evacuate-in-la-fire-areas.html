Shortly thereafter, the Weather Service issued the same warning in the Altadena area, where thousands of structures were destroyed by the Eaton fire, and across much of Los Angeles County, affecting about seven million people.</p><p>But by early evening, the brunt of the rain had passed through the Los Angeles area without causing widespread damage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s moving out,” said Carol Smith, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</p><p>The biggest concern was that a torrent of rain within a short period could have caused landslides in the wildfire areas. At one point on Thursday, muddy water cascaded across parts of the <a href="https://x.com/CaltransDist7/status/1890150590044614933" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pacific Coast Highway</a>, prompting officials to close the roadway. </p><p>The Weather Service received several reports of strong winds across Southern California, with gusts of more than 77 miles per hour in some areas. In Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles, awnings and carports suffered wind damage.</p><p>More than 100 homes were under mandatory evacuation orders in the city of Los Angeles, Jim McDonnell, the Los Angeles police chief, said Thursday morning. The Palisades fire destroyed thousands of homes in the city’s Pacific Palisades neighborhood last month, and hillsides remain vulnerable in the area.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-02-13-california-evac-embed" data-id="100000009989915" data-source-id="100000009989915"><div slug="2025-02-13-california-evac-embed" data-sourceid="100000009989915" id="embed-id-100000009989915">

On Thursday morning, some residents in Sierra Madre, Calif., were told to evacuate before the worst of the storm.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Concerns this week had extended beyond areas affected by the Palisades and Eaton fires. Mark Pestrella, the director of the Los Angeles County Public Works Department, said on Wednesday that any burn scar area from a fire within the past year was at risk.</p><p>In Orange County, the Sheriff’s Department issued an evacuation warning for the area near the site of the Airport fire, which burned more than 20,000 acres in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains. In San Bernardino County, the sheriff’s office also issued an evacuation order in some mountainous areas, citing the potential for mud and debris flow.</p><p>In Altadena, Makis Dasigenis, 69, said on Thursday afternoon that exhaustion from the firestorm and, now, the pounding rain was setting in among residents. Mr. Dasigenis, a retired banker, described how he fought to save his home during the Eaton fire using a water pump.</p><p>“All of us are dealing with insurance companies and trying to arrange for cleanup and this and that,” he said. “It’s been exhausting, and it will take months before it’s over.”</p><p>As stronger rain began to hit the neighborhood, Mr. Dasigenis said he wasn’t too worried about a mudslide or debris from the storm, which he felt would be more of a concern farther north from his home toward the San Gabriel Mountains.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services said that, to prepare for the heavy rain, it had positioned resources across 14 counties, from Sonoma County in Northern California to San Diego County at the southern border.</p><p>Intense storms had also hit the Bay Area and other parts of Northern California. On Thursday morning, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office issued <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/posts/pfbid02tYNaWNp8xtEeeEJJgM1xS2xvma3xmStw6qMitdRt2YLH1P5jWKvhm55SJZ4UeWP8l" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an evacuation order</a> for parts of the county because of rising creek levels; evacuation orders were lifted by the early afternoon.</p><p>In the Sierra Nevada, snow was heavy enough to force the closure of Interstate 80 because of low visibility and vehicles spinning out on icy road surfaces, <a href="https://x.com/CaltransDist3/status/1890178796311236660" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Caltrans.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Officials in Santa Barbara County, which experienced a deadly mudslide in 2018 along with flooding in recent years, had been preparing for the storm since late last week, said Jackie Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the county’s emergency management office.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We had back-to-back years of pretty intense rain here,” Ms. Ruiz said, “so it’s something that we’re very familiar with in the community.”</p><p>On Wednesday, sheriff’s deputies knocked on the doors of about 50 properties within the burn scar area of the Lake fire, which burned more than 38,000 acres last year, Ms. Ruiz said. Officials were also trying to reach people who live in encampments in creek beds, underpasses and other places that are prone to flooding, she said.</p><p>Jonathan Wolfe<!-- -->, <!-- -->Amy Graff<!-- --> and <!-- -->Amanda Holpuch<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
