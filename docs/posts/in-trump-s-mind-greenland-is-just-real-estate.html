Spoiler: If you elect him again, don’t be surprised when he actually goes for it.</p><p>In fact, President-elect Donald Trump did not wait to be sworn in before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/us/politics/trump-greenland-panama-canal.html" title="">reviving his bid for Greenland</a>, which he has upgraded to an “absolute necessity.” So it’s worth checking out what he finds so tempting in this big chunk of ice.</p><p>The idea was floated early in his first term by a good friend of his, the cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, but Trump typically adopted it as his own and ordered his minions to get on it. “I’m a real estate developer,” he explained to reporters interviewing him for a book. “I look at a corner, I say, ‘I’ve got to get that store for the building that I’m building,’ etc. It’s not that different.” Greenland, he conceded, was more than a corner store: “I love maps. And I always said, ‘Look at the size of this. It’s massive.’ That should be part of the United States.”</p><p>Greenland, to be precise, is not a country. It’s a self-governing part of Denmark. But such technicalities are not a problem to a Manhattan real estate developer. Nor is the fact that the governments of Denmark and Greenland have reiterated that the island is not for sale. In Trump’s business, that’s an opening bid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And Greenland, apart from looming bigly on a Mercator projection of the world, is a very desirable chunk of real estate, with huge potential for development. Trump is not the first American president to eye it; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/16/trump-greenland-purchase-harry-truman-denmark/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Andrew Johnson floated the idea in the 1860s</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/22/753192368/fact-check-did-harry-truman-really-try-to-buy-greenland-back-in-the-day" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harry Truman offered Denmark $100 million</a> for it in 1946.</p><p>Greenland has abundant riches, including rare-earth elements, and lies strategically over the eastern gateway to the fast-melting Northwest Passage. The United States maintains the <a href="https://www.petersonschriever.spaceforce.mil/Pituffik-SB-Greenland/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pituffik Space Base</a> there for missile defense and space surveillance. China has shown keen interest in putting its money into Greenland, though its efforts to build three airports there have been resisted by the United States.</p><p>Trump may have personal motives, too. When he raised the idea in his first term, the Danish prime minister called it “absurd.” Trump promptly canceled a scheduled visit to Denmark. He doesn’t forget slights.</p><p>Can the U.S. really afford this gigantic ice cube? The Washington Post has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/16/trump-wants-buy-greenland-how-much-would-it-cost/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated a price of about $1.7 trillion</a>. But might Greenland’s 56,000 residents, who have the right to declare full independence from Denmark anytime they want, be tempted by a lower offer? Would the 57,000 residents of, say, Hoboken refuse a million dollars each to secede from New Jersey and join New York? Manhattan, after all, went for $24 in beads and trinkets, the Louisiana Purchase for $15 million and Alaska for $7.2 million.</p><p>OK, so the “Buy Greenland” joke isn’t so funny anymore. But, hey, did you hear the ones going around about annexing Canada and buying the Panama Canal? This guy cracks me up.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Serge Schmemann joined The Times in 1980 and worked as the bureau chief in Moscow, Bonn and Jerusalem and at the United Nations.
