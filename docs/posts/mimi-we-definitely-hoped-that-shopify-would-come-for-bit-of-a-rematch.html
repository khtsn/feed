<p>While the rest of the competitive fanbase eagerly awaits the conclusion of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/vct-2025/?stage=242" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/champions-tour-2025-masters-toronto" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>, four teams have silently prepared for an annual offline event in London.</p>

</span> are set to take the stage at the Red Bull Gaming Sphere in a two-day LAN in an event that comes with a bit of a twist. Each team is required to fit three Duelists into their team composition throughout the entirety of the event, no exceptions.</p>

<p>To some, an event of this caliber and ruleset may seem like a waste of time. However, to many of the players – some of which may not have had proper LAN experiences – it is an opportunity to showcase their talents to the rest of the scene. </p>

<p>VLR had the opportunity to gather the thoughts of two attendees ahead of their matches at the Gaming Sphere. G2 Gozen&#39;s <span data-ref-id="4">Michaela		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/17323/mimi">mimi</a>&#34;

</span> would come for a bit of a rematch, but getting to compete with other regions is always a blessing… Obviously it&#39;s really hard to predict what&#39;s actually gonna go down because of having to have three Duelists. It&#39;s very hard to prepare for it, but just like last year it&#39;s really about which team is better at adapting and understanding how to make it work.”</p>

<p>The triple Duelist rule adds a little bit of spice to the games for viewers to enjoy. While teams are forced to base their entire composition around it, sarah believed there were certain benefits to the unorthodox setups that could impact teams.</p>

<p>“It&#39;s unusual because you don&#39;t really get three Duelists anywhere, so you have to go out of your comfort zone a little bit and play super aggressive, which we&#39;re kind of known for.” she stated. “Playing three Duelists means there&#39;s a lot of gaps on the map… you have to be super aware of your surroundings when you&#39;re in the game. You have to be very vocal, and it forces you to be super aware of everything that&#39;s going on.”</p>

<p>On top of the unique twist on the game, players also get to experience the benefits of playing in-person alongside their teammates. For many Game Changers competitors, the limited amount of opportunities within the scene can also put a damper on their involvement at LAN events; there simply aren&#39;t a lot of in-person events exclusively for the Game Changers scene. Tournaments like Instalock help give players the necessary experience they may need in the future in a healthy, safe, and fun environment.</p>

<p>“More than anything, I&#39;m really happy that we have something else outside of [Game Changers].” Mimi said. [We] get to meet and be together, and get a bit more experience playing together offline, which I think is the most important thing. You also get in these pressured situations with this constant adaptation. It&#39;s a good test, and it prepares you [well] for the year. I think it&#39;s always good having big team names coming to events like this and [running] them with a twist. Ultimately, I think this will catch people&#39;s attention, but I think what people really want to see is Mary versus Gozen or sarah versus Gozen or FlyQuest all the way from NA. These kinds of storylines are always really worth watching, and you don&#39;t really have that usually until the end of the year. Getting a little teaser at the start is [great].”</p>

<p>Speaking from experience, mimi was aware of the previous formats that often saw Game Changers culminate in one big tournament at the end of the year. However, recent changes from Riot allowing for such tournaments like Red Bull Instalock and the Spotlight Series have brought more exposure and eyes on not just teams, but individual players who could have very bright futures. mimi was hopeful for the future of the scene as a result of these changes.</p>

<p>“I think what is being done already is pretty awesome. One thing that I know that everyone has been talking about has been a [mid-year] Masters in Game Changers. Obviously there are way more factors to that, but I think it would be a fun thing. Overall, I&#39;m very happy with how things are and I do think that we have a lot of opportunities; Red Bull has been running a lot of tournaments, inviting Gozen for Homeground, Instalock… There are still a bunch of tournaments. If there were way too many, it would be too much, so I do think we have a sweet spot. We are wishing for a Masters… and a Game Changers Championship bundle to support orgs investing in the Game Changers scene.”</p>

<p>A veteran in the scene who&#39;s competitive career dated back to the CS:GO days, mimi has seen her fair share of leagues, tournaments, and events, all while competing at a high level, a feat maintained throughout her transition to Valorant. She has survived many of the roster changes at G2 Gozen, and is eagerly awaiting a match against some of her former teammates.</p>

<p>“I am so excited [to play] against them. Especially <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/17333/mary">
		Mary	</a>
</span>, because we have not played against each other since Split 3 last year. They – Falcons Vega – are a completely different roster. We know how crazy APAC is, so I&#39;m really curious as to how they&#39;re making it work… combining it with the APAC playstyle. They&#39;re aimers… that&#39;s probably gonna be the hardest matchup because all five of them can just run a Duelist.”</p>

<p>“They picked up three of the best players from APAC, so I really want to see how they come together as a team.” sarah added.</p>

<p>After turning heads at last year&#39;s Game Changers Championship, Falcons Vega underwent crucial roster changes, picking up talent from APAC in hopes of making a deeper run this year. Like them, many teams across Game Changers have been bolstering rosters as players shuffle around looking for the right team.</p>

<p>Similar to the caliber of OFF//SEASON events, Instalock provides these teams a way of testing their Stage 1 rosters even further in the form of an offline event. Teams can look to build synergy and compatibility in a low-stakes environment where everyone is forced onto the same playing ground, while viewers get to enjoy some of their favorite teams and players clash internationally.</p>

<p>With a bid at a title earlier than expected, all four teams look to impress and take home a trophy for their region ahead of the next stage. Not many are presented with this opportunity, but none of the talents present will squander their chance at glory.</p>
