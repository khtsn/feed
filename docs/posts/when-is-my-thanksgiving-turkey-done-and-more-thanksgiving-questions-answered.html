In fact, Melissa Clark recommends pulling it out at 155 degrees on instant-read thermometer. It’ll reach the U.S.D.A.-recommended 165 degrees while it rests, and it’s better to pull the turkey out ever-so-slightly early than risk tough, overcooked meat. (Here’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/article/how-to-cook-thanksgiving-turkey" title="">even more turkey guidance</a> from Melissa.)</p><p>Lastly, if you <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023649-thanksgiving-stuffing" title="">stuff</a> your bird, you’ll want to measure its temperature as well. It should be 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. And, in case you’re wondering how long that might take, the chart below can help:</p><figure><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px)" width="1080" height="1350" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/dining/18turkeyfaq/17turkeyfaq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?format=pjpg&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600 600w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/dining/18turkeyfaq/17turkeyfaq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?format=pjpg&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1160px"/><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/dining/18turkeyfaq/17turkeyfaq-superJumbo.jpg?format=pjpg&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" alt="A photo of a whole cooked turkey overlaid with type reading “How Long Should You Cook Your Turkey?” and an accompanying chart.

The U.S.D.A. also suggests inserting your thermometer in “the thickest part of the breast, the innermost part of the thigh and the innermost part of the wing.” But avoid touching the bones, which can alter the temperature reading.</p><p>For Thanksgiving, it’s really worth investing in an instant-read thermometer.

But, <strong>if you don’t have a thermometer, you can use a fork to pierce the thickest part of the thigh</strong>. If the juices run clear, it should be done. A little pinkness in the thigh meat is not a bad sign, but if something looks translucent and pink, with pink or red juices (especially in the <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022747-salt-and-pepper-roast-turkey-breast" title="">breast</a>), it’s not ready.</p><p>Remember that if you pull out the bird too early, Thanksgiving isn’t ruined.

To start, slice along the natural line between the leg and the breast, pulling the leg and thigh away from the body as you slice, and looking for the “hip” joint to cut through. Then, remove the wings in the same way, slicing the wing away from the breast, and twisting it to find the “shoulder” joint to cut through. Once the legs and wings are removed, you’ll cut off the breast meat. Find the breast bone that runs down the length of the turkey, and slice each breast away from the breast bone.

If your bird hasn’t yielded enough pan juices, you can use melted butter, too.</p><p>Speaking of those pan juices, if you’re wondering <strong>how to make turkey gravy from drippings, </strong><strong><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016906-turkey-gravy" title="">this recipe can help</a></strong>.

Spatchcocking a bird makes it cook more evenly and, crucially, much faster. </p><p>To spatchcock, you want to use kitchen shears or a sharp knife to carefully remove the backbone by cutting it on either side. (Save it for stock.) Then, press down between the breasts with the bones facing down until you hear a crack. The bird should lay flat against your work surface. </p><h2 id="link-435e5356">How do I smoke a turkey?</h2><figure><picture><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/03/dining/Turkey-Smoked-Outdoors/Turkey-Smoked-Outdoors-superJumbo-v3.jpg?format=pjpg&amp;quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" alt="A side image of a golden-brown turkey on a grill.

To do it on your charcoal grill, set it up for indirect grilling and add a drip pan (or set your smoker to 275 degrees). Make sure your bird is quite dry, and place it on the grate over the drip pan. Top the coals with about ½ cup of soaked wood chips, and cover the grill, adjusting the vents to make sure the temperature stays at 325 to 350 degrees. After every hour, baste the bird, replenish the charcoal and add more soaked wood chips. A 10- to 12-pound turkey should be done in 2 ½ to 3 hours.

The first method — a dry brine — calls for rubbing the turkey with salt and refrigerating for up to three days, while a wet brine calls for letting the bird soak in a salt solution. Both have their benefits and drawbacks. If you’re just starting out, you may look to a <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012869-dry-brined-turkey" title="">dry brine</a>, which requires less equipment (no large pot or cooler necessary).
