Dennehy, the head of the F.B.I.’s New York office. His brother, Oren Alexander, will have another hearing on the same matter in Miami on Tuesday after one of his lawyers requested a health-related extension.</p><p>Oren and Alon, twins who are both 37, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/realestate/alexander-brothers-arrested-charged-sexual-assault.html" title="">were arrested in Miami Beach</a> in December along with their older brother, Tal Alexander, 38, following months of mounting public allegations. All three are accused of using their wealth and status to lure, drug and sexually assault dozens of women, according to an indictment made public on the day of their arrest. They are expected to be arraigned, and to enter pleas, in a Manhattan federal court.</p><p>Until this summer, Oren and Tal Alexander were among the most successful real estate agents in the country. Known for brokering multimillion deals in New York and Miami, they reached the top ranks at Douglas Elliman, one of the nation’s largest brokerages. In 2019, they helped broker the sale of a nearly $240 million penthouse in Manhattan — at the time, the most expensive residential sale in U.S. history. They later co-founded their own real estate brokerage, Official. Alon Alexander, Oren’s twin, is an executive at the family’s private security firm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In addition to the federal sex trafficking charges, the twins also face state charges in Florida for sexual battery, stemming from three separate incidents. Oren Alexander faces charges in all three. Alon Alexander faces charges in one.</p><p>Oren and Alon Alexander were both present in court on Friday, as were their parents, Shlomo and Orly Alexander; Alon Alexander’s wife, Shani Zigron; and Oren Alexander’s wife, Kamila Hansen, who recently gave birth to the couple’s first child. The brothers arrived in khaki prison suits and shackles on their wrists and ankles. Orly Alexander could be seen crying as her sons entered the courtroom; Kamila Hansen and Shani Zigron, both fashion models, wore face masks. Shlomo Alexander donned a yarmulke in the presence of the judge, but removed it as soon as the hearing concluded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Orly Alexander, whose sons Tal, Oren and Alon Alexander face federal sex trafficking charges, leaves the C.

Orly Alexander runs Kent Security Services, the family’s business, alongside her brother, Gil Neuman. Shlomo Alexander is a real estate developer. The couple own a waterfront mansion in Miami’s exclusive Bal Harbour neighborhood that is worth an estimated $14 million.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Friday marked the second bond hearing for Alon and Oren Alexander. On Monday, Howard Srebnick, a lawyer for Alon Alexander, told Magistrate Judge Eduardo Sanchez that the family was prepared to post unlimited bond to secure the twins’ pretrial release, adding that they would not object to having bail set as high as $1 billion, even if it would leave the family destitute. They also offered to pay for private home detention monitoring by V2 Global, a security company whose shareholders include Jim Milford, former deputy administrator for the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Donald De Lucca, former Miami Beach police chief.</p><p>Judge Sanchez said he would need several days to consider the request, and ordered a second hearing. The government then submitted a letter, signed by federal prosecutors in both Manhattan and Miami, describing the family’s proposal as a “private jail” that “attempts to leverage their wealth to seek special treatment.”</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Srebnick presented a firmer offer to Judge Sanchez: The family would post any sum in bail, no matter how high, and Alon Alexander would be confined to a two-bedroom apartment in Miami with round-the-clock monitoring by V2 Global.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Defense attorney Howard Srebnick speaks to the media outside the C.

They can’t prevent it.”</p><p>Judge Sanchez said he was also concerned about the risk of flight, as well as a “two-tier system of justice, one for the wealthy and one for those who are not wealthy,” and ordered Alon Alexander to remain in custody.</p><p>Oren Alexander was then called before the judge. But Richard Klugh, one of his lawyers, asked the court for an extension, citing health issues that had prevented him from sufficiently meeting with his client before the hearing. Judge Sanchez granted the request, setting Oren Alexander’s third detention hearing for Tuesday.</p><p>Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom after the hearing, Mr. Srebnick said that he was “obviously disappointed” in the decision, but he believed that once all three brothers arrived in New York, a judge there would reconsider granting bond so they could “work with their lawyers and not be faced with the abominable conditions of the metro detention center in Brooklyn.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>He added that he believed that the more than 40 women who have come forward to accuse the brothers of assault and rape are “profiteering.” Asked if he believed that the women were lying about their stories, Mr. Srebnick said, “Yes. Every one of them.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tal Alexander, left, and his brother Oren in 2020.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David X Prutting/BFA.com, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>According to the federal indictment, the three brothers conspired in the sex trafficking scheme for at least 14 years. Coordinating with other men, they arranged events and domestic and international trips as bait to recruit, entice and transport women, whom they later raped, the indictment says.</p><p>Friday’s hearing was similar to Tal Alexander’s hearing in December, when the family offered to post $115 million in bail to secure his pretrial release, using the Bal Harbour home as well as the headquarters of Kent Security Services as collateral. A federal magistrate judge, Lisette M. Reid, declared Tal Alexander a flight risk and the offer was denied.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Debra Kamin reports on real estate, covering what it means to buy, sell and own a home in America today.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/debra-kamin">More about Debra Kamin</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
