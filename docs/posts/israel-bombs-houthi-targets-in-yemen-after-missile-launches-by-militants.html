The report could not be independently verified. The attack also damaged the airport in the city, a Houthi stronghold, according to initial reports.</p><p>The director of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said <a href="https://x.com/DrTedros/status/1872316621542592924" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a social media post</a> that “the airport came under aerial bombardment” as he and other United Nations officials were about to board a plane from Sana, and that a crew member was injured.</p><p>“The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge — just a few meters from where we were — and the runway were damaged,” he wrote, but added that he and his W.H.O. colleagues were safe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Israeli military said in a statement that in addition to the airport, the targets struck included the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations, describing them as “military infrastructure used by the Houthi terrorist regime for its military activities.” The jets also struck military infrastructure in the Al-Hudaydah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports on Yemen’s western coast, the military said.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1872311203617509474" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video statement</a>, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Thursday: “An hour ago, the Air Force struck targets of the Houthi terrorist organization in Yemen, both on the coast and in Sanaa. We are determined to cut this arm of Iran’s Axis of Evil off. We will pursue this until we complete the task.”</p><p>Military analysts have widely deemed the Houthis less powerful than other Iran-backed militias like Hezbollah in Lebanon or Hamas in Gaza. But Israel may be turning more attention to the Houthis now as the last major Iranian proxy threatening its borders, after reaching a cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah last month and largely undermining Hamas’s ability in Gaza over more than a year of war.</p><p>Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, threatened on Thursday to “hunt all the Houthi leaders,” adding, “Nobody can escape from Israel’s long arm.” The two men were speaking from the Israel Air Force command room in Tel Aviv, sitting alongside the military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi.</p><p>In response to the Israeli strike, Mohammed Abdulsalam, a Houthi spokesman, said in a statement: “The targeting of Sana International Airport and other civilian infrastructure is a Zionist crime against the entire Yemeni people.” He added, “If the Zionist enemy thinks that its crimes will deter Yemen from supporting Gaza, it is delusional.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Israel and the Houthis, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/houthi-yemen-red-sea-attacks.html" title="">who act as the de facto government in much of northern Yemen</a>, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in solidarity with Hamas shortly after the Palestinian militia in Gaza led attacks on Israel on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/issue/world/2024/10/21/the-oct-7-attacks" title="">Oct. 7, 2023,</a> prompting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-oct-7-year-of-war.html" title="">the war in the enclave</a>.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu said, referring to Iran’s proxies and the toppled government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria: “The Houthis, too, will learn what Hamas, Hezbollah, the Assad regime and others have learned. And even if it takes time, this lesson will be understood across the Middle East.”</p><p>The air assault on Thursday, Israel’s fourth in Yemen over the past year, comes a week after Israeli fighter jets flew more than 1,000 miles to bomb sites in the country, including in Sana and on the port city of Salif. The Israeli military said it had struck infrastructure like power plants, as well as fuel and oil tanks.</p><p>Those strikes killed nine people, according to Al-Masirah, a TV channel affiliated with the Houthis, and came hours after Israel’s military said it had <a href="https://t.me/idfofficial/13228" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">intercepted a missile</a> launched from Yemen.</p><p>The Houthis have since stepped up their efforts to strike Israel. A missile launched by the militia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-missile-yemen.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">landed in a playground in Tel Aviv</a> before dawn on Saturday, shattering glass and injuring multiple residents in nearby buildings. The group then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/24/world/middleeast/israel-houthis-yemen-missile.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">launched another missile</a> early Tuesday, hours after Israel’s defense minister suggested that his government would seek to kill the Houthis’ leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That missile set off sirens in Tel Aviv and other parts of central Israel, but the Israeli military said that the country’s air defenses had successfully intercepted it outside of its territory.</p><p>The Houthis have also been launching missiles and drones at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/world/middleeast/houthis-red-sea-yemen-israel.html" title="">cargo vessels</a> crossing the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, significantly disrupting international trade.</p><p>On Wednesday evening, the Israeli military said a drone launched from Yemen had crossed into Israeli territory and fell in an open area.</p><p>After Thursday’s round of strikes, the commander of the Israeli Air Force, Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, said, “We are not finished yet,” adding, “We have just seen a tangible demonstration of what we are capable of, and we are capable of much more.” </p><p>Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner">More about Isabel Kershner</a></span></p></div><div><p>Ismaeel Naar is an international reporter for The Times, covering the Gulf states.
