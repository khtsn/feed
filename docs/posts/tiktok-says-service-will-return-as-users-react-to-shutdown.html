Others tried to cope with humor, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/style/tiktok-ban-final-hours.html" title="">TikTok creators who threw funerals</a> — complete with makeshift caskets and eulogies — for the platform.</p><p>But by Saturday night in the United States, it was clear those hopes were, at least briefly, in vain. Alix Earle, a popular TikTok creator, headed straight over to Instagram to livestream with her followers and process the news. Ms. Earle joked she had tried to learn Mandarin to use <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/red-note-a-chinese-app-is-dominating-downloads-thanks-to-tiktok-users.html" title="">RedNote</a>, a Chinese video app that has become popular in recent days. She had already been banned from that app, she said.</p><p>Some relief finally came on Sunday when TikTok <a href="https://x.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1881030712188346459" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that, after assurances from President-elect Donald J. Trump, it was working to restore the service to U.S. users.</p><p>Before that announcement, TikTok users had been looking for a workaround to the ban in the form of virtual private networks, or V.P.N.s, which encrypt a user’s location. On Sunday, demand for V.P.N.s in the U.S. <a href="https://www.top10vpn.com/research/vpn-demand-statistics/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spiked 827 percent</a>, according to Top10VPN, a V.P.N. review site.</p><p>The assumption from some was that most TikTok creators would simply shift their content to Instagram Reels, but not everyone was thrilled with that option.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It was just so disappointing,” Casey Lewis, who writes the youth culture newsletter After School, said of using Reels after the ban went into effect. “TikTok, the algorithm, just knows me and gives me everything I want to see.”</p><p>The top free apps in Apple’s app store after the ban were, instead, other TikTok competitors: Red Note and Likee, a short-form video app with its own “For You” page. The third most downloaded app was a V.P.N. service.</p><p>The complaints about the shutdown were not limited to TikTok creators. Among those voicing support for TikTok after the ban was Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, who said he was against the ban even as he noted it would still be a direct competitor to his own social media site, X.</p><p>“The current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced,” Mr. Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1880975630646612254" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>. “Something needs to change.”</p><p>Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky went as far as joining TikTok as a form of “civil disobedience” on Saturday, urging the app’s fans to take action <a href="https://x.com/RandPaul/status/1880712790064668699" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a video</a> posted to the platform and to X.</p><p>“To the 170 million Americans who use TikTok: Don’t give up, don’t give in,” Mr. Paul said. “Resist.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The calls for TikTok’s return appear to have been answered.</p><p>TikTok posted on X on Sunday that it was “in the process of restoring service” after a pledge from Mr. Trump that no one would face financial penalties for hosting TikTok as the service tried to find a way to comply with the law.</p><p>“We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,” the statement said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eli Tan is a reporter covering the technology industry and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eli-tan">More about Eli Tan</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>19</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>For U.S. Users, A Brief Period Of Lamenting<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
