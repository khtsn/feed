Kathy Hochul has found that the City University of New York needs to “significantly” overhaul and update its policies in order to handle the levels of antisemitism and discrimination that exist on its campuses.</p><p>CUNY campuses have been a center of pro-Palestinian activism for years, which Jewish students and elected officials have said sometimes manifests as antisemitism. Since the Hamas attack on Israel last October, there have been dozens of arrests of pro-Palestinian demonstrators on CUNY campuses, including <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/05/13/city-college-palestine-encampment-nypd/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at an encampment</a> at City College in April that was shut down by the city police.</p><p>The review, which was <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/following-surge-hate-and-bias-crimes-governor-hochul-deploys-all-available-state-resources" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commissioned</a> by Ms. Hochul last October after a surge in hate and bias incidents and was released on Tuesday, documented inconsistencies and a lack of oversight in how CUNY’s 25 campuses handled complaints of antisemitism and other bias among students and staff members.</p><p>But the review, which included interviews with more than 200 people over 10 months, also found that it was a “small, vocal minority of individuals” responsible for antisemitic incidents, and not a widespread problem.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The report’s author, <a href="https://www.lw.com/en/people/jonathan-lippman" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jonathan Lippman</a>, a former chief judge of New York, offered more than a dozen recommendations to improve the campus climate, including the creation of a new CUNY center devoted to efforts to combat hate.</p><p>CUNY said that it had already begun to put some of the recommendations into effect, including approving the anti-hate center, which will be called the <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/news/cuny-board-of-trustees-and-chancellor-announce-creation-of-center-for-inclusive-excellence-and-belonging-in-ongoing-effort-to-combat-discrimination/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Center for Inclusive Excellence and Belonging</a>. Ms. Hochul said on Tuesday that she was directing CUNY to enact all of them.</p><p>“We look forward to working on implementing Judge Lippman’s recommendations to redouble our efforts and build on our progress to create a more inclusive campus environment for students, faculty and staff,” Félix V. Matos Rodríguez, the CUNY chancellor, said in a statement.</p><p>While his investigation focused on policy shortcomings and did not provide a rundown of antisemitic complaints, Mr. Lippman wrote in a letter to Ms. Hochul attached to his report that there had been “an alarming number of unacceptable antisemitic incidents targeting members of the CUNY community.”</p><p>Still, he wrote, “the vast majority of students and members of the CUNY community do not engage in antisemitism or discrimination of any kind and instead want only to access the quality education CUNY affords.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The report is one of many examinations of antisemitism on university campuses that have been published in the aftermath of the campus protests, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/nyregion/columbia-antisemitism-bias-report.html" title="">a pair of reports</a> about Columbia University. The CUNY report also follows a recent federal investigation by the Office of Civil Rights at the U.S. Education Department, which found that CUNY had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/us/politics/michigan-cuny-discrimination-complaints.html" title="">mishandled multiple complaints of antisemitism</a> and other bias since 2019.</p><p>For example, in 2021 several Jewish students at Hunter College, a CUNY campus, complained that students and faculty members had disrupted an online class “to call for the decolonization of Palestine.” <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/ed-offices/ocr/news-room" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Without interviewing any students</a>, Hunter College concluded that the disruption did not violate students’ rights and closed the matter.</p><p>In a settlement with the Office of Civil Rights announced in June, CUNY <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/us/politics/michigan-cuny-discrimination-complaints.html" title="">agreed to reopen</a> investigations into such complaints and provide training to employees who conducted these investigations. Judge Lippman recommended additional steps to allow complaints to be handled more fairly.</p><p>One issue, he found, is that each CUNY campus handles complaints of discrimination independently, with insufficient oversight. He also called CUNY’s online portal for lodging complaints about discrimination a “black box.”</p><p>More generally, while CUNY should be applauded for its extremely diverse student body, “at some schools, this diversity has not translated into an environment of tolerance and respect,” he wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He recommended that the system “increase efforts to recruit and hire those who foster inclusive dialogue” and faulted faculty members generally for too often inflaming conflict between those with differing viewpoints, rather than encouraging peaceful solutions to disagreements.</p><p>Mr. Lippman’s report was more critical than several prior reports, in part because federal guidance has shifted, and because criticisms of Zionism, the movement for a modern Jewish state in its ancestral homeland, are now more likely to be seen as discriminatory than they were in years past.</p><p>A <a href="https://www2.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/news/newswire/assets/CUNYReport.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2016 report on antisemitism at CUNY</a>, for example, found that provocative chants led by pro-Palestinian groups, most notably the Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, were broadly protected as free speech, even if some found them hateful.</p><p>“Die-ins, mock checkpoints, and the SJP banner may offend some, but the First Amendment does not permit a public university to take action against them,” said the report, by Barbara Jones, a former judge, and Paul Shechtman, a lecturer at Columbia Law School.</p><p>More recently, Mr. Lippman wrote, was an incident this month at which pro-Palestinian demonstrators <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hillelatbaruch/reel/C_f6urJREG_/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeared to harass</a> Jewish freshmen from Baruch College who were <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/news/statement-from-cuny-chancellor-felix-v-matos-rodriguez-09-04-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attending a welcome event</a> sponsored by Hillel, the Jewish campus organization, at a Manhattan kosher restaurant. While the protesters “appear to have couched some of their deplorable attacks in anti-Zionist rhetoric,” the judge wrote, that did not excuse them.</p><p>“Anti-Zionism can constitute antisemitism,” he said, “and it is truly saddening that students just beginning their college education were subject to such blatant hate.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon Otterman is a Times reporter covering higher education, public health and other issues facing New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sharon-otterman">More about Sharon Otterman</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">Israel-Hamas War News</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/city-college-of-new-york">City College of New York</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/city-university-of-new-york">City University of New York</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kathy-hochul">Kathy Hochul</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jonathan-lippman">Jonathan Lippman</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israeli Strikes in Lebanon:</strong><strong> </strong>In the deadliest attacks in Lebanon since 2006, Israeli warplanes bombed Hezbollah targets in the country, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-strikes.html">killing hundreds and wounding more than a thousand others</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why Israel Is Escalating:</strong><strong> </strong>Israel’s intensifying strikes in Lebanon show how determined it is to stop Hezbollah’s cross-border attacks — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-escalating.html">and how far it is from achieving that goal</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Diplomacy Takes a Back Seat:</strong><strong> </strong>After years of failed Mideast peace deals and tit-for-tat violence, neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians believe their adversaries will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/world/middleeast/mideast-diplomacy-hezbollah-israel.html">ever negotiate in good faith</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Between Technical Might and Strategic Fog:</strong><strong> </strong>In Gaza, Lebanon and Iran, Israel has shown it’s capable of extraordinary acts of espionage, but is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hamas-gaza.html">struggling to define long-term goals</a>, according to Israeli analysts and public figures.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hamas’s Future in Gaza:</strong><strong> </strong>One of Hamas’s most senior officials said in an interview that the militant group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israel-future.html">expects to play a decisive role in the enclave</a> when the war with Israel is over.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
