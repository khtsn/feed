Immigrant rights’ lawyers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/guantanamo-trump-lawsuit-migrants-venezuela.html" title="">have gone to court seeking access to the migrants</a>, and rights groups have been expected to file a broader challenge to the Trump administration’s policy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s a way to avoid litigation from getting traction,” said Harold Hongju Koh, a Yale Law School professor who worked as a lawyer in the State Department during the Obama administration has long been involved in litigation over detainees at Guantánamo.

In announcing the first transfer flight, <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4054676/department-of-defense-announces-arrival-of-high-threat-illegal-aliens-at-guanta/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Pentagon cast the operation</a> as a “temporary measure” to secure the migrants “until they can be transported to their country of origin or other appropriate destination.”</p><p>All of the migrants taken to Guantánamo to date have been citizens of Venezuela. It has been difficult to deport people to the country because of the breakdown in relations between its authoritarian government and the United States.</p><p>But a Trump adviser, Richard Grenell, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/us-prisoners-venezuela.html" title="">visited Venezuela in late January</a> and appeared to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, which included an agreement that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/world/americas/venezuela-deportation-flights-trump.html" title="">Venezuela would resume accepting deportees</a>. On Feb. 10, Venezuela <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1889055088213115081" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent two planes</a> to El Paso to pick up about 190 of its citizens, whom the Homeland Security Department described as under final deportation orders.</p><p>As the flights resumed, it has not been clear why some Venezuelans were taken to Guantánamo.</p><p>Trump administration officials had initially portrayed the migrants taken to Venezuela as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which the State Department included on a list of transnational cartels and gangs the administration designated as foreign terrorist organizations on Thursday.</p><p>But it is not clear whether that is true for any of the migrants: Congressional staff were told in a briefing that the only actual criteria to be sent to the base was being Venezuelan with a final removal order.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As of Wednesday, Ms. McLaughlin, the homeland security spokeswoman, had said simply that ICE was using Guantánamo “to house detainees subject to final orders of removal.” She also referred to them as “final order aliens.”</p><p>In a lawsuit seeking legal access to the migrants, the government <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277395/gov.uscourts.dcd.277395.14.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told a court</a> that it had allowed three men named in the suit to call lawyers on Monday and that “preliminary access procedures have been developed for others at the facility.”</p><p>But the Justice Department also urged a judge not to require broader access, arguing that the migrants had only “limited rights” as “immigration detainees with final orders of removal, who are staged for final transfer and in the midst of a removal operation.”</p><p>The Trump administration has raised the possibility of eventually housing tens of thousands of migrants at the base. With the future of the policy unclear, Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union, the lead lawyer for the immigrant rights’ groups seeking access to migrants at Guantánamo, said the fight was far from over.</p><p>“The government saying we can now have access to the detainees only after they have moved them is perplexing, at best,” he said. If the government was trying to make the lawsuit moot, he added, “they will not succeed.”</p><p>Eric Schmitt<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington, and <!-- -->Albert Sun<!-- --> from New York.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Carol Rosenberg reports on the wartime prison and court at Guantánamo Bay.
