The track was submitted to the Grammys for a country nomination but was <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/beyonce-daddy-lessons-rejected-grammy-country-committee-7604485/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rejected by the committee overseeing those awards</a>. (Most of those committees have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/arts/music/grammys-secret-committees.html" title="">since been eliminated</a>.) That year, Beyoncé also performed the song with the Chicks, formerly called the Dixie Chicks, at the Country Music Association Awards. The harsh response to it was apparently what set Beyoncé on a course to delving deeper into country music, on her own terms.</p><p>When announcing “Cowboy Carter” last year, Beyoncé <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4s6Zr7rlwA/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=1487ec91-2342-447d-a71f-be7722bcda5f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>: “It was born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed … and it was very clear that I wasn’t. But, because of that experience, I did a deeper dive into the history of Country music and studied our rich musical archive.” She added: “The criticisms I faced when I first entered this genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/arts/music/beyonce-cowboy-carter-country-radio.html" title="">Country radio stations gave minimal attention</a> to the songs on “Cowboy Carter,” and Beyoncé <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/arts/music/beyonce-cmas-nominations-cowboy-carter.html" title="">received no nominations at last year’s CMAs</a>.</p><p>There is a long history of Grammy voters, who are drawn from the full music industry, using their ballots to send messages to Nashville. In 2007, the Chicks won all three top awards — including album of the year, for “Taking the Long Way” — after the group was blacklisted from country radio stations over its criticism of President George W. Bush and the Iraq war.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-sisario">More about Ben Sisario</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
