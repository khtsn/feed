In recent months, the organization’s leadership has been at loggerheads. The five trustees who resigned — Timothy Boucher, Mark Dyer, Audrey Kgosidintsi, Kelello Lerotholi and Damian West — said in a joint statement that they had called on the board’s chair, Ms. Chandauka, to resign from her position, after losing “trust and confidence” in her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>They said that Ms. Chandauka, who was appointed in 2023, responded by filing a lawsuit in Britain “to block us from voting her out,” and that they were resigning to avoid burdening the charity with the cost of the suit.</p><p>“We could not in good conscience allow Sentebale to undertake that legal and financial burden and have been left with no other option but to vacate our positions,” the former trustees said in their statement. “This was not a choice willingly made, but rather something we felt forced into in order to look after the charity.”</p><p>Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso said in their statement that the former trustees had “acted in the best interest of the charity in asking the chair to step down.” They added: “What’s transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale’s beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, Sophie Chandauka, Sentebale’s chair; Argentinian polo player Nacho Figueras; Prince Harry and the former All Blacks rugby player Dan Carter at a Sentebale charity event in Singapore in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Edgar Su/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-bfaee1d">What are Ms. Chandauka’s accusations against the former trustees and Prince Harry?</h2><p>Ms. Chandauka said in a statement about the former trustees that she had acted to expose what she described as “issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir and the coverup that ensued.”<span>  </span>(Misogynoir is a term referring to pointed sexism toward Black women.) In addition to filing a case in an English court, she said, she had reported the trustees to Britain’s Charity Commission.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After the five trustees stepped down, Ms. Chandauka immediately appointed four new trustees.</p><p>In interviews with the British news media, Ms. Chandauka has since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/europe/prince-harry-accused-bullying-charity.html" title="">accused the prince</a> of engaging in harassment and bullying to try to force her out of her post. A spokesman for Harry declined to comment on her latest claims.</p><p>Despite her allegations, Ms. Chandauka said her relationship with Harry had been “fantastic, actually.” But she said, “There are some individuals on the board who thought they could get away with mistreating a woman.”</p><h2 id="link-75c51420">What is Sentebale?</h2><p>Harry established Sentebale with Prince Seeiso, the younger brother of King Letsie III of Lesotho, in 2006. Founded in honor of Harry’s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Seeiso’s mother, the charity raised funds for communities affected by the H.I.V. pandemic in Lesotho, a small landlocked kingdom that is one of the world’s poorest countries. In 2019, it expanded its work into nearby Botswana, and to addressing substance abuse, gender-based violence and other social ills among young people.</p><h2 id="link-637e7577">What happens next?</h2><p>Both sides have filed claims of wrongdoing with Britain’s Charity Commission, which regulates charities in England and Wales. Although Sentebale operates in southern Africa, it is registered in Britain.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Charity Commission said that the regulator was “assessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Driving in Singapore: </strong>The city-state, where it costs up to $84,000 just for the right to own a car, is one of the most expensive places to drive. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/car-certificate-singapore-luxury.html">That is by design</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Radio Martí Goes Off the Air: </strong>For four decades, a U.S.-financed broadcaster <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/americas/radio-marti-cuba-trump-castro.html">provoked the ire of the communist government</a> in Cuba.
