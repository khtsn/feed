He denies wrongdoing, but his defense — that he had consensual sex with a married woman — was still dreadful. His philandering and mistreatment of women have been so egregious that his mother called him an “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/us/politics/hegseth-email-text.html" title="">abuser of women</a>,” in an email to him (she has since disavowed her statement) — and yet somehow his chances of being confirmed by the Senate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/pete-hegseth-trump-defense-secretary.html" title="">appear to be increasing</a>.</p><p>Perhaps it was when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who is married to the actress Cheryl Hines, allegedly had an improper “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/media/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-relationship-new-york-magazine/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">personal relationship</a>” via smartphone with Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter who is much younger, and she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/business/media/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-jr-new-york-magazine.html" title="">lost her job</a> while he was picked to run the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>But I think it happened earlier, when a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/05/09/nyregion/trump-carroll-rape-trial-verdict" title="">jury found Donald Trump responsible</a> for sexual abuse, and he was ultimately re-elected to the presidency. After years of rightfully arguing that combating sexual assault and sexual abuse can’t override due process, many conservatives not only disregarded the jury verdict, they actually reveled in how little his voters cared about the scandal, or just dismissed it as another instance of “lawfare” against Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>I distinctly remember the mood on the right when the #MeToo movement got going. There was a sense of schadenfreude. The morally bankrupt, sexualized culture of Hollywood and the liberal media had finally been exposed. For all their talk about feminism and respecting women, many famous liberals proved to be dangerous hypocrites — or much, much worse.</p><p>Yes, there was leakage into right-wing media. Roger Ailes was pushed out at Fox News in 2016, and Bill O’Reilly suffered the same fate after my Times colleagues <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html" title="">Emily Steel and Michael Schmidt reported</a> that O’Reilly or Fox had paid $13 million to settle claims of sexual misconduct made by five different women against him.</p><p>All that happened before my colleagues Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey published their <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/new-york-times-reporting-led-jodi-kantor-and-megan-twohey-and-new-yorker-reporting-ronan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pulitzer Prize-winning</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html" title="">reporting on Harvey Weinstein</a>. But the early wave of #MeToo revelations was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/23/us/metoo-replacements.html" title="">heavily concentrated</a> in traditionally liberal institutions.</p><p>When #MeToo became #<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/silence-is-not-spiritual-the-evangelical-metoo-movement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ChurchToo</a>, though, that was the beginning of the end. In a remarkably short period of time, the narrative changed. No longer was sexual abuse and exploitation a “Hollywood problem” or a “secular problem,” it was also an evangelical problem, and it was a problem in many of the most important institutions of the church.</p><p>The Southern Baptist Convention, the nation’s largest Protestant denomination, faced a sexual abuse “<a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/2022/05/southern-baptist-abuse-apocalypse-russell-moore/?utm_medium=widgetsocial" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apocalypse</a>,” a series of scandals that my friend Russell Moore, the former head of the S.B.C.’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, called “a reality far more evil and systemic than I imagined it could be.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Liberty University, one of the largest Christian universities in the world, faced its own sexual scandals. Its president, Jerry Falwell Jr., stepped aside after a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/25/21399954/jerry-falwell-jr-resigns-scandal-liberty" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sordid series of allegations</a> that involved him, his wife and a pool-boy-turned-business associate.</p><p>At the same time that the school was sheltering a corrupt president, it was also <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-liberty-way-how-liberty-university-discourages-and-dismisses-students-reports-of-sexual-assaults" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mishandling claims of sex abuse</a> against students, including by turning the school’s code of conduct, called the Liberty Way, against sex abuse victims. If they’d violated a school policy, by drinking, for example, that could be used against them in the schools’ disciplinary proceedings.</p><p>The hypocrisy was stark. The Christian president of a Christian university was imposing standards on students — including victims of abuse — that he was flouting himself.</p><p>Before I joined The Times, I reported on the <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/frenchpress/you-are-one-step-away-from-complete/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fall of Ravi Zacharias</a>, perhaps the evangelical world’s most respected Christian apologist. After he died, reports emerged that he’d not only abused women himself, but that his organization had helped conceal and enabled his abuse as well.</p><p>My wife, Nancy, reported on <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2022/05/27/sex-abuse-kanakuk-christian-camp-missouri-peter-newman/9907577002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decades of abuse</a> at a Christian summer camp network headquartered in Missouri called Kanakuk Kamps, which is one of the largest Christian camp networks in America. In the worst scandal at the camp, a predator named Pete Newman operated on the grounds for years before he was finally caught and sentenced to life in prison. The prosecutor in his criminal case estimated that his victims could number in the hundreds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Depositions and internal documents demonstrate that the camp retained and promoted Newman even after it <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/frenchpress/they-arent-who-you-think-they-are/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received reports</a> of nude activities — including nude basketball and nude four-wheeling — with young boys. And then, after Newman’s abuse was finally reported to authorities, the camp covered up its complicity by blanketing victims with various forms of nondisclosure agreements.</p><p>The people who promoted Newman, ignored his misconduct and silenced victims still run the camp.</p><p>I could go on and on with additional examples, but soon enough Christians realized that what they thought was a “them” problem was also an “us” problem. The moral high ground slid away. #ChurchToo exposed the right, and the right wasn’t ready to repent.</p><p>I don’t mean that everyone wasn’t ready. There were and are courageous men and women who seek to hold the church accountable. The Southern Baptist Convention, most notably, <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/06/southern-baptist-convention-votes-overwhelmingly-for-sex-abuse-investigation-debate.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">formed a sexual abuse task force</a>, and its executive committee <a href="https://www.baptistmessage.com/sbcs-lawyers-resign-after-evs-vote-to-waive-attorney-client-privilege/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voted to waive attorney-client privilege</a> to conduct an open and transparent investigation.</p><p>But as Bob Smietana <a href="https://religionnews.com/2024/06/12/the-future-of-sbc-abuse-reform-is-now-in-the-hands-of-denominational-committee/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported in Religion News Service</a> in June, the task force did not finish its work. It “was charged two years ago with creating resources to help churches deal with abuse, publishing a database of abusive pastors and finding permanent funding and long-term plans for abuse reforms. While the task force did unveil a new ‘Essentials’ training resource for churches, the other two tasks remain incomplete.”</p><p><strong>There’s an easy answer</strong> for understanding the end of #MeToo, one that has the benefit of being largely true — American society (including the American church) is still rife with misogyny. As with race, the fact that America has come quite far in respecting the legal rights of women does not mean that we don’t still have far to go to achieve true cultural equality and respect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But misogyny was never a complete explanation, especially given the fact that sex abuse isn’t confined to men abusing women and girls. Something else is at work, something that also represents a deep and profound moral flaw. A person might value vulnerable people in the abstract — or might even declare a strong commitment to justice — but very few people will sacrifice anything they truly value to correct an injustice that doesn’t involve them immediately and directly.</p><p>My wife’s story helped me understand. When she was 12 years old, a vacation Bible schoolteacher abused her in her own home. Decades later, her pastor, by then retired, told her that the same person had abused at least a dozen other women and girls in the church.</p><p>The abuser was never held accountable — either by church leaders or law enforcement. Instead, he moved to a town in Kentucky and became a high school girls’ basketball coach. He lost his teaching certificate in 2023 after there were multiple reports of misconduct.</p><p>The abuser’s father was a powerful person in the church and in Nancy’s small town. Confronting his son carried a cost, and the simple fact is that very few people were willing to bear that cost, including people who were very close to Nancy. Not even their love for her could overcome their fear of the social risk.</p><p>Yes, people want justice. They want abuse to stop, but they also don’t want to poison their relationships with friends and colleagues or undermine their social status. They don’t want to say no to kids who ask to go back to their favorite summer camp. They don’t want to lose an election. Any sacrifice, no matter how attenuated, is too much.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That’s a bleak truth — one that is very hard to face — and so there is a temptation to rationalize, to say that #MeToo was a valuable movement until it went too far. Rationalizations are often rooted in a measure of truth. At its height, #MeToo was too quick to rush to judgment, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/11/16877966/shitty-media-men-list-explained" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">too reliant on rumors</a> and <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/will-anyone-win-in-this-clash-of-metoo-and-due-process/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">too dismissive of due process</a>, <a href="https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/due-process-reports" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">especially due process on campus</a>.</p><p>Even so, one can and should be able to raise awareness of a terrible social evil without undermining fundamental fairness or discarding constitutional values.</p><p>There are always excessive responses to genuine problems, and the existence of the excessive response shouldn’t blind us to the underlying reality. The fact that defunding the police was a terrible idea — or that rioters burned buildings during the summer of 2020, for example — doesn’t mean that American police officers have no problems with brutality.</p><p>And so here we are, with the nation about to be led by a man found liable for sexual abuse, with key members of his chosen senior team beset by their own gross scandals, voted into office on the strength of overwhelming white evangelical support (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/exit-polls-2024-election/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to 2024 exit polls</a>, he won white evangelicals by 65 points and lost everyone else by 18 points). And all too many Christians still celebrate his victory — and their indispensable support — as a triumph of good over evil.</p><p>When I was younger and more naïve, I wondered why so many historical injustices persisted for so long in the United States. Now I have my answer.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
