    <h1>Long Before She Was Charged With Murder, a Group of Men Had Raised an Alarm</h1>

The text chain the men had started as a kind of virtual support group erupted with relief, as well as frustration that it had come to this.</p><p>“She finally went too far,” David Butler, 52, wrote on Feb. 7, linking to an article about Mr. Manzano’s death.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>One of the men replied: “So she didn’t get any time after the trial you testified in?”</p><p>One of the men had come to town on a guys’ trip. Another was visiting family. A renovation project brought another to New Orleans, where the men say they became Ms. Colbert’s victims. Over the years, they said, they had reported her to law enforcement and spent hundreds of hours trying to repair damage to their finances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People in a neon-lit bar." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj/21xp-nolascammed-bar-gkbj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/54267f46-fc4c-57d9-93ed-effddf076847" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The men had come to New Orleans for different reasons, but they said they had something — rather, someone — in common: Ms. Colbert.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Tarnowski for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Still, Ms. Colbert, 48, had been on probation at the time of Mr. Manzano’s death — despite having twice been charged in connection with similar scams on the Las Vegas Strip. (Both of those cases were dismissed.)</p><p>Days before Mr. Manzano was supposed to cover the Super Bowl for Telemundo Kansas City, his co-workers called his hotel for a wellness check after he missed an appointment. His body was found in his room on Feb. 5, the police said, with his phone and a credit card missing. They had been stolen by Ms. Colbert, according to the authorities, who said that she had been involved in similar schemes in New Orleans. This week, preliminary autopsy findings showed that the 27-year-old Mr. Manzano had died from the toxic effects of Xanax and alcohol, in addition to positional asphyxia. He was found facedown against a pillow.</p><p>Investigators said on Tuesday that they had also found Xanax at Ms. Colbert’s home the day after Mr. Manzano’s death, and that she had commonly used it to drug victims. They charged her with second-degree murder, which in Louisiana carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Butler said his ordeal began more than three years ago — in the early morning hours of Nov. 6, 2021, when he had gone out to the French Quarter to take a break from renovating a house not far from the nightlife district.</p><p>Ms. Colbert and another woman approached him outside a bar on Bourbon Street and asked whether he wanted to join them, he recalled in a victim impact statement and in interviews. He took them up on the offer. But after leaving his first drink unattended to buy a second round and coming back to finish it, he said, something felt off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David Butler began to feel “very strange, woozy,” after one drink on a night out.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Tarnowski for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Butler recalled Ms. Colbert pushing him into a waiting taxi with her, he said, and then 12 hours later a man shaking him awake.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Tarnowski for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Within minutes, I started feeling very strange, woozy, a feeling like the world around me was going dark,” Mr. Butler said.</p><p>His memory of what happened next is fuzzy: He recalled Ms. Colbert pushing him into a waiting taxi with her, he said, and about 12 hours later, a property manager at the home he was renovating shaking him awake as he lay on a mattress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“He said he thought I was dead,” Mr. Butler said.</p><p>His wallet and phone were missing, but he still had his laptop, which had been buried under a pile of clothes. When he opened it and saw a torrent of fraud alerts, panic overcame him.</p><p>One alert: $85,000 in Bitcoin and Ethereum funds had been transferred from his Coinbase cryptocurrency wallet to an account, QUEENTX100. He said that a Google search of that name led him to a Facebook page for Ms. Colbert, whose photos he recognized. Other alerts showed an attempt to withdraw an additional $50,000 from his Chase bank account, and to make purchases totaling thousands of dollars at stores, including Walmart and Best Buy, using his credit cards, he said.</p><p>He went to the authorities the next day. His case bounced between detectives before Ms. Colbert was arrested in 2023. Nearly three years after that night — after Mr. Butler gathered mountains of paperwork for investigators and credit card companies — a jury in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court convicted Ms. Colbert last October of several felonies. During the trial, a lawyer for Ms. Colbert argued that Mr. Butler had paid her the money for sex, which he denied. Judge Nandi F. Campbell ordered Ms. Colbert to pay $50,000 in restitution to Mr. Butler, but Ms. Colbert received a 10-year suspended sentence and probation instead of jail time, court records show.</p><p>“I told the judge, I told the D.A., that she was going to kill somebody,” said Mr. Butler, who requested that other identifying information about him not be published, including where he lives and his occupation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Three years after Mr. Butler’s ordeal, Ms. Colbert was convicted of several felonies and ordered to pay him $50,000 in restitution.

Neither did the lawyer who represented Ms. Colbert in the earlier case or her current lawyer.</p><p>Daniel Lippmann, who represented Ms. Colbert in the two Las Vegas cases from 2022, said that the alleged victims in those cases had failed to show up in court for preliminary hearings.</p><p>In the months that followed his ordeal, Mr. Butler began to search online for clues about what had happened to him, and discovered other men sharing similar experiences on Reddit. He tracked them down and started a group text chain. They said they had something — rather, someone — in common: Ms. Colbert.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After going to see jazz in the French Quarter, Jason Egle called an Uber.

But there had been some confusion about whether he and his nephew had gotten into the right car, so, he said, Ms. Colbert asked to see his Uber app.</p><p>That is when Mr. Egle said he let his guard down and gave Ms. Colbert the code to unlock his phone, the same one for the password keychain for various apps, including those for his financial accounts. Not long after that, he said, Ms. Colbert told him that he had gotten into the wrong car and handed him back a phone — but it was not his. He did not immediately notice the switch because the battery was dead, he said.</p><p>Mr. Egle said Ms. Colbert had gotten into his cryptocurrency account and withdrawn about $15,000.</p><p>Mr. Egle provided The New York Times a copy of an online police report that he said that he filed with the New Orleans Police Department in October 2021 and a brief email exchange with an F.B.I. special agent in New Orleans in April 2022. Neither law enforcement agency, he said, followed up with him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The New Orleans Police Department did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the F.B.I.’s field office in New Orleans said that it was the bureau’s policy to neither confirm nor deny that it was conducting an investigation.</p><p>Ms. Colbert never had a driver account on Uber, said Sarah Casasnovas, a spokeswoman for the ride-share app.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Everything was already gone by the time I woke up,” said Eric Maul, who was picked up by Ms. Colbert in her car around the same time as Mr. Egle. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Tarnowski for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Around the time of Mr. Egle’s alleged encounter with Ms. Colbert, Eric Maul, 32, who works in technology sales and lives in Los Angeles, said he had had a lot to drink in the French Quarter and called an Uber. A black Mustang pulled up, with Ms. Colbert driving, he said. About 10 minutes later, he said, she told him that her Uber app was not working and asked for his phone, which he unlocked and gave to her. She gave him a dead phone back, which he said led to an argument and prompted him to end the ride.</p><p>“Everything was already gone by the time I woke up,” said Mr. Maul, who learned that about $10,000 was missing from his accounts and that several loan applications had been filled out in his name.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>He kept calling his phone, and about 24 hours later, someone picked up: It was Mr. Egle.</p><p>“Did she just rob you blind?” he asked Mr. Maul.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Maul kept calling his phone after it was taken from him.
