Russia’s Ministry of Defense said in a statement that Kyiv used six ballistic missiles known as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/world/europe/what-are-atacms-missiles-ukraine-russia.html#link-30e99971" title="">Army Tactical Missile System</a>, or ATACMS. A senior American official and a senior Ukrainian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations, confirmed that ATACMS were used.</p><p>The strike represented a demonstration of force for Ukraine as it tries to show Western allies that providing more powerful and sophisticated weapons will pay off — by degrading Russia’s forces and bolstering Ukraine’s prospects in the war.</p><p>Officials in Kyiv had pleaded for months for permission to use ATACMS to strike military targets deeper inside Russia before the Biden administration relented and gave its assent. The authorization came just months before the return to office of President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has said he will seek a quick end to the war in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>His election has cast uncertainty over whether the U.S. will maintain the robust military support it has provided Ukraine under Mr. Biden, or whether Mr. Trump might take a different approach. </p><p>The addition of up to 10,000 North Korean troops to Moscow’s war effort this fall appeared to be what persuaded the Biden administration to shift its stance on ATACMS. The United States and its allies viewed their arrival as an escalation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Andrii Kovalenko, a member of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said that Tuesday’s strike in Bryansk hit warehouses housing “artillery ammunition, including North Korean ammunition for their systems.”</p><p>Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed that five of the ATACMS missiles were shot down and another was damaged, saying that falling fragments caused a fire at a military facility but that there were no casualties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The attack came on the same day President Vladimir V.
