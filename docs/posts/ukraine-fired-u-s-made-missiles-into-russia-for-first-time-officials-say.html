first time, according to senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials, just days after President Biden gave permission to do so in a major shift of American policy.</p><p>The pre-dawn attack struck an ammunition depot in the Bryansk region of southwestern Russia, Ukrainian officials said. Russia’s Ministry of Defense said that Kyiv used six ballistic missiles known as ATACMS, for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/world/europe/what-are-atacms-missiles-ukraine-russia.html" title="">Army Tactical Missile System</a>. A senior American official and a senior Ukrainian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations, confirmed that ATACMS were used.</p><p>The strike represented a demonstration of force for Ukraine as it tries to show Western allies that providing more powerful and sophisticated weapons will pay off — by degrading Russia’s combat capabilities and relieving pressure on Kyiv’s overstretched forces.</p><p>The attack came on the same day President Vladimir V. Putin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/europe/putin-russia-nuclear-weapons-missiles.html" title="">lowered Russia’s threshold for the use of nuclear weapons,</a> a long-planned move whose timing appeared aimed at showing the Kremlin could respond aggressively to Ukraine using American missiles to strike Russian territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Kremlin has throughout the war used the threat of deploying its nuclear arsenal to try to deter the West from providing more robust military support to Ukraine. On Tuesday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, called Ukraine’s use of ATACMS in the Bryansk region “a signal that they want escalation” — a reference to the U.S. and western allies.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2024-11-19-atacms-bryansk" data-id="100000009833426" data-source-id="100000009833426"><div slug="2024-11-19-atacms-bryansk" data-sourceid="100000009833426" id="embed-id-100000009833426">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ukrainian officials and military analysts, who have long cautioned that no single weapon will change the course of the war, noted that the impact of the shift in White House policy will depend on the quantities of missiles being supplied.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had pleaded for months for permission to use ATACMS to strike military targets inside Russia. The Biden administration finally relented and gave its assent, a decision that was driven in part by the addition of up to 10,000 North Korean troops to Moscow’s war effort.</p><p>The authorization came just two months before the return to office of President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has said he will seek a quick end to the war in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>His election has cast uncertainty over whether the U.S. will maintain the robust military support it has provided Ukraine under Mr. Biden, or whether Mr. Trump might take a different approach on policy toward Ukraine.</p><p>On the battlefront, Russia is leveraging its advantage in air power, artillery and personnel to melt through defensive lines in southeastern Ukraine. By taking aim at logistics centers like the one targeted on Tuesday, Ukraine hopes to make it more difficult to supply Russian forces engaged in relentless assaults.</p><p>The Ukrainian military’s high command, known as the General Staff, said that Tuesday’s attack took place at 2:30 a.m., destroying “warehouses with ammunition” and triggering a dozen “secondary explosions.”</p><p>Andrii Kovalenko, a representative of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said that the strike in Bryansk hit warehouses housing “artillery ammunition, including North Korean ammunition for their systems, guided aerial bombs, antiaircraft missiles and ammunition for multiple-launch rocket systems.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Vladimir V.

It said that falling fragments caused a fire at a military facility but there were no casualties.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Neither side’s claims about the impact of the strikes could be immediately independently verified.</p><p>Russia has robust and layered air defense systems, including S-400 batteries designed to counter ballistic missiles like the ATACMS. The S-400, and the newer S-500, are similar to the Western-made Patriot systems used to protect Ukrainian skies.</p><p>Since the first longer-range ATACMS arrived in Ukraine in April, Kyiv has used its limited supplies of missiles to target those Russian air defense systems in occupied areas of Ukraine — particularly in Crimea — with some success, according to satellite imagery, military analysts as well as Ukrainian and Western officials.</p><p>The ATACMS have also been used in successful strikes on airfields and other bases, according to satellite imagery and military analysts.</p><p>But throughout the war, the moment one side introduces a new capability, the other side works to adapt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Russian effectiveness against ATACMS missiles will likely increase, even if slowly, over the course of the conflict, as Russia trains air defense crews to address the threat,” Jake Mezey, a security expert, wrote in <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/russian-and-chinese-strategic-missile-defense-doctrine-capabilities-and-development/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report</a> for The Atlantic Council in September.</p><p>The U.S. supplied Ukraine with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/world/europe/ukraine-atacms-attacks-russia.html" title="">ATACMs</a> for the first time in October of 2023, but the missiles were designed to hit targets only about 100 miles away. The Biden Administration only provided a small number — less than two dozen in the first shipments — and the move came only after a Ukrainian counteroffensive that summer had already failed.</p><p>In April of 2024, the U.S. agreed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/us/us-ukraine-russia-missiles.html" title="">secretly provide ATACMS</a> with a range of 190 miles to Ukraine. However, the Biden administration restricted their use to targeting Russian forces located in Ukrainian occupied territory, including Crimea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-13"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="ukraine-atacms-range-map" data-id="100000009833746" data-source-id="100000009833746"><div slug="ukraine-atacms-range-map" data-sourceid="100000009833746" id="embed-id-100000009833746">
