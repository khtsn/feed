It will replace a significantly bigger wooden structure that has served commuters in this remote community for over 75 years.</p><p>The new station’s components were 3D-printed elsewhere and assembled on site last month, in what the railway’s operators say is a world first. It may look more like a shelter than a station, but building one the traditional way would have taken more than two months and cost twice as much, according to the West Japan Railway Company.</p><p>As Japan’s population ages and its work force shrinks, the maintenance of railway infrastructure, including outdated station buildings, is a growing issue for railway operators. Rural stations with dwindling numbers of users have posed a particular challenge.</p><p>The new station, Hatsushima, is in a quiet seaside town that’s part of Arida, a 25,000-population city in Wakayama Prefecture, which borders two popular tourist destinations, Osaka and Nara prefectures. The station, served by a single line with trains that run one to three times an hour, serves around 530 riders a day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Yui Nishino, 19, uses it every day for her commute to university. She said she was surprised when she first heard that the world’s first 3D-printed station building was going to be built here.</p><p>“Watching it, the work is progressing at a speed that would be impossible with normal construction,” she said. “I hope that they can make more buildings with 3D-printing technology.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/27/00vid-japan-trainstation-43586-cover/00vid-japan-trainstation-43586-cover-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/27/00vid-japan-trainstation-43586-cover/00vid-japan-trainstation-43586-cover-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/03/27/136568_1_00vid-japan-trainstation-43586_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Timelapse video from Serendix, the company that made the station’s parts, shows the seven-day process.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Serendix Inc.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Serendix, the construction firm that worked with West Japan Railway the project, said printing the parts and reinforcing them with concrete took seven days.</p><p>The printing was done at a factory in Kumamoto Prefecture on the southwestern island of Kyushu. The parts left the factory on the morning of March 24 to be transported about 500 miles northeast by road to Hatsushima Station.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Normally, construction takes place over several months while the trains are not running every night,” said Kunihiro Handa, a co-founder of Serendix. Construction work near commercial lines is subject to strict restrictions and is usually carried out overnight so as not to disrupt timetables.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/28/00vid-japan-train-15318-cover/00vid-japan-train-15318-cover-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/28/00vid-japan-train-15318-cover/00vid-japan-train-15318-cover-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/03/28/136635_1_00vid-japan-train-15318_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Workers assembled the station at the site.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As trucks carrying the 3D-printed parts started pulling in on a Tuesday night in late March, several dozen residents gathered to watch the first-of-its-kind initiative get underway, in a place deeply familiar to them.</p><p>Then, after the last train pulled away at 11:57 p.m., workers got busy building the new station.</p><p>In less than six hours, the preprinted parts, made of a special mortar, were assembled.
