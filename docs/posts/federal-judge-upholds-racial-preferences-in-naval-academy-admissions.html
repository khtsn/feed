In that case, against Harvard College and the University of North Carolina, the Supreme Court decided in 2023 that the race-based admissions had violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.</p><p>But the effort to bring those arguments to the Naval Academy “has FAILED,” U.S. Senior District Judge Richard D. Bennett of Maryland wrote in a 175-page decision filed.</p><p>Judge Bennett wrote that there was a “compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps in the Navy and Marine Corps,” and that “the U.S. Naval Academy is distinct from a civilian university.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The judge cited a U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services report from this year that found a continuing problem of underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in the military service academies. “This is fundamentally a military personnel issue,” he said.</p><p>Students for Fair Admissions said on Friday that it was disappointed in the ruling and that it would appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary.</p><p>“It is our hope that the U.S. military academies ultimately will be compelled to follow the Supreme Court’s prohibition of race in college admissions,” Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, said in a statement.</p><p>The U.S. Naval Academy said in a statement that it was reviewing the court’s decision.</p><p>The Supreme Court exempted the military academies, including West Point, the Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy, from its affirmative action decision, writing that they presented potentially distinct interests that required further consideration.</p><p>The government argued in both the Supreme Court case and the one against the Naval Academy that national security depended on the academies’ ability to use racial preferences to develop a pipeline of officers who mirror the demographic composition of the enlisted troops and the population at large.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Students for Fair Admissions has argued that this view is rooted in particular circumstances of the Vietnam War that no longer apply.</p><p>Judge Bennett said in his decision that 52 percent of enlisted Navy service members belong to racial minority groups, but only 31 percent of officers do. In 2020, only about 17 of the 218 admirals in the Navy were officers of color, he said.</p><p>In the Marine Corps, the least diverse branch of the armed services, minority service members make up 35 percent of enlisted Marines, and 29 percent of officers, the judge said.</p><p>“There is a significant deficiency in the number of officers of color in the officer corps of the Navy and Marine Corps,” he wrote.</p><p>Judge Bennett said that the academy had not set racial quotas or engaged in racial balancing — both forbidden by Supreme Court precedent — and that no candidate was admitted solely based on race.</p><p>He added that race consciousness was part of an admissions process that was “far more complex” than that of civilian universities. Candidates have to be nominated, and the process involves federal statutes, Department of Defense directives and Navy regulations, Judge Bennett wrote.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Dec. 6, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the date the decision was filed.
