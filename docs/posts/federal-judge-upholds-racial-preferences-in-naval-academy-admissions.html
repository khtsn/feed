In that case, against Harvard College and the University of North Carolina, the Supreme Court decided in 2023 that race-based admissions at those schools violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.</p><p>But the effort to bring those arguments to the Naval Academy “has FAILED,” U.S. Senior District Judge Richard D. Bennett of Maryland wrote in a 175-page decision.</p><p>Judge Bennett wrote that there was a “compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps in the Navy and Marine Corps,” and that “the U.S. Naval Academy is distinct from a civilian university.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The judge cited a U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services report from this year that found a continuing problem of underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in the military service academies. “This is fundamentally a military personnel issue,” he said.</p><p>Students for Fair Admissions said on Friday that it was disappointed in the ruling and that it would appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary.</p><p>“It is our hope that the U.S. military academies ultimately will be compelled to follow the Supreme Court’s prohibition of race in college admissions,” Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, said in a statement.</p><p>The U.S. Naval Academy said in a statement that it was reviewing the court’s decision.</p><p>The Supreme Court exempted the military academies, including West Point, the Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy, from its affirmative action decision, writing that they presented potentially distinct interests that required further consideration.</p><p>The government argued in both the Supreme Court case and the one against the Naval Academy that national security depended on the academies’ ability to use racial preferences to develop a pipeline of officers who mirror the demographic composition of the enlisted troops and the population at large.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Students for Fair Admissions has argued that the racial strife the government wants to avert was unique to the Vietnam War. It was caused by the draft’s unequal effect on white, wealthy Americans who could get college deferments and poorer Black and Latino Americans who were sent to the front lines, the group has argued, and it no longer applies.</p><p>Judge Bennett said in his decision that 52 percent of enlisted Navy service members belong to racial minority groups, but only 31 percent of officers do. In 2020, only about 17 of the 218 admirals in the Navy were officers of color, he said.</p><p>In the Marine Corps, the least diverse branch of the armed services, minority service members make up 35 percent of enlisted Marines, and 29 percent of officers, the judge said.</p><p>“There is a significant deficiency in the number of officers of color in the officer corps of the Navy and Marine Corps,” he wrote.</p><p>Of the three military academies, Students for Fair Admissions has sued Annapolis and West Point, but not the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The incoming Trump administration could add a new dimension to the case. The first Trump administration was critical of race-based admissions and sued Yale over its policies. (When the Biden administration took over, the federal government dropped that lawsuit.)</p><p>The new Trump administration could take steps to forbid the use of race in admissions to the military academies. One route would be to issue an executive order. Another would be to create some kind of legal agreement between Students for Fair Admissions and the Department of Justice.</p><p>In its complaint, filed in October 2023, Students for Fair Admissions argued that the use of racial preferences in the military academies is regressive and akin to segregation.</p><p>“America’s enemies do not fight differently based on the race of the commanding officer opposing them, sailors must follow orders without regard to the skin color of those giving them, and battlefield realities apply equally to all sailors regardless of race, ethnicity, or national origin,” the complaint said. “To that end, President Truman desegregated the military well before other institutions followed suit.”</p><p>The complaint argued that the Naval Academy “has strayed from that approach.”</p><p>Admissions to the selective military academy is a zero-sum game, the complaint argues, in which white candidates lose their places to Black and Hispanic ones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Judge Bennett disagreed. He adopted the argument that there should be more parity between enlisted and officer ranks. And he said that the academy had not set racial quotas or engaged in racial balancing — both forbidden by Supreme Court precedent — and that no candidate was admitted solely based on race.</p><p>While Students for Fair Admissions is the named plaintiff in the Annapolis lawsuit, the complaint lists two students who applied to the academy and were rejected, and who the complaint says would apply again if given the chance. One is white and the other is Asian. They are not identified by name for fear of reprisal from the academy and others, the complaint says.</p><p>The judge argued that the use of race at the Naval Academy was part of a process that was “far more complex” than that of civilian universities. Candidates have to be nominated, and the process involves federal statutes, Department of Defense directives and Navy regulations, he noted.</p><p>The end of affirmative action in civilian colleges and universities has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/us/black-enrollment-affirmative-action-amherst-tufts-uva.html" title="">led to significant declines</a> in Black and Hispanic students at some schools.
