The government’s chief patron, Iran, moved to evacuate military commanders and other personnel after more than a decade of staunch support.</p><p>Those evacuated by Iran included top commanders of the powerful Quds Forces, according to Iranian and regional officials. Separately, a force led by Kurds and backed by the U.S. deployed in an eastern city previously held by al-Assad’s government. Taken together, the battlefield gains present the most serious challenge in years to the Syrian president’s power. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/syria-war-maps-control.html" title="">Here’s a map of the movements in the war.</a></p><p>The rebels are led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group previously linked to Al Qaeda.

The company argued that the law infringes on the First Amendment rights of American users. The judges disagreed.</p><p>“This ruling effectively means that TikTok’s main hope for survival in the United States is that the Supreme Court takes up this case,” Sapna said. “While Donald Trump has promised to save the app, the law is set to go into effect the day before his inauguration and it’s unclear how he could evade an act of Congress and whether he wants to risk much political capital on this given his hawkish stance on China.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-7d835d7f">N.Y.P.D. said the shooting suspect may have left the city</h2><p>New York’s police commissioner said today that the man who fatally shot a health insurance executive in Midtown Manhattan might have left the city.
