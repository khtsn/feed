By noon, he tries to stop smoking meth, so he can get to sleep later that night. Quitting is not on his radar: meth rules his life.<span>  </span>“We cannot ride on the railroad, the railroad rides upon us,” he said, with a nod to Henry David Thoreau.</p><hr/><p>Recently, he encountered a young man in full meth psychosis, wild-eyed, bare-chested and bleeding, flinging himself against concrete barriers in an alley. Mr. Burns slipped between the man and a brick wall and wrapped his arms protectively around him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Even as the man flailed uncontrollably, smacking Mr. Burns and smearing blood on his shirt, he managed to stammer, “Sorry!” Speaking softly, Mr. Burns kept repeating, “You’re going to be safe. You’re OK. We’re here because we just want to make sure you’re safe. No, you’re not in trouble. Nobody wants to hurt you. ”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I was telling myself, ‘Don’t go down to the block. Stay sober. Don’t go,’ ” she said. “I intended to get some Adderalls, which was my original favorite drug of choice. I couldn’t find my friend and I ran into someone else who gave me a pebble of meth. After that, it was all history. Every day.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“People who are housed have a degree of concealment when they struggle with psychiatric and substance use disorders,” she said. “But if they are unsheltered and using methamphetamine, they are going to develop psychotic symptoms in public.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I hate meth so much,” she said. “Health care providers are just having to hold and support so much suffering in a way that we don’t experience with opioids. Meth just turns up the volume and the intensity in ways that make things so much more complicated for our patients and for us.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Since stopping meth, she has been locked in battle with fentanyl. “At least I’m not the monster I was,” she said. “On meth, I was a very bad person.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“When the snow recedes, you find all these needles and orange caps everywhere. We refer to them as Bayside tulips,” she said. “I’m not trying to be disrespectful of anyone’s struggle. It is what it is.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“His accident stopped us doing meth,” Jaimee said. “There was no way I was having someone who was broken and relearning how to walk, with a walker, do a meth shot, because meth just makes you want to go, go, go. You can’t sit still, especially him. So our drug use just wasn’t that important.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>She is often called in to help people who are “tweaking” on meth, a stage when they can be ranting and hallucinating. When they are in that escalated state, however, hospitals and shelters usually won’t admit them.</p><p>“What are we supposed to do?” she said. “Meth makes it really difficult. We try to relocate them, give them food and water, and hope that the meth wears off. But, I mean, that’s not a solution.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><hr/><p>Produced by <!-- -->Antonio de Luca<!-- -->, <!-- -->Matt McCann<!-- --> and <!-- -->Elijah Walker<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jan Hoffman is a health reporter for The Times covering drug addiction and health law.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
