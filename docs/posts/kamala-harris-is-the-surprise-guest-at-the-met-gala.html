Ish.”</p><p>Unlike the Chloé pantsuits that Ms. Harris seemed to have adopted as a semi-uniform by the end of her presidential run, the dress — an Off-White look designed by Ib Kamara, who took on the brand after the untimely death of founder Virgil Abloh — was dramatic. It told the story of two sides. It was a return to the more inclusive dressing strategy Ms. Harris demonstrated during the 2021 inauguration events, when she wore work by all Black designers. And it will probably be controversial.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“To me, the true core of dandyism is rooted in confidence and strength,” Mr. Kamara said. “There is no person who exemplifies these characteristics more than Kamala D. Harris, someone who has overcome adversity and continues to be a beacon for so many.”</p><p>Still, political figures are relative rarities at the Met Gala, which tends to over-index on celebrities of all kinds — from Hollywood, in sports, from the art world — and the fashion brands that love them.</p><p>Attending the Met can be a fraught decision for any elected official, given the cost ($75,000 a ticket) and its association with coastal elitism and fame. For a Democratic politician like Ms. Harris, who critics believe lost November’s election in part because she and her party were seen as out of touch with the middle of the country, it is especially complicated.</p><p>Representative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/style/aoc-met-gala-dress.html" title="">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> made a splash when she attended the gala in 2021, in a gown blaring the message “Tax the Rich.” But there was more discussion over whether she should have been at the party in the first place, given her progressive positions, than there was about the point made by her dress. When Mayor Eric Adams appeared in 2022 wearing a tailcoat with the words “End Gun Violence” on the back, it prompted much <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/02/1096049375/nyc-mayor-end-gun-violence-met-gala-jacket-criticism-online" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the same reaction</a>.</p><p>Which is to say, Ms. Harris’s arrival was also a political calculation.</p><p>The exhibit the gala celebrates, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” explores the history of the Black dandy and is the first costume institute show to include only designers of color. Honoring that event allowed Ms. Harris to recognize her community and her roots; according to a news release, her look was inspired by “the Black men who helped shape her childhood and were some of her first fashion influences.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Those men included her Uncle Freddy, whom she would visit in New York, where he worked at the Studio Museum in Harlem and who she said “had incredible style, confidence, and swagger.”</p><p>Attending the event (she was accompanied by her husband, Doug Emhoff, who wore Brunello Cucinelli) also allowed her to align herself with an exhibit that seems to represent an unspoken riposte to many of the values espoused by Mr. Trump.</p><p>Additionally, Anna Wintour, the mastermind of the gala and the gala’s guest list, is a powerful Democratic fund-raiser who held an event for the Biden-Harris campaign during Paris fashion week in <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/media/anna-wintour-to-host-fundraising-event-for-biden-campaign-during-paris-fashion-week/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">March 2024</a>. As the editor of Vogue she also put Ms. Harris on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/style/kamala-harris-vogue.html" title="">magazine’s cover</a> in 2021 and on its digital cover in October 2024, after formally endorsing her last July.</p><p>Whether Ms. Harris’s appearance at Ms. Wintour’s greatest shindig is a bit of mutual back-scratching or the start of her next act (or both) is the question.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vanessa Friedman has been the fashion director and chief fashion critic for The Times since 2014.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>States Sue Administration Over H.H.S.</strong><strong>:</strong> The lawsuit, led by New York, argues that the slashing of grants and staff at the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/states-lawsuit-trump-administration-hhs-cutbacks.html">amounts to the “illegal dismantling” of the agency.</a></p></li><li><p>‘<strong>Canada Is Not for Sale’</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>President Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada, in the first meeting between the two leaders, sparred over the president’s talk of making Canada the 51st state.
