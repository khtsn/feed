encrypted messaging app Signal just days before Donald J. Trump’s presidential inauguration.</p><p>“ZMoney” was Zachary Folkman, an entrepreneur who once ran a company called Date Hotter Girls and was now representing World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency firm that Mr. Trump and his sons had recently unveiled. Mr. Folkman was writing to a crypto startup in the Cayman Islands, offering a “partnership” in which the firms would buy each other’s digital coins, a deal that would bolster the startup’s public profile.</p><p>But there was a catch, The New York Times found. For the privilege of associating with the Trumps, the startup would have to make, in effect, a secret multimillion dollar payment to World Liberty.</p><p>“Everything we do gets a lot of exposure and credibility,” Mr. Folkman wrote, asserting that other business partners had committed between $10 million and $30 million to World Liberty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Cayman startup rejected the offer, as did several other firms that received a similar pitch from World Liberty, executives said. They considered the deal unethical, concluding that World Liberty was essentially selling an endorsement — and hiding the arrangement from the public.</p><p>World Liberty’s executives, who have maintained that they did nothing improper, were undeterred. They successfully pitched similar deals to other firms while also marketing their coin to buyers around the world, reaping more than $550 million in sales, with a large cut earmarked for the president’s family.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s return to the White House has opened lucrative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/trump-organization-ethics-policy-foreign-deals.html" title="">new pathways for him to cash in on his power</a>, whether through his social media company or new overseas real estate deals. But none of the Trump family’s other business endeavors pose conflicts of interest that compare to those that have emerged since the birth of World Liberty.</p><p>The firm, <a href="https://www.worldlibertyfinancial.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largely</a> owned by a Trump <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/8793b04e9c73c074/273dbca8-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">family corporate entity</a>, has erased centuries-old presidential norms, eviscerating the boundary between private enterprise and government policy in a manner without precedent in modern American history.</p><p>Mr. Trump is now not only a major crypto dealer; he is also the industry’s top policy maker. So far in his second term, Mr. Trump has leveraged his presidential powers in ways that have benefited the industry — and in some cases his own company — even though he had spent years deriding crypto as a haven for drug dealers and scammers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He has filled his administration with sympathizers to the crypto cause, including by appointing a former adviser to industry players as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the Justice Department recently disbanded a crypto crimes task force, continuing a broader unwinding of Biden-era scrutiny of the industry.</p><p>A Times examination of World Liberty’s rapid ascent from fledgling startup to international force — and Mr. Trump’s conversion from crypto skeptic to industry cheerleader — highlights the range of conflicts of interest trailing the company:</p><ul><li><p>World Liberty has directly benefited from Mr. Trump’s official actions, such as his announcement of a federal crypto stockpile that would include a digital currency the firm has invested in. The president’s announcement caused a temporary jump in the value of World Liberty’s holdings.</p></li><li><p>World Liberty has sold its cryptocurrency to investors abroad, including in Israel and Hong Kong, according to interviews and<span>  </span>data obtained by The Times, establishing a new avenue for foreign businesses to try to curry favor with Mr. Trump.</p></li><li><p>Several investors in World Liberty’s coin managed firms that the federal government accused of wrongdoing. They include an executive whose fraud case was suspended after he invested millions of dollars in World Liberty. Other investors and business partners, some of whom haven’t been publicly identified before, are looking to expand in ways that will require the Trump administration’s approval.</p></li><li><p>World Liberty proposed swapping cryptocurrencies with at least five start-ups, and often used the Trump name to solicit steep payments as part of the deals. Even in an industry with a disreputable history, the deals raised alarm among veteran executives.</p></li></ul><p>“It’s a black spot on our industry,” said Andre Cronje, a founder of SonicLabs, a crypto firm that turned down World Liberty’s pitch.

They differ from traditional digital currencies like Bitcoin, which constantly fluctuate in price, making them easier to use for certain types of transactions.
