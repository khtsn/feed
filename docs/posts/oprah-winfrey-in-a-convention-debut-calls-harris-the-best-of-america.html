I’ve seen racism and sexism and income inequality and division. I’ve not only seen it at times, I’ve been on the receiving end of it. We are not so different from our neighbors. When a house is on fire, we don’t ask about the homeowner’s race or religion. We don’t wonder who their partner is or how they voted — no. We just try to do the best we can to save them. We’re going to be teaching our daughters and sons about how this child of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, two idealistic, energetic immigrants. Immigrants — how this child grew up to become the 47th president of the United States. That is the best of America.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/21/multimedia/21election-live-takeaways-oprah-vlfc/21election-live-takeaways-oprah-vlfc-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Oprah Winfrey spoke on the third night of the Democratic convention.

Her speech was carefully kept under wraps by Democratic organizers, including a cloak-and-dagger act during rehearsals in which one of the most famous women in America crept into the United Center wearing a hat, sunglasses and a face mask.</p><p>When Ms. Winfrey said hello to Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, Ms. Pelosi had no idea who she was at first, according to Ms. Winfrey’s friend Gayle King, the CBS anchor.</p><p>The obvious excitement in the crowd when Ms. Winfrey emerged on Wednesday evening was a reminder of her power as a public speaker and a widely recognized icon of optimism, particularly among the female and Black voters that Ms. Harris is hoping to turn out in big numbers on Election Day.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Winfrey’s speech touched on school integration, the preservation of democracy, and civil rights icons like John Lewis. Dressed in a purple outfit, she appeared to direct her remarks toward the country’s political independents, a cohort to which she said she belonged.</p><p>“Decency and respect are on the ballot in 2024, and just plain common sense,” Ms. Winfrey said, before building to a climactic passage that evoked the energy of her daytime talk show, which ended in 2011.</p><p>“Let us choose truth, let us choose honor, let us choose joy!” Ms. Winfrey shouted, stretching out the final syllable for several seconds. “Because that is the best of America.”</p><p>The fact that Ms. Winfrey appeared at all represented a feat by Ms. Harris’s campaign team.</p><p>Ms. Winfrey has often shied away from overt political activity, withholding the Oprah seal of approval for all but a few candidates. And at a moment when Americans have lost trust in many institutions, Ms. Winfrey’s celebrity has the ability to transcend politics.</p><p>In 2007, though, Ms. Winfrey waded into presidential politics for the first time. She endorsed Barack Obama, a close friend and compatriot from Chicago’s power circles. Ms. Winfrey hosted fund-raisers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/us/politics/09oprah.html" title="">barnstormed cities in Iowa</a> to round up votes for Mr. Obama, who at the time seemed a long shot to win the nomination.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s campaign sought to capitalize on Ms. Winfrey’s popularity by lobbying her for <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/11/oprah-hillary-clinton-trump-2016-336976" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a full-throated endorsement</a>. It never came. Ms. Winfrey mostly stayed away from politics that year, although she did tell one morning show interviewer, “I’m with her.”</p><p>In 2018, Ms. Winfrey <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/politics/oprah-president-2020.html" title="">stirred speculation</a> that she herself might seek the White House. A speech she delivered at the Golden Globes, where she was accepting a lifetime achievement award, was shared widely for its stirring delivery and approach to grand themes like sexism and racism in America.</p><p>The conversation died down after Ms. Winfrey poured cold water on the idea of a run. But her appearance on Wednesday evening was a reminder that some Democrats once yearned for her to enter the political realm in earnest.</p><p>Ms. King said on CBS on Wednesday that Ms. Winfrey had been editing her remarks up until a few hours before her live appearance.</p><p>“She was still tweaking this afternoon,” Ms. King said on Wednesday. “She hadn’t intended to be involved; she tries to stay out of politics.”</p><p>But, Ms. King added, “she has some things to say tonight.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
