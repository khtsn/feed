Blinken said at a news conference in Doha, the Qatari capital. “The fundamental question is: Is Hamas serious?”</p><p>Mr. Blinken met for an hour with Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar’s prime minister and foreign minister, discussing how to end the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Appearing together afterward at the news conference, they said they had no indication that Hamas was more willing to negotiate since Israel killed its leader, Yahya Sinwar, last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said that David Barnea, the head of the country’s Mossad foreign intelligence service, would depart on Sunday to a meeting in Doha with Mr. Al Thani and William J.

He also had sharp words for Israel, reflecting the view even among Israel’s allies that it has used excessive force against its enemies, resulting in disproportionate casualties and destruction.</p><p>“There has been a lot of talk in recent days of a war of civilizations, or of civilizations that must be defended,” the French president said. “I’m not sure you can defend a civilization by sowing barbarism yourself.”</p><p>Hezbollah has regularly fired munitions into Israel, saying that it was acting in support of Hamas, which is also backed by Iran. While fighting both groups, Israel has also killed some Iranian military commanders, and in July it assassinated Hamas’s leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-dead.html" title="">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, on Iranian soil. In retaliation, Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel early this month, and much of the world is waiting nervously to see how Israel will respond.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, and President Emmanuel Macron of France during an international conference for Lebanon in Paris, on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Alain Jocard</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Biden administration hopes that restarting cease-fire talks for Gaza would de-escalate the entire intertwined set of conflicts.</p><p>U.S. officials had seen Mr. Sinwar, who took over from Mr. Haniyeh, as an obstacle to negotiations and hoped that after his killing, Hamas’s remaining leaders might be more open to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/hamas-leader-sinwar-ceasefire-talks.html" title="">making a deal</a> to end the yearlong war in Gaza and release the dozens of hostages remaining there.</p><p>Mr. Al Thani said at the news conference that Qatar had “re-engaged” with Hamas, which maintains an office in Doha, in the week since Mr. Sinwar’s death, and sensed that Hamas maintains “the same position” as it has for months. Israel and Hamas have repeatedly dismissed each other’s truce conditions as unacceptable.</p><p>Mr. Al Thani added that “there are ongoing discussions between Egypt and Hamas,” but he did not elaborate. A Hamas-run channel, Al Aqsa TV, later confirmed that a Hamas delegation had arrived in Cairo to meet with Egyptian officials.
