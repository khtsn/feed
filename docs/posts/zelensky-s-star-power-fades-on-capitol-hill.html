But as the war against Russia drags on, his star power in Washington has noticeably faded, with potentially dire consequences for the future of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine.</p><p>Ukraine is working its way through a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/us/politics/aid-bill-ukraine-israel-taiwan.html" title="">nearly $61 billion</a> military aid package that Congress approved in the spring and that the Pentagon is trying to get out the door before President Biden leaves office. On Thursday, Mr. Biden announced that the United States would send Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/politics/biden-zelensky-weapons-aid-ukraine.html" title="">$8 billion worth of weapons</a>, including glide bombs, air defense missiles and an additional Patriot battery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But when that military assistance runs out, Ukraine’s fate will once again depend in large part on Congress’s willingness to keep replenishing Mr. Zelensky’s war chest.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky held two meetings at the Capitol on Thursday, first taking questions from a bipartisan group of about 20 senators, including Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader. He then met with a bipartisan group of about a dozen House members, including Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky, who gave a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, had the bad luck of arriving on Capitol Hill the morning after both chambers of Congress adjourned for the campaign season, which was a factor in the low attendance. Congressional leaders did little to raise the profile of his visit: Neither Mr. Schumer nor Mr. McConnell addressed the news media, in person or via an emailed statement, as has happened after Mr. Zelensky’s earlier visits, nor did Mr. Jeffries.</p><p>Nearly every lawmaker who attended the sessions had previously and repeatedly voted in strong support of military assistance for Ukraine.</p><p>“I think he’s an admirable person, obviously showed a lot of courage and leadership in very, very difficult times,” Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said of Mr. Zelensky. “The will of the Ukrainian people to fight and defend their country has been something that I think most of us have found inspirational.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He noted that Ukraine’s president had stressed the importance of having longer-range missiles to strike military targets inside Russia, and of having weapons delivered to Kyiv faster, to help Ukraine gain momentum.</p><p>Yet in other circles, Mr. Zelensky’s visit was met with anger over what some Republicans said was a display of favoritism by the Ukrainian government for Democrats and the Biden administration during an election season.</p><p>On Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, demanded that Mr. Zelensky recall his ambassador to the United States for organizing a trip to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pa., that has been making 155-millimeter artillery rounds that are a staple of Ukraine’s war machine.</p><p>The same day, Representative James R. Comer, Republican of Kentucky and the chairman of the Oversight Committee, opened an investigation into whether the Biden administration misused public funds by flying Mr. Zelensky on military aircraft to visit the plant.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky’s tour of the factory was led by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Democrat of Pennsylvania, which promises to be the most hotly contested swing state in the presidential election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris and failed to include a single Republican,” Mr. Johnson wrote in a letter to Mr. Zelensky, calling the appearance a “shortsighted and intentionally political move.”</p><p>Mr. Johnson also appeared to refer to comments Mr. Zelensky made <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to The New Yorker</a> in which he called Senator JD Vance, the G.O.P.’s vice-presidential nominee, “too radical.”</p><p>“Support for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine continues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested and needlessly tarnished when the candidates at the top of the Republican presidential ticket are targeted in the media by officials in your government,” Mr. Johnson wrote.</p><p>The episodes frustrated some of Mr. Zelensky’s Republican supporters, who expressed concern that the Ukrainian president had weighed in on American politics.</p><p>“I think he got some bad advice,” said Mr. Cornyn, who also separately told reporters it was a “monumental miscalculation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Other Republicans pushed back on the speaker’s characterization of the Scranton tour.</p><p>“It was not supposed to be political, but it’s very understandable that it could be interpreted to be political,” Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina and a co-chairman of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, told reporters of the Scranton event. “I’m confident that the government of Ukraine was not meant to be political.”</p><p>The spat is a reminder of the challenges Mr. Zelensky could face in coming months if Republicans take full control of Congress and if former President Donald J. Trump, who has been vocal about his opposition to arming Ukraine, wins the election.</p><p>Mr. Johnson, under pressure from right-wing Republicans opposed to funding Ukraine’s war effort, spent months resisting efforts to put a military aid bill on the House floor, eventually relenting last spring when Congress approved $61 billion for Kyiv as part of a package of national security bills. Though Congress eventually passed military assistance for Ukraine with strong bipartisan support, a majority of Republicans in the House, and about a third of Senate Republicans, voted against it.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky, who visited Capitol Hill last year in September and December, seemed to be cognizant of the hurdles Ukraine aid faces — and careful about sidestepping them. During Thursday’s meetings, attendees said that he studiously avoided asking lawmakers to approve any additional assistance.</p><p>When asked by reporters whether he could bring the war with Russia to an end, Mr. Zelensky responded affirmatively.</p><p>“Of course,” he said. “We have to.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karoun Demirjian covers Congress with a focus on defense, foreign policy, intelligence, immigration, and trade and technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karoun-demirjian">More about Karoun Demirjian</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>9</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Speaker Snubs Zelensky As Bipartisanship Ebbs<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
