Those efforts often cite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/us/politics/vance-ohio-conspiracy-theory-immigration.html" title="">baseless claims over noncitizens voting</a> that have proliferated in right-wing media.</p><p>Voting rights organizers now say they are stepping up efforts to counter what they call voter intimidation and attempts to criminalize their members and volunteers ahead of Election Day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In interviews, leaders of organizations working to get voters to the polls in Alabama, Arizona, Texas, Georgia and Florida said they were increasing their training, building new lines of communication with local election officials and pre-emptively seeking legal support to prepare for challenges. That groundwork, they said, is critical because the presidential race is expected to be won at the margins in a handful of swing states.</p><p>“This has just increased our alert here at home,” said Hillary Holley, a longtime activist in Georgia, where battles over elections have raged in recent years.</p><p>Ken Paxton, the Republican attorney general of Texas, said the search warrants against Democratic operatives and members of the League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the nation’s oldest Latino civil rights organizations, were carried out as part of an “ongoing election integrity investigation” into allegations of election fraud and vote harvesting that began two years ago. His office declined to comment further on the cases. The civil rights group has asked the Justice Department to investigate the sweeps.</p><p>Kathy Jones, the president of the League of Women Voters of Alabama, said the Texas raids had reinvigorated her organization’s work to educate members and volunteers about the voting process. The Texas investigations, she said, have had a ripple effect in Alabama, which since 2018 has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/us/politics/voting-rights-alabama.html" title="">adopted restrictive voting measures</a> that disproportionately affect voters who are Black or Latino.</p><p>“It is just shocking the efforts that are being made to cause fear and chaos with people who are just trying to help their fellow neighbors being able to vote,” Ms. Jones said. Still, she added, the raids in Texas had made her members “more determined not to be intimidated.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Héctor Sánchez Barba, the president of Mi Familia Vota, which oversees some of the largest Latino voter mobilization groups in swing states, said his group was looking to increase already heavy investments in security guards, digital forensics to prevent hacking, and safety and de-escalation training for canvassers.</p><p>In <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-florida-voter-registration-noncitizen-proof-314008662755" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Florida</a> and Colorado, members of the group have faced harassment from people following them and filming and photographing their activities, he said. The Supreme Court last week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/supreme-court-arizona-voter-registration-law.html" title="">reinstated key provisions</a> to an Arizona law, which Mi Familia Vota and others had challenged in a lawsuit, requiring canvassers to verify a person’s citizenship before registering him or her to vote.</p><p>“They are making it really hard for us to do our work,” he said. “It requires us to essentially enforce immigration laws.”</p><p>Republicans said the legal requirements were needed to prevent noncitizens from voting, adding that allowing unqualified people to register and cast ballots would dilute the voting rights of legitimate voters and undermine confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.</p><p>The focus on ballot fraud <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/magazine/voting-rights-act-dream-undone.html" title="">has roots in Reconstruction-era efforts</a> to suppress the votes of newly freed enslaved people, and was revived after the passage of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/magazine/voting-rights-act-dream-undone.html" title="">the Voting Rights Act in 1965</a>. But former President Donald J. Trump’s promotion of the false notion in recent years has given it fresh prominence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>States like Texas began escalating inquiries into voter fraud as Mr. Trump falsely claimed that millions of unauthorized immigrants had cast ballots in 2016, costing him the popular vote. The push for actions grew fiercer as he and his allies spread the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. Since then, Texas and several other states have moved to establish “election integrity” units, purge voters from their rolls and pass laws restricting how and when people can vote.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas and a Republican, said the raids were part of an election fraud investigation that began two years ago.

And conspiratorial talk about Democrats’ allowing immigrants into the country to vote for their candidates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/politics/rnc-immigration-trump-takeaways.html" title="">has become a dominant feature</a> of the Republican Party’s message on immigration.</p><p>Audits have turned up administrative failures in places like Houston, but courts, law enforcement officers and elections officials have found no evidence of widespread fraud.</p><p>On the same day as the raids, which spanned counties near San Antonio and in South Texas, Mr. Paxton announced an investigation into organizations that he said were “illegally registering noncitizens to vote in our elections.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On Monday, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, announced that under the state’s new voter policies, his office had removed more than a million people from the voter rolls, including some who were noncitizens. Local elections officials and the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas expressed concerns over the data, given flawed <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/abbott-decries-noncitizen-voters-activists-19723919.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">numbers in previous purges</a>.</p><p>Voting rights leaders said they were working to allay fears among their members that any mistake could be used to entrap them in broader criminal charges.</p><p>Cecile Scoon, the co-president of the League of Women Voters of Florida, said security concerns following the Texas raids were giving her group pause as it considered whether to renew its program helping people with paper ballot registration forms. The group, which skews older, halted the program last year after Florida introduced requirements for receipts on that assistance and increased fines and charges over violations.</p><p>“You have this hammer that is hitting everyone,” Ms. Scoon said, pointing to religious organizations and civic groups that often work with Black and Latino voters.</p><p>Tyler Sterling, the national mobilization director with the N.A.A.C.P., said his chapters were “no stranger to state-sanctioned voter suppression efforts.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>His group has been training its 2,200 member organizations how to spot voter intimidation tactics, and has created a website where members can file incident reports, so the group can collect data on cases down to the precinct.</p><p>“It is appalling and unfortunate that state-sanctioned voter suppression continues in a time when we have seen some of our safest elections across the country,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jazmine Ulloa is a national politics reporter for The Times, covering the 2024 presidential campaign.
