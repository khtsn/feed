But in his final months he has been seeking to cement a legacy as a transformative president that stabilized domestic politics while bolstering America’s leadership abroad, one who ushered the nation out of a pandemic, made historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy, and worked to strengthen democratic institutions both nationally and globally.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/15/the-biden-harris-administration-record/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter published early Wednesday</a> before his address, Mr. Biden said the country was “stronger, more prosperous and more secure” than it was four years ago.</p><p>“It has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years,” Mr. Biden wrote. “Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States. I have given my heart and my soul to our nation. And I have been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“History is in your hands,” he added.</p><p>Whatever image the president seeks to project on Wednesday evening, it is set against a backdrop in which he is leaving office <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deeply unpopular</a> and handing the reins to a successor, Donald J. Trump, whom he disdains and has repeatedly said is unfit to hold power.</p><p>Even the location of the speech, from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, is a reminder that Mr. Biden is not departing as he may have wanted. His last prime-time address delivered there was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/biden-speech-transcript.html" title="">11 minutes</a> he spent in July explaining why he dropped out of the presidential race under pressure from his own party as questions mounted about his age and fitness for another term.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
