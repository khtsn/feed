But in his final months he has been seeking to cement a legacy as a transformative president who stabilized domestic politics while bolstering America’s leadership abroad, one who ushered the nation out of a pandemic, made historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy, and worked to strengthen democratic institutions both nationally and globally.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/15/the-biden-harris-administration-record/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter published early Wednesday</a> before his address, Mr. Biden said the country was “stronger, more prosperous and more secure” than it was four years ago.</p><p>“It has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years,” Mr. Biden wrote. “Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States. I have given my heart and my soul to our nation. And I have been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“History is in your hands,” he added.</p><p>Whatever image the president seeks to project on Wednesday evening, it is set against a backdrop in which he is leaving office <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deeply unpopular</a> and handing the reins to a successor, Donald J. Trump, whom he disdains and has repeatedly said is unfit to hold power.</p><p>Even the location of the speech, from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, is a reminder that Mr. Biden is not departing as he may have wanted. His last prime-time address delivered there was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/biden-speech-transcript.html" title="">11 minutes</a> he spent in July explaining why he dropped out of the presidential race under pressure from his own party as questions mounted about his age and fitness for another term.</p><p>Since Mr. Biden left the race and especially since Mr. Trump’s election victory in November, the president has struggled to maintain the spotlight.</p><p>“Farewell addresses are challenging because they aim to put the capstone on an era at a time when most of the country has already moved on to the next one,” said Robert Schlesinger, the author of the book “White House Ghosts: Presidents and Their Speechwriters.”</p><p>The farewell address, a tradition that dates back to George Washington, is one of a series of speeches Mr. Biden is giving in his last days in office. By turns, he has highlighted domestic accomplishments, such as his conservation record. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/us/politics/biden-foreign-policy-speech.html" title="">an address focused on foreign policy</a> at the State Department on Monday, Mr. Biden said he had fortified America’s place as a global leader and left it in a stronger position with allies and foes than it was four years ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hours before his address, Mr. Biden bolstered his foreign policy legacy by announcing that Israel and Hamas had accepted a deal he proposed last spring for a cease-fire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages that the terrorist group took when it attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/15/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire-deal-gaza" title="">deal, when ratified</a>, will end a 15-month conflict that has clouded the last year of Mr. Biden’s tenure — he was protested across the country as “Genocide Joe” for supporting Israel’s war that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians — and isolated the United States globally.</p><p>He will give at least two more speeches this week in which he is expected to continue building the case that as a one-term president, he made generational progress. </p><p>And in remarks as recently as last week, he has remained defiant about the presidential race, saying that he believed that he could have beaten Mr. Trump and that his decision to drop out was motivated by his desire to unify the Democratic Party.</p><p>“I think I would have beaten Trump, could have beaten Trump, and I think that Kamala could have beaten Trump,” Mr. Biden said, adding: “I thought it was important to unify the party. Even though I thought I could win again, I thought it was better to unify the party.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Biden has told donors that he intends to stay involved in the party after he leaves office. Last week, when asked what role he planned to take on post-presidency, he responded: “I’m not going to be out of sight or out of mind.”</p><p>Previous presidents have used their farewell address to both reflect on their records and warn of challenges ahead.</p><p>In 2001, President Bill Clinton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/19/us/transition-washington-president-farewell-talk-clinton-looks-back-forward.html" title="">used his farewell address</a> to warn his successor not to diminish the country’s economic prosperity and global presence. In 2009, President George W. Bush <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/world/americas/16iht-bush.3.19429446.html" title="">delivered a somber address</a>, in which he acknowledged “setbacks” during his eight years in office, but said he hoped Americans understood that he did what he thought was right. Before turning the reins over to Mr. Trump in 2017, President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/obama-farewell-address-president.html" title="">warned</a> that economic inequity, racism and closed-mindedness threatened democracy and unity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President George W. Bush acknowledged setbacks during his farewell speech in 2009.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In his farewell address in 2021, Mr. Trump, politically isolated and facing impeachment after the attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters on Jan. 6, told supporters who had gathered to watch him take off from the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews: “Goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Historians said Mr. Biden’s address could be reminiscent of the one by Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose farewell is considered among the most memorable since George Washington’s, and like Mr. Biden’s, was delivered after a half-century of public service.</p><p>William Hitchcock, Mr. Eisenhower’s biographer, said he would expect that Mr. Biden would make veiled references to the dangers to democracy and an “ethos of service,” painting a contrast with Mr. Trump, if not explicitly.</p><p>“It would be reasonable for him to deliver a personal farewell, focused on a life of public service — he literally gave his life and indeed his family members’ lives to this country,” Mr. Hitchcock said. “And I think projecting sacrifice and service is something he’s comfortable doing. The contrast to his successor will be obvious to his listeners. That’s not something he has to do.”</p><p>Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Eisenhower left after their handpicked successors — their vice presidents — lost their elections. But Mr. Eisenhower, who at the time was the oldest president to serve, did not explicitly criticize his young successor, John F. Kennedy, though he thought little of him.</p><p>But the gravity of the moment will be palpable, he said.</p><p>“It’s a bitter moment of transition,” Mr. Hitchcock added, “just as it was for Eisenhower.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
