was part of Russia’s so-called shadow fleet of ships aimed at bypassing sanctions.</p><p>The Estlink 2 submarine cable, which carries electricity between Finland and Estonia, was cut on Wednesday, Finland’s police <a href="https://poliisi.fi/-/poliisi-tutkii-yhteistyossa-muiden-viranomaisten-kanssa-suomenlahden-tapahtumia?languageId=en_US" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>, the latest in a slew of disruptions to undersea infrastructure that are being investigated as acts of sabotage. The Finnish authorities said Thursday that <a href="https://traficom.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/traficom-mukana-selvittamassa-suomenlahden-kaapelivaurioita" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four other cables</a> carrying data also had been damaged.</p><p>A number of other vital undersea cables <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/business/finland-germany-cable-baltic-sea.html" title="">have been cut</a> in recent months, raising fears that Russia might be waging a shadow campaign against NATO nations that have supported Ukraine in the face of Moscow’s full-scale invasion.</p><p>Last month, two fiber-optic cables were cut in the Baltic Sea in what Germany’s defense minister <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/business/finland-germany-cable-baltic-sea.html" title="">described</a> as an act of sabotage. One cable connected Finland and Germany; the other ran between Lithuania and Sweden — all members of the NATO alliance.<span>  </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Russian ships <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/world/europe/russian-oil-tankers-gabon.html" title="">have been reported</a> in the Baltic and North Seas near areas where critical infrastructure lies beneath the waters, and dozens of Russian tankers have begun sailing under different flags to evade sanctions.</p><p>The police in Finland called the latest cable cuts “aggravated vandalism.” In a statement on Thursday, the police said authorities had seized the Eagle S tanker, which is registered in the Cook Islands in the South Pacific. The ship was sailing <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:712379/mmsi:518998865/imo:9329760/vessel:EAGLE_S" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from St. Petersburg, Russia to Port Said, Egypt</a> when it entered Finnish waters.</p><p>“We assume at this stage that the vessel in question is a member of the shadow fleet” used by Russia, the head of Finland’s customs agency, Sami Rakshit, told a news conference, without providing further details.</p><p>Finland’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, said that while there was no direct evidence that the Eagle S was connected to Russia, the incident underscored Baltic nations’ vulnerability to potential meddling from Moscow.</p><p>“This underlies the danger of the shadow fleet in the Baltic Sea,” Mr. Orpo said at a news conference in Finland’s capital, Helsinki.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Our main task is to find effective means to stop the shadow fleet,” Mr. Orpo added. “The shadow fleet pumps money into Russia’s war fund so that Russia can continue to wage its war in Ukraine against the people of Ukraine, and it has to be stopped.”</p><p>Mr. Orpo said at the news conference that Finnish leaders had discussed the incidents with officials from Estonia, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Poland, NATO and the European Commission.</p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, commended Finland’s “swift action.”</p><p>“Yesterday’s Baltic Sea incident highlights threats to E.U. infrastructure,” she <a href="https://x.com/vonderleyen" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a>. “Together we will increase our common protection of European critical infrastructure including undersea cables.”</p><p>Estonia’s prime minister, Kristen Michal, said his government had been coordinating with Finland to respond to the cable cuts. </p><p>“Glad that we managed to act decisively and stop the suspected vessel for further investigation,” Mr. Michal <a href="https://x.com/kristenmichalpm?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The cut to the Estlink 2 cable caused little disruption in Finland and Estonia.
