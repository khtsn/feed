The ship, which is registered in the Cook Islands in the South Pacific, had been sailing <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:712379/mmsi:518998865/imo:9329760/vessel:EAGLE_S" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from St. Petersburg, Russia, to Port Said, Egypt</a>, when it was detained.</p><p>The police said they were investigating whether the vessel was involved in the latest suspected act of sabotage on undersea infrastructure: the cutting on Wednesday of the Estlink 2 submarine cable, which carries electricity between Finland and Estonia. The Finnish authorities said Thursday that <a href="https://traficom.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/traficom-mukana-selvittamassa-suomenlahden-kaapelivaurioita" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four other cables</a> carrying data also had been damaged. The police called the latest cable cuts “aggravated vandalism.”</p><p>The Finnish authorities said the tanker might be part of Russia’s shadow fleet, which emerged as a way to circumvent Western-imposed price caps on Russian oil transported by sea. The caps were introduced several months after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>To skirt the restrictions, the Kremlin invested billions of dollars in a fleet of mostly unmarked tankers not easily traced to Russia. Many sail <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/world/europe/russian-oil-tankers-gabon.html" title="">under the flags of other nations</a>, like the Central African country of Gabon, and sell to buyers in countries like India and China, which are not bound by the price cap.</p><p>The goal was largely economic and mostly successful. Since the oil price cap was enacted, nearly 70 percent of Russia’s oil is being transported by so-called shadow tankers, according to an analysis published in October by the Kyiv School of Economics Institute, a Ukraine-based think tank.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
