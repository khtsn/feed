The financial services industry, after all, is one in which more major banks are named after the Morgan family than led by a female chief executive.</p><p>So it meant something over the past half-decade or so when the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/jpmorgan-diversity.html" title="">biggest names in finance said</a>, over and over again, that they would pour dollars and effort into lending to, hiring, promoting and working with underserved communities.</p><p>And it means something else now, as many of those much-promoted policies and practices are being scrubbed to be sure they don’t wind up in the cross hairs of the Trump administration’s campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion.</p><p>The retreat includes white-collar investment banks, consultancies, mutual funds and stock exchanges. The latest was Goldman Sachs, which said on Tuesday that it would drop a quota that forced corporate boards of directors to include women and members of minority groups. Others on Wall Street are curtailing efforts to recruit Black and Latino employees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>One international bank, BNP Paribas, even hit the brakes on programming new events for next month’s International Women’s Day.</p><p>This pullback has thus far been less overt than, say, in the technology industry, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/technology/trump-tech-ceos.html" title="">whose executives have</a> made public displays of their support for President Trump’s anti-diversity initiatives. And some financial firms <a href="https://www.pionline.com/esg/wall-streets-dei-retreat-has-officially-begun" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had started to make changes</a> long before the election — opening programs aimed at minority candidates to all, for example.</p><p>The renewed push, though, reflects an acceptance among the financial elite that if it was once good business sense to champion diversity, it is now beneficial to abandon that cause.</p><p>“The speed at which everyone is abandoning this work and fleeing this space is pretty amazing,” said Seth Welty, a former investment bank diversity recruiter.</p><p>At Citi, employees have peppered Mark Mason, the bank’s chief financial officer and one of the industry’s most senior Black executives, with questions about whether the bank will stick to its D.E.I. promises, he told staff in a closed-door meeting on Thursday, according to two employees present and a transcript reviewed by The New York Times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Mason told staff that he had few concrete answers. “The strategies and programs that we have may have to evolve, but I don’t see our core values changing.

Thirteen included training on combating “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/smarter-living/unconscious-bias-trust.html" title="">unconscious biases</a>,” or the idea that employees may inadvertently discriminate against others, the employee said.</p><p>Asked about the offerings, Citi said that count was inaccurate. A spokeswoman said the total was 10 in the United States if the count excluded courses such as those required by law, repeated in multiple languages and some that the bank — after inquiries from The Times — had determined were inaccurately described as diversity-related. Some should have been categorized as “anti-harassment,” and only one is specifically devoted to unconscious bias, the spokeswoman said.</p><p>“We continue to actively review the executive orders to understand any impact they may have to our business and will make any required changes,” she wrote in an emailed statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-72d98bc5">A Raging Debate</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/business/economy/trump-wall-street-promises.html" title="">Financiers were ebullient</a> in the run-up to Mr. Trump’s inauguration, as he chose Wall Street-friendly faces for top jobs and pledged less interference in business.</p><p>He has rewarded their hope in some respects — by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/russell-vought-consumer-bureau-protect-hq-close.html" title="">defanging the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>, for one — but put them on the D.E.I. defensive. The president signed sweeping executive orders rolling back <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/business/trump-dei-corporate-reaction.html" title="">government D.E.I.</a> efforts, and last week the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1388501/dl?inline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Justice said</a> it would direct its civil rights division to investigate and penalize private-sector D.E.I. activities.</p><p>Late last month, 11 Republican state attorneys general <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Updated%20Paxton%20Financial%20Institutions%20Letter.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> to BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citi and Morgan Stanley with a slew of accusations, including that they illegally use racial preferences when hiring, promoting and selecting suppliers.</p><p>“Political objectives have,” the attorneys general wrote, “influenced your decision-making at the expense of your statutory and contractual obligations.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Inside those companies, the threats have triggered alarms.</p><p>Take Goldman, which during the six-year tenure of its chief executive, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/11/business/goldman-sachs-david-solomon.html" title="">David M.

That’s less because Mr. Solomon had changed his mind on the merits — he didn’t, two people who spoke to him about it said — but because leaving it in place could make the bank a target for Mr. Trump and activists, the people said.</p><p>Beginning in January, the bank first bent its rules, allowing two of its clients to file public offerings without meeting the board requirements, as Mr. Solomon asked the bank’s lawyers to weigh in on whether the company risked a lawsuit for employing gender and racial preferences, one of the people said. Still, some inside Goldman continued to encourage the chief executive to stay the course or to stop enforcing the policy without making a formal change, noting the peril of appearing to genuflect to changing politics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>On Tuesday, Goldman officially ended the program, with a bank spokesman, Tony Fratto, citing “legal developments.”</p><p>“We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach,” Mr. Fratto said in a statement.</p><h2 id="link-4f9ca47b">New Rules</h2><p>The financial world is different from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/business/dei-programs-initiatives-costco-microsoft.html" title="">retailers such as Costco</a>, whose customers can quickly choose to shop elsewhere.

Deutsche Bank’s chief executive, Christian Sewing, said on Jan. 30 that he was “firmly behind” the bank’s D.E.I. program, and his counterpart at the Swiss bank UBS has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-02-04/in-full-ubs-ceo-ermotti-on-buybacks-capital-tariffs-video" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hit similar notes</a>.</p><p>Several major banks, including JPMorgan, the country’s largest lender, continue to operate gigantic investment funds that they say are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/business/jp-morgan-racial-equity-pledge.html" title="">trained on closing the racial wealth gap</a>. Asked by CNBC after Mr. Trump’s inauguration about pressure from conservative activists, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan, responded, “Bring them on.” But he quickly added, “It does not mean you’re not going to change policies going forward.”</p><p>At BNP Paribas, based in Paris, the shift is more immediate. For at least a decade, BNP has taken up the cause of gender parity in banking, a historically male-dominated industry. BNP mandated internally that meetings of four people needed to include at least one woman, and it went to lengths to mark International Women’s Day in March, even <a href="https://group.bnpparibas/en/press-release/bnp-paribas-announces-jean-laurent-bonnafe-s-commitment-heforshe-thematic-champion-initiative-gender-equality" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promoting</a> that its chief executive was named a “HeForShe” champion by the United Nations for his gender-parity efforts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Over the past week, however, the bank has ordered a halt to plans to expand festivities focused on women next month at a tennis tournament it sponsors, including revoking invitations to speakers. The bank told some staff that it was loath to attract more attention to its efforts, according to a person briefed on the planning who was not authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>Michelle Sprod, a BNP spokeswoman, confirmed the decision not to expand the program or others in other sports. She cited planning and resource limitations. “We’ll do that next year,” she said.</p><p>Maureen Farrell<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Executive Power:</strong> President Trump’s early moves to slash the federal government and expand American territory represent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-ideology-power.html">significant ideological swings from his first term</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Courts:</strong> With a compliant Congress and mostly quiet streets, Trump’s opponents are turning to the judicial branch to stop some of his executive orders. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/trump-federal-courts-lawsuits.html">But can the courts keep up?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:</strong> Less than 36 hours after Trump appointed Russell Vought as the consumer bureau’s acting director, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/business/vought-cfpb-musk-trump.html">he shut its operations</a>, throwing the agency into chaos.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Work Force:</strong> One thing lost in the Trump administration’s war on the federal bureaucracy is the collective voice of the employees. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/federal-workers-trump.html">But some have begun to speak out</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> The collapse of the aid agency at the hands of Trump and Elon Musk is already leaving gaping holes in vital health care and other services that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/world/africa/usaid-africa-trump-musk.html">millions of Africans rely on for their survival</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
