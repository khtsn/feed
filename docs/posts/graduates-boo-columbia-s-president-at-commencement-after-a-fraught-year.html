But they had also lived through campus lockdowns, the arrests of hundreds of students at pro-Palestinian protests and a revolving door of university presidents.</p><p>So it was with a mixture of gratitude and relief that the graduates gathered for a massive ceremony in the rain. Last year’s commencement was canceled in the aftermath of pro-Palestinian encampments and police crackdowns.</p><p>Ms. Shipman kept talking over the boos, praising the families, teachers and graduates. “Graduates, it is time to give the world your gifts,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Amid a clampdown by the Trump administration on international students involved in pro-Palestinian activism, Ms. Shipman spoke in favor of the rights of those students, saying, “We firmly believe that our international students have the same rights to free speech as everyone else.” She said they should not be punished for exercising those rights.</p><p>The president noted that many graduates were “mourning” that Mahmoud Khalil, a new graduate who continues to be detained in Louisiana by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, was not there.</p><p>Through the jeers, many other graduates remained quiet as the rain soaked them and chants of “Free Palestine” rang out through the student crowd. Ms. Shipman managed to finish her remarks, which focused on the importance of democracy, and went on to officiate the ceremony, conferring degrees on the sea of graduates clad in light-blue gowns seated in front of her.</p><p>The celebrations at smaller graduation ceremonies on Tuesday were also punctuated by anger directed at Columbia administrators. At the graduation for Columbia College, the university’s main undergraduate school, some students repeatedly interrupted Ms. Shipman’s remarks with loud jeers. At one point, they chanted “Free Mahmoud.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>About 12,000 students graduated as rain fell.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Arredondo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Khalil’s name was announced on Tuesday as a graduate during the ceremony for the School of International and Public Affairs. While students cheered his accomplishment, several graduates wearing kaffiyehs refused to shake the hand of their dean, Keren Yarhi-Milo, an Israeli who served in the Israel Defense Forces.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Jewish students who said they had been deeply hurt by antisemitism on campus during 19 months of protests against Israel also had profoundly mixed feelings about the day. Some Jewish students reported to Columbia’s antisemitism task force that they had been ostracized by their peers for supporting Israel, or had been expected to denounce the country before being accepted in student groups.</p><p>“To be honest, I’m so happy to finally be leaving Columbia,” said Eliana Goldin, who headed Aryeh, a pro-Israel student organization. “They’ve given me so much and I’m incredibly appreciative of the education I’ve received, but I’ve also reached my limit for how much antisemitism I can experience and how much backlash for standing up for Israel I can take.”</p><p>As graduates and their relatives filed out of the subway, they were met with the sound of drumbeats and protester chants. Demonstrators outside the university’s main gate chanted, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” “Columbia will fall” and “One solution, revolution.” The protesters held signs that listed the death toll related to Israel’s war in Gaza.</p><p>By 11:30 a.m., about 100 to 125 demonstrators had gathered. A group of former students burned their diplomas. Small skirmishes with the police broke out. The ceremony inside the gates went on interrupted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former students burned their diplomas during a protest outside the commencement ceremony.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alex Kent for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Maryam Alwan, a graduating student who had been a leader of pro-Palestinian activism, explained the anger that she and her peers had expressed through booing.</p><p>“Over the past two years, I’ve been arrested, suspended, forcefully removed by Columbia Public Safety, put through a disciplinary trial for an anonymous political op-ed and left with no protection from death threats and harassment,” she said.</p><p>“But I am lucky to walk across the stage when every university in Gaza has been reduced to rubble” and Mr. Khalil cannot, Ms. Alwan said.</p><p>About 12,000 graduates and 25,000 guests attended Wednesday’s commencement at Columbia’s Morningside Heights campus, on the same lawns where demonstrators erected tents last year. Graduates of Columbia’s 17 different schools held up symbols — including red inflatable hammers for engineering and inflatable owls for general studies — to represent their institutions as their degrees were conferred.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Trump administration has pulled more than $400 million in federal grant funding from Columbia because of what the White House has called the university’s failure to crack down on antisemitism. The school has agreed to demands to tighten its student disciplinary procedures and increase oversight of its Middle Eastern studies programs, but the money has not yet been returned.</p><p>The president of Barnard, Laura Rosenbury, was also booed by some of the graduates as she got up to speak. Barnard, a Columbia affiliate school, had also suspended and expelled several students involved in pro-Palestinian activism.</p><p>Wesley Parnell<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon Otterman is a Times reporter covering higher education, public health and other issues facing New York City.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
