Many were out of luck: Some major grocery stores were closed Monday afternoon. Smaller groceries struggled to refill shelves that were quickly emptying. At some counters, clerks were tallying bills by hand using paper and pen, since electronic scanners and cash registers were no longer working.</p><p>“It’s like when I was younger, 50 years ago,” said Francisco Garcia, 61, a boat restorer living in the old part of Lisbon.</p><p>For the first 30 minutes, Mr. Garcia was able to get access to news updates on his phone.
