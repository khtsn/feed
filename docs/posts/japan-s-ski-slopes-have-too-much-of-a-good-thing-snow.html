But the effects of snowstorms last month — which led to school closures and the cancellation of trains and flights — are still being felt.</p><p>At Kagura Ski Resort, a few hundred miles by road northeast of Washigatake, visitor numbers are down this year even though the snow has been good and plentiful, a spokesman, Kazuto Harasawa, said.</p><p>Unusually heavy snow forced the resort to close six times last month. The closure of a nearby highway, combined with the resort’s mile-high elevation, did not help. “We are experiencing record-breaking snow and our staff is exhausted, so please understand,” the resort <a href="https://www.facebook.com/snowkagura/posts/pfbid0LBVyqu7H6yYCJxPJH7eMQukzdoZzi7MbxdXRJMoyVnXmqBqXSh1e2QU5EzPAYXjil?__cft__[0]=AZX93y9eVZwo4sUXe3RrYwnCB1lkw01YDLoPRGHieLlxqAm4OJmfbnceJTAL_Xa4tzMiL2CNGsdcOEcoHeDJiYQHY8AFLr6-pnEO1d4z-GGBiOILNnvE5YZgzG3FDdvk_X_6PkATWPDcvdkVix452hbcBecH9jrZSoxurjWCmhb_uTFHThSiQwFJ2OSFcQCgTWo&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> in late February.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/05/multimedia/00xp-snow/00xp-snow-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/05/multimedia/00xp-snow/00xp-snow-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/05/multimedia/00xp-snow/00xp-snow-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Two vending machines surrounded by snow glow at night." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/05/multimedia/00xp-snow/00xp-snow-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/05/multimedia/00xp-snow/00xp-snow-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/05/multimedia/00xp-snow/00xp-snow-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/05/multimedia/00xp-snow/00xp-snow-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f632474e-bda9-554f-bb5d-07fea938420f" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The ski resort town of Hakuba, in Nagano prefecture.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bears Den Hakuba</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The snow also forced Gala Yuzawa Snow Resort, about 12 miles by road from Kagura, to close for a day in late February — its first closure in more than 30 years of operation.

They headed to a resort in the Hakuba Valley that had <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/venues-overview-ioc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hosted events</a> for the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics. </p><p>They took a lift to the resort’s highest point and hiked uphill for an hour, searching for pristine backcountry terrain. “Even though I’m chasing snow all over the world, I think I’ve never seen so much snow anywhere,” he said in a phone interview.</p><p>Though the sun was shining and the powder was exceptional, Mr. Kreibich and Mr. Koschier began to see cracks in the snowpack as they glided over a windswept, nearly treeless ridgeline. Mr. Kreibich said he also noticed that the snow under his feet felt “a little weird.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-13"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/world/asia/_3x2_H/_3x2_H-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/world/asia/_3x2_H/_3x2_H-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/03/07/135376_1_00vid-xp-snow-70710_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Mr. Kreibich said he noticed that the snow felt “a little weird” before he saw Gabriel Koschier slide in an avalanche.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Tao Kreibich</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Then Mr. Koschier slid nearly 1,000 feet in an avalanche.
