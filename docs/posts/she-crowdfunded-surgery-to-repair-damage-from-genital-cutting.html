Taking a razor blade to a rose and slicing into its soft petals, she recounted to millions of viewers her experience with genital cutting at age 6. She was held down by her aunt in Somalia, where almost all women and girls are cut.</p><p>Now 32, Shamsa Sharawe is a sweary and self-possessed British anti-cutting campaigner — perfect for the TikTok generation.</p><p>“Trigger warning, guys,” is how she begins her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shamsa.araweeloo/video/7217555385710873862" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filmed account</a> of how she was cut, fingering the needle and thread that she will use to stitch up the disfigured rose petals.

If she did, what would happen to her 9-year-old daughter?</p><p>Lying on the bed in her hotel room, she recorded a video for her daughter, Sarah. She told Sarah how much she loved her and explained why she was having the surgery.</p><p>“I will finally have a clitoris. I will finally know what my vulva was meant to look like. And I can finally live in a body that I don’t view as being my enemy,” she said.</p><p>It might seem a bit much for a 9-year-old to take in.

Uncut girls are often seen as unclean and unreligious among the citizens and diasporas of the African and Asian countries that practice cutting. And ​<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/world/africa/gambia-female-genital-cutting.html" title="">despite it being illegal</a> in many countries, every year, millions of girls are cut anyway, tens of thousands of them dying as a result. Many more experience pain, emotional trauma, lack of sexual pleasure and danger giving birth.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Those who do tell their stories find few willing listeners.</p><p>But Ms. Sharawe — with her vivacious delivery — has managed to keep people’s attention.</p><p>It may be graphic, she said in an interview last summer in her little terraced house in northern England, but, she added: “This happened to me. You can take a little graphic.”</p><p>Sarah follows her mother on TikTok, so she knows all about female genitalia and cutting. But even for Sarah, sometimes it gets a bit much.</p><p>“Sarah, can you throw me the silicone vagina?” Ms. Sharawe yelled up the stairs at her daughter during our interview. Ms. Sharawe has taken an item usually marketed to men and repurposed it as an educational tool, a prop to show how girls are cut.</p><p>“I’m not touching that!” Sarah shouted back.</p><p>“No one’s used it.”</p><p>“I don’t care!”</p><p>Eventually, Sarah yielded, throwing the silicone vagina down the stairs.

Eventually, Ms. Sharawe found the surgery had gotten rid of her constant pain.</p><p>But it had also saddled her with medical debts, since she hadn’t raised enough to cover the full cost of her care.</p><p>The N.H.S. provides almost every kind of medical treatment to everyone — with no deductibles and no co-payments. It offers gender-affirming surgery for transgender people, Ms. Sharawe pointed out, and, in some circumstances, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-procedures/cosmetic-surgery/labiaplasty/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surgery to reduce</a> the size of the labia minora. Survivors of cutting number at least in the tens of thousands in Britain, <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/female-genital-mutilation/january---march-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the N.H.S.</a> And yet, it offers only deinfibulation — surgery to open the vagina when it has been sealed — the most extreme type of cutting, common in Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti.</p><p>N.H.S. officials did not respond to interview requests. Ten years ago, an N.H.S. statement said there was insufficient evidence to show reconstruction surgery was effective.</p><p>Ms. Sharawe has become increasingly angry at this state of affairs. The surgery, which many survivors of cutting say is life changing, is <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.17886" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">available</a> in several European countries, a few African ones and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/health/genital-cutting-surgery.html" title="">parts of the United States</a>. The N.H.S. should fund it, she said — and last year she started a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/700001?fbclid=PAY2xjawHuSw9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABpmz5n4OUAOkqWI8IEKtH5zoWo8PiscZKxNljHRZf4GkicYO1D4rfDxGwYw_aem_XwI4GabWI4SQlXnRX99Tug" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">petition</a> to this effect.</p><p>“We’re telling you what we need,” Ms. Sharawe said, addressing the N.H.S. and adding an expletive. “And you’re not listening.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Survivors of cutting are used to not being listened to, she said. The vast majority of them are Black women.</p><p>But things are changing, Ms. Sharawe said — and she is at the vanguard.</p><p>Previous generations of survivors of cutting in the West, she said, were often immigrant women steeped in the culture of their birth countries, trying to navigate new lands in foreign languages while raising families. “Those people had very few expectations,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Sharawe represents a new kind of survivor: thoroughly British; candid about how she was cut and the resulting, permanent, pain; aware of her rights and what ought to be her rights; and unafraid to criticize revered national institutions.</p><p>“We are not mere foreigners who, you know, our needs can’t be understood,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-37"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Taking the train to London to speak at a fund-raising event hosted by Scrub the Stigma, a women’s health organization.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Sharawe speaking about cutting at the Scrub the Stigma event.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-40"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Speaking virtually in her daughter’s room to medical students for a webinar in collaboration with Dr. O’Dey, who pioneered techniques to reconstruct female genitalia.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Some of those watching Ms. Sharawe on social media were fellow survivors of cutting.
