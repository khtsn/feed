What’s behind their dramatic shift? We asked them. In more than two dozen interviews across the continent, Europeans who voted for far-right parties talked about casting their ballots in fury, in frustration, in protest, but perhaps most of all in a bid to bring change to a system they believe has failed to fulfill the contract between their democratically elected governments and the people.</p><p>They talked openly about nationalism, immigration, stagnant economies, the cost of living, housing shortages, anger at the elite and their countries’ perceived buckling to what many consider politically correct views.</p><p>Their voices offer a window into the choices Europeans may make in the year ahead. The main event will be a Feb. 23 snap federal election following the collapse of the governing coalition in Germany, where the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has made tremendous gains. Voters in Italy, Poland, Norway, Ireland, Romania and the Czech Republic — all countries where populist movements are either well established or on the rise — are also expected to choose leaders on the local or national levels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Europe is changing.

Fierce debates over immigration have raged on for a decade and Germany’s military aid to Ukraine has grown increasingly controversial.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Alternative for Germany, known by its German acronym AfD, has promised relief from economic woes and a harder line against immigration and support to Ukraine. The party benefited from German voters’ anger in state elections in September when it captured a record number of votes in the eastern states of Thuringia, Brandenburg and Saxony.</p><p>It is on track to make further gains in the Feb. 23 national election: The AfD is now <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polling</a> ahead of all other parties except the Christian Democratic Union. Though it started on a primarily Euroskeptic agenda, the party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/26/world/europe/afd-election-east-germany-hoecke.html" title="">radicalized</a> over time. Today, its extreme positions, including the use of occasional <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/world/europe/germany-far-right-afd-comeback.html" title="">Nazi-era language</a> by its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/26/world/europe/afd-election-east-germany-hoecke.html" title="">officials</a>, have drawn the concern of German authorities: Germany’s domestic intelligence service has classified the party a “suspected” right-wing extremist organization, giving it authorization to place it under surveillance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aliona Kardash for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Helga Dörflinger</strong> </p><p>I don’t think most people vote for right-wing parties because we’re simply right-wing. In Germany, for example, it’s always so dangerous with our history of Hitler. Many people following this “right” track are really doing so as a protest: A lot of people simply haven’t been heard for a long time.</p><p>Our taxes are high, new people are coming who are not even checked. Are they good? Are they bad? What happened in their countries before? Our money is being given away elsewhere in the world, instead of us simply looking at our own infrastructure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Everyone has the right to a free life, and not to be afraid of what the government is doing in Germany. Many people, older people, have no money to buy food and drink. If you’re given an eviction notice on an apartment now, you think, “Can I get a new apartment that I can afford?”</p><p><strong>Tarah Wild</strong></p><p>I don’t like the fact that we are supposed to send our tax money for this war in Ukraine. We’re not asked whether we want this war at all.</p><p>The migration policy doesn’t work here either. They bring everyone in, supposedly because they want to help the people who are doing badly. But somehow everyone comes in and takes advantage of Germany. A lot of people just don’t want to assimilate here.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Iona Dutz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Iona Dutz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>Michael Meiner</strong></p><p>My biggest concern is actually that democracy is no longer defined in such a way that it is said to be a common good. The definition of democracy — what democracy is — is usually done by the government saying what is and isn’t possible. And anything that doesn’t fit in is then treated with contempt and people are insulted and labeled anti-democrats and right-wing radicals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Price increases in general are exorbitant … That’s the kind of concern about the future that people have.

It means doing something for your country.’</p><p>When President Emmanuel Macron of France announced snap elections in June, he created a rare and unforced political opening for his chief rival, Marine Le Pen. Homing in on voters’ unhappiness over immigration, which includes many people from the Muslim world, crime, and the rising cost of living, her far-right National Rally party notched a historic win in the first round of polls weeks later. A new coalition helped deny Ms. Le Pen a victory in the second round, keeping the party power out of power — for now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The French voters who cast ballots for the National Rally have not gone anywhere, and many will still be there to vote for the party when the next presidential elections come around in 2027. While the party’s founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was openly racist and antisemitic, his daughter Marine Le Pen has tried to rebrand and mainstream the party since taking over in 2011. She still runs it on a strong nationalist, anti-immigration and tough-on-crime platform that has gathered rapid support in recent years.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">William Keo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p><strong>Jean Denis Dendievel</strong></p><p>Nationalism is simple.

We still want to live this way. Republican laws aren’t going to make us change our traditions, our way of life.”</p><p>No, I’m sorry.

Tell them: “You’re coming to France, but sing the Marseillaise, learn to speak French.” Maybe it’s an old way of thinking … but it’s true that I don’t like to see what France has become.</p><p>A veiled woman is unbearable … What will that mean for our children’s future? No, I love a woman’s freedom too much, her independence too much. I raised my daughter to be independent, to work.</p><p>Yes, maybe the world is changing. You have to accept it.

In national elections in September, it garnered the largest portion of votes — 29 percent — but was sidelined when the mainstream parties initially refused to join it in forming a government. When talks between those parties failed this month, the Freedom Party was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/world/europe/austria-far-right-freedom-party.html" title="">given a chance</a> to lead a government for the first time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>The Freedom Party maintains a strident anti-immigrant position and has called for asylum seekers to be barred from receiving almost all social services and denied a pathway to Austrian citizenship.

Some of his most notorious proposals include banning the Quran and mosques, but what helped lead his populist party to victory was misrepresenting the cause of the country’s housing shortage — falsely blaming it on immigrants.</p><p><strong>Jeroen Van Liempt</strong></p><p>Our own people must come first. I see that as an entrepreneur, but I also see that as a father of two small children.</p><p>I hope it will become possible for a new generation to participate in the housing market again. It’s not easy today to buy a starter home in the Netherlands. It’s not easy with two salaries to buy a house. Yet our City Hall has settled many migrant workers here, and there is housing for them.</p><p>I really have nothing against Islam or against certain cultures. Absolutely not — everyone is equal with me. But whether the family comes from Syria or from Ukraine, at some point the Netherlands will be full, and then we can’t continue.
