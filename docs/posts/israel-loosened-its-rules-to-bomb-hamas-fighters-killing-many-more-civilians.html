Officers could now pursue not only the senior Hamas commanders, arms depots and rocket launchers that were the focus of earlier campaigns, but also the lowest-ranking fighters.</p><p>In each strike, the order said, officers had the authority to risk killing up to 20 civilians.</p><p>The order, which has not previously been reported, had no precedent in Israeli military history. Mid-ranking officers had never been given so much leeway to attack so many targets, many of which had lower military significance, at such a high potential civilian cost.</p><p>It meant, for example, that the military could target rank-and-file militants as they were at home surrounded by relatives and neighbors, instead of only when they were alone outside.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In previous conflicts with Hamas, many Israeli strikes were approved only after officers concluded that no civilians would be hurt. Sometimes, officers could risk killing up to five civilians and only rarely did the limit rise to 10 or above, though the actual death toll was sometimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-airstrike-tunnel.html" title="">much higher</a>.</p><p>On Oct. 7, the military leadership changed its rules of engagement because it believed that Israel faced an existential threat, according to a senior military officer who answered questions about the order on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>Hours earlier, Hamas-led terrorists had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-attack.html" title="">stormed into southern Israel</a>, seizing towns and army bases, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/22/world/europe/beeri-massacre.html" title="">committing</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/world/middleeast/israel-music-festival-massacre.html" title="">atrocities</a>, firing thousands of rockets at civilian areas, killing up to 1,200 people and taking roughly 250 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/middleeast/hamas-hostage-sexual-assault.html" title="">hostages</a>.

That led Israel to fire nearly 30,000 munitions into Gaza in the war’s first seven weeks, more than in the next eight months combined. In addition, the military leadership removed a limit on the cumulative number of civilians that its strikes could endanger each day.</p></li><li><p>On a few occasions, senior commanders approved strikes on Hamas leaders that they knew would each endanger more than 100 noncombatants — crossing an extraordinary threshold for a contemporary Western military.</p></li><li><p>The military struck at a pace that made it harder to confirm it was hitting legitimate targets. It burned through much of a prewar database of vetted targets within days and adopted an unproven system for finding new targets that used artificial intelligence at a vast scale.</p></li><li><p>The military often relied on a crude statistical model to assess the risk of civilian harm, and sometimes launched strikes on targets several hours after last locating them, increasing the risk of error. The model mainly depended on estimates of cellphone usage in a wider neighborhood, rather than extensive surveillance of a specific building, as was common in previous Israeli campaigns.</p></li><li><p>From the first day of the war, Israel significantly reduced its use of so-called roof knocks, or warning shots that give civilians time to flee an imminent attack. And when it could have feasibly used smaller or more precise munitions to achieve the same military goal, it sometimes caused greater damage by dropping “dumb bombs,” as well as 2,000-pound bombs.</p></li></ul><p>The air campaign was at its most intense during the first two months of the war, when more than 15,000 Palestinians were killed — or roughly a third of the overall toll, according to the Gazan health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>From November 2023 onward, amid a global outcry, Israel began to conserve ammunition and tighten some of its rules of engagement, including by halving the number of civilians who could be endangered when striking low-ranked militants who posed no imminent threat. But the rules remain far more permissive than before the war. Since those early weeks, more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed, and while Israel disputes the ministry’s figures, the total continues to climb.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israel vastly increased the number of military targets in Gaza, and increased the number of civilians who could be endangered in strikes. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yousef Masoud for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Provided a summary of The Times’s findings, the Israeli military acknowledged that its rules of engagement had changed after Oct. 7 but said in a 700-word statement that its forces have “consistently been employing means and methods that adhere to the rules of law.”</p><p>The changes were made in the context of a conflict that is “unprecedented and hardly comparable to other theaters of hostilities worldwide,” the statement added, citing the scale of Hamas’s attack; efforts by militants to hide among civilians in Gaza; and Hamas’s extensive tunnel network.</p><p>“Such key factors,” the statement said, “bear implications on the application of the rules, such as the choice of military objectives and the operational constraints that dictate the conduct of hostilities, including the ability to take feasible precautions in strikes.”</p><p>The relatives of Shaldan al-Najjar, a senior commander in a militia allied with Hamas that joined the Oct. 7 attacks, were among the first casualties of Israel’s loosened standards.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>When the military struck his home in a war nine years earlier, it took several precautions to avoid civilian harm — and no one was killed, including Mr. al-Najjar.</p><p>When it targeted him in this war, it killed not just him but also 20 members of his extended family, including a 2-month-old baby, according to his brother Suleiman, who lived in the home that was hit and witnessed the immediate aftermath. Some relatives were blown from the building. His niece’s severed hand was found in the rubble.</p><p>“Blood was splattered all over the neighbor’s wall — as though some sheep had just been slaughtered,” the brother recalled.</p><p>Israel, which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-icj-genocide.html" title="">accused of genocide</a> in a case before the International Court of Justice, says it complies with international law by taking all feasible precautions to minimize civilian casualties, often by ordering evacuations of whole cities before strikes, and by dropping leaflets over neighborhoods and posting online maps about imminent operations.</p><p>Israel says that Hamas’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/world/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israel-fighting.html" title="">military strategy</a> makes bloodshed more likely. The group embeds itself in the civilian population, firing rockets from residential areas, hiding fighters and weapons inside homes and medical facilities, and operating from underground military installations and tunnels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photograph taken during an escorted tour of a tunnel the Israeli military said was built by Hamas underneath a school.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Unlike Hamas, which fires rockets indiscriminately at civilian areas, Israel and all Western armies operate under a multilayered oversight system that assesses the legality of planned strikes. Each attack plan is usually meant to be analyzed by a group of officers, which often includes a military lawyer who can advise on whether strikes might be unnecessary or unlawful.</p><p>To comply with international law, officers overseeing airstrikes must conclude that the risk of civilian casualties is proportional to the target’s military value, and take all feasible precautions to protect civilian life. But officers exercise significant discretion because the laws of armed conflict are vague about what counts as a feasible precaution or an excessive civilian toll.</p><p>After the shock of the Oct. 7 attack, a dozen officers recalled, some Israeli officers involved in the counteroffensive became less stringent about adhering to military protocol. While some commanders tried hard to maintain standards, five senior officers used the same phrase to describe the prevalent mood inside the military: “harbu darbu.”</p><p>It is an expression derived from Arabic and widely used in Hebrew to mean attacking an enemy without restraint.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-5ec71af1">Why Civilians Were at Higher Risk</h2><p>The Israeli military first targeted Shaldan al-Najjar during the war in August 2014.

Then the military dropped a small projectile on the house, what it calls a “roof knock,” standard practice then before strikes on targets believed to hold ammunition or tunnel entrances.

By listening to calls made by phones associated with the militants, intelligence officers tried to work out where they were, officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>But the databases sometimes included outdated data, according to six officers, increasing the likelihood that officers would misidentify a civilian as a combatant. There were also too many calls for the officers to manually track.</p><p>To speed up the process, officers used artificial intelligence.</p><p>In recent years, the Israeli military had developed computing systems, one of which was known as “The Gospel,” that could automatically cross-reference information from several different sources, including phone conversations, satellite imagery and mobile phone signals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-42"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israel controls Gaza’s telecoms networks, allowing it to tap and track Palestinian phones.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmud Hams/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>In the chaotic opening weeks of the war, different intelligence units harnessed these automated computing systems in varied ways to triangulate data and locate militants.</p><p>One common method involved automatically cross-referencing the location of a phone with its owner’s home address.

But the amount of verification varied from unit to unit, according to at least eight officers.</p><p>Some officers said they would only confirm someone as a militant if they overheard the person speaking about their involvement in Hamas’s military wing.</p><p>In other units, three officers said, an individual was considered a confirmed militant if he was simply listed in Lavender. Details of that process were <a href="https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously reported</a> by +972, an Israeli-Palestinian news website; the Israeli military has <a href="https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-press-releases-israel-at-war/june-24-pr/the-idf-s-use-of-data-technologies-in-intelligence-processing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied</a> that was military policy and said that any analyst who relied solely on Lavender would have been overruled by superiors.</p><p>Once officers were satisfied that they had confirmed a legal target, they would begin planning an attack, such as a missile strike if the target seemed to be staying the night at home, the soldiers said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-23"><p>The first step was to gauge the civilian risk.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-48"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Removing a body out of the rubble of a house in Khan Younis in December 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yousef Masoud for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-24"><div><p>In the most rigorous version of that assessment, officers sometimes hacked a target’s phone handset to listen to the conversations taking place nearby, in order to build a better picture of whom he was with, according to three officers familiar with the process. In some cases, the hacking allowed officers to pinpoint the target’s location as well as which way he was facing, how many floors he had climbed and how many steps he had recently taken.</p><p>As an additional precaution, officers sometimes attempted to trace the phones of the buildings’ other known prewar residents — a laborious process that could take more than an hour.</p><p>But the military was pursuing so many targets that officers often lacked the time or resources for such sophisticated surveillance, particularly when tracking low-ranking militants early in the war, according to seven officials and soldiers.</p><p>Officers could still intercept calls and determine a phone’s rough location by checking which cellphone towers received its signals. That information was less precise — and it was more difficult to ascertain who was nearby.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-25"><div><h2 id="link-6cd0de71">Overlooked Civilians</h2><p>In the absence of more accurate data, Israeli intelligence officers routinely used a simplistic model to estimate the number of civilians who might be killed in an airstrike, according to 17 soldiers and officials.</p><p>The military divided Gaza into 620 sectors, most the size of a few city blocks, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/world/middleeast/gaza-invasion-israel-cellphone-data.html" title="">estimated</a> the number of working phones in each using the signals received by cellphone towers. After comparing phone and Wi-Fi usage with prewar levels, the military then estimated the proportion of residents who remained in each sector.</p><p>To gauge the number of civilians inside a particular building, officers typically assumed that the building’s prewar residents had fled at the same rate as the surrounding neighborhood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-52"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been injured since the war began, according to Gazan health officials.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-26"><p>Even at its best, the model provided information that might be out of date by the time of an airstrike.

The strike killed two women — but the target survived because he was no longer there, according to the official and a second person familiar with the incident.</p><p>The model also suffered from fundamental flaws.</p><p>It relied, for example, on people having enough electricity to power their phones — and a working phone network. But power and network <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/world/middleeast/gaza-electricity.html" title="">outages</a> in Gaza often made that impossible.</p><p>The location of handsets also cannot be determined with complete accuracy based on phone signals; phones that seem to be in one neighborhood may be in an adjacent one. And the model also ignored how, during times of war, people often cluster together in large groups, three officers said.</p><p>Starting in November, senior officers in the American Joint Special Operations Command repeatedly raised concerns about the model’s accuracy with their Israeli counterparts, warning that it was leading to catastrophically imprecise assessments, according to the two senior U.S. military officials familiar with the conversations.</p><p>Some within the Israeli military also sounded the alarm. Throughout November and December, Israeli Air Force analysts urged colleagues to use more extensive drone surveillance to check for the presence of civilians, according to internal military assessments. Little to no action was taken, at least for several weeks, according to those assessments. The air force was supposed to recheck estimates of civilian presence but did not always do so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-28"><div><p>Even when conducting after-action reviews, the military rarely tried to count how many civilians had been killed, making it almost impossible for officers to assess the model’s accuracy, according to 11 officers involved in target selection.</p><p>The Israeli military’s statement to The Times did not address questions about the model, but it said that in general the military’s methods “adhere to the rules of law, whether it be the choice of munitions or the use of digital technologies to support this effort.”</p><p>Israel’s strike on a residential street on the edge of Gaza City on Nov. 16, 2023, exemplified how inaccurate the model could be. The military told The Times in a statement that it was trying to destroy one of the many tunnels used by Hamas’s military wing. In the process, it hit a large house.</p><p>Before the war, 16 members of the extended Malaka family lived in the three-story building, according to two surviving brothers, Hazem and Nidal Malaka.
