		<p>Paper Rex has defeated ZETA Division 2-0 in the second Pacific Kickoff lower bracket match. They will next play against either Global Esports or DetonatioN FocusMe, while ZETA is eliminated from the event.</p>

<p>The match began on ZETA&#39;s map pick, Lotus, which PRX won 13-5. Map two, Fracture, went Paper Rex&#39;s way, with a 13-8 ending the series 2-0.</p>

<p>Paper Rex remains in Kickoff contention, looking to earn Championship points and qualify to Masters: Bangkok should they reach the final. ZETA will need to wait until Stage 1 to return to the server.</p>
