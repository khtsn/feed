Though Mr. Nouchi grew up in Paris, he was trained in Belgium and worked in Italy during his early career, and he said that his time outside France had been a major influence on his identity as a designer. But the process of designing hundreds of garments for performers with disabilities brought forth his latent pride in his country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“I was becoming more and more patriotic as I was working on this project,” Mr. Nouchi said. “The more I was doing rehearsals and fittings, the more proud I was. And you know, it’s difficult for French to be proud of being French.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Nouchi designed 700 items of clothing, with the added task of making sure they worked for people with disabilities. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vincent Fandos</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The brief was straightforward, but it was also an enormous undertaking: create approximately 700 items of clothing for performers with disabilities to wear during the festivities. Mr. Nouchi said he knew from the outset that he didn’t want to create costumes. Rather, he wanted his clothing to play a supporting role in the show. The clothing should have an urban, Parisian sensibility and, crucially, be comfortable. He didn’t want his garments to overshadow the performers or the event itself.</p><p>In order to achieve this, he had to take a different approach than he would have for a runway show. He imagined 200 performers onstage together and thought about the way they would move and the sounds the fabric would make. “The difference between a garment and a costume is functionality,” he said. He decided to create outfits made of jersey fabric that were machine washable. The pieces are not without flair, however: He incorporated embroidery, rhinestones and feathers in his designs.</p><p>Mr. Nouchi’s opening ceremony outfits ranged from casual to formal. Like his LGN designs, his choices for the Paralympics had a chic, sparse quality. There was a red tracksuit with cutouts along the shoulder blades, accented with white and black lines, an enormous glossy blue robe with pleats, a shimmering, oversized silver blazer, a tunic with quite possibly the deepest V-neck you’ve ever seen, and a denim button-up shirt with deep red splatters.</p><p>Mr. Nouchi went with a red, white and blue color scheme overall, which was a deconstruction of the French flag. “The representation of our own flag in France, it’s not something that you’re doing in the U.S.,” he said. “Showing a French flag, it can be not very positive sometimes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>He added: “I was really happy about the Olympics. We got to own our own flag. Doing those colors in this place, it was the place of the revolution. Using those colors has meaning.”</p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-7"><div><figcaption><span>Mr. Nouchi believed the clothes should have a wide mix from formal to casual, and he tried to incorporate a great deal of red, white and blue as a deconstruction of the French flag.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Photographs by Vincent Fandos</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When conceiving the looks, Mr. Nouchi said, he asked himself: “What’s the reference? Is it the right reference?”</p><p>“Nothing is innocent when you’re talking about fashion,” he continued. “You’re talking about society, specifically in this ceremony, when you really talk about inclusivity and different body types.”</p><p>Designing clothing for people with disabilities was similar to doing so for able-bodied people, Mr. Nouchi said. But he had to take different factors into consideration. “For someone in a wheelchair, you don’t want to put the attention on having big shoulders, because it’s not flattering to the silhouette,” he explained. “There were some people that didn’t want to have long sleeves because they needed their skin to be in contact with a wheelchair to perform.”</p><p>He recalled one of the dancers trying on a suit he designed for her, and bursting into tears. “You have no idea what the meaning of this is for me,” Mr. Nouchi said the dancer, who uses a wheelchair, told him. She had always wanted to wear a suit, but had not been able to find one that was made for her body.</p><p>Mr. Nouchi’s experience working on the Paralympics’ opening ceremony was liberating for him. “I was creating outfits for the beauty of gesture,” Mr. Nouchi said. “Nothing is going to be on sale after. It’s not just about me. I’m just doing the clothes. It really helped me let go creatively and to allow myself to test new things.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>8</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Parisian Finds Patriotism Dressing Paralympians<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Style Coverage</h2><h3>The latest in fashion, trends, love and more.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Most Wanted ‘Girl’ in Fashion: </strong>How did Miu Miu become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/style/miu-miu-miuccia-prada-miu-miu-girl.html">fashion’s biggest success story</a> — halfway to $1 billion in sales for 2024?</p></li><li><p><strong>Hairstyle Heat Relief: </strong>On a hot day, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/heat-summer-hair.html">getting hair off the back of your neck</a> is often the simplest way to start cooling down.
