In a crucial earlier vote, Senator Chuck Schumer and eight other Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/senate-vote-shutdown.html" title="">broke with their party and voted to advance the measure</a>. The vote inflamed an intraparty feud about how to effectively resist President Trump. </p><p>The legislation, which would keep the government running through Sept. 30, would largely keep federal funds flowing at levels set during the Biden administration, save for an increase in military spending. It also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/congress-spending-bill-shutdown-earmarks.html" title="">cuts out so-called earmarks</a> and effectively slashes Washington, D.C.’s city budget by roughly $1 billion over the next six months.</p><p>It does not contain the specific instructions to allocate money for programs that are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-republicans-congress-power.html" title="">usually included in spending bills</a>. Democrats have warned the bill could essentially create slush funds for the Trump administration at a time when it is already disregarding spending directives set by Congress.</p><p>Schumer, the leader of Senate Democrats, had argued against the bill just two days ago. He defended his reversal on the basis that a shutdown would benefit Trump, and he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/schumer-trump-government-shutdown.html" title="">said he was willing to take political hits to protect his members</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Several members of his own party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/nyregion/aoc-schumer-democrats-ny.html" title="">criticized his stance as a shameful capitulation</a>, though some conceded privately that he was simply doing his job as a leader. Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, also voted with Schumer.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>The backlash against Schumer thrust into public view a generational divide that has emerged as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/government-shutdown-spending-bill-schumer-democrats.html" title="">one of the Democratic Party’s deepest and most consequential rifts</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Trump at the Department of Justice today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-37e49440">Trump assailed opponents in Justice Department speech</h2><p>In an unusual speech delivered at Justice Department headquarters in Washington, Trump made clear that he intends to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-speech-justice-department.html" title="">bend the vast powers of federal law enforcement to his will</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>During the address, Trump veered from his prepared remarks to launch into a bitter spiel.
