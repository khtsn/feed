    <h1>The Senate Voted to Avoid a Shutdown</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Senate voted this afternoon to pass a Republican-written spending bill and avert a government shutdown. In a crucial earlier vote, Senator Chuck Schumer and eight other Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/senate-vote-shutdown.html" title="">broke with their party and voted to advance the measure</a>. The vote inflamed an intraparty feud about how to effectively resist President Trump. </p><p>The legislation, which would keep the government running through Sept. 30, would largely keep federal funds flowing at levels set during the Biden administration, save for an increase in military spending. It also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/congress-spending-bill-shutdown-earmarks.html" title="">cuts out so-called earmarks</a> and effectively slashes Washington, D.C.’s city budget by roughly $1 billion over the next six months.</p><p>It does not contain the specific instructions to allocate money for programs that are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-republicans-congress-power.html" title="">usually included in spending bills</a>. Democrats have warned the bill could essentially create slush funds for the Trump administration at a time when it is already disregarding spending directives set by Congress.</p><p>Schumer, the leader of Senate Democrats, had argued against the bill just two days ago. He defended his reversal on the basis that a shutdown would benefit Trump, and he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/schumer-trump-government-shutdown.html" title="">said he was willing to take political hits to protect his members</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Trump at the Department of Justice today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor of Germany.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ralf Hirschberger/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Merz has billed the spending push as a response to Trump’s decision to pull back American security guarantees for Europe.
