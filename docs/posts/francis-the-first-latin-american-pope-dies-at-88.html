He was 88.</p><p>The pope’s death was announced by the Vatican in <a href="https://x.com/VaticanNews/status/1914226689065865254" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement on X</a>, a day after Francis appeared in his wheelchair <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/world/europe/pope-francis-easter.html" title="">to bless the faithful</a> in St. Peter’s Square on Easter Sunday.</p><p>Throughout his 12-year papacy, Francis was a change agent, having inherited a Vatican in disarray in 2013 after the stunning resignation of his predecessor, Benedict XVI, a standard-bearer of Roman Catholic conservatism.</p><p>Francis steadily steered the church in another direction, restocking its leadership with a diverse array of bishops who shared his pastoral, welcoming approach as he sought to open up the church. Many rank-and-file Catholics approved, believing that the church had become inward-looking and distant from ordinary people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Francis reached out to migrants, the poor and the destitute, to victims of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy members, and to alienated gay Catholics. He traveled to often-forgotten and far-flung countries and sought to improve relations with an antagonistic Chinese government, Muslim clerics and leaders from across the fragmented Christian world.</p><p>After some early stumbles, he took strong steps to address a clerical sex abuse crisis that had become an existential threat to the church. He adopted new rules to hold top religious leaders, including bishops, accountable if they committed sexual abuse or covered it up, though he did not impose the level of transparency or civil reporting obligations that many advocates demanded.</p><p>In his final years, slowed by a bad knee, intestinal surgery and respiratory ailments that sapped his breath and voice, Francis used a cane and then a wheelchair, seemingly a diminished figure. But that was a misleading impression. He continued to travel widely, focusing on exploited and war-torn parts of Africa, where he excoriated modern-day colonizers and sought peace in South Sudan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/03/multimedia/00francis-01-blgz/00francis-01-blgz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/03/multimedia/00francis-01-blgz/00francis-01-blgz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/03/multimedia/00francis-01-blgz/00francis-01-blgz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Francis being pushed in a wheelchair up a ramp covered in red cloth toward the tall wooden doors of an ochre church.

He demoted conservatives in Vatican offices, restricted the use of the old Latin Mass dear to traditionalists, opened influential meetings of bishops to laypeople, including women, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and made clear that transgender people could be godparents and that their children could be baptized.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He also refused to endorse calls to deny communion to Catholic politicians supportive of abortion rights, including when he was president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said Francis had called him a “good Catholic.”</p><p>His avuncular charm and easy smile belied his reputation inside the Vatican as a steely — his opponents said ruthless — administrator as he brought greater transparency to church finances and overhauled the Vatican’s bureaucracy.</p><p>The traditional Italian power bases of the Vatican grew frustrated with his purposefully unpredictable governing style, which relied on a small group of confidants, many of them Jesuits like himself, and his own gut.</p><p>Conservative Catholics accused him of diluting church teachings and never stopped rallying against him. Simmering dissent periodically exploded into view in almost medieval fashion, with talk of schisms and heresy.</p><p>But Francis also disappointed many liberals, who hoped that he might introduce progressive policies. His openness to frank discussion gave oxygen to debates about long-taboo subjects, including priestly celibacy, communion for divorced and remarried people, and greater roles for women in the church. While he opened doors to talking about such issues, he tended to balk at making major decisions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We are often chained like Peter in the prison of habit,” he said of the church in 2022 in a speech in St. Peter’s Basilica. “Scared by change and tied to the chain of our customs.”</p><h2 id="link-53327811">A New Style</h2><p>Perhaps the most surprising aspect of his papacy was that he became pope at all.</p><p>Francis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/world/europe/cardinals-elect-new-pope.html" title="">was elected in March 2013</a> after the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/europe/with-popes-resignation-focus-shifts-to-a-successor.html" title="">resignation of Benedict</a>, the first pontiff to step down in nearly six centuries, amid turmoil and intrigue about secret lobbies and financial chicanery. The cardinal electors sought a reformer with a strong administrative hand, but few anticipated how Francis, then the 76-year-old archbishop of Buenos Aires, would blend reformist zeal and folksy charm in a push to clean house and transform the church.</p><p>“Buona sera,” good evening, Francis announced to the faithful in his first remarks as pope from the balcony overlooking St. Peter’s Square, breaking the ice with unaffected style. He joked about being from Argentina, noting that in fulfilling their duty to produce a pope, “it seems that my brother cardinals have gone almost to the ends of the Earth to get him.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica after being elected pope.

He became the first pontiff to take his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the austere friar who dedicated his life to piety and the poor and who, according to tradition, received instruction from God to rebuild his church.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Francis signaled his humble style from the outset. He paid his own bill at the Vatican hotel where he stayed during the conclave that elected him, rode about town in a modest Ford Focus, lived in a Vatican guesthouse rather than the ornate papal apartments and, in a Holy Week ritual performed at a youth prison, washed the feet of a young Muslim woman. Later, in his ailing years, he referred to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/world/americas/pope-francis-canada-elderly.html" title="">his own frailty in demanding dignity</a> for the aged.</p><p>His humility could be disarming. When asked about a priest who was said to be gay, he responded, “Who am I to judge?”</p><p>The comment made global headlines and signaled a dramatic change underway inside the Vatican.</p><p>Francis took over the church at a moment of crisis. In the industrialized world, it<strong> </strong>suffered from falling attendance, faith-draining clerical sexual abuse scandals, demands for a greater role for women and a dire shortage of priests. And in Latin America, Asia and Africa, where the faith was continuing to grow, the Catholic church faced increasing competition from Protestant evangelical and Pentecostal churches.</p><p>He soon tried to move the church away from divisive issues like abortion and homosexuality, and shifted its emphasis to global problems like climate change, poverty and migration. His <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/world/europe/pope-offers-mass-on-island-beacon-for-refugees.html" title="">first papal trip out of Rome</a> was to Lampedusa, a tiny Italian island that had become the point of arrival for thousands of African migrants crossing the Mediterranean.</p><p>His vision, expressed in major documents like the encyclical <em>“</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/18/world/europe/encyclical-laudato-si.html" title="">Laudato Si</a>,” or “Praise Be to You,” linked Catholic theology to protecting the environment and championing those on the margins, while denouncing the excesses of global capitalism in exploiting the poor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>He traveled frequently to the Arab world, where Christians faced persecution, to pursue détente with Islam, and repeatedly visited what he called the “peripheries,” the places and people often overlooked.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Francis traveled in 2021 to Iraq, where he sought to forge bonds between Muslims and the dwindling Christian community there.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In 2019, Francis got on his hands and knees before the warring leaders of South Sudan’s government and its opposition, kissing their shoes and imploring them to make peace. In 2023, in declining health, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/world/africa/pope-francis-south-sudan.html" title="">traveled to the capital city, Juba</a>, to upbraid them on their lack of progress.</p><p>“No more bloodshed, no more conflicts, no more violence and mutual recriminations about who is responsible for it,” Francis said in the gardens of South Sudan’s presidential palace. “Leave the time of war behind and let a time of peace dawn!”</p><p>He repeatedly denounced violence and, after an initial reluctance to take sides in the war in Ukraine, spoke out in support of Ukraine. But Ukrainian officials worried that what he called the Vatican’s secret “mission” to mediate an end to the war, without explicitly rejecting Russia’s occupation,<strong> </strong>could unwittingly aid their enemy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Francis could be scathing toward the prelates in the Vatican. He once compared the hierarchy to a “ponderous, bureaucratic customs house.” He accused some church officials of deluding themselves as being “indispensable” and afflicted by the “terrorism of gossip.”</p><p>His Christmas speeches to Vatican leaders became reliably blunt lectures about a church weighed down by clericalism — the notion that the “peacock priest” and “airport bishop,” who drop in when convenient, see themselves as superior to their flock and had become out of touch. Clericalism, he contended, lay at the heart of many of the church’s ills, including the child sexual abuse crisis.</p><p>Some powerful conservatives tried to use those scandals as a cudgel to destroy Francis, accusing him of covering up for Cardinal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/us/cardinal-mccarrick-abuse-priest.html" title="">Theodore E. McCarrick</a>, an American who was removed in disgrace for the sexual abuse of a minor.</p><p>That accusation against Francis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/theodore-mccarrick-vatican-report.html" title="">proved unfounded</a>, but he nevertheless had a long and painful learning curve on the sex abuse scandals. His initial calls for action yielded little, and when the crisis exploded again on his watch, he instinctively supported his fellow bishops and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/world/europe/pope-francis-sex-abuse.html" title="">publicly doubted some victims</a>, endangering his legacy as a defender of the downtrodden.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>He ultimately regained his footing on the issue by recognizing his own blindness and by talking with abuse survivors.<strong> </strong>He never held bishops to account as much as some of his supporters had hoped. But he enacted meaningful reforms, sought to make the protection of children a priority for bishops around the world and, remarkably, ordered an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/world/europe/theodore-mccarrick-vatican.html" title="">exhaustive investigation</a> that placed blame for Cardinal McCarrick’s ascent at the feet of Saint John Paul II.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Francis with Cardinal Theodore E.

He rejected same-sex marriage yet called on priests to be welcoming to people in nontraditional relationships, such as gay men and lesbians, single parents and unmarried couples who live together.</p><p>He supported civil unions for gay couples but approved a Vatican decision to bar priests from blessing them — a decision he later said he regretted, and then reversed.</p><p>He called the criminalization of homosexuality “unjust,” but also backed the Vatican’s opposition to a proposed Italian law extending protections to L.G.B.T.Q. people. And when Germany’s bishops overwhelmingly voted to bless gay couples in 2023, the Vatican cracked down with the pope’s approval.</p><p>Some of Francis’ defenders argued that his ambiguities and incrementalisms reflected a strategy to build a consensus for a larger, longer-lasting project — that of creating a more collegial church that shifted power away from Rome to local bishops and priests in the trenches.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>After Benedict’s death ended the anomalous situation of two living popes, some of Francis’ supporters expected him to exercise a freer hand. They hoped for bold changes from a meeting of the world’s bishops in 2023 and 2024, where topics such as ordaining women as deacons and priestly celibacy and marriage were on the table. But the potentially explosive meeting ended with a whimper. The bishops called for women to be given more leadership roles but left the other major questions for another day.</p><p>Indeed, Francis’ most enduring legacy may be the transformation of the clerical ranks and the reshaping of the College of Cardinals, once dominated by conservatives appointed by Benedict and John Paul II.</p><p>In a hierarchy where personnel is policy, Francis’ supporters hope the clergy he promoted — and the successor they will choose — will cross the lines he dared walk up to.</p><h2 id="link-29ebcc6e">An Immigrant Family</h2><p>Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born on Dec. 17, 1936, in the Flores neighborhood of Buenos Aires to Mario Bergoglio and Regina (Sivori) Bergoglio, both immigrants from Italy.</p><p>The family’s passage to Argentina would become part of Bergoglio lore: Booked in steerage on the ocean liner <a href="https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?153615" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Principessa Mafalda</a><em>, </em>the future pope’s paternal grandparents missed their departure because of delays in selling their coffee shop in Turin, Italy. But frustration soon turned to relief: The ship sank at sea. A few months later, they arrived safely in Buenos Aires aboard another liner, the Giulio Cesare.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Jorge, who was the eldest of five siblings, is survived by a sister, María Elena Bergoglio.</p><p>Growing up, Jorge was deeply influenced by his grandmother Rosa Bergoglio, who in Italy had joined Catholic Action, the 1920s movement that defended the church against the encroachment of Mussolini’s Fascist state. The rise of Fascism had helped push the family to leave.</p><p>In Flores, Rosa taught her grandson Italian inflected with the family’s native Piedmont dialect and a love of literature. His father, Mario, eager to assimilate, insisted on speaking Spanish.</p><p>Catholicism was a sustaining and nurturing force in the Bergoglio household. When his mother was bedridden after the difficult birth of one of his sisters, Jorge, then 12, was placed in a school run by Salesian priests. The Salesians helped imbue him with a sense of duty toward the poor, as well as a realization of his own responsibility for improving the state of the world.</p><p>“I learned, almost unconsciously, to seek the meaning of things,” he recalled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jorge Mario Bergoglio in an undated photo.

Barely six weeks short of his 17th birthday, he was rushing to meet his friends in Flores when he paused in front of the Basilica of St. Joseph.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>“I felt I had to go in — those things you feel inside and you don’t know what they are,” he recounted. In the sanctuary, he said, he “felt like someone grabbed me from inside” and took him into the confessional. “Right there I knew I had to be a priest,” he said.</p><p>He often referred to a story about divine mercy describing the moment Jesus, by “showing mercy and by choosing,” miserando atque eligendo, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">captivated Matthew the tax collector</a>. He said he felt the Lord was waiting for him too, and chose the Latin phrase for his motto.</p><p>“That’s me,” he later told the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest and friend who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/world/europe/an-interview-with-pope-francis.html" title="">published an extensive interview with the pope</a>. “How I felt.”</p><p>But Jorge hid his ambition from his family. In high school he had demonstrated a scientific aptitude, and his mother hoped he would become a doctor. He worked in a chemistry lab and earned pocket money as a doorman at tango bars.</p><p>In November 1955, just after graduating from high school, he finally told his parents of his plans for the priesthood. His mother was unhappy and accused him of misleading her. “I didn’t lie to you, Mom,” his sister, Maria Elena, recalled Jorge responding. “I’m going to study the medicine of the soul.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><h2 id="link-5ebc5519">Time in the Wilderness</h2><p>After 13 years of training, Jorge Bergoglio was ordained as a Jesuit priest in 1969. The Jesuits had arrived in South America in 1580, along with colonists from Spain and Portugal who subjugated the continent with the complicity of Rome.</p><p>The Jesuits, though, resisted some of the worst colonial abuses, creating self-ruled protectorates for Indigenous peoples. The future pope embraced this legacy: the closeness to the poor, the respect for Indigenous peoples, the suspicion of European expansion and the resistance to it, and a wariness toward secular ideologies.</p><p>Latin America and Catholicism were in turmoil when Father Bergoglio, at 36, took charge of the Argentine Jesuits. Argentina was in the throes of a “dirty war,” with a brutal military government killing and torturing thousands of opponents. And the Latin American church was sundered, as many senior prelates remained close to the ruling classes while many Jesuits embraced liberation theology, which called on the church to press for social change on behalf of the poor.</p><p>Conservative church leaders denounced that theology as Marxist.

He replaced conservatives with allies at the Vatican’s Congregation of Bishops, which selects local church leaders. In choosing bishops, he was said to pick pastors over managers, street priests over power brokers. He preferred bishops closer to the people than those near the business-friendly Catholic group Opus Dei.</p><p>In the College of Cardinals, where a two-thirds majority of those under 80 will elect his successor, he appointed more than half its voters. He made the college less white (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/us/pope-francis-cardinal-gregory.html" title="">appointing the first African American cardinal</a>), less Italian and less representative of the Roman curia.</p><p>Relying less on Europe, which he called “aged,” or America’s traditional feeder cities, like Philadelphia, he chose cardinals from nations with increasingly popular Pentecostal and evangelical movements in Latin America, Asia and Africa, the most fertile ground for Catholic growth and for priests, who are disappearing from Catholicism’s historic centers in Europe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-30"><p>“You are important,” he told young Catholics in Mozambique in 2019. “Not only are you the future of Mozambique, or of the church and of humanity.

He canonized Pope John XXIII, who called the council, on the same day that he canonized Pope John Paul II.

He called Francis part of a “conspiracy of silence” to protect a “homosexual current” within the Vatican.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-41"><div><p>Francis denied it. “About McCarrick I knew nothing,” he said in an interview. “Obviously, nothing, nothing.”</p><p>In February 2019, he summoned bishops from around the world to Rome for an unprecedented meeting on protecting minors, a sign that the Vatican would finally treat the sexual abuse problem as a global crisis, and not the failing of a particular country or culture.</p><p>He issued the church’s most comprehensive response to the crisis, and it became the seminal document on Vatican culpability.</p><p>It obligated church officials worldwide to report cases of sexual abuse — and attempts to cover it up — to their superiors. Vatican officials described the measure as an effort to enshrine accountability for bishops into church law, and to impose a uniform response to accusations of sexual abuse, which had differed widely from country to country. In some dioceses, where leaders denied the existence of abuse, there had been no procedures at all.</p><p>However the edict, which was made permanent in 2023, did not<span>  </span>require church officials to report abuse accusations to the police and prosecutors, an omission that outraged abuse victims and their advocates. Vatican officials argued that such an obligation could, in some places, result in victims being ostracized or priests being persecuted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-42"><div><h2 id="link-29058541">A New Openness</h2><p>Arguably the most dramatic change Francis brought to the church, his supporters say, was perhaps the simplest: a willingness to open questions for debate, planting the seeds for deep, long-lasting change. He talked in 2018 about an “apostolate of the ear: listening before speaking.”</p><p>He once told Father Spadaro, the Jesuit priest and friend: “Opposition opens up paths. I love opposition.”</p><p>Some of his predecessors had been less fond of it. Pope Pius X purged Catholic theologians who took a modernist approach to Bible studies. John Paul II treated theological disagreement as profane dissent, and with his doctrinal watchdog, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, later Benedict XVI, the Vatican silenced theologians with differing visions of the church. When he became pope, Benedict ordered the removal of the editor of a Jesuit journal, America, because it entertained ideas anathema to conservative orthodoxy.</p><p>Francis did not stifle views he disagreed with and believed in a patient process — he called it discernment — in which ideas and proposals could be weighed before going forward.</p><p>“Bosses cannot always do what they want,” he told Reuters in 2018. “They have to convince.”</p><p>His closest allies said the slow and steady approach worked.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-88"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pope Francis at Madison Square Garden during a five-day trip to the United States in 2015.

Reforming the Roman bureaucracy that governs the church, which is deeply resistant to change, he said, “took a lot of time and a lot of energy.”</p><p>While some of Francis’ most ardent boosters worried that his fondness for debate and discernment resulted in a pontificate that was largely talk, he made undeniable substantive changes, like broadening the definition in church law of people who could be considered victims of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/world/europe/vatican-priests-sexual-abuse.html" title="">clerical sex abuse</a>, and seemingly bureaucratic ones, like devolving power away from Rome and stacking the hierarchy in the United States with liberals. Those efforts have the potential to yield even greater change.</p><p>His October 2023 meeting of world bishops, which for the first time included women and lay people as voting members, built momentum for a larger role for women in the church and at least broached some of the most sensitive topics, including the celibacy and marital status of priests, even if it didn’t change those policies. In the following weeks, he issued papal equivalents of executive actions to allow priests to bless gay couples.</p><p>For many liberals, that impetus stalled and the progress it promised never materialized. But in many ways, Francis’ willingness to discuss once-taboo issues was itself a breakthrough. And if, at the beginning of his pontificate, supporters predicted a “Francis effect” that would fill the pews with faithful, by the end they claimed a more modest achievement, that he had opened church doors that had for decades been sealed shut.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jason Horowitz is the Rome bureau chief for The Times, covering Italy, the Vatican, Greece and other parts of Southern Europe.</p></div><div><p>Jim Yardley became the Rome bureau chief in September 2013, after spending the previous decade reporting from China, India and Bangladesh.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/pope-francis">Pope Francis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/roman-catholic-church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/pope-benedict-xvi">Pope Benedict XVI</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Santa’s Neighbors Are Annoyed: </strong>A tourist season in Rovaniemi, Finland that stretches from October to March has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/asia/santa-finland-rovaniemi.html">anything but jolly for some residents</a> of the “Official Hometown of Santa Claus.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Orange Skies in Iraq: </strong>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/middleeast/iraq-sandstorm.html">severe sandstorm swept across Iraq</a>, turning the sky a strange orange, reducing visibility and sending several thousand people to emergency rooms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Van Gogh’s Last Painting: </strong>The artist painted his final work, “Tree Roots,” in Auvers-sur-Oise, France.
