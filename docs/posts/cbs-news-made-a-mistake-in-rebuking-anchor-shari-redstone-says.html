Some accused the anchor, who is Jewish, of asking biased and hostile questions. Others called it a fair scrutinizing of Mr. Coates’s views.</p><p>The turmoil inside CBS mirrors debates that have broken out inside many news organizations since the Hamas attack against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. As far back as May, a group of CBS staff members raised concerns about Mr. Dokoupil’s coverage on a call with the network’s president at the time, Ingrid Ciprián-Matthews, according to two people familiar with the call.</p><p>Mr. Dokoupil’s interview with Mr. Coates resurfaced those concerns, and late last week, a group of CBS News employees approached management, according to two people with knowledge of the events, who requested anonymity to share internal discussions.</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Dokoupil met with members of the network’s standards team and its <a href="https://contentforchange.paramount.com/cbs-race-and-culture-unit" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">race and culture unit</a>, which advises on “context, tone and intention” of programming. The discussion focused on the anchor’s tenor and body language during his exchange with Mr. Coates.</p><p>On Monday, the CBS newsroom gathered for its traditional top-of-week conference call led by Ms. McMahon, the CBS News chief executive. The news division was basking in a pair of big moments: last week’s vice-presidential debate and that evening’s “60 Minutes” interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. McMahon did not mention those at the top of the call. Instead, she acknowledged the date — Oct. 7, the anniversary of the Hamas-led attack in Israel — and then introduced Ms. Roark, the head of editorial and news gathering, who said the network had reviewed Mr. Dokoupil’s interview and found that it had fallen short of network standards.</p><p>CBS journalists, Ms. Roark said, need to leave “our biases and opinions at the door.”</p><p>One veteran CBS correspondent, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/team/jan-crawford/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jan Crawford</a>, questioned that conclusion. “It’s my understanding that as journalists, we are obligated to challenge that worldview so that our viewers can have that access to the truth or a fuller account,” she said. “To me, that is what Tony did.”</p><p>CBS initially planned to bring in an outside consultant, specializing in diversity, equity and inclusion issues, to guide a staff meeting about the Dokoupil matter. Those plans were scrapped. Instead, a smaller meeting of the “CBS Mornings” staff was held on Tuesday, according to two people told of the plans.</p><p>At that meeting, the conversation became emotionally charged; several employees were tearful, and Mr. Dokoupil expressed regret that the interview had led to so much uproar, though he did not apologize for the content of the interview, according a person present, who was granted anonymity to describe sensitive conversations.</p><p>CBS executives eventually cut the meeting short, after becoming concerned that some participants were leaking details about the gathering and compromising the ability to have a frank discussion, the person said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>CBS News declined to comment on Wednesday on Ms. Redstone’s remarks. Hours afterward, Mr. Cheeks, the Paramount executive, said in a statement that he supported Ms. McMahon, calling her “an outstanding, accomplished leader.”</p><p>Mr. Cheeks acknowledged that there was “strong and growing discord within CBS News that needed to be addressed in an editorial meeting.” He added, “Our hosts and correspondents will continue to ask the toughest questions on the most important and complex issues.”</p><p>Mr. Coates did not respond to an inquiry on Wednesday. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJu7cOydT-Y" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a trailer for an</a> interview with the former “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah, Mr. Coates said Gayle King, who co-hosts “CBS Mornings” with Nate Burleson and Mr. Dokoupil, had approached him on the set with a marked-up copy of his book and signaled that she planned to ask him several questions on the air. Ms. King ultimately did not ask a question because Mr. Dokoupil took up the bulk of the allotted time.</p><p>“I don’t think he did Nate and Gayle a service,” Mr. Coates said of Mr. Dokoupil. “I’m really, really sorry for them. More than anything, I can take care of myself.”</p><p>John Koblin<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
