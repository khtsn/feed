After all, the last three winners of SAG’s top prize — “Oppenheimer,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and “CODA” — all won the best picture statuette at the Oscars.</p><p>But it isn’t exactly that clear cut.</p><p>Those past three films had essentially swept their awards season, and aside from the SAG Awards, “Conclave” has won only one other best picture title, at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/movies/baftas-winners-conclave-brutalist.html" title="">the BAFTAs</a> in February.</p><p>“Anora,” the comedy-drama about a stripper (played by Mikey Madison) whose modern fairy-tale romance implodes, had several of the other early big wins this season, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/movies/anora-wins-producers-and-directors-guild-awards.html" title="">two major industry prizes</a> — from the Directors Guild of America and the Producers Guild of America — that almost always signal a best-picture Oscar up ahead.</p><p>Also, Edward Berger, the director of “Conclave,” was not nominated for a best directing Oscar. Only six films in the history of the Oscars have won best picture without a best directing nomination, most recently “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/movies/coda-review.html" title="">CODA</a>” in 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><h2 id="link-34141020">Scandals Plague ‘Emilia Pérez’</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Karla Sofía Gascón in “Emilia Pèrez.” She is up for a best actress Oscar, but her chances of winning may have been derailed by recent scandals.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shanna Besson/Netflix</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Just a few weeks ago, “Emilia Pérez” was on top of the world. The Spanish-language musical out of France had earned 13 Oscar nominations, the most of any film this year (and nearly the most ever), and its lead, Karla Sofía Gascón, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/movies/karla-sofia-gascon-oscar-history-trans-actress.html" title="">made history</a> as the first openly transgender actress to be nominated for an Academy Award, in the best actress category no less.</p><p>And at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/arts/golden-globes" title="">Golden Globes</a> in January, out of its 10 nominations, it won four awards: best non-English-language motion picture; best musical or comedy motion picture; best original song; and Zoe Saldaña won for best supporting actress. “Emilia Pérez” also won two coveted honors at the Cannes Film Festival last year, including the jury prize.</p><p>But the film’s prospects have quickly eroded. In late January, the journalist Sarah Hagi resurfaced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/movies/karla-sofia-gascon-apology-netflix.html" title="">a series of derogatory comments</a> that Gascón had posted years ago on Twitter, now known as X. In them, she denigrated Muslims, called George Floyd a “drug-addicted con artist,” and even criticized the diverse winners of the 2021 Oscar telecast, writing: “I didn’t know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women%27s_Strike_2018" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">8-M</a>.”</p><p>Netflix — the distributor of “Emilia Pérez” that was hoping that the film would finally earn the streamer a best picture Oscar — swiftly tried to mitigate the damage. “I want to acknowledge the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused hurt,” Gascón, 52, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/movies/karla-sofia-gascon-apology-netflix.html" title="">said in an apology</a> provided by Netflix.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/movies/emilia-perez-oscars-scandal.html" title="">Gascón didn’t drop it</a> after that, instead opting to keep defending herself on her Instagram, saying that some of her opinions had been misconstrued and that some posts had been doctored.</p><p>Since then, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/business/media/netflix-oscars-emilia-perez.html" title="">Netflix has distanced itself</a> from Gascón, instead making Saldaña, who is up for supporting-actress Oscar, the face of the film.</p><p>While that might seem like enough drama to derail the film’s Oscar dream, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/movies/karla-sofia-gascon-emilia-perez-controversies.html" title="">backlash against the film</a> — about a transgender Mexican cartel boss who seeks gender-affirming care to transition physically into a woman — had already been brewing on several fronts.</p><p>The film was received negatively by many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/world/americas/emilia-perez-mexico-oscars.html" title="">viewers in Mexico</a>, who thought that the film’s French director, Jacques Audiard, made light of or even glamorized the country’s drug-related violence. And despite being set in Mexico, “Emilia Pérez” was filmed almost entirely on soundstages in France.</p><p>In a statement issued in November, GLAAD, one of the most powerful L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy organizations, said “Emilia Pérez” was “a profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman” and “a step backward for trans representation.”</p><p>Gascón has skipped recent awards ceremonies, including Critics Choice, Directors Guild and Producers Guild. But she is expected to attend the Oscars, though it’s unclear if she will walk the red carpet or sit with the cast and crew of the film.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><h2 id="link-2f131e8b">Is It Finally Demi Moore’s Moment?</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demi Moore in “The Substance.” She faces stiff competition in the best actress category.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mubi</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>When Demi Moore <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/movies/demi-moore-golden-globes-the-substance.html" title="">accepted her Golden Globe</a> for best actress in a musical or comedy in January — for her role <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/movies/demi-moore-substance-oscars.html" title="">as Elisabeth Sparkle</a>, a fading star who goes to gruesome lengths to stay relevant in the body horror film “The Substance” — she made a moving statement about her Hollywood trajectory.</p><p>“I had a woman say to me, just know, you will never be enough, but you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick,” she said. “And so today I celebrate this as a marker of my wholeness and of the love that is driving me.”</p><p>The win solidified the star’s comeback and the message helped the actress, who has more name recognition among American audiences than many nominees, stand out in an exceedingly competitive awards season for best actress nominees.</p><p>At the Oscars, Moore, 62, is up against Mikey Madison, 25, the star of “Anora,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/movies/baftas-winners-conclave-brutalist.html" title="">who bested Moore</a> at the BAFTAs in mid-February; Fernanda Torres, of “I’m Still Here,” who won the best actress in a drama Golden Globe; Cynthia Erivo, the “Wicked” star who made viral magic with her co-star Ariana Grande on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/arts/music/wicked-movie-popcast-ariana-grande.html" title="">their press tour</a>; and Gascón from “Emilia Pérez.”</p><p>Also working in Moore’s favor: At the Screen Actors Guild Awards last weekend, she triumphed over Madison, Erivo and Gascón (Torres was not nominated).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p><h2 id="link-731ed4a">‘No Other Land’ Still Has No U.S. Distributor</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Basel Adra, left, and Yuval Abraham, two of the filmmakers behind “No Other Land,” as seen in the documentary.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Antipode films</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Normally American studios scramble to snap up buzzy films and documentaries, particular those that have had successful festival runs, in the hopes of boosting their Oscar-nomination totals. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/movies/no-other-land-documentaries-distribution.html" title="">so far</a>, no American distributor will touch “No Other Land” even though it won the top documentary award and the audience award at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024 and dozens of awards from critics, juries and audiences across the world since.</p><p>The movie, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/movies/no-other-land-documentary-gaza-west-bank.html" title="">our critic called</a> “audacious and devastating,” is about the Israeli government’s efforts to demolish homes and expel families in the community of Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank, claiming the area is needed for a military training ground.</p><p>Its filmmaking team is made up of two Palestinians, Basel Adra and Hamdan Ballal, and two Israelis, Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor. The movie documents the period between 2019 and 2023, and includes archival footage from Adra’s family, who are from Masafer Yatta.</p><p>Producers eventually opted to self-distribute the film, landing it in about two-dozen U.S. theaters with more underway thanks to a strong box office. Still, the filmmakers hope a U.S. distributor will help their film reach more viewers, potentially via a streamer like Netflix or Max.</p><p>“It’s clear that there are political reasons at play here that are affecting it,” Abraham <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/movies/no-other-land-oscars.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> in a February video interview he did alongside Adra, from Adra’s Masafer Yatta home. “I’m hoping that at a certain point the demand for the film will become so clear and indisputable that there will be a distributor with the kind of courage to take it on and show it to the audience.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>It’s certainly plausible that an Oscars win might just be that needed nudge.</p><h2 id="link-43bef72c">Cynthia Erivo Could Clinch an EGOT</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cynthia Erivo in “Wicked.” If she wins the best actress Oscar, she will become the youngest person to have earned an EGOT.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Universal Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Cynthia Erivo is hoping to join an exclusive circle on Sunday night: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/egot-winners-history.html" title="">the EGOT club</a>, an acronym for those who have won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony.</p><p>She is nominated in the best actress category for her turn as the green-hued heroine Elphaba in “Wicked,” the first of a two-part adaptation of the Broadway musical inspired by the story of the Wizard of Oz.</p><p>If Erivo wins, she would become not only the 22nd person with an EGOT earned in competitive categories (meaning none of the awards were honorary) but also the youngest person to ever achieve this status, at the age of 38. A few previous winners secured their EGOTs at age 39, including Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who did so last year with an Emmy win for a song they wrote for the Hulu comedy “Only Murders in the Building.”</p><p>Erivo won her Tony in 2016, for best actress in a musical for her role as Celie in “The Color Purple”; her Grammy in 2017 for the cast album for that musical; and her daytime Emmy in 2017 for a performance by the cast of “The Color Purple” on the<strong> </strong>“Today” show.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p><h2 id="link-75b48431">Despite Wildfires, the Show Is on Track</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Despite fire-related setbacks to other Oscars events this year, the ceremony will proceed as planned. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>As wildfires devastated large swaths of Los Angeles in January, it seemed possible that the Oscars ceremony might need to be delayed.
