Wade and on the same week as the annual March For Life in Washington, was part of a continuing Republican effort to appeal to its conservative, anti-abortion-rights base.</p><p>The bill would require that infants born alive after an attempted abortion receive the same protection under the law and degree of care as any newborn baby, and threaten medical providers with up to five years in prison for failing to resuscitate babies born alive during abortions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Federal law already requires that a baby who survives an attempted abortion receive emergency medical care, and live births during abortion procedures are rare. But the legislation would create new penalties for medical providers involved in such procedures, which could also apply to those treating women with severe late-pregnancy complications who find themselves in agonizing situations in which their children have no chance of survival.</p><p>The House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/11/us/politics/house-passes-abortion-bill.html" title="">passed the same bill last year</a> and is expected to take it up again later this week.</p><p>Conservative groups have continued to make opposition to abortion rights a litmus test, even as outright abortion bans have alienated voters across the country in multiple election cycles. Republicans have routinely brought up what they call the “Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act” when they are in control of Congress, presenting it as something that should not be debatable.</p><p>“This shouldn’t be a controversial bill,” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said Wednesday. “We should all be able to say that a baby born alive after an attempted abortion must be protected.”</p><p>Republicans used the debate to portray Democrats as extremists on an issue that has proved politically toxic to G.O.P. candidates since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“Because there’s nothing more important to Democrats than abortion,” Mr. Thune added, “they will vote against legislation to provide appropriate medical care to babies born alive in an abortion clinic.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, at the Capitol earlier this month.

She said what the legislation would actually do was force doctors to take away a fetus with a fatal anomaly from a grieving mother.</p><p>In bringing up the bill, Republicans appeared to be using a similar political strategy to the one they have employed on immigration this month: putting forth a narrow measure they contend is a common-sense step and essentially daring Democrats to oppose it. On Wednesday, the House was set to give final approval to a bill that would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/senate-passes-border-crackdown-bill.html" title="">mandate detentions and potential deportations</a> for migrants who enter the country without authorization and are accused of certain crimes after dozens of Democrats embraced it despite their concerns that it lacked due process for the accused.</p><p>But while there is ample evidence that a bipartisan political consensus is growing to clamp down on illegal immigration, there is no such agreement on the issue of abortion rights. In fact, Democrats saw some silver lining in Republicans’ insistence on taking up a messaging bill on the issue. About <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">63 percent of voters support abortion being legal</a> in all or most cases, according to a Pew survey.</p><p>“The only good news is they’re showing their true colors only two days after the president was sworn in,” Mr. Schumer said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But Republicans like Senator John Cornyn of Texas said they were standing up against what amounted to “infanticide.”</p><p>The surgical method typically used to perform an abortion after the first trimester, known as dilation and evacuation, makes the odds of a live birth negligible. A vast majority of abortions in the United States occur in the first trimester, before the point of fetal viability, which is currently at about 23 weeks.</p><p>Policy organizations supporting abortion rights said the measure was an effort to discourage women from seeking abortions and doctors from performing them.</p><p>Democrats said it was a disgrace that Republicans were using the first week of Mr. Trump’s presidency to escalate their attacks on women’s reproductive freedom.</p><p>“It would create a new government mandate that would override the best judgment of grieving families that find out their fetus has a fatal condition,” Ms. Murray said. “Americans are rightly worried about what will happen to their reproductive rights under Republican control of government. During the first week of Trump’s pregnancy, this is what Republicans are focused on?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.
