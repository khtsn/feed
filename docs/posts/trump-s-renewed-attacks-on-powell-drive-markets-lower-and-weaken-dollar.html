Powell, the Fed chair, in a social media post, calling him “a major loser” and urging a cut in interest rates.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell more than 3 percent, as did the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index. All of the major sectors in the S&amp;P 500 were down, with the technology, energy and consumer discretionary sectors hardest hit.</p><p>U.S. government bonds, which have emerged as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/bond-market-tariffs-trump.html" title="">a major concern for Wall Street and the White House</a>, showed renewed stress, with the 10-year Treasury yield at one point jumping above 4.4 percent. (Yields move inversely to prices.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump also lashed out at Mr. Powell <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/business/economy/trump-jerome-powell-fed.html" title="">last week</a>, saying to reporters on Thursday that “if I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast — believe me.&#34;</p><p>The Fed chair had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/economy/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-inflation-interest-rates.html" title="">warned in a recent speech</a> that tariffs could create a “challenging scenario” by putting the central bank’s two main goals — stable inflation and a healthy labor market — in tension. As tariffs have been imposed, some surveys have shown consumers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/economy/inflation-fed-trump.html" title="">bracing for sharply higher prices</a>.</p><p>On Monday, the president suggested that an economic slowdown would be Mr. Powell’s fault.</p><p>Stock market investors tend to favor lower interest rates, which make it easier for companies to borrow and expand their businesses. Stock prices often rise when investors expect the Fed to cut rates — even if it is the result of bad economic news. But the recent market reaction to Mr. Trump’s calls for lower rates suggested that investors see the threat to Fed independence as outweighing any benefit from rate moves.</p><p>Renewed attacks on Mr. Powell add to the uncertainty that Mr. Trump’s tariffs have injected into financial markets, said John Mowrey, the chief investment officer at NFJ Investment Group.</p><p>“There’s a slew of things that could be very unsettling to the market as it tries to navigate what it doesn’t really know how to navigate, which is policy uncertainty about tariffs,” Mr. Mowrey said, adding that “Powell is one of them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Trump administration has acknowledged an uptick in the probability of a recession. Mr. Trump’s criticism of Mr. Powell signals an effort to “have the cards ready to blame other people should that occur,” Mr. Mowrey said.</p><p>Mr. Trump is said to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/trump-powell-fed-markets.html" title="">wary of trying to oust Mr. Powell</a> before his term as chair is up next year, which would probably inject even more volatility into already jittery markets. The political independence of the Fed is seen as critical across world financial markets, and threats to that independence has made investors anxious about the stability of assets priced in dollars, long considered safe and reliable place to park money.</p><p>The U.S. dollar <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/business/us-dollar-trump-tariffs.html" title="">continued its slide</a> against nearly every other major currency on Monday. It fell about 1 percent against the euro, to the lowest in more than three years. The dollar also fell against the Japanese yen, to its lowest level since September. </p><p>On the surface, a weaker dollar makes American goods cheaper overseas, and imports more expensive. But a substantial shift could signal that investors are moving away from a decades-long belief that the dollar and U.S. assets were a safe haven, and they are instead choosing to put their money elsewhere.</p><p>“We believe dollar weakness will continue,” said Win Thin, a managing director at Brown Brother Harriman, in a note. He added, though, that recent gains in some currencies may not last because economic growth was likely to weaken.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The renewed angst about the Fed’s independence on Monday came against a backdrop of investors’ unease about the global economy. Mr. Trump has drastically raised U.S. tariffs on imports, as high as 145 percent on Chinese goods, to flatten U.S. trade imbalances. Beyond tariffs, Washington has tightened trade on critical items such as advanced silicon chips. China has responded with high tariffs on U.S. goods and restrictions on exports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/china-rare-earths-us.html" title="">rare earth minerals and magnets</a>, essential for electric car motors and other technologies.</p><p>Economists project these changes will raise prices while impeding growth.</p><p>“‘News out of Washington’ remains the primary catalyst for markets,” said Chris Larkin, head of trading and investing at E-Trade. “Choppiness will likely continue until trade policy clarifies,” he added.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump’s announcement of tariffs against nearly every U.S. trading partner on April 2, more than 40 percent of corporate earnings calls have mentioned tariffs, with about 20 percent citing “material” risks, according to S&amp;P Global.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund has warned that its latest projections for the global economy, to be released on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/business/economy/imf-trump-tariffs-global-economy.html" title="">will forecast slower growth and higher inflation</a> this year than previously anticipated.</p><p>Oil prices, which are often considered a barometer of future economic growth, dropped about 3 percent on Monday, with Brent crude at about $66 a barrel. Oil has dropped about 20 percent from its mid-January high.</p><p>Gold, which investors often seek during times of geopolitical turmoil, has surged nearly 30 percent in price this year. Gold set yet another record high on Monday, rising above $3,400 per ounce for the first time.</p><p>Ben Casselman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
