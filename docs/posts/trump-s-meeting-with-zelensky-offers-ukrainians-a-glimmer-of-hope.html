But many cheered one statement he made on Saturday after meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, questioning why President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would continue to pummel Ukraine as the United States is trying to broker peace talks.</p><p>“It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along,” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social after meeting with Mr. Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral, adding that Mr. Putin may need to be “dealt with differently” — with more sanctions. </p><p>The day’s events were a victory of sorts for Mr. Zelensky and Ukraine at a critical juncture in the war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The United States has been pushing Ukraine to accept a peace plan that seems in part a gift to Moscow. The proposal would force Kyiv to abandon its aspirations of joining NATO, offer Ukraine only vague security guarantees, and see the United States officially recognizing Crimea as Russian. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/europe/ukraine-peace-counterproposal.html" title="">Ukraine</a> has rejected that deal, which the Trump administration had described as its final offer.</p><p>But now, Ukrainians see a small glimmer of hope that Mr. Trump will not try to force Ukraine into a lopsided peace plan. It first emerged in the fallout from a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/world/europe/ukraine-kyiv-russia-attack.html" title="">massive Russian missile attack</a> on Ukraine’s capital early Thursday that killed 12 people and injured almost 90. “Vladimir, STOP!” Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social, in a rare rebuke of Mr. Putin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And then, the hope grew slightly on Saturday when Mr. Zelensky managed to wrangle <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/world/europe/trump-pope-francis-funeral.html" title="">about 15 minutes</a> with Mr. Trump in Rome. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cnn/video/7497632041660583214" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Photos</a> released by the Ukrainian government showed the two men sitting in chairs and leaning toward each other, talking like equals — a vastly different scene than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-us-ukraine-russia.html" title="">a disastrous meeting</a> in the Oval Office in late February that ended with Mr. Zelensky’s abrupt departure from the White House and the temporary freezing of all U.S. aid.</p><p>The photos from Rome “were extraordinary,” said Volodymyr Dubovyk, the director of the Center for International Studies at Odesa I.I. Mechnikov National University. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A picture made available by Ukraine’s presidential press office shows President Trump meeting privately with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in Rome.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ukrainian Presidential Press Service</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Trump’s team has had too much exposure to the Kremlin and its talking points lately, so for Kyiv to be able to present their perspective directly to Trump was useful, I suppose. Just maybe Trump will now understand a bit better Ukraine’s concerns,” Mr. Dubovyk said.</p><p>Some Ukrainians interviewed on Sunday in Kyiv acknowledged that Mr. Trump can change his mind with breakneck speed. But they took solace in the fact that the White House called Saturday’s conversation a “very productive discussion.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Oleh Karas, 40, who was collecting donations to buy drones outside of a memorial to fallen soldiers, called the photos of the two leaders “amazing” and said it looked like “Trump was listening to him.”</p><p>As he stood in front of thousands of flags planted in the ground, each one marking a dead soldier, Mr. Karas said: “You should bring Trump here. Have him see this place. Let him go to where the missile hit. Let him see what happened.”</p><p>Since taking office, the Trump administration has at times appeared almost solicitous of Mr. Putin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/trump-russia-putin.html" title="">a sharp reversal</a> in U.S. policy. And Mr. Trump has made no secret of his dislike for the Ukrainian leader.</p><p>So Mr. Trump’s statements on Truth Social after the meeting seemed to many in Ukraine like something of a vindication of what they have been saying for years: that Mr. Putin might not be telling the truth. Russia seized Crimea in 2014.Ukraine has also been fighting Russia in the eastern Donbas region since then, and Mr. Putin has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/europe/zelensky-ukraine-russia-putin.html" title="">violated multiple peace accords</a> aimed at ending the violence there. The Russian leader also repeatedly claimed that he had no intention of mounting a broader invasion of Ukraine — right up until the moment his tanks crossed the border in 2022 to begin the full-scale invasion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>That history is why Ukraine’s government has insisted that any peace deal in this war with Russia must include a strong security guarantee — and why it wanted NATO membership, even though that dream has been put on hold.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers fired artillery toward Russian targets in eastern Ukraine last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, told journalists in a briefing broadcast on Russian state television on Sunday that it was too early to talk about terms of any peace deal, adding that the negotiations were not public. </p><p>The Ukrainians have countered the Trump administration’s peace plan with their own, which calls for a European peacekeeping force with the United States providing backup. In a social-media post after the meeting on Saturday, Mr. Zelensky did not get into specifics about his conversation with Mr. Trump, but said they talked about a “full and unconditional cease-fire,” and a “reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly said Ukraine is losing the war and doesn’t have the leverage to demand a good deal from Russia, a transactional approach to foreign policy at odds with many Western leaders. Some leverage that Ukraine had at one point appears to be lost: Russia’s top military commander said Saturday that Russian troops had completely retaken the Russian region of Kursk, more than eight months after Ukrainian troops launched a surprise incursion. On Sunday,<span>  </span>Mr. Peskov told reporters, Mr. Putin called Russian troops to thank them for what he called “the end of an operation to liberate the Kursk region.” Ukrainian officials continued to deny that they had been pushed out from Kursk. </p><p>Serhiy Hrabsky, a military analyst who is a former colonel in the Ukrainian Army, said Sunday that talk of a peace deal now was premature and that Moscow was playing “political Ping-Pong” with the Trump administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Russia will not stop,” he added.</p><p>With the Trump-Zelensky meeting being the talk of Kyiv, Yulia Svyrydenko, the Ukrainian economy minister and a close ally of Mr. Zelensky, called the encounter “a chance to move forward — to build real peace through strength.” In a social media post, she said that only stronger sanctions and more pressure on Russia could bring the war to an end.</p><p>And Sen. Lindsey Graham — the South Carolina Republican who had been a staunch ally of Ukraine but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/trump-putin-senate-gop-ukraine.html" title="">shifted his tone</a> amid Mr. Trump’s push to broker a quick peace — seemed to sense an opening. He lauded the Trump administration’s efforts to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5269329-lindsey-graham-donald-trump-russia-ukraine-peace-talks/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broker a cease-fire</a> and also touted a recent bipartisan threat to impose more sanctions on Moscow.</p><p>Still, there is no doubt that pressure is building on Ukraine to make a deal, both at home and from the Trump administration. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, who has had a tense relationship with Mr. Zelensky, told the BBC hours after the massive missile attack Thursday that it may be time to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp348ygjgy3o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">give up land</a> for peace, at least temporarily. Mr. Zelensky has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/europe/nato-ukraine-trump-peace-talks.html" title="">also said</a> that Ukraine might have to cede some territory for a peace deal — land it hopes to regain through diplomatic means — as long as it gets a security guarantee.</p><p>The United States has repeatedly threatened to abandon peace talks if it cannot make progress. On NBC News’s “Meet the Press” Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the upcoming week “very critical” in determining whether the United States will continue participating.</p><p>And despite the positive feelings about Saturday’s talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, questions about their relationship remained. After the brief meeting, a Ukrainian spokesman said that the two men would talk again later on Saturday. But Mr. Trump left Rome after telling aides that he wanted to get back to his golf resort in New Jersey.</p><p>After Mr. Trump boarded Air Force One to leave, the Ukrainian spokesman said a second meeting would not occur after all, because of the “very tight schedules of the presidents.”</p><p>Oleksandra Mykolyshyn<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nataliya Vasilyeva<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kim Barker is a Times reporter writing in-depth stories about the war in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/north-atlantic-treaty-organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/vitali-klitschko">Vitali Klitschko</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/27/world/europe/ukraine-trump-zelensky-putin.html">460</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/27/world/europe/ukraine-trump-zelensky-putin.html">460</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Deadly Car Blast</strong><strong>: </strong>An explosion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/europe/russian-officer-explosion-moscow-ukraine.html">killed a senior Russian military officer</a> in a Moscow suburb, investigators said, the latest in a series of apparent assassinations targeting Ukraine’s opponents inside Russia.</p></li><li><p><strong>Europe’s Choices if America Walks Away</strong><strong>: </strong>Europeans see Ukraine’s security as vital to their own and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/world/europe/europe-ukraine-russia-trump.html">want to defend the principle of no border changes by force</a>, even if President Trump does not.</p></li><li><p><strong>Air Raids and Antidepressants:</strong><strong> </strong>Sleep deprivation has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/europe/ukraine-sleep-deprivation-russia-war.html">a health crisis</a> in Ukraine, experts and psychologists say.
