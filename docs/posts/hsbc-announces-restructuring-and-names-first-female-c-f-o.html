A new corporate and institutional banking division will house commercial banking outside Britain and Hong Kong, as well as the markets and investment banking business. HSBC’s private banking, asset management and insurance businesses will be become part of an international wealth and premier banking unit.</p><p>The lender will also create an Eastern regional division that will pair its Asia Pacific and Middle East operations. Europe, Britain and the Americas will be grouped in another.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>With rates under pressure, banks are scrambling to cut costs. HSBC reported better-than-expected second quarter results, but some analysts worry that the lender is exposed to big rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks.</p><p>HSBC is also at the front line of trade tensions between the West and China. The bank is listed in London but makes most of its money in Asia. It was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/hsbc-china-politics/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">caught in the crossfire</a> during the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/05/business/dealbook/hsbc-ping-an-shareholder-agm.html" title="">investors rejected a plan</a> backed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/04/business/dealbook/hsbc-ping-an-shareholders-agm.html" title="">Ping An</a>, a Chinese insurer and one of HSBC’s biggest shareholders, for the bank to separate its Asia operations.</p><p>Mr. Elhedery said the changes had been designed to simplify operations. “The new structure will result in a simpler, more dynamic and agile organization as we focus on executing against our strategic priorities, which remain unchanged,” he said in a statement.</p><p>But investors shrugged off the latest changes. HSBC’s shares are up almost 10 percent over the past year but barely moved this morning. That’s partly because details weren’t revealed on how much the restructuring would cost, how many roles would be cut and how much money would be saved. Some analysts also want to know <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/hsbc-appoints-pam-kaur-first-female-cfo-2024-10-22/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">what other parts of the group</a> could be cut next.</p><p>HSBC also announced that Pam Kaur, the chief risk and compliance officer, will become the chief financial officer. Ms. Kaur, who joined the bank in 2013, will be the first woman to hold that role at the bank.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ravi Mattu is the managing editor of DealBook, based in London.
