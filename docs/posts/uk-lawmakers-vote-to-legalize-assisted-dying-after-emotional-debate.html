I’ll still say that we must keep try and keep to the time limit.” “I have been astonished by the number of people who have been in touch with me to tell me about their terminally ill loved ones who have starved themselves to death, and this is currently legal. And doctors are required to assist the patient through this agonizing process. How can we allow this, but not a compassionate and humane assisted death?” “Here.” “My daughter Maria lived her life with severe disabilities and health conditions, and since her birth, she was told, we were told many times that she might have only six months to live. She lived for 27 years. I am filled with dread and fear for those other people like Maria, who are nonverbal and don’t have that capacity. And what might happen to others like Maria if they aren’t loved and cared for and have somebody speaking out for them.” “Here.” “A very considerate five minutes. Thank you. David Davis.” “The ayes to the right, 330. The noes to the left, 275. The ayes have it. The ayes have it. Unlock.” ” I mean, I do absolutely respect the people who were opposed to it and their heartfelt reasons for why they were opposed. But this was always about choice. And they still have choice. But now so do we. And I’m feeling very emotional.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29uk-dying-01sub-gjcq/29uk-dying-01sub-gjcq-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The bill applies to those who are at least 18 years old, have received a terminal diagnosis and have no more than six months to live.

But it is a landmark political moment, setting the stage for a significant shift that some have likened to Britain’s legalization of abortion in 1967 and the abolition of the death penalty in 1969.</p><p>The new legislation would apply to a narrow group: Applicants would have to be over 18, diagnosed with a terminal illness and have been given no more than six months to live. Two doctors and a judge would be required to give their approval, and the fatal drugs would have to be self-administered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Assisted dying <a href="https://wfrtds.org/worldmap/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is already legal in a handful</a> of European countries, as well as in Canada, New Zealand, 10 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>The bill debated on Friday was proposed by a Labour Party member of parliament, Kim Leadbeater, but lawmakers were given the freedom to vote with their consciences, instead of being expected to vote along a party-line, meaning the outcome was impossible to predict.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29uk-dying02-kmgf/29uk-dying02-kmgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29uk-dying02-kmgf/29uk-dying02-kmgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29uk-dying02-kmgf/29uk-dying02-kmgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The British lawmaker Kim Leadbeater gestures as she speaks in a green space." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29uk-dying02-kmgf/29uk-dying02-kmgf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29uk-dying02-kmgf/29uk-dying02-kmgf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29uk-dying02-kmgf/29uk-dying02-kmgf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29uk-dying02-kmgf/29uk-dying02-kmgf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/fc568a62-781b-50ef-a898-8bef57e8458b" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kim Leadbeater in London last month. The Labour lawmaker told Parliament that her legislation addressed “one of the most significant issues of our time.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaimi Joy/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>During almost five hours of debate on Friday in a crowded parliamentary chamber, raw divisions were revealed over an issue that transcended political affiliations.</p><p>Meg Hillier, a Labour lawmaker, said the legislation would “cross a Rubicon,” by involving the state in the death of some of those it governs. “This is a fundamental change in the relationship between the state and the citizen, and the patient and their doctor,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Kit Malthouse, a Conservative lawmaker, argued in support of the bill, saying, “The deathbed for far too many is a place of misery, torture and degradation, a reign of blood and vomit and tears.” He added, “I see no compassion and beauty in that — only profound human suffering.”</p><p>Proponents of assisted dying say it is a merciful way to curtail unbearable suffering in the final months of life.</p><p>Under current British law, those who help relatives or friends to end their lives face police questioning and potentially prosecution. So even terminally ill patients who decide to end their life in a country with more permissive rules, like Switzerland, must do so alone to protect their families. That condemns some to a terrible death, some proponents of the bill argued.</p><p>Ms. Leadbeater told Parliament that her legislation addressed “one of the most significant issues of our time,” and asked colleagues to help families who face “the brutal and cruel reality of the status quo.”</p><p>Peter Prinsley, a Labour lawmaker and surgeon, rejected claims by opponents of the bill that its scope would later be extended to include a wider category of people. “This is not some slippery slope,” he said. “We are shortening death, not life, for our patients. This is not life or death; this is death or death.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Critics view assisted dying as a threat to the old, disabled and those with complex medical conditions, any of whom might feel pressured into agreeing to a premature death.</p><p>Some lawmakers said they feared that some of those patients might end their lives prematurely to remove the physical or financial burden on their families.</p><p>“People often recognize coercion only after years have passed, yet within a month someone could be dead,” said Rachel Maskell, a Labour lawmaker who worked as a senior physiotherapist in acute medical care. “Malign coercion cases may be few, but as a clinician working at the fringes of life, I heard my patients frequently say, ‘I don’t want to be a burden,’ or ‘I’d rather the money went to the grandchildren than on my care.’”</p><p>Under the British system, the scope of the proposed law extends only to England and Wales. A push for similar legislation is underway in the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>Polls suggest a clear majority of Britons support the principle of assisted dying as long as conditions are attached, with 65 percent in favor and 13 percent opposed, <a href="https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/media/jrko2fog/proceeding-with-caution.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to one recent survey</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Many faith leaders, however, expressed their opposition to the move and, ahead of the vote, two senior cabinet ministers, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, also spoke out against the measure.</p><p>Mr. Streeting argued that training staff to deal with assisted dying would add costs to the country’s National Health Service. He also pointed to the uneven availability of palliative care in Britain, warning that some patients might feel that they effectively had no alternative but to opt for assisted dying.</p><p>After Friday’s vote, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, said that he had opposed the measure because of his mother’s end-of-life experience. “Like millions of working class people, her final diagnosis filled her not with fear of death but a fear of being a burden to her family,” <a href="https://x.com/DavidLammy/status/1862524265330807176/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote in a letter</a> to his constituents.</p><p>In 2015, when lawmakers in Britain last considered the issue of assisted dying, they voted against it by 330 votes to 118. Ahead of Friday’s debate, four former prime ministers, Gordon Brown, Boris Johnson, Theresa May and Liz Truss — none of whom are still elected lawmakers — indicated that they would have opposed the measure if they had a vote.</p><p>But David Cameron, who was against the measure when it was debated in 2015 and while he was prime minister, said he had changed his mind.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>When it came, the result of the vote marked a clear break with the past, perhaps reflecting shifting social attitudes.</p><p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer had refused to say in advance which way he would vote, even though he supported assisted dying in 2015. On Thursday he hinted to reporters that his views had not changed, telling them that he had a strong interest in the issue because he had been responsible for reviewing police investigations into assisted deaths as a chief prosecutor before entering Parliament.</p><p>On Friday, alongside a majority of the cabinet, Mr. Starmer voted in favor of a bill that could prove one of the most consequential pieces of legislation to emerge during his time in Downing Street.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-13"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephen-castle">More about Stephen Castle</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/national-health-service">National Health Service</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/11/29/world/europe/uk-assisted-dying-bill-vote.html">304</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
