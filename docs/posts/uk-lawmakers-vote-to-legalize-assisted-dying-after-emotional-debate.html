The decision in Westminster followed weeks of fraught, often emotional public debate in Britain on a complex ethical question that has transcended<span>  </span>political affiliations and provoked sharp disagreement.</p><p>The bill that lawmakers approved on Friday would apply to a narrow group: Applicants would have to be over 18, diagnosed with a terminal illness and have been given six months or less to live. Two doctors and a judge would be required to approve a patient’s choice to end their life, and fatal drugs would have to be self-administered.</p><p>The legislation was proposed by a Labour Party member of Parliament, Kim Leadbeater, but lawmakers were given the freedom to vote with their conscience, meaning the outcome was impossible to predict.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kim Leadbeater in London last month.

But critics view it as a threat to the old, the disabled, and those with complex medical conditions who, they argue, might be pressured into a premature death.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Leadbeater told Parliament that her legislation addressed “one of the most significant issues of our time,” and asked colleagues to help families who face “the brutal and cruel reality of the status quo.”</p><p>Under current British law those who help relatives or friends to end their lives face police questioning and potentially prosecution. So even terminally ill Britons who decide to end their lives in a country with more permissive rules, like Switzerland, must do so alone to protect their families.</p><p>That consigns some to a terrible death, proponents of the bill asserted on Friday.</p><p>“The deathbed for far too many is a place of misery torture and degradation, a reign of blood and vomit and tears,” said Kit Malthouse, a Conservative Party supporter of the bill. “I see no compassion and beauty in that: only profound human suffering.”</p><p>But Meg Hillier, a Labour lawmaker, said the legislation would “cross a Rubicon,” by involving the state in the death of some of those it governed. “This is a fundamental change in the relationship between the state and the citizen, and the patient and their doctor,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Faith leaders have expressed their opposition to the move and, ahead of the vote, two senior cabinet ministers, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, also spoke out against the measure.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Streeting argued that training staff to deal with assisted dying would add costs to the country’s National Health Service. He also pointed to the uneven availability of palliative care in Britain, suggesting that some patients may feel that they effectively have no alternative but to opt for assisted dying.</p><p>However a clear majority of Britons support the principle of assisted dying, with 65 percent in favor and 13 percent opposed, <a href="https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/media/jrko2fog/proceeding-with-caution.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to one recent survey</a>.</p><p><em>If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 from the United States to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephen-castle">More about Stephen Castle</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
