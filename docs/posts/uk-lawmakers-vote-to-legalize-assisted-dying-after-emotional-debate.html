The decision in Westminster followed weeks of fraught, often emotional public debate in Britain on a complex ethical question that has transcended<span>  </span>political affiliations and provoked sharp disagreement.</p><p>The bill that lawmakers approved on Friday would require two doctors and a judge to give their approval to any patient choosing to end their life, and fatal drugs would have to be self-administered.</p><p>It was proposed by a Labour Party member of Parliament, Kim Leadbeater, but lawmakers were given the freedom to vote with their conscience.</p><p>Proponents of assisted dying see it as a merciful way to curtail unbearable suffering in the final months of life. But critics view it as a threat to the old, the disabled, and those with complex medical conditions whom, they argue, might be pressured into a premature death.</p><p>Ms. Leadbeater told Parliament that her legislation addressed “one of the most significant issues of our time,” and asked colleagues to help families who face “the brutal and cruel reality of the status quo.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Under current British law those who help relatives or friends to end their lives face police questioning and potentially prosecution. So even terminally ill Britons who decide to end their lives in countries with more permissive rules, like Switzerland, must do so alone to protect their families.</p><p>That consigns some to a terrible death, proponents of the bill asserted on Friday.</p><p>“The deathbed for far too many is a place of misery torture and degradation, a reign of blood and vomit and tears,” said Kit Malthouse, a Conservative Party supporter of the bill. “I see no compassion and beauty in that: only profound human suffering.”</p><p>But Meg Hillier, a Labour lawmaker, said the legislation would “cross a Rubicon,” by involving the state in the death of some of those it governed. “This is a fundamental change in the relationship between the state and the citizen, and the patient and their doctor,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephen-castle">More about Stephen Castle</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/national-health-service">National Health Service</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
