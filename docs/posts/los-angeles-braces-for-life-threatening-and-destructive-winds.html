In addition to the fire risk, widespread damaging wind gusts, reaching 50 to 80 miles per hour, and even above 100 m.p.h. in the mountains, may knock down trees and power lines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>These winds aren’t unusual, and the strongest Santa Ana winds typically happen this time of the year. But by January, Los Angeles has usually had enough rain that the fire threat is mitigated because the vegetation is greener and there is more moisture in the ground. This year, that hasn’t been the case, said Rich Thompson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Los Angeles.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Because the vegetation is extremely dry, if a fire starts, these winds will help it spread rapidly — just as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/mountain-fire-ventura-california.html" title="">Mountain fire</a> did in November across Ventura County and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/franklin-fire-malibu-california.html" title="">Franklin fire</a> did in Malibu in December. “Any spark, any ignition source, could lead to something very, very dramatic, very, very quickly,” Mr. Thompson said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After a short-lived dip in speed on Tuesday afternoon, the winds are expected to accelerate to dangerous levels from Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning. Gusty winds and dangerous conditions could linger into Thursday or even Friday.</p><p>The weather conditions will mostly be similar to those that led to the Mountain and Franklin fires. However, in a few areas, winds may reach stronger levels than during those earlier events.</p><p>The longer-lasting strong winds will occur mostly across Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. Moderate to strong winds may even reach the Los Angeles County coast, especially in the Hollywood Hills, Beverly Hills and Sepulveda Pass, and extending into Palos Verdes and Catalina Island from Tuesday evening into Wednesday, according to forecasters in the Los Angeles National Weather Service Office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Even portions of the San Gabriel Valley and the San Fernando Valley, which don’t often see damaging wind gusts, could see strong winds during this event’s peak.</p><p>The winds may return next week. “We’re not catching a break,” Mr. Thompson said. “There’s just no rain in the forecast. So this is going to be a persistent issue for the next couple of weeks.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
