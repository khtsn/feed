Enhanced security at Israeli checkpoints across the territory slowed or stopped traffic; in one case a<span>  </span>45-year-old woman died at a checkpoint outside Hebron while waiting to be allowed to go to a hospital, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.</p><p>The mayor of Jenin, Mohammad Jarar, told Wafa that Israeli forces held as many as 600 people overnight at the Jenin Governmental Hospital, but they were allowed to leave Wednesday morning.
