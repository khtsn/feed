On Monday, Mr. Trump said he was “not sure” what Mr. Carney wanted to discuss. Canadian officials framed the meeting as a first step in the two leaders becoming acquainted and beginning talks that would likely go on for a while.</p><h2 id="link-395bbb71">Chemistry matters</h2><p>As is often the case with Mr. Trump, a lot could come down to his chemistry with Mr. Carney, which is untested.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The two may not be a natural match. Mr. Carney is a sometimes stiff former banker, known to not suffer fools. He has — while campaigning — revealed a snappish side, as well as a bone-dry sense of humor, when pressed or cornered.</p><p>But he could earn Mr. Trump’s respect for his private-sector experience — he worked at Goldman Sachs for more than a decade and was later a boardroom leader for major companies.</p><p>“He’s a very nice man, I think,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Carney in an interview on the NBC program, “Meet The Press” on Sunday.</p><p>The anodyne statement was an improvement on his feelings about Mr. Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau. The two had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/10/world/canada/g-7-justin-trudeau-trump.html" title="">a public falling out in 2018</a>, and the relationship never recovered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Trump at the White House in 2019.

While Mr. Trudeau has never confirmed this version of events, Mr. Trump has cited Mr. Trudeau’s supposed statement to claim that Canada doesn’t deserve to be a country because it is overly dependent on the United States.</p><p>He started referring to Mr. Trudeau as “Governor Trudeau” and Canada as “the 51st state.”</p><p>Despite the more respectful language regarding Mr. Carney, it was clear Mr. Trump was not backing down from his main claims about Canada.</p><p>“I’m a real estate guy at heart,” he told NBC. “When I look down at that artificial line that was drawn with a ruler many years ago — was just an artificial line, goes straight across. You don’t even realize. What a beautiful country it would be.”</p><h2 id="link-424a3f4e">What are the issues?</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/canada/trump-trudeau-canada-51st-state.html" title="">On a call with Mr. Trudeau in February</a>, Mr. Trump said he did not like the border treaty between the two nations, a claim he’s since repeated publicly, and raised doubts about the two countries’ water-sharing agreements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The president’s statements suggest he is eyeing a renegotiation of the agreements that regulate the relationship between the two next-door neighbors, a worrying prospect for Canada, which would enter such talks as the weaker party.</p><p>“America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/canada/canada-election-mark-carney-win.html" title="">Mr. Carney said in his acceptance speech</a> last week. “President Trump is trying to break us so he can own us. That will never happen.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs on many Canadian goods, but some goods that had been slated for tariffs have been exempted as he has changed his mind, spreading confusion.</p><p>Canada has applied retaliatory tariffs against U.S. goods, the only country to take that step besides China, although Mr. Carney has said there is a limit to this approach. </p><p>The United States, Canada and Mexico have long had a free-trade agreement, now known as U.S.M.C.A., which lays in tatters. Renegotiating a new deal is one of Mr. Carney’s goals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Ambassador Bridge, which connects Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit.

In reality, the United States last year had a $63.3 billion trade deficit with Canada, <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/canada" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> U.S. government data. When Canadian oil exported to the United States is excluded, America has a surplus.</p><p>Mr. Trump has complained that Canada is a laggard in military spending in NATO, which has a target for its members of committing 2 percent of economic output to defense. Mr. Carney has promised to reach that goal by the end of this decade.</p><p>And Mr. Trump has said Canadian industries like dairy and banking are unfairly protected, making access for U.S. competitors harder.</p><p>Many elements of the relationship that Mr. Trump says are unfair, were agreed on as part of the trade agreement he negotiated and signed in his first term.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matina Stevis-Gridneff is the Canada bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the country.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Steady Interest Rates:</strong> The U.S. central bank is set to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/business/fed-interest-rates-economy.html">reinforce its wait-and-see approach</a> at its meeting this week as President Trump’s tariffs begin to bite.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iowa Farmers Struggle:</strong> With high costs and low prices for their crops, soybean and corn farmers were already nervous as they planned for planting season this year. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/business/soy-farmers-struggle-with-trade-war.html">A big trade war isn’t helping.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>China&#39;s Garment Factories:</strong> Tariffs compound multiple <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/business/china-tariffs-de-minimis-guangzhou.html">challenges facing garment makers in China</a>.
