    <h1>Trump Hits an Obstacle: the Courts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump’s attempts to reshape the economy and punish the nation’s oldest university were both upended in federal court over the last 24 hours.</p><p>First, the president suffered back-to-back defeats. One court declared many of his tariffs to be illegal, and another blocked him from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/29/us/harvard-trump" title="">barring international students from attending Harvard</a>. Then, this afternoon, Trump secured a temporary victory when an appeals court froze the decision blocking his tariffs.</p><p>The court fights are new, but they probably feel familiar. While Congress has mostly fallen in line behind Trump, the judiciary has emerged as the primary check on the president’s power. Over the first 130 days of Trump’s second term, courts have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/trump-administration-lawsuits.html" title="">ruled against at least 180 of his actions</a>.</p><p>The White House hasn’t just noticed; they are outraged. “If these judges want to be secretary of state or the president, they can run for office themselves,” said Karoline Leavitt, the president’s spokeswoman. One of Trump’s top advisers, Stephen Miller, wrote on social media: “We are living under a judicial tyranny.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>On tariffs: </strong>The appeals court paused the ruling against the levies without ruling on the merits. The delay simply <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/politics/trump-tariffs-trade-strategy.html" title="">bought time for it to consider the government’s appeal</a>.</p><p>In a separate ruling today, a federal judge ordered another, temporary halt to some of Trump’s tariffs in a case brought by an educational toy company. But the district judge, Rudolph Contreras, paused the enforcement of his ruling for 14 days.</p><p>The string of court defeats only reinforced a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/world/europe/us-trade-tariffs-court-decision.html" title="">palpable sense of worry among Trump’s advisers</a>. Top White House aides said last month that they planned to reach 90 deals in 90 days — a goal they are far from reaching.</p><p><strong>At Harvard: </strong>The university received its temporary reprieve while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/harvard-graduation-ceremony.html" title="">9,000 students were gathered in Harvard Yard</a> to receive their diplomas. Sporadic cheers broke out as students learned of the judge’s decision. Harvard’s lawyers said that international students had been panicked and sought to transfer.</p><p>Still, neither Harvard nor international students appear likely to be out of Trump’s cross hairs anytime soon. The administration has frozen more than $3 billion in federal funding to Harvard and described visa holders as “agitators.” Trump has argued that more of their admissions spots should go to Americans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ukrainian soldier near Kupiansk, northeast Ukraine, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-469ecb15">Russia’s summer offensive appears to be underway</h2><p>After making only incremental gains for months, Russian forces are advancing on Ukrainian battlefields at their fastest pace this year while bombarding Ukrainian cities with some of the biggest drone and missile strikes of the war. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-offensive.html" title="">They have opened another front in northern Ukraine</a>, even as the Kremlin has begun its first direct peace talks with Ukraine since 2022.</p><p>Russian forces are pushing into territory in the east with the goal of conquering the remainder of Donetsk, one of two regions in the Donbas, this year.
