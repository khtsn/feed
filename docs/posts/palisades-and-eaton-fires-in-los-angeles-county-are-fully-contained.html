    <h1>Palisades and Eaton Fires in Los Angeles County Are Fully Contained</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More than three weeks after the devastating Eaton and Palisades fires broke out in Southern California, state officials on Friday evening said that firefighters had fully contained both fires, meaning that the perimeters of the fires were completely under control.</p><p>Evacuation orders had already been lifted, and for more than a week the fires have not posed a major threat. But their full containment closed a chapter on two fires that raged for days, killed at least 29 people, displaced thousands of residents and ravaged many neighborhoods.</p><p>Cal Fire, the stateâ€™s firefighting agency, updated the data for both fires on Friday night to show 100 percent containment.</p><p>The Palisades fire destroyed more than 6,800 structures, mostly in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles and Malibu, and burned 23,448 acres, according to the agency. The Eaton fire destroyed more than 9,400 structures, mostly in the Altadena community in Los Angeles County, and burned 14,021 acres.</p></div></div>
