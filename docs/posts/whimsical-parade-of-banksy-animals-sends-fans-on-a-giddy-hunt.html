The second work, a pair of elephants, appeared overnight on a house in southwest London. Then came some playful monkeys, a howling wolf, two hungry pelicans and a cat.</p><p>For nine straight days, Banksy, the famed and elusive street artist, unveiled a menagerie of animal artworks around the city, a prolific outburst that thrilled Londoners.</p><p>For Banksy fans, finding the works became a daily, citywide scavenger hunt.</p><p>“It’s like an adventure,” said Daniel Lloyd-Morgan, an artist who <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dlmdoodles/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sketches</a> live street scenes. “It’s turned into a safari around London.”</p><p>Every day since the first one appeared, Mr. Lloyd-Morgan checked social media to figure out the location of each new Banksy and pay it a visit. “This is like a happening,” he said. “So basically I put everything else on hold.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>It was an unusually whimsical outpouring from Banksy, a British artist known for his socially and politically charged street art, which has appeared in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/arts/design/banksy-makes-new-york-his-gallery-for-a-month.html" title="">New York City</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/world/middleeast/banksy-hotel-bethlehem-west-bank.html" title="">the West Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/world/europe/banksy-mural-ukraine.html" title="">Ukraine</a> and other areas around the world. More recently, he sent an inflatable boat with dummy passengers to surf across a crowd at the Glastonbury Festival in England, a commentary on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/world/europe/migrants-death-italy-libya.html" title="">the plight of migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea</a>.</p><p>But what message was Banksy trying to send with the animals scattered across London? That has spurred speculation, even as the works have delighted the residents of the neighborhoods they popped up in.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, a stencil of a gorilla was <a href="https://www.londonzoo.org/zoo-stories/news/banksy-london-zoo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sighted outside</a> London Zoo, appearing to lift a shutter for birds and other animals to escape. It was the ninth and final piece of the series, according to Pest Control Office, the organization that manages contact with Banksy, who has remained anonymous. It declined to comment on the meaning behind the works.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The ninth and final artwork appeared at the entrance to the London Zoo on Tuesday morning. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andy Rain/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Those who hustled to see the gorilla only hours after Banksy shared it online had plenty of thoughts. On Tuesday, families that gathered had at the entrance of the London Zoo to see real animals were joined by a crowd of street art bloggers and photographers. Runners and cyclists, still sweating, stopped to take selfies. Two patrolling police officers, after checking on the crowd, posed with the Banksy.</p></div><div><div><p>Giulia Riva, a street art <a href="https://www.blocal-travel.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blogger</a> from Italy, speculated that the work was about nature taking back the urban space. “These animals are now running wild throughout the city — and they are re-wilding the city,” she said. Ms. Riva, who arrived in London recently and has met other like-minded people during her Banksy pursuits this week, said that the hunt was part of the art.</p><p>“The point is not if the stencil is sharp or well-executed, but it is creating all this,” she said, gesturing around. “There are dozens if not hundreds of people going around the city, chasing the animals.” She added: “We are part of the piece in a way. It’s a performance.”</p><p>Banksy’s latest series has echoes of “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CShWMUwFKkI/?hl=en-gb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A Great British Spraycation</a>,” a set of artworks that appeared in towns across East Anglia in England in 2021, said Charlotte Stewart, the managing director of <a href="https://www.myartbroker.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MyArtBroker</a>, an art dealing platform for Banksy prints and originals. “But he claimed them all at once, via a video on his Instagram,” she said in an email. “This day-by-day process is new.”</p><p>The Johnson family, who were visiting London from Asheville, N.C., had been on a rock music tour when they heard about the last Banksy, the gorilla mural, online. Their guide interrupted the end of the tour to rush them over to the zoo. “To be able to see it within hours of it happening is a pretty great experience,” Daniel Johnson said.</p></div></div><div><p>Part of the reason behind the rush to see the works is that Banksy’s street art is often defaced, removed or obscured in some way shortly after appearing. Masked men <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgrjyv2dwnvo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removed</a> one of the pieces in the series in South London, of a howling wolf on a satellite dish, soon after it was discovered. The artist was not connected to the theft, according to a statement from Pest Control. Another piece, a rhino, was soon <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yd66w769zo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">defaced</a> with a graffiti tag.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Three monkeys appeared on a bridge in Shoreditch, a neighborhood in East London. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andy Rain/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The London Zoo, which discovered the gorilla artwork early on Tuesday morning, left the shutter closed and set up a barricade for admirers. The zoo was discussing how to make the artwork available to view, said Karl Penman, the zoo’s commercial operations manager. “We will be doing all that we can to obviously protect this piece of amazing work,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Lloyd-Morgan, the sketch artist, was sad to hear that Tuesday would be the last day of the series. “It’s not just about the art,” he said, while painting a watercolor of the gorilla. “It’s about the whole environment that he creates.” Mr. Lloyd-Morgan added of passers-by: “I’ve gotten to know these people from coming everyday. I’ve seen the same faces everyday.”</p><p>He was still hopeful, though, that there could be more to come on this Banksy roundabout. “He likes to mislead people, fox them, send them in the wrong direction,” he said. “So who knows?”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
