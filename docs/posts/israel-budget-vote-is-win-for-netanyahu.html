Had it failed to pass by the end of the month, Parliament would have been automatically disbanded. That would have set off elections, some 18 months early, that Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition of right-wing parties might have lost, according to most recent polls.</p><p>Now, Mr. Netanyahu has much greater leeway to set his government’s priorities, both at home and in Gaza, because it will be harder for any single disgruntled party in his coalition to threaten its downfall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“That could mean doubling down on extreme right-wing populism and the war in Gaza, or it could mean figuring out an exit strategy and attempting a dash to a Saudi normalization deal,” said Michael Koplow, an analyst at Israel Policy Forum, a New York-based research group. “But whichever path it is will reflect Netanyahu’s own calculations rather than what he is being pushed into by his coalition partners.”</p><p>The vote drew sharp protests from demonstrators, who blocked roads to the Parliament, holding signs to demand that Mr. Netanyahu move more quickly in negotiations to free several dozen hostages who have been held in the Gaza Strip for nearly 18 months. Talks to resume a cease-fire with Hamas appear stalled, and a recent government decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-war.html" title="">return to war</a> is raising fears among Israelis for the hostages who have not been released.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters and police officers outside the Parliament in Jerusalem on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ronen Zvulun/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel’s parliamentary opposition, claimed the budget also included cuts to essential services like health care, welfare and education while diverting funds to Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition partners.</p><p>“The budget harms every Israeli citizen, especially working people,” Mr. Lapid said. “Just to keep the coalition going for a few more months, it sells out the citizens of Israel.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The budget capped spending at $168.8 billion, allocating more money — $29.9 billion — to Israel’s defense ministry than any other government agency. Nearly 18 percent of <a href="https://main.knesset.gov.il/en/news/pressreleases/pages/press25325y.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the newly approved budget for 2025</a> will fund its military and defense operations.</p><p>A summary of the budget said that allocation reflected the continuing need for significant military spending since October 2023, when the Hamas-led assault that killed about 1,200 Israelis touched off the ongoing war in Gaza. Spending increased last year, the budget said, as Israel opened new fronts in Lebanon and Syria and stepped up airstrikes against Iran and Yemen.</p><p>“This is a war budget, and with God’s help it will also be the victory budget,” Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, an ally of Mr. Netanyahu, said in a statement after the budget was approved on Tuesday.</p><p>The United States, which is part of deadlocked peace negotiations to free the Israeli hostages and end the war in Gaza, has eased some of Israel’s wartime expenses by supplying billions of dollars in weapons.</p><p>Already this year, the Trump administration has bypassed Congress to allow the sales of more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/us/politics/trump-israel-arms-weapons.html" title="">$12 billion</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/us/politics/rubio-arms-israel.html" title="">in arms</a> to Israel over the coming decade — including <a href="https://www.dsca.mil/press-media/major-arms-sales/israel-munitions-and-munitions-support" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2 billion in bombs</a> like the 2,000-pound munition that human rights officials and advocates said had indiscriminately killed civilians in Gaza.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
