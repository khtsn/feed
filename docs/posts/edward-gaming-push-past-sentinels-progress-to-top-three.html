</span> tomorrow with their tournament lives on the line.</p>

<p>This match represented the first ever face-off between the two regional heavyweights after both had taken clean 2-0 wins in their first playoff games. The winner would claim their first top-three placement at a Champions event. </p>

<p>EDG opened their map pick of Haven with their first of many pistol rounds, but the initial lead was short-lived as Sentinels answered back with seven rounds in a row. Everything went their way as they consistently dismantled EDG&#39;s defensive setups. <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9/tenz">
		TenZ	</a>
</span> in particular dominated the first half with 17 kills, including a clean three-piece in round 12 to secure his team an 8-4 lead.</p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9/tenz">
		TenZ	</a>
</span> couldn&#39;t lose a fight on Haven.</em></p>

<p>EDG collected the second pistol but were immediately thriftied after CHICHOO was caught isolated with a Bulldog. The Chinese team showed signs of life, including an impressive four kills from <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13768/s1mon">
		S1Mon	</a>
</span> in round 16, but Sentinels&#39; lead was too much to overcome and the Americas squad closed out the map 13-9.</p>

<p>While the headliner duelists in <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4004/zekken">
		zekken	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> both recorded 23 kills, zekken&#39;s impact as the spearhead far exceeded his counterpart&#39;s as he delivered 9-1 FK/FD compared to ZmjjKK&#39;s 5-6 FK/FD. </p>

<p>On Lotus, Sentinels found another strong start as they went up 5-1. This time, EDG were able to wrestle back control, pulling the score back to 5-4 and an eventual 6-6 half off the back of a 2v3 from <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span> and S1mon in round 7. </p>

 
<p><em><span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13768/s1mon">
		S1Mon	</a>
</span> bring EDG back into the game.</em></p>

<p>The second half saw EDG taking their first lead of the series as they chained a pistol and bonus win to a 10-6 lead, forcing a timeout from Sentinels. Sentinels brought it back to 10-9, but EDG maintained a stronghold on A to win the map 13-9 and take Sentinels to the first map three of playoffs thus far.</p>

<p>That map, Sunset, wound up being the most one-sided of them all; EDG grabbed hold of a 10-2 attack half with a greater-than-usual emphasis on B postplants for the map. One of the only rounds for Sentinels was another thrifty win on round 4.</p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span> comes online with three to extend EDG&#39;s commanding lead.</em></p>

<p>The second pistol was the nail in the coffin for Sentinels; EDG found a 12-2 scoreline with a 5-1 pistol record for the series and won Sunset 13-6, closing it with a thrifty of their own. CHICHOO took over the entire server with 23 kills to 10 deaths, 333 ACS, and an outsized 1.72 rating.</p>

<p>With this result, Sentinels will face FNATIC in the lower bracket tomorrow in a rematch of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/19089/sentinels-vs-fnatic-valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-reykjavik-main-event-gf" target="_blank">Masters Reykjavik grand final</a> and the teams&#39; first meeting since LOCK//IN. </p>

<p>On the other side, EDG have secured a historic win for China with the first ever top-three placement at a global event for their region. They will confront the winner of Team Heretics versus Leviatán in the upper bracket final as they push for VCT China&#39;s first international trophy.</p>

<p>When asked about how he handles the pressure in the post-match interview, S1mon&#39;s answer was short and simple: “Focus on winning the games.”</p>

<p>EDG will return on Aug. 23 for a chance at a coveted slot in the grand final.</p>
