Putin of Russia was warmly received by the leader of Mongolia on Tuesday in his first state visit to a member nation of the International Criminal Court since it issued a warrant for his arrest last year.</p><p>Instead of arresting Mr. Putin, as the I.C.C., Ukraine, and human rights groups have urged, Mongolia, which is highly dependent on Russia for its energy needs, gave the Russian leader a red-carpet welcome in the capital, Ulaanbaatar. Mr. Putin was greeted by an honor guard, some on horseback, whose uniforms were inspired by the 13th-century Mongol ruler Genghis Khan.</p><p>Following the ceremonial welcome, Mr. Putin and President Ukhnaa Khurelsukh of Mongolia held talks in a traditional yurt in Ulaanbaatar’s State Palace.</p><p>“Relations between the Russian Federation and Mongolia are developing in all directions,” Mr. Putin said during the public portion of the meeting, according to RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Khurelsukh expressed appreciation to Mr. Putin for his visit, the first in five years.</p><p>“It is gratifying to note that relations between our countries and peoples are traditionally friendly and have reached the level of a comprehensive strategic partnership,” he continued.</p><p>Mongolia, which relies on Russia for 95 percent of its petroleum products, has refrained from condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine and has abstained during United Nations votes concerning the conflict. Mongolia was one of the top destinations for Russians fleeing the country in 2022 after the war began and the Kremlin announced a mobilization campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Putin’s motorcade in Ulaanbaatar on Tuesday, in a photograph released by Russian state media.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vyacheslav Prokofyev/Sputnik, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Officials in Ukraine, which has been under intense missile and drone attacks in the past week and a half, expressed outrage over Mr. Putin’s visit.</p><p>“The Mongolian government’s failure to carry out the binding I.C.C. arrest warrant for Putin is a heavy blow to the International Criminal Court and the international criminal justice system,” Georgiy Tykhyi, a Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman, <a href="https://x.com/SpoxUkraineMFA/status/1830663499045052871" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Mongolia has allowed an accused criminal to evade justice, thereby sharing responsibility for the war crimes. We will work with partners to ensure that this has consequences for Ulaanbaatar.”</p><p>The Mongolian government has not commented on the calls to arrest Mr. Putin.</p><p>In March 2023, the I.C.C. issued a warrant for Mr. Putin’s arrest, accusing him of committing war crimes with the abduction and deportation of Ukrainian children. The court also issued a warrant for Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova.</p><p>Russia, like the United States, does not recognize the jurisdiction of the court, which is based in The Hague in the Netherlands. However, Mongolia is one of 124 signatories of the Rome statute, which governs membership in the international court.</p><p>Mr. Putin’s visit is being portrayed at home as a sign that Western efforts to turn him into a global pariah since he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 have not been effective.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>He brought a large delegation to Ulaanbaatar, including the deputy prime minister Aleksei Overchuk, and the deputy defense minister Alexey Fomin, as well as top officials in energy, foreign affairs, transport and other ministries.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mongolia, which relies on Russia for 95 percent of its fuel, has refrained from condemning the war in Ukraine and has abstained during United Nations votes concerning the conflict.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.
