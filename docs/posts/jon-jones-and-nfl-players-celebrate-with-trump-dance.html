Trump dance craze is that it’s not really a craze. (Not yet, at least.) Nor, to be honest, is it a dance.</p><p>What is certain, however, is that the president-elect’s signature shimmy is currently en vogue with all manner of professional athletes, imitated by at least five National Football League players on Sunday, as well as by Jon Jones, the current heavyweight champion of the U.F.C., who seemingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/us/politics/donald-trump-msg-ufc.html" title="">helped spread the fad on Saturday night</a> after knocking out Stipe Miocic in the third round.</p><p><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113499727057908996" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Jones celebrated</a> by rocking from hip to hip and pumping his fists at waist level — both hallmarks of Mr. Trump’s dancing — before pointing his finger at Mr. Trump, who was attending the fight in New York and sitting ringside. Mr. Trump, never one to pass up a compliment, beamed in the moment and soon reposted Mr. Jones’s performance on his Truth Social account.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Mr. Trump, seen in profile, grasps the hand of Jon Jones, who is shirtless and leaning toward him." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw/18TRUMP-CELEBRATION-DANCE-03-cqpw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/297a2c65-b8a4-5dc5-abe1-a33a15e64801" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump congratulated Jon Jones after his victory over Stipe Miocic at a U.F.C. fight on Saturday.

His resounding victory on Nov. 5, however, has resulted in an increasing trickle of congratulations from famous people — a diverse cohort including the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/11/18/celebrities-on-the-election-charles-barkley-tells-dems-to-shut-up-sylvester-stallone-calls-trump-second-george-washington/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">likes of Caitlyn Jenner and Sylvester Stallone</a>. Mr. Jones and the N.F.L. players expanded that circle even more.</p><p>For the unacquainted, Mr. Trump’s gyrations are a far cry from the complexities of the moonwalk, the Macarena or the Electric Slide. Both simple and strangely hypnotic, Mr. Trump’s wiggle incorporates the kind of stiff swivel often employed by arrhythmic wedding guests or awkward, one-too-many conventioneers. In the bent elbows and fist pumps, there’s a certain slowed-down homage to <a href="https://tenor.com/search/frank-the-tank-gifs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Frank the Tank</a> — Will Ferrell’s boozy character in the 2003 movie “Old School” — while the corresponding hip action makes it a dance that is simultaneously wrong for most music, and perhaps barely passable for all.</p><p>Sunday saw more variations emerging, from N.F.L. players like Brock Bowers, a tight end for the Las Vegas Raiders, who did a quick end zone dance with the Trumpian boogie, something he said was inspired by Mr. Jones. “I saw it and thought it was cool,” Mr. Bowers <a href="https://x.com/Safid_Deen/status/1858275468312551560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1858275468312551560%7Ctwgr%5E47143865813f46c1b051e23b02ed3db1edd29565%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fsports%2Fraiders-brock-bowers-talks-cool-trump-celebration-team-curiously-ends-press-session-right-after-report" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told reporters</a>.
