This year the program diverged somewhat from the its traditional kaleidoscopic panorama. An official theme, “Mathematics in the Age of A.I.,” was set by Bryna Kra, the president of the American Mathematical Society, which hosts the event in collaboration with 16 partner organizations. In one configuration or another, the meeting, called the Joint Mathematics Meetings, or the J.M.M., has been held more or less annually for over a century.</p><p>Dr. Kra intended the A.I. theme as a “wake-up call.” “A.I. is something that is in our lives, and it’s time to start thinking about how it impacts your teaching, your students, your research,” she said in an interview with The New York Times. “What does it mean to have A.I. as a co-author? These are the kinds of questions that we have to grapple with.”</p><p>On the second evening, Yann LeCun, the chief A.I. scientist at Meta, gave a keynote lecture titled “Mathematical Obstacles on the Way to Human-Level A.I.” Dr. LeCun got a bit into the technical weeds, but there were digestible tidbits.</p><p>“The current state of machine learning is that it sucks,” he said during the lecture, to much chortling. “Never mind humans, never mind trying to reproduce mathematicians or scientists; we can’t even reproduce what a cat can do.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Instead of the generative large language models powering chatbots, he argued, a “large-scale <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">world model</a>” would be the better bet for advancing and improving the technology. Such a system, he said in an interview after the lecture, “can reason and plan because it has a mental model of the world that predicts consequences of its action.” But there are obstacles, he admitted — some mathematically intractable problems, their solutions nowhere in sight.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yann LeCun, the chief A.I. scientist at Meta, said “the current state of machine learning is that it sucks.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fabrice Coffrini/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Deirdre Haskell, the director of the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences in Toronto and a mathematician at McMaster University, said she appreciated Dr. LeCun’s reminder that, as she recalled, “the way we use the term A.I. today is only one way of possibly having an ‘artificial intelligence.’”</p><p>Dr. LeCun had noted in his lecture that the term artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I. — a machine with human-level intelligence — was a misnomer. Humans “do not have general intelligence at all,” he said. “We’re extremely specialized.” The preferred term at Meta, he said, is “advanced machine intelligence,” or AMI — “we pronounce it ‘ami,’ which means friend in French.”</p><p>Dr. Haskell was already sold on the importance of “using A.I. to do math, and the huge problem of understanding the math of A.I.” An expert in mathematical logic, she plans to use a theorem-proving program to create the equivalent of a textbook: a collection of results that can be used by A.I. systems to generate and verify more complex mathematical research and proofs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For Kenny Banks, an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro who attended the J.M.M., artificial intelligence does not appeal as a tool for guiding exploration. “I think the mathematics that people currently love is driven by human curiosity, and what computers find interesting cannot be the same as what humans find interesting,” he said in an email. Nevertheless, he regretted not squeezing any A.I.-related talks into his itinerary. “The math + A.I. theme was definitely of interest, it just ended up not working with all the things I had planned!”</p><p>Here are some other highlights from the mathapalooza in Seattle:</p><h2 id="link-17af9">Day 1</h2><p>At 6 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 8, after a ribbon-cutting and awards ceremony, attendees stampeded to the grand-opening reception in an exhibit hall. The draw was a) free food, and b) exhibitor booths occupied by publishers and purveyors of various mathy wares. At Booth 337, Robert Fathauer was selling an impressive inventory of dice — including the new “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yMtTqiAhol8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">5-Player Go First Dice</a>,” a colorful set of five 60-sided dice that share no number in common, allowing five game players an equal shot when they roll to determine who starts first. Dr. Fathauer, who is based in Arizona, was also co-organizer of the meeting’s art exhibit and contributed two ceramic sculptures of his own, “Hyperbolic Helicoid” and “Cubic Squeeze.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Cubic Squeeze” by Robert Fathauer.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Siobhan Roberts</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Hyperbolic Helicoid.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Siobhan Roberts</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The exhibit’s award-winning art submissions were “Saddle Monster,” crocheted in wool, copper and nylon, by Shiying Dong of Greenwich, Conn., a mathematical artist with a Ph.D. in physics …</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Saddle Monster” by Shiying Dong.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shiying Dong</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>… and “Twisted” and “Untwisted,” created using a vector graphics app on an iPad, by Rashmi Sunder-Raj, a mathematical artist in Waterloo, Ontario.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-12"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rashmi Sunder-Raj</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rashmi Sunder-Raj</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Rebecca Lin, a Ph.D. student in computer science at M.I.T., received an honorable mention for a laser-cut engraving on paper titled “Disintegrating (State of Mind).”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rebecca Lin’s “Disintegrating (State of Mind).”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca Lin</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-17afa">Day 2</h2><p>On Thursday, Jon Wild, a music theorist at McGill University in Montreal who does math on the side, was invited to a session on applied mathematics to discuss his investigations into “counting arrangements of circles” in the plane. Given certain constraints, there is one way to draw one circle, three ways to draw two circles, 14 ways to draw three, 173 ways for four, and 16,951 ways to draw five. (The enumeration of six circles is yet to be computed.) Dr. Wild was surprised to learn that this research was relevant to 3-D printing: that is, to how multiple printer heads could each trace circular arcs while avoiding collisions. “I was tickled,” Dr. Wild said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jon Wild’s circles on a plane applied to 3-D printing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jon Wild</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>During a session on mathematics and the arts, Susan Goldstine, a mathematician at St. Mary’s College of Maryland, lectured about her “Poincaré Blues” craft project.

As she described in a write-up: “After noodling around with different patterns, I settled on the tiling of the Poincaré disk model of the hyperbolic plane by 30º-45º-90º triangles,” which was familiar to her from <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201006/201006-full-issue.pdf?adat=June/July%202010&amp;trk=&amp;cat=none&amp;type=.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an illustration</a> by the classical geometer H.S.M.

space; and a model for wildfire containment, smoke spread and their public health consequences.</p><p>During another session on mathematics and the arts, Barry Cipra, a mathematician from Minnesota, gave a talk about “<a href="https://kmw.zetcom.net/de/collection/item/418/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gelbes feld</a>” (“yellow field”), a painting by the Bauhaus-trained

3-by-3 magic square so that there are exactly five pips along each row, column and main diagonal of the 9-by-9 subgrid?” The same question can be asked for 5-by-5 and larger magic squares of odd

public lecture, Ravi Vakil, a mathematician at Stanford and the incoming president of the American Mathematical Society, explored the simultaneously playful and profound “<a

and pianist at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, addressed “Math, Art, Social Justice.” One of her salient messages: “Pure mathematics is a framework for agreeing on things.” She sang some of the lecture alongside a recorded video of herself playing the piano.</p><p>And there was a world premiere of a documentary film, “Creating Pathways,” the second in the “<a href="http://www.zalafilms.com/jbm/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Journeys of Black Mathematicians</a>” series by the director George Csicsery. (It airs <a href="https://www.aptonline.org/offer/JOURNEYS-OF-BLACK-MATHEMATICIANS" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on public television stations</a> in February.) The film’s senior consultant was Johnny Houston, an emeritus professor at Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina. After the screening, Dr. Houston remarked on the timeliness of the 2025 premiere: In 1925, Elbert Frank Cox became the first African American — and first Black person in the world — to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics. Of his own journey, and that of many Black mathematicians, Dr. Houston said that with exposure, experience and opportunity, “we can do as well as any mathematician in earning a Ph.D. and beyond.”</p><p>The last of the talks wound down that evening. By 3 a.m. the next morning, as some attendees headed to the airport, two mathematicians were just heading to bed, but not before riding the elevator down to the hotel lobby to ask reception for a late checkout.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>D</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Numbers Reveal Their Beauty In Music and Art<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
