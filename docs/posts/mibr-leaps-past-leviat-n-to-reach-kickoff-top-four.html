    <h1>MIBR leaps past Leviatán to reach Kickoff top four</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>With a 2-1 win, MIBR has eliminated Leviatán from Kickoff Americas. Now in the top four, they will next play against the winner of today&#39;s second elimination match, KRÜ Esports vs. LOUD. The loss means Leviatán will not earn Championship points, and will return to the server until the conclusion of Masters: Bangkok.</p>

<p>The series began on Leviatán&#39;s selection, Lotus, which they took 13-7. MIBR bounced back on Pearl, a counter pick against Leviatán, which paid off with a 13-9. The decider went MIBR&#39;s way, with a 14-12 victory propelling them to a historic top four at Kickoff Americas.</p>
