Treaty.</p><p>While there are different versions of the Tomahawk, they can generally reach targets about 1,000 miles away while carrying a conventional warhead with the explosive power of about 400 pounds of TNT, or a small thermonuclear device tens of thousands of times more powerful.</p><p>Unlike high-flying ballistic missiles, cruise missiles like the Tomahawk have small wings that allow them to fly horizontally low to the ground and use small jet engines to reach distances more than five times farther than ATACMS.</p><p>As of yet, there has been no public discussion of providing Tomahawks to Ukraine, but the Pentagon has a smaller and more stealthy air-launched cruise missile under consideration.</p><p>It is called JASSM, pronounced “jazz ’em,” for Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile.
