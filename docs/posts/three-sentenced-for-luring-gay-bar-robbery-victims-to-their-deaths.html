It was just after 3 a.m.</p><p>About an hour later, the taxi driver reported to the police that Mr. Ramirez was alone and abandoned in the back of his cab. Mr. Ramirez’s bank account had been drained, and his wallet, phone and ID stolen. The men had given him a fatal cocktail of drugs before leaving him for dead.</p><p>A month later, John Umberger died in an Upper East Side townhouse following an encounter with the men at another bar. After withdrawing more than $20,000 from Mr. Umberger’s accounts, the defendants posed for pictures, toasted next to his unconscious body and lounged on his balcony with drinks.</p><p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/nyregion/gay-bay-murder-charges.html" title="">men convicted of murder in February</a> for drugging, robbing and ultimately luring Mr. Ramirez and Mr. Umberger to their deaths were sentenced.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Jayqwan Hamilton, 37, Robert DeMaio, 36, and Jacob Barroso, 32, were all convicted of murder, robbery and conspiracy in the murder of Mr. Ramirez.</p><p>Mr. Hamilton and Mr. DeMaio, who were also convicted of burglary and murder in the death of Mr. Umberger, received 40 years to life in prison. Mr. Barroso, who faced charges only in Mr. Ramirez’s death, received a lighter sentence of 20 years to life.</p><p>Judge Felicia A. Mennin said that she had considered the defense lawyers’ arguments, particularly a plea to consider Mr. DeMaio’s difficult upbringing and lack of parental role models. But, she said, the defendants had spent the stolen money on high living and luxury goods. The victims’ lives, she said, had been less important to them than “some fancy shoes and some fancy boots.”</p><p>Allowed to address the defendants, Carlos Ramirez, Mr. Ramirez’s brother, asked them what it felt like “to know your name will never be remembered with honor, only with disgrace.”</p><p>Through an interpreter, Mr. Ramirez’s mother, Ana, wondered whether her son had been scared or had even known what was happening during the last moments of his life. Mr. Ramirez’s father, Julio, stood silently, his arm around her waist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Umberger’s mother, Linda Clary, paused during her statement for a spell of silence that she said reflected the recording the defendants had made in her son’s apartment.</p><p>“I would like to pause for 13 seconds to acknowledge the video that was made while my son died, and you did nothing to help,” she said, addressing the defendants.</p><p>All three defendants had faced sentences as long as life in prison for what prosecutors described as a “deadly hustle.” The three carried out a practiced and calculated scheme that involved lurking outside bars in Hell’s Kitchen in Manhattan, said Meghan Hast, an assistant district attorney, during closing arguments.</p><p>On April 20, 2022, Mr. Ramirez, 25, a social worker, was out for drinks at the Ritz Bar &amp; Lounge on West 46th Street with a friend, Carlos Camacho. Mr. Camacho testified that the two friends had gotten separated and that he had assumed Mr. Ramirez had headed home. Instead, Mr. Ramirez got into a taxi with a group that included Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Barroso.</p><p>Mr. Umberger, 33, a political consultant, was visiting New York from Washington, D.C., in May of that year. He was last seen at the Q on West 48th Street — a bar three blocks from the Ritz — leaving with two men. Security camera footage captured the group getting into a car; prosecutors identified the two men in the video as Mr. Hamilton and Mr. DeMaio.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Prosecutors showed jurors photos of Mr. DeMaio posing and smiling next to Mr. Umberger’s incapacitated body in the townhouse where he was found. In another video, the camera panned to Mr. Hamilton, who was perched on the townhouse’s balcony, holding a drink, images that Judge Mennin said would “stay with me for the rest of my life.”</p><p>The police initially treated the two deaths as isolated events — street muggings followed by solitary overdoses.</p><p>But after Ms. Clary discovered that a large sum had been transferred out of her son’s accounts, she pushed the police to investigate further. Prodding by Ms. Clary and relatives of Mr. Ramirez prompted a homicide investigation.</p><p>Several men <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/03/nyregion/gay-men-roofie-attacks-deaths.html" title="">spoke to The New York Times</a> after surviving similar encounters. They described waking up with no recollection of the previous night, their bank accounts drained and their credit cards maxed out. When they awoke, some of the men said, they realized that someone had gained access to their phones using facial recognition technology while they were unconscious. Upon gaining access, the thieves had emptied their bank accounts and left them unconscious in their homes.</p><p>In several cases, men the victims didn’t recall meeting were captured on surveillance footage leading them out of the bars and into taxis or their apartments. The jury that convicted the three men heard from several of these victims during the trial.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>That jury also heard from medical examiners, who said they had determined that Mr. Umberger and Mr. Ramirez were both killed by a fentanyl-laced drug cocktail. Mr. DeMaio, text messages showed, was the one to procure the fentanyl.</p><p>The defendants and their supporters showed little remorse on Wednesday. Theatric yawns from the supporters punctuated the proceedings, the gallery bench vibrating as people squirmed and tapped their feet.</p><p>The judge allowed the defendants a chance to apologize directly.</p><p>Mr. DeMaio offered brief condolences to his victims’ families, prompting the judge to ask, “Is that it?”</p><p>Mr. Barroso declined to speak.</p><p>Mr. Hamilton, however, was defiant. “I maintain my innocence,” he said, adding that he planned to appeal. “My actions weren’t deadly at all.”</p><p>In a statement, Alvin L. Bragg, Manhattan’s district attorney, said that the defendants had “displayed a wanton disregard toward their victims.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“They left both men to die as they used their financial accounts to purchase clothes and sneakers, never once showing concern about the deadly consequences of their actions,” Mr. Bragg said.</p><p>As the defendants filed from the courtroom, Mr. Hamilton walked haltingly, trying to make eye contact with family and friends. Mr. Barroso, who had blown a kiss to a family member as he entered, struggled to stand from his chair and was silent as he walked out.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
