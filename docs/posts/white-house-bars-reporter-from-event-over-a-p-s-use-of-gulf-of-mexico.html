Mr. Trump signed an executive order in front of reporters at the Oval Office on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/11/us/president-trump-news/trump-musk-oval-office" title="">calling on federal agencies to work with Mr. Musk’s cost-cutting effort</a>, called the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p>“It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish A.P. for its independent journalism,” Ms. Pace said. “Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.”</p><p>Eugene Daniels, the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, called on the Trump administration to “immediately change course.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The White House cannot dictate how news organizations report the news, nor should it penalize working journalists because it is unhappy with their editors’ decisions,” Mr. Daniels said in a statement. “The move by the administration to bar a reporter from The Associated Press from an official event open to news coverage today is unacceptable.”</p><p>The A.P. had issued editorial <a href="https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-style-guidance-on-gulf-of-mexico-mount-mckinley/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guidance</a> about the Gulf of Mexico on Jan. 23. In a post on its website, it said that the body of water had carried its name for more than 400 years and shared borders with both the U.S. and Mexico. Because Mr. Trump’s executive order only carried authority within the U.S. and had not been recognized by Mexico, the A.P. said it would refer to the Gulf of Mexico “by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the A.P. did update its stylebook to reflect Mr. Trump’s order to revert the name of Denali, a mountain in Alaska, back to Mt. McKinley.</p><p>Mr. Trump issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-names-that-honor-american-greatness/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> renaming the Gulf of Mexico on Jan. 20, part of his pledge to honor “American greatness.” He declared Feb. 9 “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/one-more-stop-on-a-busy-presidential-day-the-super-bowl.html" title="">Gulf of America Day</a>.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
