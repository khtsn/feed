    <h1>White House Bars Reporter From Event Over A.P.’s Use of ‘Gulf of Mexico’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Associated Press said on Tuesday that one of its reporters was barred from an Oval Office event because the outlet has continued to refer to the Gulf of Mexico by its original name.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-statement-on-oval-office-access/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, The A.P.’s executive editor, Julie Pace, said that they were informed by the White House that the news organization would not be allowed to attend the event if the outlet did not start using “Gulf of America,” the name President Trump decreed through an executive order in January. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in front of reporters at the Oval Office on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/11/us/president-trump-news/trump-musk-oval-office" title="">calling on federal agencies to work with Elon Musk’s cost-cutting effort</a>, called the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p>“It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish A.P. for its independent journalism,” Ms. Pace said. “Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.”</p><p>Eugene Daniels, the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, called on the Trump administration to “immediately change course.”</p></div></div>
