</span>, the Pacific region&#39;s Korean superteam. It looked easy at the start, with EDG dominating to seize a 10-0 lead in the first map. However, a punch back from T1 saw the Korean team threaten a reverse sweep.</p>

<p>The battle began with the map veto process. Both teams have been known to ban Abyss, and EDG as the higher-seeded team elected to give T1 the first pick, which they used to ban Abyss. EDG banned Lotus, T1&#39;s strongest map in 2025, leaving T1 to pick Split, and EDG to pick Bind. The decider, if necessary, was to be played on Pearl.</p>

<p>Split began dominantly for the world champions, who put the defending T1 on their heels. The Korean side moved away from the comp that saw <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span> on Chamber, instead putting him on Viper as part of a double-Controller, double-Duelist look that fielded no Sentinels.</p>

<p>With very little on the other side to slow them down, EDG cut through T1&#39;s defense like a hot knife through butter. T1 head coach <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/2504/autumn">
		Autumn	</a>
</span> was forced to use both of his timeouts in the first half, facing a 7-0 deficit. By the time T1 won their first round, EDG had amassed ten rounds, setting up for a 10-2 halftime score.</p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="4">

	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span> wipes it away.</em></p>

<p>A must-win pistol round saw T1 squander yet another man advantage, and a near-effortless anti-eco saw the Chinese giants reach match point. </p>

<p>After looking as good as dead just rounds before, moments of heroics extended T1&#39;s stay on the map. A <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/valorant/clip/RoundDiligentSeahorseFailFish-U44LL9eNyBT-_M-G" target="_blank">miraculous 1v5 ace</a> from <span data-ref-id="6">

	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span> put an end to that, ending the map 13-7.</p>

<p>CHICHOO, who has been at the forefront of EDG&#39;s hot form since the second half of 2024, ended the map with a server-high 1.86 rating. His star Duelist player <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> had a 1.48 rating and logged a game-high 24 kills. No player on T1&#39;s side had more than 15 kills.</p>

<p>T1 started the first half of Bind on defense, and the map turned out to be a tight one. For the entirety of the first half, neither team led by more than two rounds. That trend was snapped by T1 though, with a second pistol round of the map, anti-eco, and bonus round securing them a 10-5 lead.</p>

<p>T1&#39;s attack on Bind seemed as unstoppable as EDG&#39;s on Split. After losing ten straight rounds to open the first map, T1 rode eight straight to reach match point, dropping just one map in the second half en route to a 13-6 victory. </p>


<p><em>T1 empties the tank to force a third map.</em></p>

<p>Pearl was a map that both teams played in their last match. For EDG, they dropped the map in their 2-1 win over <span data-ref-id="10">

</span>, their first-ever win over their Korean foes. In 2025, T1 was 3-0 on the map.</p>

<p>The map played out similarly to Bind, with both teams trading thrifty rounds and staying within arm&#39;s reach of each other. It seemed as though T1 had figured out their attack side when they seized an 11-9 lead, but 11 was the most that they would get. </p>


<p><em>A CHICHOO 4K to reach match point.</em></p>

<p>Individual brilliance from CHICHOO and Sylvan carried their respective teams forward, but in the end, it was CHICHOO&#39;s Vandal that got his team over the line. CHICHOO finished with an unreal 32 kills in the map, doing the heavy lifting while Kangkang struggled. Sylvan&#39;s 25 kills were not enough for T1, as EDG won four straight to advance to the upper final.</p>

<p>CHICHOO ended the series on the top of the kill leaderboard with 72, while Sylvan&#39;s 52 was the next-best.</p>

<p>With the win, EDG will await the winner of the second <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/449009/team-vitality-vs-g2-esports-champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok-ubsf" target="_blank">upper semifinal match</a> between <span data-ref-id="12">
