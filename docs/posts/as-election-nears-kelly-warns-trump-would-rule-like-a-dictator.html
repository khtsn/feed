Trump than John F. Kelly, the former Marine general who was his longest-serving chief of staff.</p><p>With Election Day looming, Mr. Kelly — deeply bothered by Mr. Trump’s recent comments about employing the military against his domestic opponents — agreed to three on-the-record, recorded discussions with a reporter for The New York Times about the former president, providing some of his most wide-ranging comments yet about Mr. Trump’s fitness and character.</p><p>Mr. Kelly was homeland security secretary under Mr. Trump before moving to the White House in July 2017. He worked to carry out Mr. Trump’s agenda for nearly a year and a half. It was a tumultuous period in which he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/us/politics/kelly-trump.html" title="">drew internal criticism</a> over his own performance and grew disenchanted and distressed by conduct on the part of the president that he considered at times to be inappropriate and reflecting no understanding of the Constitution.</p><p>In the interviews, Mr. Kelly expanded on his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/politics/trump-despots-advisers-sound-alarm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously expressed concerns</a> and stressed that voters, in his view, should consider fitness and character when selecting a president, even more than a candidate’s stances on the issues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“In many cases, I would agree with some of his policies,” he said, stressing that as a former military officer he was not endorsing any candidate. “But again, it’s a very dangerous thing to have the wrong person elected to high office.<em>”</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump met the definition of a fascist.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He said that, in his opinion, Mr. Trump met the definition of a fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of law.</p><p>He discussed and confirmed <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/inside-the-war-between-trump-and-his-generals" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous reports</a> that Mr. Trump had made <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/06/donald-trump-hitler-michael-bender-book" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">admiring statements</a> about Hitler, had expressed contempt for disabled veterans and had characterized those who died on the battlefield for the United States as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“losers” and “suckers”</a> — comments first reported in 2020 by The Atlantic.</p><p>Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump’s campaign, assailed Mr. Kelly in a statement, calling Mr. Kelly’s accounts of his time in the White House “debunked stories” and saying Mr. Kelly had “beclowned” himself.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Here are excerpts from, and audio of, Mr. Kelly’s comments.</p><p><strong>Kelly said that based on his experience, Trump met the definition of a “fascist.”</strong></p><p>In response to a question about whether he thought Mr. Trump was a fascist, Mr. Kelly first read aloud a definition of fascism that he had found online.</p><p>“Well, looking at the definition of fascism: It’s a far-right authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="AudioBlock-7"><figure><figcaption><p><h3>Kelly on Trump and Fascism</h3></p></figcaption><div></div></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Kelly said that definition accurately described Mr. Trump.</p><p>“So certainly, in my experience, those are the kinds of things that he thinks would work better in terms of running America,” Mr. Kelly said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He added: “Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he’s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators — he has said that.

Mr. Trump nevertheless continued while in office to push the issue and claim that he did have the authority to take such actions, Mr. Kelly said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div

explain to the president that top government officials like himself had taken an oath to the Constitution and would place that oath over personal loyalty.</p><p>Mr. Kelly said Mr. Trump pressed him

beginning of the administration, he would talk about ‘his generals,’” Mr. Kelly said. “I don’t know why he thought that — but then a very big surprise for him was that we were — those of us who were former generals and certainly people still on active duty — that the commitment, the loyalty was to the Constitution, without question, without second thought.”</p><p>Mr. Kelly added: “That was a big surprise to him that the generals were not loyal to the boss, in this case him.”</p><p><strong>Trump told him that “Hitler did some good things.”</strong></p><p>Mr. Kelly confirmed previous reports that on more than one occasion Mr. Trump spoke positively of Hitler.</p><p>“He commented more than once that, ‘You know, Hitler did some good things, too,’” Mr. Kelly said Mr. Trump told him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="AudioBlock-32"><figure><figcaption><p><h3>Comments About Hitler</h3></p></figcaption><div></div></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>Mr. Kelly
