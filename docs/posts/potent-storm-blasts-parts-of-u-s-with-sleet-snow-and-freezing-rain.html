Southern Illinois and Indiana are predicted to receive a few inches of sleet and freezing rain.</p><p>In Ohio, where the storm was expected to lurch into hilly areas in the southeast part of the state, thousands of miles of roads had been treated with salt by Saturday, said Matt Bruning, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation.</p><p>The state expected to deploy more than 1,000 snowplows at the height of the storm, he said. Clear, sunny weather was helping Ohio in its preparations on Saturday.</p><p>“Now, it’s just waiting for Mother Nature to bring whatever she brings,” Mr. Bruning said.</p><p>To the south of the band of heavy snow, a stripe of freezing rain is predicted to fall from central Kansas into the central Appalachians through Monday, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Some regions may see ice accumulations exceeding half an inch.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“That rain will freeze on contact and turn to glazing — that’s what sticks to the trees, power lines, roads, cars, car windows, everything,” said Rich Bann, a meteorologist with the Prediction Center.</p><p>After crossing the central Appalachian Mountains, most likely early on Monday morning, the system will move into the Mid-Atlantic.</p><p>Rain and thunderstorms are also expected to affect parts of the lower Mississippi Valley, from eastern Texas to Mississippi, throughout Sunday afternoon and evening. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a risk level of three — out of five — for severe thunderstorms in parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The main concerns include damaging wind gusts, tornadoes and hail.</p><p>By daybreak Monday, snow will be falling across a large part of the Mid-Atlantic region, including Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, and it is expected to continue through the day.</p><p>Baltimore is forecast to get four to nine inches of snow and Washington five to nine inches.</p><p>If the system shifts slightly north or south, the totals could go up or down “quite significantly in either direction,” said Kevin Rodriguez, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>By Tuesday, the snow will have ended in the Mid-Atlantic, although some light snow may linger over the central Appalachians. Cold, gusty weather is forecast through the week, with afternoon highs in the 30s in the capital, and overnight lows in the 20s. “It’s going to be pretty cold for a good part of the week,” said Mr. Oravec of the Weather Prediction Center. From the eastern Rockies to the East Coast, temperatures will be about 10 to 12 degrees below the seasonal average.</p><p>“The snow on the ground that falls, it’s not going to go anywhere because it will be so cold,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “You’ll have snow on the ground all week.”</p><p>Yan Zhuang<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nazaneen Ghaffar<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-16"></div></section><div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/weather/winter-storm-forecast-snow-ice.html">0</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/weather/winter-storm-forecast-snow-ice.html">0</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
