Less than 24 hours after Mr. Trump floated the plan, top administration officials sought to soften it.</p><div><p>Speaking to reporters in Guatemala, Secretary of State Marco Rubio twice suggested that Mr. Trump was only proposing to clear out and rebuild Gaza, not claim indefinite possession of the territory. Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East, told Republican senators at a closed-door luncheon that Mr. Trump “doesn’t want to put any U.S. troops on the ground, and he doesn’t want to spend any U.S. dollars at all” on Gaza, according to Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri.</p><p>And at the White House, the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said “the president has not committed to putting boots on the ground in Gaza,” though she did not specify how the United States could take control of the territory without using military force.</p><p>The Gaza proposal, which Mr. Trump unveiled on Tuesday during a visit by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to the White House, upended decades of international diplomacy and opened a geopolitical Pandora’s box with far-reaching implications for the Middle East. Most immediately, it <a href="#trumps-gaza-proposal-comes-as-israel-and-hamas-prepare-to-hold-more-cease-fire-talks" title="">complicated talks about extending a fragile cease-fire</a> between Israel and Hamas; placed Egypt and Jordan <a href="#egypt-jordan-gaza-trump" title="">in an impossible position</a>; and threatened the U.S. ambition for normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/saudi-arabia-palestine-trump-gaza.html?smid=url-share" title="">Saudi Arabia</a>.</p><p>In a statement issued before 4 a.m. local time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/saudi-arabia-palestine-trump-gaza.html" title="">Saudi Arabia expressed its “unequivocal rejection”</a> of attempts to displace Palestinians and reiterated that it would not establish diplomatic ties with Israel in the absence of an independent Palestinian state. Egypt’s foreign ministry said that aid and recovery programs for Gaza would have to begin “without the Palestinians leaving.” And King Abdullah II of Jordan, in a meeting with the head of the Palestinian Authority on Wednesday, rejected any attempt to displace Palestinians and annex their land.</p><p>Gaza has been devastated by the war between Israel and Hamas, which was set off by the militant group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Speaking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-gaza-netanyahu-takeover.html" title="">alongside Mr. Netanyahu</a> at the White House on Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump described Gaza as “a demolition site” that the United States would rebuild into “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-gaza-strip-netanyahu.html" title="">the Riviera of the Middle East</a>.”</p><p>Hamas has ruled in Gaza for most of the past two decades and has begun <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israel-cease-fire.html" title="">re-establishing control</a> there since a cease-fire took effect last month. The group immediately rejected the idea of a mass relocation of the territory’s population, a politically explosive proposal in a region with a long and bloody history of forced displacement.</p><p>Here is what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Against the law:</strong> Mr. Trump’s proposal would be <a href="#trump-gaza-takeover-illegal" title="">a severe violation of international law</a>, experts say. Forced deportation or transfer of a civilian population is defined as a violation of international humanitarian law, a war crime and a crime against humanity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza reaction: </strong>Palestinians in Gaza expressed <a href="#gaza-trump-takeover-palestinians" title="">a mixture of condemnation and confusion</a> over Mr. Trump’s comments. And while some residents rejected leaving Gaza under any circumstances, others said conditions were so unlivable after 15 months of Israeli bombardment that they would consider relocating.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israeli embrace:</strong> Far-right politicians in Israel welcomed Mr. Trump’s plan as unraveling decades of unwelcome orthodoxy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as raising the possibility of negating the militant threat in Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-plan.html?smid=url-share" title="">without creating a Palestinian state</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Around the world:</strong> Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/05/world/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump/international-reaction?smid=url-share" title="">brought together allies and adversaries</a> alike in opposition to his proposal, though some sought to strike a balance by not criticizing him directly.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMwMmFkZjA5LTgzY2YtNWQ3Ny1hYzA4LTg2ODMwMDYzNjI1ZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/05/world/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump#trump-gaza-middle-east" data-source-id="100000009972232"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-lipton"><img alt="Eric Lipton" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/multimedia/author-eric-lipton/author-eric-lipton-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/multimedia/author-eric-lipton/author-eric-lipton-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/multimedia/author-eric-lipton/author-eric-lipton-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-05T21:52:21.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 5, 2025, 4:52 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Trump Organization’s multiple projects in the Middle East include a deal to build a golf course and hotel in Oman, involving land owned by that country’s government.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrea DiCenzo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>As President Trump pushes a new plan to take control of Gaza and clear out an area that once was home to an estimated two million residents, he is advocating bringing the United States much more deeply into a region where his family has a growing collection of real-estate and business interests.</p><p>There is no part of the world as crucial to the growth of various Trump family business ventures as the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Israel, when the full portfolio of Mr. Trump as well as Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, are included. Here is a look at the family’s interests in the region and Mr. Trump’s proposal for Gaza.</p><div><h2 id="link-202a35e5">What Trump proposed for Gaza</h2><p>Mr. Trump declared on Tuesday that the United States should seize control of Gaza and permanently displace the entire Palestinian population of the devastated seaside enclave.</p><p>Mr. Trump suggested the resettlement of Palestinians would be akin to the New York real estate projects he built his career on. “If we could find the right piece of land, or numerous pieces of land, and build them some really nice places with plenty of money in the area, that’s for sure,” he said. “I think that would be a lot better than going back to Gaza.”</p><p>“Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land,” Mr. Trump added, “developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s aides on Wednesday <a href="#here-is-the-latest" title="">walked back some of his comments</a>, with the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, saying that “the president has not committed to putting boots on the ground in Gaza.”</p><h2 id="link-4aaa786c">Real estate in Oman, Saudi Arabia and Dubai</h2><p>The Middle East has in the past three years turned into the hottest spot for the Trump family in terms of new international real-estate deals. Most of these are so-called branding deals, which collectively earn the family tens of millions of dollars in fees in exchange for the right to use the name to help boost luxury condo, golf or hotel sales.</p><p>Recent agreements have been signed with a Saudi-based real estate company called <a href="https://www.daralarkan.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dar Al Arkan</a> to build high-rise luxury apartments, golf courses or hotels in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/us/politics/trump-real-estate-deal-oman.html" title="">Oman</a>, <a href="https://darglobal.co.uk/trump-tower-jeddah" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href="https://www.trump.com/media/dar-global-announces-third-collaboration-with-trump-organization-to-launch-iconic-trump-tower-dubai-in-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dubai</a>.</p><p>“We are delighted to strengthen our ongoing relationship with the Trump Organization,” Ziad El Chaar, an executive with Dar Al Arkan’s subsidiary, said last year, in announcing one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/trump-organization-saudi-arabia-tower.html" title="">of the deals</a>.</p><p>The project in Oman, which is the farthest along, involves the government of Oman itself, as it owns the land where the Trump golf course and hotel are being built.</p><p>Although the opening of the resort destination is still at least <a href="https://darglobal.co.uk/press/Dar-Global-sets-a-new-benchmark-in-luxury-hospitality-with-the-launch-of-the-500ml-Trump-International-Oman-in-AIDA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three years off</a>, the Trump Organization has already raked in at least $7.5 million from the Oman deal, financial reports from the <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2023-4-trump-financial-disclosure/6acf31d6716dfdb6/full.pdf#page=6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">past two</a> years <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/0a5c19fa284801c8/2a2a7cf0-full.pdf#page=5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">show</a>.

Mr. Trump’s son Eric Trump has said he intends to wait until the war ends before moving ahead.</p><p>Even before this recent burst of new Middle East deals, the Trump family already had an outpost in the region. Trump International Golf Club, Dubai, opened in 2017, shortly after Mr. Trump started his first term in the White House.</p><p>The partner in this Dubai club is DAMAC Properties, run by <a href="http://www.hussainsajwani.com/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hussain Sajwani</a>, a billionaire real-estate executive who, Mr. Trump boasted in December, plans to invest billions of dollars in the United States to build data centers.</p><h2 id="link-24922a8f">A partnership with LIV Golf</h2><p>The Trump family also has been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/us/politics/trump-golf-saudi-arabia.html" title="">key partner to LIV Golf,</a> the upstart professional golf league financed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. In April, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/politics/liv-golf-tournament-trump-doral-resort.html" title="">for the fourth year in a row</a>, the league is slated to hold one of its tournaments at the Trump National Doral near Miami.</p><p>LIV Golf pays the Trump family to host the tournament, which also drives thousands of customers to its restaurants and hotel rooms during the weekend event, scheduled for April of this year. Mr. Trump and his family own more than a dozen golf courses worldwide, all of which benefit from the media attention that the Saudi-backed tournament brings.</p><p>Mr. Trump has long sought to attract these kinds of tournaments to his golf courses, but had at least one major event canceled after a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><h2 id="link-74976119">Jared Kushner’s investments</h2><p>The president’s son-in-law, Mr. Kushner, runs a private equity firm called Affinity Partners that has raised $4.5 billion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/us/politics/jared-kushner-affinity-partners.html" title="">mostly from sovereign wealth funds</a> of the oil-rich nations of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, based on relationships he built as an adviser to Mr. Trump during his first term.</p><p>Mr. Kushner, who has said he does not plan to return to the White House, also has invested in at least two Israel-based businesses: Phoenix Holdings, an insurance company, and the car leasing division of Shlomo Holdings.</p><p>Mr. Kushner’s business partner at Shlomo Holdings is also a partial owner of Israel’s only domestic builder of warships. That puts him in business with executives who are also major shareholders in an Israeli military contractor whose vessels <a href="https://videoidf.azureedge.net/38e0e6da-8a51-4417-b249-194f412928fb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been used</a> in the <a href="https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/node/61170" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">war in Gaza</a>, armed with American-made weapons.</p><p>It was Mr. Kushner who last year first floated the idea of considering Gaza as a potential real-estate development site. “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable,” Mr. Kushner said last year during an <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjS0cKSsK2LAxVqMlkFHewABLYQtwJ6BAgJEAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdtaIHr5S0ts&amp;usg=AOvVaw1izGGYHU59o-1mi9K37mND&amp;opi=89978449" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">event sponsored by Harvard’</a>s Kennedy School of Government, suggesting that Israel “move the people out and then clean it up.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="20" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzNkZjM0NWVjLWRkNzEtNTllYi04NmM5LTdkNWU0YjhmMDM2Yw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/05/world/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump#house-speaker-defends-trumps-gaza-plan-while-other-republicans-express-doubts" data-source-id="100000009971913"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni"><img alt="Ephrat Livni" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/robert-jimison"><img alt="Robert Jimison" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-05T20:51:49.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 5, 2025, 3:51 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Speaker Mike Johnson said President Trump’s plan for Gaza had surprised many people but suggested that it had been widely “cheered” around the world.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>President Trump’s proposal that the United States “take over” the Gaza Strip, displace about two million Palestinians and transform the war-torn enclave into “the Riviera of the Middle East” was lauded by some Republicans in Congress on Wednesday. But it appeared to shock others.</p><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, speaking at a news conference in Washington on Wednesday morning, said that the concept had surprised many people but suggested — despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/05/world/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump/international-reaction?smid=url-share" title="">plenty of evidence</a> <a href="#gaza-trump-takeover-palestinians" title="">to the contrary</a> — that it had been widely “cheered” around the world. Although the idea was swiftly met with rebukes from Arab and European nations, as well as residents of Gaza, Mr. Johnson argued that there was support for it “because that area is so dangerous.” </p><div><p>Mr. Trump made his bombshell statement at the White House on Tuesday, during a visit by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel — the first world leader the president has invited in his second term. Mr. Johnson noted the distinction offered to the Israeli leader and said it “is more than symbolism, but it is a symbol, and it shows the world that we’re not going to equivocate.” </p><p>Within hours, though, top Trump administration officials <a href="#trump-officials-walk-back-plan-to-take-over-gaza" title="">had begun trying to walk back</a> some of the most explosive elements of Mr. Trump’s proposal, arguing that he had not committed to using American troops or funds for the rebuilding of Gaza, and suggesting that any relocation of Palestinians would be temporary. </p><p>Mr. Johnson, who spoke before the Trump administration’s apparent damage control efforts, defended Mr. Trump’s original comments, urging people to wait until more details emerged before judging the plan.</p><p>The speaker accused the Biden administration of appeasing Iran and its proxies — which include Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen — by encumbering Israel with restrictions and praised Mr. Trump’s new “bold” approach. </p><p>He also suggested that people “withhold judgment on all of it” for the time being, promising “more developments” to come. Mr. Johnson is expected to meet with Mr. Netanyahu on Thursday. </p><p>But some Republican lawmakers, even as they praised the president, seemed stunned by his proposal, which would <a href="#trump-gaza-takeover-illegal" title="">appear to violate international law</a>, and questioned its viability.<span>   </span></p><p>“Donald Trump is a visionary, a builder,” Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said. “He sees a beachfront property and has big ideas and floats those ideas.” But, he added, “the impracticality of it, I think, is hard to miss.”</p><p>Mr. Cramer noted that the United States had no claim to Gaza but suggested that the president “floats these big ideas”<span>  </span>in order “to see what happens and see what shakes out.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas has allowed Palestinians to begin returning to the northern Gaza Strip, including the largely destroyed city of Jabaliya.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Similarly, Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, struck a conciliatory tone, saying that he understood the sentiments behind the proposal. Gaza has been decimated by more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas, a conflict ignited by the Oct. 7, 2023, attack Hamas led on Israel. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Rounds suggested reconstruction would be easier if the two million Palestinians living in Gaza went elsewhere. </p><p>“The question is, how do you go about rebuilding a place in the middle of a construction thing?” Mr. Rounds said. “So I understand as a real estate developer, the president saying, if you move them out of the way, we can move and expedite the stuff on it.”</p><p>Other Republican lawmakers, when questioned about the plan on Tuesday evening, grimaced about the comments and declined to respond. Those who did speak appeared skeptical, though they maintained a cautious tone and did not outright dismiss the proposal.<span>  </span></p><p>Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said that he did not “think it’s the best use of United States resources to spend a bunch of money in Gaza,” adding that he would prefer that money “be spent in the United States first.”</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the plan “might be problematic,” but pledged to “keep an open mind.” He added that the United States would “see what our Arab friends have to say about” the president’s proposal.</p><p>Arab nations swiftly <a href="#egypt-jordan-gaza-trump" title="">rejected the plan</a>, which would put some of them — notably Gaza’s neighbors Egypt and Jordan — in an impossible position. Egypt and Jordan are among the top recipients of American military aid but dare not risk alienating their populations by appearing complicit in what many see as ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.

There were mixed emotions — some people thought it was hilarious, some people were furious. But nobody saw this coming.”</p><p>Mr. Trump made his proposal during a White House news conference as he stood beside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/middleeast/icc-netanyahu-israel-gaza-war.html" title="">subject of an arrest warrant</a> issued by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>The plan was met with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/05/world/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump" title="">immediate opposition</a> from world leaders, who called it a breach of international law and a threat to regional stability in the Middle East. On Wednesday, the administration <a href="#trump-officials-walk-back-plan-to-take-over-gaza" title="">tried to walk back</a> elements of the proposal, saying that Mr. Trump had not committed to sending U.S. troops to Gaza and that any relocation of Palestinians would be temporary.</p><p>In interviews, many Palestinian Americans said the idea of expelling millions of people from the Gaza Strip and placing it under American control was horrifying and absurd, and also unsurprising, given the broader context of Middle Eastern history.</p><p>“There’s a long list of adjectives we could run through,” said Yousef Munayyer, the head of the Palestine-Israel Program at the Arab Center Washington D.C., a think tank, when asked for his thoughts on the proposal. “Outrageous, criminal, harebrained. How much time do you have?”</p><p>But he noted that the idea of forcing Palestinians from their homes was in no way new.</p><p>“The region has suffered for decades from instability and conflict precisely because of the mass ethnic cleansing of Palestinians during the creation of Israel in 1948,” said Mr. Munayyer, referring to the expulsion and flight of some 750,000 Palestinians from the land. “That’s not lost on anyone there in the region.”</p><p>Just over two weeks ago, Mr. Trump and President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were celebrating a long-sought cease-fire deal between Hamas and Israel that was negotiated by advisers to both administrations in the closing days of Mr. Biden’s term.</p><p>But on Wednesday, all of that seemed very far away. Many Palestinians in the United States said they felt a deep sense of foreboding about the effect Mr. Trump’s comments could have on the fragile peace deal, under which Hamas has released Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-says-talks-second-phase-gaza-ceasefire-deal-have-started-2025-02-04/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Negotiations</a> over the cease-fire’s second phase only began earlier in the day on Tuesday.</p><p>And those interviewed said they were shocked by the ways that Mr. Trump’s proposal seemed to rewrite the recent history of the war in Gaza, which began in 2023 after Hamas and other groups killed roughly 1,200 people and took 250 hostages during a surprise attack on Israel.</p><p>In the war that followed, Israel displaced almost two million people, destroyed Gaza’s civilian infrastructure and killed more than 47,000 people, according to local health officials, whose count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>Zahra Sakkejha, 35, a Palestinian Canadian health care worker who lives in Los Angeles, said that it was impossible to overstate how painful it was to hear people in power keep saying that the solution to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis was simply to remove the Palestinians.</p><p>“It just hits the core wound of every Palestinian about the Nakba,” she said, referring to the events of 1948. “We can never be recognized for just wanting to live our life where we are from.”</p><p>Her family is from Jaffa, which is now a neighborhood of Tel Aviv. She does peace-building work with Israeli allies through an organization called Standing Together, but said that proposals like Mr. Trump’s made that task harder.</p><p>“We’re human beings, we have lives, we have the same hopes and dreams as anyone else,” she said. “So that’s part of the frustration, is that anytime that there’s mention of us as a people, it’s always in the context of either we’re terrorists or we’re a problem. We are like cattle they have to move around.”</p><p>Noreen Rashid, 22, of Rockaway, N.J., said she had long feared that the United States or Israel might take over Gaza. The proposal has made her reflect sadly on her last visit to see her relatives there, just one month before the war began.</p><p>“I saw the last of it, and the best of it,” she said. “Now I’m thinking about when I have children, and it’s an out-of-body experience to know they will never know Gaza — that it’s all going to be Trump villas.”</p><p>Laila Elhaddad, an activist and author who spent part of her childhood in Gaza and now lives in Maryland, said that watching Mr. Trump describe the removal of Palestinians from the “hellhole” of Gaza felt like stepping into “bizarro world.”</p><p>“The way Trump was speaking, it was like Palestinians in Gaza existed in a vacuum, when the person responsible for their suffering was standing there smirking to his left,” she said of Mr. Netanyahu. “They were acting like Gaza had the misfortune to be hit by some natural disaster.”</p><p>Before Mr. Netanyahu’s arrival, Ms. Elhaddad was part of a <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/home/press-center/press-releases/netanyahu-visits-us-palestinian-americans-call-doj-enforce-icc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legal action</a> by the Center for Constitutional Rights that called on the Justice Department to enforce the I.C.C. arrest warrant issued against the Israeli prime minister in November for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. The department did not enforce the warrant, and Ms. Elhaddad said she had not expected it to do so.</p><p>“Netanyahu said clearly at the beginning of the war that the goal was to make Gaza uninhabitable, and they destroyed anything that sustains life — the infrastructure, the schools and universities, the fishing fleets,” said Ms. Elhaddad. “So now is Trump proposing that he will finish their plans for them?”</p><p>That was also a fear for Taher Herzallah, 35, a graduate student in Minnesota. He said he “almost burst into laughter” when he heard the news of Mr. Trump’s proposal on Tuesday night because, he said, “it’s all one giant absurdity.”</p><p>But that sense of ridiculousness was tempered by darker feelings a day later.</p><p>Mr. Herzallah said he believed that the proposal amounted to an “ethnic cleansing” of the Gaza Strip, where he has already lost 33 family members during the war.</p><p>The announcement of the cease-fire provided his relatives with a brief moment of guarded optimism, he said. But that was extinguished on Tuesday.</p><p>“I feel a deep sense of dread of what’s to come,” he said. “My family has suffered unimaginable, unimaginable pain.”</p><p>Community leaders in Dearborn, Mich., a town whose largely Arab population has made it a frequent bellwether of Arab-American politics and popular opinion, said many residents were in a state of shock after Mr. Trump’s remarks. </p><p>But Mohamed Baja, a Trump supporter who works as the chef at a local restaurant, said maybe the president’s proposal could work out. “This violence has been going on for 60-70 years,” he said. “So maybe this one time things could work out. Maybe a couple of countries will take” Gaza’s inhabitants.</p><p>But, he added, he immigrated to the United States from Lebanon and is not Palestinian. </p><p>“It’s up to Gaza, not to me,” he said. “It’s not my land.”</p><p>Ernesto Londoño<!-- -->, <!-- -->Katherine Rosman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Sharon Otterman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Mary Chapman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMWYzYmE5YWYtMzU5Zi01N2VlLWIzMmQtNDAwYmRkMmUxMzY0"><div id="1f3ba9af-359f-57ee-b32d-400bdd2e1364" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/05/world/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump#1f3ba9af-359f-57ee-b32d-400bdd2e1364"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farnaz-fassihi"><img alt="Farnaz Fassihi" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-05T20:38:59.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 5, 2025, 3:38 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Riyadh Mansour, the Palestinian representative to the U.N., said that Gaza was a precious part of a state of Palestine. “We are not going to leave Gaza,” he told a U.N. committee on safeguarding Palestinian rights. “There is no power on earth that can remove the Palestinian people from our ancestral homeland, including Gaza.” </p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZDhkOWZmZGEtYTkyMi01MDVmLWEyNGItODg3YmZjZWQ4NTU3"><div id="d8d9ffda-a922-505f-a24b-887bfced8557" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/05/world/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump#d8d9ffda-a922-505f-a24b-887bfced8557"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farnaz-fassihi"><img alt="Farnaz Fassihi" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-05T20:33:35.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 5, 2025, 3:33 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, spoke carefully in his first public comments on President Trump’s Gaza plan, which Trump unveiled shortly after signing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-united-nations-unrwa.html" title="">an executive order</a> calling for a general review of U.S. funding and involvement in the United Nations. </p><p>“In the search for solutions, we must not make the problem worse,” Guterres said at an annual gathering of a U.N. committee that safeguards Palestinian rights. “It is vital to stay true to the bedrock of international law.

Politicians and activists traded attacks and fought over whether this vision squared with Mr. Trump’s “America First” brand, which has always revolved around his promise to extricate the nation from foreign wars.</p><p>From the right, Mr. Trump received perhaps the sharpest Republican pushback of his nascent presidency, which has so far been defined by his party’s complete fealty to him. Some anti-interventionist lawmakers like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky <a href="https://x.com/RandPaul/status/1887114985383367065" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bristled at the idea</a>.

She did not specify how the United States could take control of Gaza without military force, though she said Mr. Trump would be meeting with other leaders in the region to discuss next steps. </p><p>She also said that any displacement of Palestinians would be temporary. Mr. Trump had said he viewed the United States as taking “a long-term ownership position” in Gaza and that Gaza would become a place “not for a specific group of people but for everybody.”</p><p>Ms. Leavitt said: “The president has made it clear that they need to be temporarily relocated out of Gaza for the rebuilding of this effort. Again, it’s a demolition site right now. It’s not a livable place for any human being.

His suggestion that they could be moved to Egypt and Jordan was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/world/middleeast/arab-nations-reject-trump-evacuate-gaza.html" title="">rejected last week</a> by those countries, along with a broad group of Arab nations.</p><p>On Tuesday evening, the president went even further. Speaking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-gaza-netanyahu-takeover.html" title="">alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> of Israel at the White House, Mr. Trump said the United States intends to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-gaza-strip-netanyahu.html" title="">seize control of Gaza,</a> displace the Palestinian population living there and turn the devastated coastal enclave into “the Riviera of the Middle East.”</p><p>But he did not say how exactly he planned to do that — offering little detail on the logistics or extensive political maneuvering that would be required.<span>  </span></p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A hostage handover in Khan Younis on Saturday. “Our people in Gaza will not allow for these plans to come to pass,” Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, said in a statement.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-75b56f8f">Regional complexity</h2><p>A mass relocation of Gaza’s roughly two million inhabitants is a politically explosive idea in a region with a long and bloody history of forced resettlement.</p><p>While Mr. Trump framed the matter as a humanitarian imperative and an economic development opportunity, he effectively reopened a geopolitical Pandora’s box with far-reaching implications for the Middle East. Control over Gaza has been one of the major flash points of the Arab-Israeli conflict for decades — and to Palestinians and their allies, Mr. Trump’s proposal would constitute ethnic cleansing.</p><p>Many Gazans are descendants of Palestinians who were forced out of their homes during the wars surrounding Israel’s founding in 1948, a displacement that came to be known around the Arab world as the Nakba, or catastrophe. Now Mr. Trump is suggesting that they be displaced again — insisting that Palestinians would welcome it because “they’re living in hell” in Gaza.</p><p>“I would think they would be thrilled,” he said.</p><p>But the internationally backed Palestinian Authority rejected President Trump’s proposal, as did Hamas, which has ruled in Gaza for most of the past two decades and has begun <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israel-cease-fire.html" title="">re-establishing control</a> there since a cease-fire deal with Israel took effect last month. </p><p>“Our people in Gaza will not allow for these plans to come to pass,” Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, said in a statement. </p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On Tuesday night, during an appearance at the White House with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, President Trump asserted that the United States would take control of Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-48ca09b6">The cost</h2><p>Mr. Trump likened his idea about displacement to the New York real estate projects on which he built his career. “If we could find the right piece of land, or numerous pieces of land, and build them some really nice places with plenty of money in the area, that’s for sure,” he said. “I think that would be a lot better than going back to Gaza.”</p><p>Where that money would come from, however, remains to be seen. Mr. Trump suggested that other countries in the region could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-gaza-strip-netanyahu.html" title="">finance the resettlement</a>, but he offered no details.</p><p>He also did not say who would finance and build the gleaming and modern “Riviera” he was envisioning, either. Mr. Trump again suggested that other countries would pay for the reconstruction of Gaza — a project his Middle East envoy recently said would take 10 to 15 years — but also said he foresaw “a long-term ownership position,” without explaining what that meant.</p><p>The foreign ministry of Egypt, a key U.S. partner, said in a statement that aid and recovery programs for Gaza must begin “without the Palestinians leaving.” And King Abdullah II of Jordan on Wednesday rejected any attempt to displace Palestinians and annex their land, according to the Jordanian royal court.</p><h2 id="link-23f6cf52">The legality</h2><p>Mr. Trump left a number of other basic questions unanswered, like how a U.S. takeover of Gaza would be enacted, and whether the use of force would be required. He conceded that American troops might be necessary.</p><p>But experts say that his proposal would unquestionably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/05/world/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump" title="">violate international law</a>.</p><p>The Geneva Conventions — which both the United States and Israel have ratified — prohibit the forcible relocation of populations. Forced deportation or transfer of a civilian population is defined as a violation of international humanitarian law, a war crime and a crime against humanity.</p><p>It would be a further, severe violation for the United States to permanently take over the territory of Gaza, experts say. The specifics of that violation would depend partly on whether Palestine is considered a state, according to Marko Milanovic, a professor of international law at the University of Reading in England. The United Nations recognizes Palestine as a “permanent observer state” and 146 out of 193 U.N. member states recognize Palestinian statehood, but the United States does not. </p><p>The prohibition on one state annexing all or part of another state’s territory is one of the most <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4806600" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">important, foundational principles</a> of international law. “There’s a clear rule,” Professor Milanovic said. “You cannot conquer someone else’s territory.” </p><p>It is rare for states to violate that rule. When they have, as in the case of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the response has been widespread global condemnation.</p><p>That could help explain why, by Wednesday afternoon, the Trump administration appeared to be trying to soften some of the president’s more problematic suggestions. </p><p>Speaking to reporters in Guatemala City during a trip to Latin America, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Mr. Trump was only proposing to clear out and rebuild Gaza — not claim indefinite possession of the enclave. </p><p>“The only thing president Trump has done — very generously, in my view — is offer the United States’ willingness to step in, clear the debris, clean the place up from all the destruction,” Mr. Rubio said, so that “then people can move back in.” </p><p>It was an idea, Mr. Rubio added, that “people need to think about seriously.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off"

Militants could launch attacks at Israel from Egyptian soil, inviting Israeli retaliation, or be recruited into the local insurgency in Sinai that Egypt has battled for years. Jordan’s king has to reckon with a population that is more than half Palestinian, so to accept more such refugees could further raise tensions.</p><p>That refusal has been backed up by political independents and opposition figures in Egypt, along with mouthpieces for the country’s authoritarian government, underscoring how the Palestinian issue can unify even the bitterest political opponents there.</p><p>Khaled el-Balshy, the editor of one of the few remaining Egyptian media outlets that are not pro-government and the head of the national journalists’ union, issued a statement on Wednesday calling Mr. Trump’s proposal “a clear violation of human rights and international laws.”</p><p>Moustafa Bakry, a loudly pro-government member of Parliament, suggested, without giving specifics, that Egypt could repel the displacement with force. “Egypt can move forward with other measures, because the Egyptian military can never allow this,” he said in an interview on Wednesday.</p><p>But Mr. Trump has shown little regard for the two countries’ concerns, their sovereignty or the idea of Palestinian statehood.</p><p>“They say they’re not going to accept,” Mr. Trump said of Egypt and Jordan during an earlier meeting with Mr. Netanyahu in the Oval Office. “I say they will.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at the White House on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>If he presses ahead with his proposal, the president may have ways of bending them to his will. Egypt and Jordan are among the top recipients of American military aid; Mr. Trump has mentioned the funding in recent weeks, without publicly threatening to pull it over the Gaza issue. With Egypt’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/world/middleeast/egypt-economy-refugees.html" title="">economy in crisis</a>, the government is dependent on loans, including from the International Monetary Fund, in which the United States is the largest shareholder.</p><p>One reason the United States has given billions of dollars to Egypt and Jordan over the years is their special status as the first Arab countries to agree to peace treaties with Israel. The United States brokered those agreements after years of conflict, seeing them as key to the security of Israel. The arrangements have long been viewed as foundational to Middle East stability.</p><p>Egypt has cooperated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/world/middleeast/israel-airstrikes-sinai-egypt.html" title="">closely with Israel on security</a> in its restive Sinai Peninsula, which borders both Gaza and Israel. But while Egypt and Jordan are on speaking terms, and sometimes more, with Israel, their populations have never stopped seeing Israel as an enemy, especially after its most recent assault on Gaza.</p><p>Analysts say the incentives of keeping U.S. aid, which makes up a limited portion of each country’s budget, are minor compared to their fears of alienating their populations by appearing complicit in what many see as ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. Though the rulers of both countries frequently brook little dissent, often using repression to silence internal criticism, analysts say they cannot afford to ignore public opinion.</p><p>“It’s no joke going up against Trump, particularly for Egypt and Jordan,” said Paul Salem, the vice president for international engagement at the Middle East Institute in Washington. But since “this would really be a bridge way too far for much of public opinion,” he added, “there is no other option for an Arab leader. I don’t see what else they could do.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The northern Gaza city of Jabaliya, seen on Tuesday, was a regular target of Israeli airstrikes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>For President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, the issue is particularly sensitive because he has tried to rally public support by painting himself as a champion of the Palestinians. Popular discontent over rampant inflation and government mismanagement had been growing before the war in Gaza began in October 2023, which allowed Mr. el-Sisi to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/world/middleeast/egypt-election-gaza-war.html" title="">regain some popularity</a> with strong denunciations of Israel and promises to stand by the Palestinians.</p><p>But the shine wore off as the war went on and Egyptian social media swirled with reports of signs that Egypt’s leaders was cooperating with Israel. The government has arrested dozens of Egyptians who were protesting Israeli actions.</p><p>Mr. el-Sisi and his allies have tried to counteract the discontent, with Egyptian pro-government media frequently trumpeting Egypt’s role in delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza and pro-government politicians congratulating Mr. el-Sisi on personally brokering the recent cease-fire agreement. (Egypt served as one of the mediators on the deal, along with Qatar and the United States.)</p><p>Allowing Palestinian displacement into Egypt would “wreck the narrative of ‘I’m defending the country,’” said Maged Mandour, an Egyptian political analyst.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nahla al-Bashti, a Palestinian who arrived in Egypt with her family from Gaza in December 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fatma Fahmy for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Egypt also sees the possibility of Palestinians settling en masse in Egypt as a serious security threat, government officials, diplomats and analysts say.

Cairo has spent years trying to quash political Islamism and an insurgency at home.</p><p>Jordan, with its far smaller population — including many people of Palestinian descent — is perhaps even more vulnerable. Jordan’s monarchy has also had a tense history with militant Palestinian factions.</p><p>Far-right Israelis have long talked of Jordan as the place where Palestinians forced out of Gaza and the West Bank should make their homes, raising fears in Jordan that if people from Gaza are forced out, Israel would next turn to the West Bank.</p><p>Many, if not all, would likely be forced to go next door to Jordan, which is already unsettled by tensions between citizens who are of Palestinian descent and those who are not, analysts say.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jordanian soldiers loading aid boxes to be sent to the Gaza Strip, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Khalil Mazraawi/Agence France-Presse,</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Yet analysts said Israel’s hard-line government appeared so confident of U.S. support for its actions that it may be willing to destabilize relations with its neighbors.</p><p>But relying on U.S. backing to push through its ambitions over the strenuous objections of its neighbors will not be sustainable in the long run, said H.A.

But while some residents rejected leaving Gaza under any circumstances, others said conditions were so unlivable after 15 months of Israeli bombardment that they would consider relocating.</p><div><p>“I need to stay in my land — my life, my family and my memories are here,” said Mohammed Fares, 24, a resident of Gaza City who was displaced to the southern city of Khan Younis. “I have something in Gaza I can’t get anywhere else. I’ll stay, even through hell.”</p><p>Mr. Fares said he was staying at a relative’s home in Khan Younis because his family’s home in Gaza City had been destroyed and because there was little water available there.</p><p>About two million Palestinians remain in Gaza after a war that has reduced cities to rubble and killed tens of thousands of people. Israel waged a war against Hamas after the militant group led the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people.</p><p>Mr. Trump said that all Palestinians in Gaza should be moved to neighboring Arab countries such as Egypt and Jordan because of the devastation wrought by the war.</p><p>Palestinians blasted the notion of forced displacement, though some said they would be open to finding a more stable life outside Gaza.</p><p>“It’s unacceptable to expel people from their homes,” said Mukhlis al-Masri, 33, a resident of the northern town of Beit Hanoun displaced to Khan Younis. “But I never thought I would get to this place, where everything is a struggle.”</p><p>If he were able to move outside Gaza, Mr. al-Masri said, he would.</p><p>“Do I want to live through a tragedy for another 20 or 30 years?” he said. “Do I want to continue to live through hell? I can’t.”</p><p>Since a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas came into effect on Jan. 19, the entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza has surged but residents have said restoring a relative degree of normalcy still feels years away. The simplest of tasks before the war — charging a phone or bathing — have become daily ordeals.</p><p>In lieu of a shower, Mr. Mukhlis, his wife and their three sons lay a sheet of plastic across a classroom at a United Nations school and dump glasses of water on themselves, he said.</p><p>During the first eight months of the war, an estimated 100,000 people crossed into neighboring Egypt from Gaza, Diab al-Louh, the Palestinian ambassador to Egypt, said last year. While some of those people have stayed in Egypt, others have moved to other parts of the Arab world, sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and the United States.</p><p>But since Israel invaded Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, in May, almost all Palestinians have been barred from exiting the territory.</p><p>On Saturday, the first wounded and sick people passed through the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza in nearly nine months. But only a small number were permitted to leave.</p><p>Mohammed Abu Teir, 47, a father of five, said he had planned to sell his car, rent his home and move away from Gaza for years. But Mr. Trump’s statements had persuaded him to give up on those plans, he added.</p><p>“I refuse to leave,” he said. “I will live here, and I will be buried here. They talk about us as if we don’t exist, as if we can just be moved like pieces on a chessboard.

Those talks were set to begin this week, 16 days after the agreement went into effect in late January.</p><div><p>Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Mideast envoy, told reporters on Tuesday that he was set to meet Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, in Florida on Thursday afternoon for further talks toward a permanent truce. Qatar and Egypt, alongside the United States, have been mediating negotiations between Israel and Hamas.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s remarks have now landed square in the middle of those sensitive negotiations. Analysts say it is far from certain that Israel and Hamas will advance from the initial six-week cease-fire — “phase one” — to the permanent truce — “phase two.”</p><p>The talks revolve around what terms would allow Israel to declare a permanent end to its war against Hamas and a full withdrawal from Gaza, including who will govern the enclave. In exchange, Hamas would release the remaining living hostages it has held since the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel that set off the war in Gaza.</p><p>Israeli leaders have said they will not countenance Hamas rule in Gaza. Hamas has shown some willingness to abdicate responsibility for governing civil affairs in the enclave, but its leaders have said they will not cede military control there by disbanding the group’s armed wing.</p><p>Under Mr. Trump, the United States now appears to be throwing its weight behind an almost unheard-of and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-plan.html" title="">unworkable</a> idea: moving the roughly two million Palestinians remaining in Gaza to neighboring countries and rebuilding the enclave under American control. Hamas has already rejected that proposal as a non-starter.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who stood alongside Mr. Trump when he announced his proposition for Gaza at the White House, said in a statement on Tuesday that he would convene the country’s security cabinet — a small group of senior ministers — to discuss Israel’s position in the “phase two” talks upon his return from Washington.</p><p>On Saturday, Hamas is expected to release the next group of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians jailed by Israel. The two sides have conducted four hostage-for-prisoner swaps so far, prompting emotional scenes among both Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>Hamas condemned Mr. Trump’s remarks but gave no indication that they would derail the upcoming exchange. The group is on Friday scheduled to announce the names of the next three hostages slated for release, after which Palestinian officials will receive a list of prisoners who will be freed from Israeli jails the next day.</p><p>Hamas is set to release at least 33 hostages as part of the first phase of the agreement with Israel, which the group’s leaders hope will lead to an end to the war in Gaza and leave them in power in the enclave they have ruled for the better part of two decades.</p><p>But if Israel and the United States move ahead with Mr. Trump’s ambitious plans — which would appear to leave no room for Hamas rule — that could lead the Palestinian militants to delay releasing further hostages as leverage, said Michael Milshtein, a former senior Israeli military intelligence official.</p><p>“We could see snares in the first phase — and we might never reach the second phase at all,” Mr. Milshtein said.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2IzMWVkOWU5LWJkMjMtNTI1Mi1hNGM4LTljYjcxNzg1OTM5Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/05/world/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump#trump-gaza-takeover-illegal" data-source-id="100000009970857"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/amanda-taub"><img alt="Amanda Taub" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/16/reader-center/author-amanda-taub/author-amanda-taub-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/16/reader-center/author-amanda-taub/author-amanda-taub-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/16/reader-center/author-amanda-taub/author-amanda-taub-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-05T12:50:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 5, 2025, 7:50 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians making tea near the rubble of their destroyed house in Jabaliya in northern Gaza last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Osama Al-Arabid/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>President Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-gaza-strip-netanyahu.html" title="">proposal</a> for the United States to take over Gaza, transfer its population to Egypt and Jordan and redevelop it into the “Riviera of the Middle East” would unquestionably be a severe violation of international law, experts say.</p><p>Forced deportation or transfer of a civilian population is a violation of international humanitarian law, a war crime and a crime against humanity. The <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v1/rule129" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prohibition</a> against forced deportations of civilians has been a part of the law of war since the Lieber Code, a set of rules on the conduct of hostilities, was promulgated by Union forces during the U.S. Civil War. It is prohibited by multiple provisions of the Geneva Conventions, and the Nuremberg Tribunal after World War II defined it as a war crime.</p><div><p>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court lists forcible population transfers as both a war crime and a crime against humanity. And if the displacement is focused on a particular group based on their ethnic, religious or national identity, then it is also persecution — an additional crime. (Because Palestine is a party to the International Criminal Court, the court has jurisdiction over those crimes if they take place within Gaza, even if they are committed by citizens of the United States, which is not a member of the court.)</p><p>When Mr. Trump was asked how much of Gaza’s population he wanted to move, he said, “all of them,” adding, “I would think that they would be thrilled.” And when he was pressed on whether he would force them to go even if they did not want to, Mr. Trump said, “I don’t think they’re going to tell me no.”</p><p>Janina Dill, the co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, said in a statement that forcing Gazans to leave would be a crime: “The scale of such an undertaking, the level of coercion and force required, hence the gravity, make this a straightforward crime against humanity.”</p><p>It would be a further, severe violation for the United States to permanently take over the territory of Gaza. The specifics of that violation would depend partly on whether Palestine is considered a state, said Marko Milanovic, a professor of international law at the University of Reading in England. The United Nations recognizes Palestine as a permanent observer state, and 146 out of 193 U.N. member states recognize Palestinian statehood, but the United States does not.</p><p>The prohibition on one state annexing all or part of another state’s territory is one of the most <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4806600" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">important, foundational principles</a> of international law. “There’s a clear rule,” Professor Milanovic said. “You cannot conquer someone else’s territory.” It is rare for states to violate that rule, and when they have, as in the case of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the response has been widespread global condemnation.</p><p>Aggression, which the International Criminal Court defines as a state using force “against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations,” is also a crime. The court would not be able to prosecute Mr. Trump or other U.S. officials for that crime, because unlike with other war crimes, it can only prosecute aggression if it is committed by a citizen of a member state. But lack of jurisdiction would not mean that the conduct itself is legal.</p><p>And even if Gaza is not considered part of a state, U.S. annexation of the territory would still violate the civilian population’s right to self-determination. The International Court of Justice has ruled twice that the Palestinian people are entitled to that right within Gaza.</p><p>“If you take it without their consent, you’re violating their right to self-determination,” Professor Milanovic said. “There’s really no doubt about that.”</p><p>Mr. Trump seemed unconcerned with how his proposal might be viewed by the institutions that underpin the international legal system, and he has shown little interest in having the United States participate in those institutions. On <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-united-nations-unrwa.html" title="">Tuesday</a>, he signed an executive order calling for a general review of U.S. funding for and involvement in the United Nations, raising questions about the U.S. commitment to that global body. He also withdrew the United States from the U.N. Human Rights Council.</p><p>Even if Mr. Trump’s Gaza plan ultimately does not move forward, his attitude toward international law could have serious consequences for U.S. interests around the world, Professor Dill said.</p><p>“Trump is just casually making major international crimes into policy proposals,” she said. “He just normalizes violating, or proposing to violate, the absolute bedrock principles of international law.”</p><p>By appearing to disregard the value of those rules, Mr. Trump could send a message that he is not strongly committed to defending them in other contexts, such as a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, Professor Dill said.</p><p>“If we live in a world where conquest is normalized and the legal rule is simply set aside, we live in a completely different world, in a world that’s incredibly dangerous also for Americans,” she said.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
