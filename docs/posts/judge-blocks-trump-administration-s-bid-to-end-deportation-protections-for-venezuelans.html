    <h1>Judge Blocks Trump Administration’s Bid to End Deportation Protections for Venezuelans</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In February, the administration revoked an 18-month extension of T.P.S. protection for Venezuelans that was granted under the Biden administration, and it terminated T.P.S. for Venezuelans who initially registered for the status in 2023. It later partly voided another 18-month extension that the Biden administration had granted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/haitians-temporary-protected-status.html" title="">to Haitian immigrants</a>.</p><p>The actions would have terminated the initiative for nearly 350,000 people in early April, and for hundreds of thousands more later this year.</p><p>In a hearing this month, the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the actions — an immigrant advocacy organization and a group of Venezuelan T.P.S. holders — contended that Ms. Noem had violated administrative procedures and acted with racial bias when she moved to reverse extensions of the protections that had been granted under the Biden administration. Federal officials rebutted the allegations of discrimination and said that Ms. Noem had acted within her authority to protect the national interests of the United States.</p><p>In his ruling on Monday, Judge Chen said the government had failed “to identify any real countervailing harm” in continuing the program for Venezuelan T.P.S. holders. He said the plaintiffs had also demonstrated they were likely to succeed in showing that the actions taken by the Ms. Noem were “unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.”</p></div></div>
