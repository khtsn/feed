A hurricane watch was also issued from Acapulco to Tecpan de Galeana and Lazaro Cardenas to Punta San Telmo on Thursday.</p><p>A hurricane watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area within 12 hours as of Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>A tropical storm warning, which means that tropical storm conditions were expected somewhere within the warning area, was issued from Punta Maldonado to Acapulco and Lazaro Cardenas to Punta San Telmo, forecasters said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,” the center said.</p><p>The system had intensified from a tropical storm to a Category 3 hurricane on Monday, bringing winds of about 120 miles per hour as it struck land.</p><p>Forecasters tracked the storm as it fell apart over Mexico on Tuesday afternoon, but they had warned that flash flooding was possible in the south and southwestern parts of the country for several more days.</p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, the storm’s maximum sustained winds had increased to near 50 m.p.h., with higher gusts. The storm was expected to strengthen as it approached the coast of southern Mexico on Thursday.</p><p>Through Friday, the storm was expected to bring additional rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches and around 30 inches across the Mexican States of Guerrero, Oaxaca, coastal Chiapas and coastal Michoacán, forecasters said.</p><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/NHC_Pacific/status/1838961938858230175" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heavy rainfall will likely produce</a> “significant and catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides” along four states on Mexico’s coast, according to the center.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ahead of the storm, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico <a href="https://twitter.com/lopezobrador_/status/1838395942359437806" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had urged residents</a> in affected areas to “seek higher ground, protect yourselves and do not forget that life is the most important thing; material things can be replaced.”</p><p>By Tuesday morning, the storm had already dumped more than 10 inches of rain on parts of Guerrero and Oaxaca, two of the country’s poorest states, according to local authorities.</p><p>The storm’s most severe effects were felt in Guerrero, said Evelyn Salgado, the state’s governor. Two people were killed in their homes by a landslide in the municipality of Tlacoachistlahuaca. At least 60,000 people were without power after the storm struck, uprooting trees and blocking highways, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-john-mexico-pacific-b56193c39433fa96cd06d83ae2228157" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to The Associated Press.</a></p><p>A recent study showed that rapid intensification, as in the case of John, is now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/climate/hurricane-intensity-stronger-faster.html" title="">twice as likely</a>, at least for Atlantic hurricanes, partially because of human-caused climate change driven by the burning of fossil fuels.</p><p>John is the 10th named storm to form in the Eastern Pacific in 2024, and it is moving through the region at the same time as a powerful Atlantic storm, Hurricane Helene, is churning in the Gulf of Mexico on its way to a likely landfall in Florida on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The two storms are related in a way — they both originated from the same parent system, called the central American gyre, and it is a broad, widespread area of storms across Central America that has spun up both Helene and John. This same broad quality of the storm is what is going to make Helene such a large hurricane as it spins in the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida.</p><p>Judson Jones<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-8"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Johnny Diaz is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news from Miami.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/johnny-diaz">More about Johnny Diaz</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
