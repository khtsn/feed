But a World War II battle 80 years ago this month turned the Japanese island into a byword for desperate, deadly combat — and for American triumph.</p><p>On Feb. 23, 1945, a contingent of American Marines climbed to the top of Mount Suribachi, the highest point of Iwo Jima. Atop the rubble of war and volcanic eruption, they pitched forward and raised an American flag. A photographer for The Associated Press, Joe Rosenthal, snapped an image, indelible and iconic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-1"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">U.S. Navy, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>U.S. troops landed on Iwo Jima four days before they claimed Mount Suribachi.

He was a technical sergeant attached to the U.S. Marine Corps Fifth Division, a division that is no longer active in this more peaceful era. His job as a combat correspondent meant that he was to write about American valor and, hopefully, victory. But the conquest of Iwo Jima, despite the famous flag-raising four days into the battle, did not come for another month.</p></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">U.S. Air Force, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Air-to-air phosphorus bombing by Japanese bombers on a formation of U.S. bombers over Iwo Jima.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Advancing U.S. troops trying to establish the location of a Japanese machine-gun nest on a map so as to forward the information to attacking artillery or mortar units.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">U.S. Marine Corps</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Marines attacked some Japanese defenses blocking the path to Mount Suribachi with flamethrowers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On the day the Stars and Stripes were unfurled on Mount Suribachi — twice, for good measure — my father told me he was jammed in a foxhole, trying not to get killed by the Japanese, something that would eventually happen to one of his friends, and then another, and then another.</p></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-13"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">W.

Iwo Jima means “sulfur island” in Japanese, and the Japanese Imperial army had fortified its caves with tunnels and other defenses. The charred island smoldered. Its bluffs and beaches became a vast cemetery, volcanic ash and black sand burying the dead.</p></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-15"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">W.

Some died in a final banzai charge; others ended their own lives rather than surrender to the Americans.

Less than five months later, the Japanese emperor surrendered, ending an imperial march across Asia that cut short millions of lives. American bombs, both atomic and incendiary, had devastated Japan as well.</p><p>After the war was over, the United States built a military base on Iwo Jima. In 1968, the island was given back to Japan. The Japanese villagers who were evacuated in 1944, as the island geared up for the coming battle, never returned. In 2007, the island was officially renamed Iwo To, as it was known before the battle, using a different pronunciation of the word “island.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-25"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">U.S. Coast Guard</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>These Japanese prisoners of war, most of them captured on Iwo Jima, would eventually be sent to Pearl Harbor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>My father, like many veterans of that generation, did not talk much of World War II.
