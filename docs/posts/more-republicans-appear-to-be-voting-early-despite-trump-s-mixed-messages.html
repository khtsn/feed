Trump’s most loyal supporters to change their minds about voting early.</p><p>There is some evidence to suggest it’s working.</p><p>With polls opening on Tuesday in Wisconsin, some form of early voting has commenced in all seven of the swing states. As of Monday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/us/politics/2024-early-voting.html" title="">17 million people nationwide had already cast</a> a vote — and there are initial indications that Republicans are showing up to the polls or returning absentee ballots with more gusto than in recent years. In many cases, Republican officials and canvassers on the ground are spurring their voters on with the same debunked conspiracy theories about fraud that Mr. Trump has used to sow doubt about the integrity of the count.</p><p>“They have done a better job of turning out their voters to vote early,” said Sam Almy, a Democratic political strategist who tracks early ballots in Arizona. “I think they realized that early voting is easy and convenient: It turns out your voters quickly, and they don’t have to gamble on turning out all their voters on Election Day.”</p><p>It’s a remarkable turnabout from four years ago, when Mr. Trump had thoroughly demonized every method of voting that didn’t occur in person on Election Day. As states expanded access to mail and absentee voting at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr. Trump repeatedly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-ap-fact-check-elections-voting-fraud-and-irregularities-8c5db90960815f91f39fe115579570b4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discouraged his voters</a> from taking advantage. He said mail ballots created “chaos and confusion,” and asserted without evidence that it would lead to “election interference by foreign countries.” Many of his supporters believed him, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-absentee-voting-looked-like-in-all-50-states/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">won, buoyed by Democratic dominance</a> in early and mail votes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This year, Mr. Trump has offered a more muddled message on the various methods of voting while others in his party worked overtime to reverse course. The Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6363522806112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lara Trump now the co-chair,</a> poured resources into programs that would encourage Republican voters to submit ballots early. The former president himself <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-casts-ballot-early-florida-primary-early-voting/story?id=112834111" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voted early in the Florida Republican primary</a> over the summer.</p><p>Even so, Mr. Trump has kept up the attacks. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/trump-mail-in-voting/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Campaigning</a> in Pennsylvania last month, he called early voting “stupid stuff” — moments after telling rallygoers that they should “start right away.” Earlier this year, he called mail voting “totally corrupt” <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-casts-ballot-early-florida-primary-early-voting/story?id=112834111" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at a Michigan rally</a>. He told a <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/politics/us/donald-trump-interview-nigel-farage-in-full-watch-video" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">British interviewer in March</a> that mail-in ballots inevitably lead to “cheating.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Despite Republican efforts to encourage voters to turn out early, former President Donald J. Trump has continued his attacks on early and mail-in voting.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Not all states release early vote data broken down by partisanship, limiting the snapshot. But available data and experts who closely follow ballot returns see an uptick for Republicans in a few key places.</p><p>In Nevada, about 39.5 percent of the roughly 245,000 ballots <a href="https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showpublisheddocument/14868/638651398649807004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submitted</a> as of Monday evening came from Republicans, and 36.3 percent came from Democrats, according to the secretary of state’s latest tallies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Arizona ballot data compiled by Uplift, a Democratic group that Mr. Almy works for, and reviewed by the Times, suggested that Republican ballots surged in the initial days of early voting and have tapered off to a 2020 pace more recently. Democrats, though, are well behind their 2020 early voting pace, suggesting a realignment reminiscent of the pre-Trump era in Arizona, when the state was a Republican stronghold and G.O.P. mail voters outpaced Democrats in early returns. (Mr. Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since President Bill Clinton in 1996.)</p><p>“It’s kind of returning to where they were, of having this ballot advantage,” Mr. Almy said.</p><p>In both Nevada and Arizona, Republican officials have leaned on a message that “banking” votes early is the surest way of avoiding supposed chicanery in the ballot-counting process. Both states were prominent in Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.</p><p>At a rally on Saturday kicking off the first day of early voting in Nevada, Michael McDonald, the chairman of the state Republican Party, implored the crowd to encourage their friends and family to get to the polls as soon as possible.</p><p>“Go vote,” he said. “You got all this time to vote early. You can mail in ballots. You want to do it that way? That’s fine. Or you do it Election Day. Make a plan, execute that plan.”</p><p>“You got to vote early or the Democrats will steal it,” one attendee hollered.</p><p>That this message was coming from Mr. McDonald was particularly notable. In 2020, Republicans <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-campaign-nevada-republicans-sue-to-stop-clark-county-mail-vote-counting-until-proper-procedures-in-place" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tried and failed to get the courts</a> to stop election officials from counting mail ballots in Clark County before Election Day. He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/us/politics/nevada-trump-michael-mcdonald.html" title="">indicted by the state attorney general</a> last year as one of six Republicans who signed false certificates trying to award Nevada’s electoral votes in 2020 to Mr. Trump, even though Mr. Biden won the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Republicans have also changed their tune on so-called ballot harvesting, or the practice of a voter allowing someone else to return their ballot, which was first permitted in Nevada in 2020 and is legal in many states. The party has spent years arguing that the process is a recipe for fraud.</p><p>“Now you can ballot-harvest. That’s kind of against our principle, but the Democrats changed the rules, so the best thing to do is play by the rules,” Mr. McDonald told the crowd at a recent campaign rally in Reno, Nev., for Mr. Trump. “Make sure you harvest ballots. You get your neighbors’ ballots if they can’t go. You help them to the polls. You vote early.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Michael McDonald, the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, is facing trial in a case related to Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election that he lost.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bridget Bennett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Jon Ralston, the prominent Nevada political journalist and commentator, said it was highly unusual to see Republicans hold a lead at this point in early voting. Typically, he said, it is Democrats who bank an early advantage and must fight to stave off Election Day votes that skew Republican.</p><p>“These numbers are very good for Republicans,” Mr. Ralston said.</p><p>Still, Mr. Ralston said it was difficult to know whether that is a sign of unusually strong Republican momentum, or these are simply voters who would have normally voted on Election Day getting the process out of the way early.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Democrats have maintained confidence in their canvassing and turnout operations.</p><p>Local unions power this effort, knocking on doors and checking in with voters about whether they had submitted ballots. The Nevada chapter of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has committed to knocking on the doors of 70,000 union members in southern Nevada three times each on behalf of the Harris campaign and down-ballot Democrats. Canvassers from the Culinary Workers Local 226 began campaigning for Democrats in early August and expect to knock on 900,000 doors and talk to 130,000 voters by Election Day.</p><p>At a news conference last week, Daniele Monroe-Moreno, the chairwoman of Nevada’s Democratic Party, took aim at Mr. McDonald, whose trial as part of the fake elector scheme is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nevada-republicans-fake-electors-indictment-trump-750c73f864b951c6fc4063be77ffd0a3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected</a> to begin in January.</p><p>“It is my No. 1 priority that every Nevada voter have equitable access to the ballot box,” Ms. Monroe-Moreno said. “On the other side, Nevada Republicans are setting up an environment to amplify more falsehoods to deny election results.”</p><p>Republicans maintain that they dislike early voting — and Mr. Trump continues to promise to restrict it — but that they are simply playing within the system that has been set up. Mr. Trump’s past criticism of early voting, many believe, undermined Republicans’ pursuit of the White House. Karoline Leavitt, a Trump spokeswoman, said in a statement that the campaign wanted citizens to vote in whatever manner “works best for them.”</p><p>“Our aggressive political operation is leaving no stone unturned in reaching all supporters who prefer to vote early,” Ms. Leavitt added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who leads the group Turning Point Action, made encouraging early voting a priority for his organization <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/us/politics/trump-turning-point-action-chase-vote.html" title="">ever since he witnessed long lines and delays</a> at the polls in Arizona during the 2022 midterms. There, Mr. Kirk’s group has assumed a large chunk of the Republican turnout operation with a “chase the vote” program that is aimed at persuading low-propensity conservatives to vote and then helping them plan to return their ballots early.</p><p>On a recent day in the sweltering Phoenix suburbs, Turning Point staff fanned out to ring doorbells and ensure Republicans were voting early.</p><p>“I do appreciate the face-to-face,” said Anne Sterling, a Republican in Mesa, Ariz., who said the conversation with a Turning Point staff member was a good reminder to submit her ballot “because we’re busy, and we don’t take the time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Turning Point USA staff member canvassing in Gilbert, Ariz., this month.

In the past, she <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kari-lake-suggests-early-voting-restricted-arizona-repeats/story?id=91920284" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has criticized early voting</a>. A lawsuit she filed after losing her race for governor in 2022 was based in part on questioning the signature verification procedures for the same mail ballots she is now encouraging.</p><p>Gina Swoboda, the chairwoman of Arizona’s Republican Party, is another official who <a href="https://grandcanyontimes.com/stories/650691428-grand-canyon-times-podcast-gina-swoboda-on-arizona-election-integrity" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has cast doubt</a> on the integrity of mail-in and early voting, and called for the practice to be curtailed. Now, she, too, is urging voters to get their ballots in early.</p><p>“Don’t get jammed up, don’t have to wait on the line on Election Day — vote early,” Ms. Swoboda said in a video message that the state party posted on social media last week.</p><p>That is not to say that Republicans aren’t still divided on this issue. The Republican Party in Washoe County, Nevada’s second-largest, has advised voters in <a href="https://x.com/RealWashoeGOP/status/1848100502661128564" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media posts</a> to “opt out of mail-in voting.”</p><p>Before early voting started in the state on Saturday, Stavros Anthony, Nevada’s lieutenant governor and a Republican, said in an interview that he disliked the availability of mail-in voting and ballot harvesting. “Democrats will do whatever they can to disrupt our election process,” Mr. Anthony said.</p><p>Still, Mr. Anthony said he and his wife planned to vote in person on the first day polls were open.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kellen Browning is a Times reporter covering the 2024 election, with a focus on the swing states of Nevada and Arizona.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kellen-browning">More about Kellen Browning</a></span></p></div><div><p>Benjamin Oreskes is a reporter covering New York State politics and government for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benjamin-oreskes">More about Benjamin Oreskes</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/22/us/politics/trump-republicans-early-voting.html">85</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/22/us/politics/trump-republicans-early-voting.html">85</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
