How Mexico’s leaders, under President Claudia Sheinbaum, navigate this landscape will be pivotal, potentially setting the tone for North American diplomacy for years to come.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here are four things to know about how a newly elected Mr. Trump might reshape the United States’ relations with Mexico.</p><h2 id="link-175556a4">1. Trump has vowed to bolster border security and deport millions of undocumented migrants.</h2><p>Like his predecessor, Mr. Trump has big plans for remaking America’s immigration system. But their visions could not be more different.</p><p>Illegal crossings at the border are at their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/us/politics/immigration-illegal-border-crossings.html" title="">lowest levels</a> in more than four years. Still, Mr. Trump has said his government would hire 10,000 new agents to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border and proposed using some of the military’s budget for border security.</p><p>“We’ve seen what Trump does. What he is proposing is the 3.0 version of the same increased pressures on Mexico,” said Tonatiuh Guillén, a former head of Mexico’s National Migration Institute, adding that in 2019 Mr. Trump’s demands led Mexico to take a militarized approach to enforcement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“Mexico gave in to the pressures back then, and the question is whether Mexico will give in again,” Mr. Guillén added. “I think the likelihood it will is high.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Migrants are processed after being apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents on the U.S.-Mexico border in Sunland Park, New Mexico, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Ratje for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For the past two U.S. administrations, Mexico effectively turned into an extension of the White House’s border policies. It <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/opinion/international-world/mexico-migrants.html" title="">became the wall</a>, some analysts have said, that Mr. Trump vowed to build during his first term.</p><p>However, this election could lead the United States to enact new transit and entry bans, further tightening the border.</p><p>“Many immigrants would not be able to enter through regular pathways, as they are doing now, or they would be very quickly turned back from the United States,” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">vowed</a> to carry out the largest deportation program in U.S. history, targeting many of the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants living in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Undocumented migrants are most commonly from Mexico, accounting for about four million people. While a mass deportation program would face legal and logistical <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">challenges</a>, Raul Hinojosa, director of U.C.L.A.’s North American Integration and Development Center, said that there are growing concerns about the effect that the such deportations could have on Mexico.</p><p>If Mexican migrants are sent home, much of the money they send back to Mexico — $63 billion in 2023 — would plummet, depleting Mexico’s economy of one of its most important sources of income, Mr. Hinojosa said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>U.S. Border Patrol agents search for migrants trying to enter the United States from Mexico, in New Mexico, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mexico could also find itself pressured, as in the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/03/biden-mexico-migration-border-deportation-title-42" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">past</a>, to accept Venezuelans, Nicaraguans or Cubans, who are sometimes unable to be deported to their origin countries for diplomatic reasons.</p><p>Unemployment in Mexico would also increase, with many of the deportees in the suddenly larger labor force looking for jobs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We’re going to see deportees who are harder to reintegrate,” said Eunice Rendón, the coordinator of Migrant Agenda, a coalition of migrant advocacy groups.</p><p>Taken together, Mexico’s economy could be pushed into a sharp recession, according to a study by researchers from U.C.L.A., the Petersen Institute for International Economics and the U.S. Naval Academy.</p><h2 id="link-60916ee3">2. Trump has threatened up to 100 percent tariffs.</h2><p>Mr. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/07/business/economy/united-states-china-mexico-trade.html" title="">eclipsed</a> China to become the largest source of imports in the United States. At one of his last rallies, he vowed to immediately place 25 percent tariffs on all goods from Mexico unless the government halts the flow of migrants and drugs to the United States.</p><p>That could send shock waves across Mexico, which is exceptionally dependent on trade with the United States. Around 80 percent of its exports go to the American market, according to Capital Economics, a research firm based in London.</p><p>“Mexico now looks potentially like the most exposed major economy” to Trump tariffs, said William Jackson, Capital Economics’ chief emerging markets economist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Aerial view of trucks queuing next to the U.S.-Mexico border to cross to the United States from Tijuana, Mexico, in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guillermo Arias/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Trump has also threatened to impose 100 percent tariffs — or even 200 percent — on vehicles imported from Mexico. That could deal a staggering blow to an industry that exports nearly $90 billion of finished vehicles to the United States, accounting for about 5 percent of Mexico’s G.D.P.</p><p>But given how deeply connected production chains are between Mexico and the United States, a move like this would likely harm American companies and consumers as well.</p><p>“Trump calls himself ‘The Tariff Man,’” said Pedro Casas, the general director of the American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico. “If you put 25 percent tariffs on everything exported from Mexico today, you’ll cause an inflationary shock in the U.S. market. I mean, that is not viable.”</p><h2 id="link-2e1efc09">3. Trump has said he would use military force against Mexico’s drug cartels.</h2><p>During his previous term, Mr. Trump suggested shooting missiles into Mexico to take out drug labs. Other Republicans leaders have since embraced the idea of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/us/politics/trump-mexico-cartels-republican.html" title="">using U.S. military force against cartels</a> in Mexican territory — even without Mexico’s consent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/strikes-against-mexican-drug-cartels-absolutely-still-table-says-former-president-trump" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with Fox News in July, Mr. Trump was asked whether he was prepared to use military force against Mexican drug cartels. “Absolutely,” Mr. Trump said. “Mexico’s going to have to straighten it out really fast, or the answer is absolutely.”</p><p>Such a move would be “extremely damaging” for the U.S.-Mexico relationship, said Rebecca Bill Chavez, head of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based research institute. It could jeopardize all cooperation between the two countries, she said, including commercial ties, but also efforts to control the flow of U.S.-bound migrants and drugs, such as fentanyl.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Customs and Border Protection chemist inspects evidence bags of small blue pills, thought to be fentanyl, that someone attempted to smuggle from Tijuana through the Otay Mesa port of entry in Southern California, in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Meridith Kohut for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mexican officials have warned that violation of the country’s sovereignty will not be tolerated.</p><p>“We are a country that must be respected,” Roberto Velasco Álvarez, the top North American official in Mexico’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, told The New York Times last year. “We are not anyone’s colony or protectorate.”</p><p>Others caution that military strikes on cartels or targeted assassinations of their leaders may barely affect the drug flow into the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Time and again during the decades-long drug wars in Latin America, similar efforts actually opened the way for new suppliers to muscle into the drug trade — as Mexican cartels did in the 1990s when Colombian cartels were on the decline.</p><p>“Maybe you get some heads put on a post, or whatever the 21st-century equivalent of that would be,” said Christopher Fettweis, a political science professor at Tulane University. “It’s not going to actually stop drugs from coming in.</p><h2 id="link-531e59f">4. Mexico’s previous president had a good rapport with Trump. Sheinbaum will try to replicate this.</h2><p>Ms. Sheinbaum has repeatedly said that Mexico would collaborate with any U.S. leader, including Mr. Trump. “There is no reason to worry,” she told reporters on Wednesday morning. “There will be good relations with the United States, I am convinced of that.”</p><p>Earlier this week, Mr. Trump said at a rally in Raleigh, N.C., that he would inform her “on Day 1 or sooner” that if Mexico did not stop an “onslaught” of criminals and drugs, he would immediately impose tariffs.</p><p>Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Ms. Sheinbaum’s predecessor and mentor, also faced Mr. Trump’s promised tariffs. He diffused those threats by deploying Mexico’s armed forces to manage the flow of migrants. The informal agreement between Mr. López Obrador and Mr. Trump was that Mexico would manage migration issues, while the White House would refrain from interfering in Mexico’s domestic affairs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Claudia Sheinbaum speaks during a news conference after a meeting with business people from Mexico and the United States, in Mexico City, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Raquel Cunha/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The strategy worked for Mr. López Obrador — who shares a populist, larger-than-life personality with Mr. Trump — to the point that he boasted, on several occasions, how he had convinced Mr. Trump to moderate his decisions.</p><p>It is unclear whether Ms. Sheinbaum will have the same influence on Mr. Trump. But on her Tuesday news conference, she seemed to send a message for both Democrats and Republicans. “Sometimes they don’t have enough information,” she said, “about the effort that Mexico has made to reduce migration.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Simon Romero is a Times correspondent covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
