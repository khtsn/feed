The Navy’s top JAG, a three-star admiral, abruptly retired in December. His deputy, a two-star admiral, remains in place as the acting Navy JAG.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7302548446295597056/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post on LinkedIn</a> late Monday night, Matt Isler, a retired Air Force brigadier general who oversaw the combination of aerial surveillance, coalition air power and ground-based weapons in support of ground troops battling Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria, pushed back on the new Pentagon leadership’s decision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Some have recently argued that Defense Department efforts to mitigate civilian deaths in war inappropriately constrain U.S. forces,” he wrote. “This could not be farther from the truth.”</p><p>“Reducing risks of civilian harm focuses combat effects on the enemy, accelerates achievement of campaign objectives, preserves combat power, and protects warfighters,” he added.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth’s decision was heavily criticized by civilian harm protection advocates with whom the military worked in close consultation to develop policies.</p><p>“Repeal of these lifesaving policies would be a betrayal of the civilians who have borne the brunt of U.S. operations,” said Annie Shiel, the U.S. advocacy director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict. “It would also be a betrayal of the war fighters and veterans Secretary Hegseth says he stands for, who have themselves worked to ensure the U.S. can learn from the grave mistakes and lessons of past wars.”</p><p>Eliminating these programs could also halt efforts to provide redress and payments to civilian victims of U.S. combat operations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Joanna Naples-Mitchell, a human rights lawyer representing 30 families whose loved ones were injured or killed in U.S. combat operations in Iraq, Syria or Afghanistan between 2015 and 2024, said that eliminating these programs would exacerbate the trauma of civilian victims and moral injury among soldiers involved in the incidents.</p><p>Ms. Naples-Mitchell, whose clients include the relatives of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/19/magazine/victims-airstrikes-middle-east-civilians.html" title="">victims who were the subject of New York Times reporting</a>, said the changes would make the government less efficient.</p><p>“Killing innocent people is not only a moral stain,” she said, “but wastes government resources and makes Americans less safe.”</p><p>Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, also criticized Mr. Hegseth’s move.</p><p>“By revoking these policies, we increase the risk that U.S. weapons are deployed in a manner that undermines our interests and values — ultimately posing a greater threat to our national security,” he said. “Americans should be ashamed.”</p><p>The Defense Department’s civilian protection program was started during the first Trump administration by James N. Mattis, the secretary of defense at the time, in response to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/16/magazine/uncounted-civilian-casualties-iraq-airstrikes.html" title="">a Times report in November 2017</a> on civilians who were killed during airstrikes in Iraq.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In 2022, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/2022-pulitzer-airstrikes-gone-wrong" title="">a series of Times investigations</a> that uncovered systemic failures to protect civilians, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/us/politics/pentagon-civilian-casualties.html" title="">announced sweeping changes</a> to military doctrine, planning and training aimed at mitigating the risk of civilian harm.</p><p>While these programs were heralded as making improvements to U.S. civilian harm policies, they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/us/politics/military-civilian-deaths.html" title="">faced criticism</a> for not addressing operations the United States supports through military aid alone, such as Israel’s campaign in Gaza. </p><p>The Trump administration also recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/counterterrorism-drone-strikes.html" title="">rescinded Biden-era limits</a> on counterterrorism drone strikes and commando raids outside conventional war zones, reverting to the looser set of rules the president used in his first term.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump took office, the U.S. military has launched several strikes in Iraq, Syria and Somalia, despite his earlier promises <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/veterans-trump-iraq-afghanistan.html" title="">to end “endless wars.”</a></p><p>The most recent of those actions targeted Al-Shabaab fighters in Somalia on Saturday, according to <a href="https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/35727/federal-government-of-somalia-engages-al-shabaab-with-support-from-us-forces" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement released by U.S. Africa Command</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>On Feb. 23, U.S. forces launched an attack in northwest Syria that killed the senior leader of a terrorist organization affiliated with Al Qaeda, according to U.S. Central Command, which later <a href="https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/4086506/centcom-forces-kill-the-senior-military-leader-of-al-qaeda-affiliate-hurras-al/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a video of the strike</a>.</p><p>On Feb. 12, five ISIS fighters in Iraq were killed in an airstrike enabled by U.S. forces in the country, Central Command said <a href="https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/4068739/iraqi-forces-conduct-airstrike-against-isis-enabled-by-centcom-forces/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> days later.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Ismay is a reporter covering the Pentagon for The Times.
