It also extends the period of alleged racketeering conspiracy — which, prosecutors say, involves a “criminal organization” responsible for crimes including kidnapping and drug offenses — back to 2004, instead of 2008.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Prosecutors said in court papers that they do not expect the new allegations to slow down court proceedings.
