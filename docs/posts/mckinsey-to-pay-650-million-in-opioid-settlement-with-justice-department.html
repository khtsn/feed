A former senior partner, Martin Elling, has also agreed to plead guilty to obstruction of justice for destroying internal company records in connection with that work.</p><p>At the center of the government’s case was McKinsey’s advice that Purdue Pharma should “turbocharge” sales of Purdue’s flagship OxyContin painkiller in the midst of an opioid addiction epidemic that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans. More than two dozen McKinsey partners consulted for Purdue over roughly 15 years, earning the firm $93 million.</p><p>The settlement stemmed from charges brought by the U.S. attorney’s offices in Massachusetts and the Western District of Virginia.</p><p>McKinsey has in recent years settled government investigations in this country and overseas by paying hundreds of millions of dollars while not admitting any wrongdoing. That is no longer true.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>McKinsey issued a statement on Friday apologizing for its work with the opioid maker</p><p>“We are deeply sorry for our past client service to Purdue Pharma and the actions of a former partner who deleted documents related to his work for that client,” the consulting firm wrote. “We should have appreciated the harm opioids were causing in our society and we should not have undertaken sales and marketing work for Purdue Pharma. This terrible public health crisis and our past work for opioid manufacturers will always be a source of profound regret for our firm.”</p><p>Mr. Elling’s decision to plead guilty to destroying internal company records follows an announcement this month by federal prosecutors that another former McKinsey senior partner, Vikas Sagar, pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with paying bribes to secure South African government contracts for the firm. McKinsey had earlier fired Mr. Sagar.</p><p>To settle that case, McKinsey agreed to pay a fine of more than $122 million, and said it “will continue to cooperate” with South African and U.S. authorities in other investigations. The firm had already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/business/mckinsey-opioids-settlement.html" title="">agreed to pay</a> about $1 billion to states, cities and other plaintiffs to end investigations into their work with Purdue and other opioid makers.</p><p>McKinsey is widely regarded as the most prestigious management consulting firm, with offices around the world from which it advises most of the Fortune 500 companies as well as government agencies, including those in authoritarian nations such as China and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Congress held <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/business/mckinsey-congress-opioids.html" title="">hearings</a> in 2022 focusing on the firm’s simultaneous work with opioid makers and the Food and Drug Administration after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/business/mckinsey-purdue-fda-records.html" title="">reports</a> in The New York Times and elsewhere. The Times documented how McKinsey pushed ethical boundaries by advising drug and cigarette makers while also consulting for their federal regulators, who never publicly questioned these arrangements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In 2018, after Massachusetts had sued Purdue over its marketing of opioid products, two of the firm’s leading partners who oversaw the Purdue account, Mr. Elling and Arnab Ghatak, discussed how to handle it.</p><p>In an email to Mr. Ghatak, Mr. Elling wrote: “It probably makes sense to have a quick conversation with the risk committee to see if we should be doing anything” other than “eliminating all our documents and emails. Suspect not but as things get tougher there someone might turn to us.” The following month, Mr. Elling wrote an email to himself that said “delete old pur documents from laptop.”</p><p>Both men were fired after The Times first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/business/mckinsey-purdue-oxycontin-opioids.html" title="">wrote about</a> their communications in late 2020.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Ghatak said he felt “vindicated” by Mr. Elling’s guilty plea, adding that he had “never engaged in improper deletion and McKinsey behaved unconscionably in scapegoating and defaming me repeatedly.”</p><p>The McKinsey case is unrelated to Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy plan, now in legal limbo, that would have offered compensation to tens of thousands of families.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Walt Bogdanich joined The Times in 2001 as investigative editor for the Business desk.
