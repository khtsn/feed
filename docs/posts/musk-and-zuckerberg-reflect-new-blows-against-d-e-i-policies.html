The nongovernmental panel, the Department of Government Efficiency, is said to be considering a report by a right-wing civil rights group that claims to have identified more than $120 billion in potential cuts in D.E.I.-related programs.</p><p>Among them, according to The Post, are ending programs to benefit Black farmers and businesses, as well as a Biden-era executive order reserving 15 percent of federal contracts for minority-owned businesses.

The tech mogul said new guidelines were coming — and soon after announced a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/07/business/meta-fact-checking" title="">rollback of content moderation rules</a> and an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/technology/meta-mark-zuckerberg-trump.html" title="">end to Meta’s D.E.I. efforts</a>.</p><p>Moreover, Zuckerberg blamed Sheryl Sandberg, his former longtime lieutenant who was known for cultural advocacy programs like Lean In, for encouraging employee self-expression in the workplace, The Times adds. (The revelation <a href="https://www.threads.net/@karaswisher/post/DE5ukK4yb1C" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stoked</a> <a href="https://www.threads.net/@chrislhayes/post/DE5mdz1vPvo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outrage</a> online.)</p><p><strong>The news underscores how defenses of D.E.I. are faltering.</strong> Many companies had already been <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/dei-cuts-microsoft-woke-backlash/722281/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rethinking</a> <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/boeing-dismantles-diversity-team-as-pressure-builds-on-new-ceo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their</a> <a href="https://x.com/harleydavidson/status/1825564138032234994/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commitment</a> to diversity programs before Trump’s victory, especially after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action at universities. But several corporate giants, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-10/amazon-is-halting-some-of-its-diversity-and-inclusion-programs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/our-commitment-to-inclusion.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">McDonald’s</a>, have ended or scaled back such programs post-election.</p><p>For some corporations, work on diversity will still take place, using language that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-28/dei-backlash-by-conservatives-has-companies-dropping-d-or-e-from-dei" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">isn’t as politically charged</a>.

And for some workers whose careers haven’t advanced how they like, diversity programs may have simply been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/you-blamed-dei-for-hurting-your-career-now-what-6150c575" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an excuse to sugarcoat</a> the real reason they were passed over, according to a Wall Street Journal column.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>Israel’s security cabinet meets to approve the cease-fire deal.</strong> The vote is taking place after Israeli and Hamas negotiators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/17/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire/israel-hamas-gaza-cease-fire" title="">resolved remaining disputes</a>, with ministers expected to clear the agreement this weekend. If approved, Israel would withdraw eastward and both sides would release hostages or prisoners, potentially paving a path to ending the 15-month war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>China’s economy grows, but its population shrinks again.</strong> New data showed that the Chinese economy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/business/china-economy-2024-gdp.html" title="">grew 5 percent</a> last year, with increased exports and investment in manufacturing offsetting a slump in construction. But Beijing also disclosed that China’s population <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/business/china-population-births-deaths.html" title="">fell for a third straight year</a>, despite an unexpected rise in births, portending a longer-term challenge to economic growth.</p><p><strong>The Biden administration files a final flurry of regulatory actions.</strong> Regulators including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department struck settlements with companies including <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/american-express-pay-1087-mln-settle-deceptive-marketing-allegations-justice-2025-01-16/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Express</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/business/cash-app-fraud-settlement.html" title="">Block</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/technology/general-motors-driving-data-settlement.html" title="">General Motors</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/business/toyota-hino-epa-diesel-emissions-settlement.html" title="">Toyota</a>, and recommended charges against the <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/ftc-says-snaps-ai-chatbot-could-harm-users-refers-case-to-criminal-prosecutors" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">parent of Snapchat</a>. They’re a last burst of oversight actions before the Trump administration, which is expected to take a lighter hand in regulating business, takes office next week.</p><h2 id="link-8c3077">Markets feel reassured by Bessent </h2><p>Bitcoin, stock futures and government bonds — all are rallying modestly on Friday, the final trading day of the Biden era.</p><p>Their fortunes appear to be buoyed by renewed bullishness for the next Trump administration, with investors feeling relieved about what they’ve heard from the president-elect’s Cabinet picks on how they intend to operate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Markets were especially heartened by Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary pick, Scott Bessent. In his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Bessent <a href="https://x.com/SaraEisen/status/1879936416597307756" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">played down the inflationary risks</a> of Trump’s agenda.</p><p><strong>Here are the highlights:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Bessent called for renewing and extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts to avert “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o44H3xhqOv4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">economic calamity</a>.” But while he said cutting fiscal spending was also important, he was noncommittal about repealing the country’s debt ceiling and said entitlement programs like Medicare would be safe.</p></li><li><p>He said tariffs should be imposed on select countries to fix trade imbalances or used as leverage to negotiate favorable trade deals. A new round directed at China seems inevitable. In response, China is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/business/china-us-trade-sanctions.html" title="">zeroing in on American chipmakers</a>.</p></li><li><p>Bessent said that Fed independence is key to American fiscal stability. But he warned that Trump, who has long grumbled about high interest rates, was still “<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/of-course-fed-should-be-independent-but-trump-will-make-his-views-known-bessent-201905027.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">going to make his views known</a>.”</p></li><li><p>He demurred on the idea of the Fed creating a digital currency. Still, Bloomberg reports that Trump is expected to designate crypto <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/trump-plans-to-designate-cryptocurrency-as-a-national-priority" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as a national priority</a>. Speculation is also growing that Trump will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/technology/trump-bitcoin-stockpile.html" title="">greenlight a federal Bitcoin reserve</a>.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Other confirmation hearings raised questions about how the second Trump administration was shaping up.</strong> Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, the choice for interior secretary, criticized renewables as part of a wider national “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a030c7a5-39d3-4d0d-8633-354c47949ffd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">electricity crisis</a>.” The country needed to refocus on fossil fuels to maintain its global lead in energy-intensive sectors like artificial intelligence, he added.</p><p>But Lee Zeldin, Trump’s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/climate/lee-zeldin-epa-confirmation.html" title="">dodged questions</a> about Trump’s repeated vows to roll back or scrap the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s signature climate legislation.</p><p>And <a href="https://apnews.com/article/scott-turner-nfl-hud-housing-secretary-trump-6c4c8b6bf79f59e6837b18772271ce06" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scott Turner</a>, the former N.F.L. player tapped to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, offered little detail about how he would address a housing crunch. His lack of clarity came as new Freddie Mac data showed mortgage rates hitting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/business/mortgage-rates-housing-costs.html" title="">an eight-month high</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The surge is pricing some prospective buyers out of the market — despite the Fed having lowered borrowing costs — in a trend that has alarmed some market watchers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-7c864612">The TikTok countdown continues</h2><p>As TikTok nears a potential ban in the United States, elected officials are racing to find ways to delay a crisis that many of them helped stoke by backing the law behind the punishment.</p><p>Here’s where things stand.</p><p><strong>President Biden is trying to make it Donald Trump’s problem.</strong> An administration official <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-administration-keep-tiktok-available-us-rcna187902" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told NBC News</a> that the White House was “exploring options” to forestall the app from going dark.
