Trump’s request to dismiss <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/30/nyregion/trump-hush-money-verdict.html" title="">his criminal conviction</a> in the wake of his electoral victory, signaling instead their willingness to freeze the case while he holds office.</p><p>In a letter to the judge overseeing the case, the prosecutors emphasized that a jury had already convicted Mr. Trump of falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal.</p><p>But acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the case — Mr. Trump would be the first felon to serve as president — the prosecutors raised the prospect of a four-year freeze.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“The people deeply respect the office of the president, are mindful of the demands and obligations of the presidency, and acknowledge that defendant’s inauguration will raise unprecedented legal questions,” prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney’s office wrote to the judge, Juan M. Merchan. “We also deeply respect the fundamental role of the jury in our constitutional system.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Eager to clear his criminal record, Mr. Trump is now expected to move forcefully for a dismissal, setting in motion a legal battle that could shadow his second presidential term and ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court. That fight will almost certainly further delay Mr. Trump’s sentencing, which was scheduled for next week.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Trump, Steven Cheung, celebrated the delay, calling it “a total and definitive victory for President Trump and the American people.”</p><p>He added: “The lawless case is now stayed, and President Trump’s legal team is moving to get it dismissed once and for all.”</p><p>In recent court records that hinted at a Supreme Court challenge, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/nyregion/trump-criminal-conviction-overturn-manhattan.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s lawyers requested that the prosecutors proactively dismiss the case, arguing that doing so</a> would “avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump’s ability to govern.” It was, they added, “in the interests of justice.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, took a week to deliberate before delivering Tuesday’s much-anticipated response. His prosecutors ultimately determined that there was no law requiring the dismissal of a jury conviction obtained well before a defendant was elected.</p><p>Instead, they argued, that courts had insisted on balancing the interests of the presidency and “the integrity of the criminal justice system.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prosecutors for Alvin K. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, proposed freezing the case.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Todd Heisler/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Bragg’s options were limited and unappealing: He could have either dropped the case, a move that would have alienated his liberal Manhattan base, or suggest some way to pause it, potentially intensifying Mr. Trump’s ire and drawing a legal challenge.</p><p>His prosecutors did not propose the four-year freeze outright. Instead, they raised it as a preferable alternative to a dismissal, citing “the need to balance competing constitutional interests.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>They also asked Justice Merchan to temporarily put the case on hold while both sides submit formal arguments in the battle over a potential dismissal.</p><p>That will tee up a legally and politically fraught decision for Justice Merchan, the no-nonsense judge who presided over Mr. Trump’s seven-week trial this year.</p><p>Even as Mr. Trump has accused Justice Merchan of being “biased” and “corrupt” — and leveled personal attacks at his daughter, a Democratic political consultant — the judge has vowed to apply “the rules of law evenhandedly.”</p><p>It is unclear how Justice Merchan will eventually rule as he balances the weight of a jury verdict against the extraordinary status of the defendant.</p><p>A former prosecutor known for his law-and-order leanings, Justice Merchan might be hesitant to unravel the verdict. Instead, he could be more amenable to freezing the case, having already postponed the sentencing twice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Long sentencing delays are not unheard-of. When defendants are ill — or cooperating with prosecutors against other defendants — it can take months or years to be sentenced.</p><p>But another delay for Mr. Trump — this one lasting four years — would punctuate the sharp reversal in his legal fortunes. Just a few months ago, Mr. Trump was facing the prospect of serving time behind bars in New York, as well as trials in three other criminal cases.</p><p>Now, all four cases may unravel. In July, a judge he appointed during his first term dismissed his federal classified documents case in Florida <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/15/us/trump-documents-case-dismissed" title="">in its entirety</a>. The same month, his federal election interference case in Washington was upended following the Supreme Court’s landmark decision <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-immunity.html" title="">granting him broad immunity</a> for official actions taken as president.</p><p>While the federal special counsel who brought those cases made efforts to revive them, Mr. Trump’s victory thwarted those plans. The federal judge overseeing his election interference case in Washington recently paused all filing deadlines while the special counsel, Jack Smith, weighed whether to drop the case entirely.</p><p>The future is less clear in Georgia, where Mr. Trump’s state racketeering case has been on hold for months as an appeals court weighed whether to disqualify the prosecutor. At some point, Mr. Trump’s lawyers are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/trump-georgia-prosecution-delay.html" title="">expected to call</a> for a long delay if not an outright dismissal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s lawyers will not settle for a delay in Manhattan, and should Justice Merchan decide against a dismissal, he will not have the final word.</p><p>The former and future president could appeal the judge’s decision in either state or federal court. If he loses, the case might wind its way to the Supreme Court, where the 6-to-3 conservative majority includes three justices Mr. Trump appointed in his first term.</p><p>As he gears up for a legal dogfight, Mr. Trump might eventually revamp his legal team. Last week, he picked two of the lawyers who represented him at trial, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, for senior roles at the Justice Department, most likely creating an opening for a new group of appellate lawyers to take over.</p><p>A new legal team could also inherit Mr. Trump’s separate effort to overturn his conviction based on the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. Within hours of the high court announcing its ruling in July, Mr. Trump’s lawyers had moved to throw out the verdict.</p><p>Manhattan prosecutors have argued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/nyregion/trump-conviction-immunity.html" title="">that the immunity ruling had “no bearing</a>” on their case, noting that Mr. Trump’s cover-up of the sex scandal was unrelated to his presidency. Justice Merchan was poised to rule on the matter last week but shelved the decision in light of Mr. Trump’s new bid to have the case dismissed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s two-pronged attack on the Manhattan case — wielding both the immunity ruling and the election results — underscored his expansive view of presidential power.</p><p>In arguing that the case should be dismissed based on the election, Mr. Trump’s lawyers are likely to rely on broad interpretations of a 1963 law that enshrined the importance of a smooth transition into the presidency, as well as a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/146241-0/dl?inline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">longstanding Justice Department policy</a> that a sitting president cannot face federal criminal prosecution.</p><p>That policy undoubtedly applies to both of Mr. Trump’s federal criminal cases, but its authority over Mr. Bragg, a local prosecutor who secured Mr. Trump’s conviction before the presidential election, is an open question.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Protess is an investigative reporter at The Times, writing about public corruption.
