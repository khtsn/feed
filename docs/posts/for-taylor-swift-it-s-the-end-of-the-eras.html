    <h1>For Taylor Swift, It’s the End of the ‘Eras’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Anyone with an ear tuned to the world of pop music knew the Eras Tour was going to be a big one.</p><p>It was Taylor Swift’s first tour in almost five years, the longest gap of her career. And Swift, long the biggest star in pop music, had become even bigger, transcending the Top 40 to become a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>Now, almost two years later, the tour is coming to an end on Sunday night in Vancouver, Canada.</p><p>The tour included extensive music, not just from her most recent album, “Midnights,” but from her entire career, from the country of “Fearless” to the pop of “1989” and the indie pop of “Folklore.”</p><p>The first concert came in March 2023 in Glendale, Ariz., and it was even bigger than anyone imagined: three hours, 15 minutes without intermission and more than 40 songs.</p><p>Tickets vanished in seconds, then quickly popped up on the secondary market at 10 times the price. Fans who couldn’t obtain or afford tickets came to the venues anyway, content to commune with others like them and sing along with the amplified music coming from inside.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>And the excitement just kept building, with frenzied anticipation in every city, attendance records broken and vast economic impacts in regions and even entire countries.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Swifties descend on Vancouver in Canada for the last stop of Swift’s Eras tour on Saturday night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alana Paterson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hayley Pallin from Oregon came with her family to watch the concert.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alana Paterson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Destination Vancouver, a tourism agency, estimated the concert series poured $157 million into the local economy.</p><p>“It’s turned the city upside down,” said Jarrett Vaughan, a business school professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. “For one person to have such a big impact, it’s really unprecedented.”</p><p>Dozens of downtown businesses jumped on the Swift bandwagon, advertising drink specials tied to the Eras tour. Overhead signs at the nearest transit station, Stadium-Chinatown, were temporarily styled in a Swift-inspired friendship bracelet font.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Terry Fox Memorial in downtown Vancouver, which honors a college student who lost a leg to cancer and who ran halfway across the country with an artificial limb to raise money for cancer, was overshadowed by a towering tribute to Swift’s album “Red.” Fans lined up to pose for photos with the giant glowing red sign. Twelve similar pop-up installations took over scenic spots across the city.</p><p>A few blocks from the concert venue, BC Place, on Saturday night, the perimeter was barricaded with dump trucks and lots of police officers.</p><p>Sequin, fringe, fur, cowboy boots and flower crowns could be seen in every direction. A group of fans wearing matching pink tinsel arrived on a local water taxi. Some of the boats were outfitted with oversize friendship bracelets draped over the sides.</p><p>Outside a maze of pink tape where concertgoers waited to be let into the venue, a woman held a cardboard sign that said “I need a ticket.” By 7 p.m., the spectacle was in full swing, as screaming fans could be heard more than a block away.</p><p>Melissa Pallin, 39, of Portland, Ore., said she spent about $1,900 per ticket for a family of four but that it was worth it. Her family drove nine hours to celebrate her daughter’s 16th birthday, which comes on Dec. 12, one day before Swift’s.</p><p>Val Iddings, 43, of Rapid City, S.D., said her family has followed the Eras tour across several time zones, from her home state to Cheyenne, Wyo., to Denver, and now Vancouver. Her daughter Kaylee, 18, attended her first Swift concert at age 2.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As much as the tour’s success was expected, much happened over its course that could not have been anticipated.</p><p>Ticket snags led to lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/arts/music/taylor-swift-ticketmaster-eras-tour.html" title="">demanding that Ticketmaster</a> clean up its act and even threatening to break the company up.

But a month later, reports began to circulate that the relationship was over.</p><p>The N.F.L. star Travis Kelce attended one of the Eras concerts but said he did not get a chance to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it. Nevertheless, by the fall dating rumors were swirling and Swift began to attend Kansas City Chiefs games.</p><p>She popped up often enough that some football fans hyperbolized that she was being shown on TV <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/style/taylor-swift-nfl-broadcasts.html" title="">more than the players</a>. Swift and Kelce remain together.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In July 2023, she released “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” and in August onstage in Inglewood, Calif., she announced “1989 (Taylor’s Version),” which was released in October.</p><p>In October 2023 some of the fans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/style/taylor-swift-movie-fans.html" title="">shut out</a> by high ticket prices and sold-out concerts were able to see the film “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” which Swift got into theaters through AMC, a theater company, rather than a movie studio. It grossed more than $250 million worldwide.</p><p>The Eras Tour got a shake-up in April 2024 when Swift released a new album, “The Tortured Poets Department.” When the tour resumed in May after a two-month break, she had added a new era.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-13"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Peyton Iddings of Rapid City, S.D., came with her family to see Taylor Swift.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alana Paterson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Crowds gathered outside the concert venue on Saturday night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alana Paterson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/08xpswift-03-tfpm/08xpswift-03-tfpm-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/08xpswift-03-tfpm/08xpswift-03-tfpm-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/08xpswift-03-tfpm/08xpswift-03-tfpm-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Lines of people filling the street outside the concert venue." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/08xpswift-03-tfpm/08xpswift-03-tfpm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/08xpswift-03-tfpm/08xpswift-03-tfpm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/08xpswift-03-tfpm/08xpswift-03-tfpm-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/08xpswift-03-tfpm/08xpswift-03-tfpm-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/84da4253-c098-5e0a-8c08-6d2769fe074e" decoding="async" width="600" height="480"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destination Vancouver, a tourism agency, estimated the concert series poured $157 million into the local economy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alana Paterson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>In a darker twist, promoters in August <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/arts/music/taylor-swift-concert-terror-plot-vienna.html" title="">canceled</a> her three scheduled concerts in Vienna after two men were charged in connection with plotting a terrorist attack targeting the tour.
