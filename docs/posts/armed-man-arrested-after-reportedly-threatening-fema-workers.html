    <h1>Armed Man Arrested After Reportedly Threatening FEMA Workers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A North Carolina man was arrested on Saturday and accused of threatening federal emergency responders who have been administering aid since Hurricane Helene ravaged parts of the state last month.</p><p>The man, William Jacob Parsons, 44, of Bostic, N.C., was charged under a law that makes it illegal to carry a weapon in a way that threatens the public. He was arrested at a supermarket where a Federal Emergency Management Agency bus was parked, according to Capt. Jamie Keever, a spokesman for the Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office. Mr. Parsons had a handgun and a rifle in his possession.</p><p>No FEMA personnel were at the site, he said.</p><p>The Rutherford County Communications Center received a call on Saturday afternoon that a man armed with an assault rifle had made a comment about harming FEMA workers in the area, according to a statement released by the sheriff’s office.</p><p>The man was overheard voicing threats at a gas station in neighboring Polk County, and either a station clerk or a customer alerted U.S. Army soldiers nearby, Captain<span>  </span>Keever said. The Army informed the Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office, whose deputies visited the gas station and obtained a description of the man’s vehicle. That information led them to Mr. Parsons at the supermarket.</p></div></div>
