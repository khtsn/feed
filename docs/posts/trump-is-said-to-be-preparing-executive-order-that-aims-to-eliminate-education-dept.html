The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak about private deliberations. Hours later, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump would not be signing any orders related to the Education Department on Thursday.</p><p>No modern president has ever tried to unilaterally shut down a federal department. The Education Department was created by an act of Congress in 1979, and federal lawmakers would likely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/trump-close-department-of-education.html" title="">have to approve eliminating it</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s order was expected to lead to another legal fight for the administration, which is already embroiled in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/trump-administration-lawsuits.html" title="">multiple lawsuits</a> over actions in its first six weeks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The American Federation of Teachers noted in a statement late Wednesday that the Education Department was “legally required” to distribute federal funds — money approved for poor students, those with disabilities and others — to states.</p><p>“Any attempt by the Trump administration or Congress to gut these programs would be a grave mistake, and we will fight them tooth and nail,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the union.</p><p>A draft of Mr. Trump’s order circulated in Washington on Wednesday ahead of a potential announcement. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Mr. Trump could sign the order as soon as Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Trump has been blunt about his desire to do away with the department entirely. He remarked recently that he hoped Ms. McMahon would effectively put herself out of a job.</p><p>He told reporters last month that the Education Department was “a big con job” and that “I’d like to close it immediately.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Ms. McMahon’s first action as education secretary was to email the department’s staff about its “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/mcmahon-education-final-mission.html" title="">final mission</a>,” an indication of how she planned to fulfill Mr. Trump’s goal of shuttering the department.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael C.
