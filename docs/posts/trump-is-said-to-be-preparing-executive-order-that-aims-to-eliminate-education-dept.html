    <h1>Trump Is Said to Be Preparing Executive Order That Aims to Eliminate Education Dept.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Trump is preparing to sign an order that would instruct Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin dismantling her agency, setting the stage for a potential power struggle with Congress and another round of legal challenges from opponents.</p><p>An administration official said the order could be signed as soon as Thursday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak about private deliberations. Hours later, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump would not be signing any orders related to the Education Department on Thursday.</p><p>No modern president has ever tried to unilaterally shut down a federal department. The Education Department was created by an act of Congress in 1979, and federal lawmakers would likely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/trump-close-department-of-education.html" title="">have to approve eliminating it</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trumpâ€™s order was expected to lead to another legal fight for the administration, which is already embroiled in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/trump-administration-lawsuits.html" title="">multiple lawsuits</a> over actions in its first six weeks.</p></div></div>
