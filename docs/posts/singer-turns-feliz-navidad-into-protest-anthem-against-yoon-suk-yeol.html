The adaptation’s repeated opening verse: “Impeachment is the answer.”</p><p>The day after Mr. Yoon’s short-lived <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-martial-law.html" title="">declaration of martial law</a> last week, the protest anthem’s creator, Baek Jae Gil, performed it for thousands outside the National Assembly in Seoul. A <a href="https://x.com/ninini0421/status/1864268737786085738/video/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recording</a> has received nine million views on X, and the song has spread on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. On the Chinese app WeChat, it has been translated into Chinese, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SSKCW-WocQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“If Yoon Suk Yeol gets lost, it’s a Merry Christmas,” the crowd sang along to the tune of the 1970 Christmas classic.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Baek, 52, a professional musician known as Baekja, has been protesting for decades. He has seen demonstrations become more peaceful and the mood lighten since his first rally in 1989. That was during a brutally suppressed teachers movement that led to the formation of a national union.</p><p>“It was scary,” he said of those days in an interview last Saturday during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/07/world/asia/south-korea-protests-seoul-yoon.html" title="">protests</a> at the National Assembly. “It was the time of tear gas and violent repression.”</p><p>Growing up as the youngest of six children in South Korea’s southwest, Mr. Baek said, he often heard stories from his older brothers about how soldiers suppressed pro-democracy protests in the nearby <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/asia/gwangju-massacre-human-acts-han-kang.html" title="">city of Gwangju</a> in 1980, the last time South Korea was under martial law.</p><p>“My brother was almost killed,” he said, adjusting his thick-rimmed glasses.</p><p>In middle school, he moved to Seoul at his brothers’ recommendation to find better opportunities. In high school, he wrote poetry, some of it political. He kept writing poems as he studied business at university, and a friend from high school turned them into songs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He took the stage as a singer for the first time in 1990, the year he started college, at a pro-democracy protest on campus.</p><p>Mr. Baek also learned to play the guitar. In 1991, he performed it in the alleyways of Seoul among crowds of students and workers whose demonstrations were set off by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/15/world/seoul-protest-sets-off-street-clashes.html" title="">killing of a student activist</a>. About a dozen protesters died <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/19/world/more-self-immolations-in-seoul-protests.html" title="">setting themselves on fire</a>.</p><p>“I sang in the midst of tear gas every week,” he said.</p><p>In the past two decades, the police tactics to suppress demonstrations have become less violent. He said that protest culture changed significantly during candlelight vigils in 2002 in response to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/04/world/koreans-protest-us-military-s-handling-of-a-fatal-accident.html" title="">deaths</a> of two schoolgirls fatally struck by a U.S. Army vehicle. A U.S. military court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/23/world/2nd-us-sergeant-is-cleared-in-the-death-of-2-korean-girls.html" title="">acquitted</a> two soldiers in the crash, sparking anger, but the protests remained largely peaceful.</p><p>Mr. Baek also saw the mood at demonstrations become brighter after the protests against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/world/asia/korea-park-geun-hye-protests.html" title="">President Park Geun-hye</a>, some of the largest the country has seen, led to her impeachment in 2016. People were jubilant, he said: A peaceful protest had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html" title="">toppled</a> the country’s leader.</p><p>“Protests in South Korea went from being dark and depressing to being fun and exciting,” Mr. Baek said. “There was a sense of pride in democracy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Those demonstrations provided the inspiration for his “Feliz Navidad” adaptation. A protester performed a version of the song, originally written by the Puerto Rican singer José Feliciano, titled “Geun-hye Is Not the One.”</p><p>(Mr. Feliciano did not comment directly on the latest adaptation. Susan Feliciano, his wife, said in a statement that the lyrics have been repurposed often and that it was gratifying to see the melody endure.)</p><p>Mr. Baek wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQsbIcGT7O0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his version</a> in 2022, after Mr. Yoon had become president. Protests calling for his removal grew after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/world/asia/south-korea-itaewon-crowd-crush-victims.html" title="">crowd crush</a> in Seoul around Halloween killed more than 150 people. Mr. Baek wanted to come up with a song fit for the run-up to Christmas.</p><p>“The response has been great,” he said. “It’s fun, it’s exciting, it’s a Christmas carol.”</p><p>Mr. Baek has run into trouble with other satirical songs. A government-run broadcaster accused him of copyright infringement earlier this year after he used portion of its footage in a YouTube video satirizing the material. At the broadcaster’s request, YouTube deleted his video, and the police launched an investigation. Mr. Baek said he was fighting the case, calling it a targeted infringement on his free speech rights.</p><p>Last week, the day after hundreds of soldiers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/south-korea-national-assembly-troops.html" title="">stormed</a> the National Assembly, he sang his anthem and several other songs there to an energized audience that was younger than those he had seen at previous rallies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Let’s make Yoon Suk Yeol’s arrest our Christmas gift this year!” he shouted before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY4Xskqz60Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">performing</a> for a crowd of protesters.</p><p>Mr. Baek, who sang it again on a stage at last <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/world/asia/south-korea-protests-president-impeach.html" title="">Saturday’s protests</a>, said that he liked to lift people’s mood.</p><p>“The wind is biting, isn’t it?” he told thousands of protesters as wind swept his brown-highlighted perm. “If you’re cold, get up and dance!”</p><p>The crowd rose and cheered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-11"></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/yoon-suk-yeol">Yoon Suk-yeol</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
