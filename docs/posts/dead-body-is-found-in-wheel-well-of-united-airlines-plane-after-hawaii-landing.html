The department is investigating the death, said Alana K. Pico, a department spokeswoman. The airline said it is working with law enforcement on the investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was unclear how or when the person entered the wheel well, a compartment underneath the plane that stores the retractable landing gear. According to a United spokesperson, the area where the body was found is only accessible from outside the aircraft. The aircraft is a Boeing 787-10, the spokesperson said. </p><p> Low oxygen levels in wheel storage compartments and extreme temperatures as flights climb to cruising altitudes make surviving in the wheel wells or other areas of commercial aircrafts rare, the Federal Aviation Administration has previously said. The agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The police did not say on Tuesday that the person who was found dead on Maui was a stowaway. Others have died over the years after being in the landing gear compartment.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/28/us/stowaway-miami-guatemala.html" title="">In 2021</a>, a 26-year-old man survived a flight from Guatemala to Miami after hiding in the airplane’s landing gear compartment, officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/world/europe/stowaway-london-garden-heathrow.html" title="">In 2019</a>, the body of a man believed to have fallen from the landing gear compartment of a flight to Heathrow Airport from Nairobi, Kenya, landed in the backyard of a house in southwest London.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
