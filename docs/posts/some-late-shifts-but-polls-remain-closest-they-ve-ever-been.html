</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The 2004 election between John Kerry and George W. Bush might be the next closest election in terms of polling, but it’s hard to put it in quite the same tier. Even then, Mr. Bush was a modestly clear favorite. Mr. Kerry needed to win states like Florida and Ohio, where Mr. Bush held a consistent if narrow lead in the final polls.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This time, neither Mr. Trump nor Ms. Harris faces such a narrow path to victory. In the key tipping point state in this year’s pre-election polling — Pennsylvania — both candidates can point to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president-pennsylvania.html#the-latest-pennsylvania-polls" title="">several high-quality polls</a> showing them tied or ahead. For good measure, they’re both highly competitive in additional states, should Pennsylvania fall through.</p><p>Whether the final result will actually be as close as the polls show is another matter. Even in an excellent year for polling, the polls tend to err one way or another, even if only by one or two points. When these subtle errors happen, it mostly goes unnoticed and the pollsters celebrate.</p><p>This year, even a relatively accurate year for polling might yield outcomes that feel very different. Do not be surprised if either candidate winds up winning in a manner that feels fairly decisive, such as by sweeping all of the battleground states and winning more than 300 electoral votes.</p><h3 id="link-726d8894"><span><strong>What if the polls are wrong?</strong></span></h3><p>Of course, it’s also possible that the polls will err by more than one or two percentage points. If they do, it might yield an outcome that doesn’t just <em>feel </em>decisive — it could also produce a surprisingly comfortable victory. Indeed, the poll errors from just the last two election cycles might be all it would take.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="electoal-college-bars-11-03-dggas0" data-id="100000009801410" data-source-id="100000009801410"><div slug="electoal-college-bars-11-03-dggas0" data-sourceid="100000009801410" id="embed-id-100000009801410">

This included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/trump-msg-rally.html" title="">his rally</a> at Madison Square Garden and his former chief of staff’s warning that he would rule <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html" title="">like a dictator</a>.</p><p>While the news and the polls have helped give the Harris campaign a sense of momentum heading into Election Day, the overall effect on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">the averages</a> has been relatively minimal.
