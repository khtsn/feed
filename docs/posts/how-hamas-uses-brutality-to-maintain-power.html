American officials have repeatedly expressed deep frustration with Israel for those failures, too, as well as for not providing basic security in the territory.</p><p>But the reality of the war, according to U.S. officials, is that the Israeli military and Hamas carry out questionable acts nearly every day. Many of the reports reviewed by American intelligence analysts involve Israeli actions: military strikes that kill large numbers of civilians, errant attacks on aid convoys or other deadly incidents. But a large number of reports involve Hamas, both its acts of terrorism against hostages and its abuses of Palestinians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Vice Adm. Frank Whitworth, the head of the U.S. intelligence agency that analyzes satellite imagery, compared the role of intelligence officials monitoring Gaza to that of an umpire.</p><p>“We also have a responsibility to tell the whole story,” he said <a href="https://nationalsecuritymedia.gwu.edu/project/vice-admiral-frank-trey-whitworth-director-national-geospatial-intelligence-agency/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at a gathering of reporters</a> recently. “We certainly are enabling Israel to protect itself. But we are also calling every ball and strike and balk and foul, and we’re doing so in a very complete way.”</p><p>This article is based on interviews with more than three dozen U.S. and Israeli officials, Hamas members and Palestinian residents of Gaza. Many of the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence assessments. Many of the Palestinians spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation.</p><p>Since the attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, which killed 1,200 people, Israel’s aim has been to “destroy Hamas.” In practice that means that the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to end the group’s hold on power in Gaza. But after 11 months of war, U.S. officials say Hamas’s control has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/us/politics/israel-gaza-hamas-war.html" title="">loosened but not broken</a>.</p><p>Palestinians are quick to excoriate Israel for the deaths and destruction in Gaza. But some Palestinians said in interviews that Hamas has put Gazans in Israel’s cross hairs by launching attacks from neighborhoods, running tunnels under apartment buildings and hiding hostages in city centers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And Hamas is still able to inspire fear among the people it rules, despite the chaos that has taken hold across the territory.</p><p>“There’s no international law that justifies Israel killing civilians,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a professor of political science who fled Gaza early in the war. “But Hamas has acted recklessly.”</p><h2 id="link-3c17036a">Putting Civilians in the Line of Fire</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Taking cover during an Israeli airstrike targeted at a school on the outskirts of Gaza City this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Al-Qattaa/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Hamas’s practice of operating from civilian areas of Gaza has drawn sharp criticism from Palestinians.</p><p>“Those launching rockets and firing bullets from civilian areas don’t care about civilians,” said Abu Shaker, whose family has been repeatedly displaced. He asked to be identified by his nickname. “If you want to fight Israel, you should go do that. But why are you coming to hide among the civilians?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>At the beginning of the war, he said, militants fired rockets at Israel from the busy towns of Deir al Balah and Nuseirat in central Gaza. Residents hurried indoors in anticipation of retaliatory Israeli strikes.</p><p>It is notoriously difficult to assess public opinion in Gaza. Mobile phone networks have been spotty. Polling is extremely complicated. Interviews are challenging to conduct, especially during a war. And speaking out against Hamas is risky.</p><p>Still, Palestinians interviewed by The New York Times expressed frustration with Hamas, particularly over its practice of embedding in civilian areas. The Palestinians interviewed said that while Israel bore enormous responsibility for the suffering the war has brought upon them, Hamas did too.</p><p>Hamas built access points to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/europe/hamas-tunnels-war-documents.html" title="">its extensive tunnel network</a> inside homes. An aerial photo recovered by the Israeli military from a Hamas commander’s post shows three dozen hidden tunnel entrances marked with color-coded dots and arrows in one crowded neighborhood.</p><p>To some Palestinians, an Israeli airstrike on July 13 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-deif-mawasi-khan-younis.html" title="">targeting the senior military commander Muhammad Deif</a> and another Hamas military leader is an example of the perils civilians face.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Israeli officials say that Mr. Deif had entered a villa in a designated humanitarian zone to meet with a Hamas commander who was hiding there. Some 70 Palestinians were killed in the assault, including many women and children, according to the Gazan health ministry.

While the syndicate did not explicitly name Hamas, it left little doubt that it was behind the raid on Mr. Fasfous’s home in the southern city of Khan Younis.</p><p>In its statement, the organization said it viewed the raid with “great severity” and that journalists and their families should be protected.</p><p>“Journalists in Gaza are being constantly killed by Israel,” said Tahseen al-Astal, the deputy head of the group. “When internal Palestinian parties go after them, too, their work becomes impossible.”</p><p>Mr. Fasfous, a well-known critic of Hamas, has long been targeted by the group’s general security service, a secret police force in Gaza that has conducted surveillance on everyday Palestinians, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/world/europe/secret-hamas-files-palestinians.html" title="">according to Hamas documents obtained by The Times</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Weeks before the start of the war, the unit recommended taking action to prevent Mr. Fasfous from reporting as a journalist. “Defame him,” a file from August 2023 read, calling him one of Hamas’s “major haters.”</p><p>“We advise that closing in on him is necessary because he’s a negative person who is full of hatred, and only brings forth the Strip’s shortcomings,” the file said.</p><p>In an interview with The Times in May, Mr. Fasfous said Hamas held critics in contempt. “If you’re not with them, you become an atheist, an infidel and a sinner,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Palestinian journalist broadcasting live from Rafah in southern Gaza last December.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Said Khatib/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Ismail Thawabteh, the director general of the Hamas-run government media office, attempted to distance Hamas from the threats and violence waged against Mr. Fasfous and Mr. Abed.

But other Palestinians have also been threatened and intimidated.</p><p>Earlier this year, Alaa al-Haddad, 28, an activist from Gaza City, began criticizing Hamas as he watched the news with strangers at a shelter in Rafah. Soon after, Mr. Haddad said that his uncle was approached by a member of Hamas. “Shut him up,” Mr. Haddad said the man told his uncle.</p><p>“This is the story of the Palestinian people in Gaza,” said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a Palestinian American who is a fellow with the Atlantic Council. “The powerlessness of being stuck between a ferocious Israeli war machine and a nefarious Islamist group that operates among the civilians.”</p><p>While Hamas officials minimize criticisms of their conduct, they broadly argue that the suffering of the Palestinian people is the cost for fighting against the Israeli occupation of Gaza.</p><p>Hamas recognizes that “freedom doesn’t come for free,” said Salah al-Din al-Awawdeh, a member of the group who spent time in prison with its current leader, Yahya Sinwar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“There is no liberation movement that has freed its people without paying a big price in terms of civilians,” he said.</p><p>But some U.S. and Israeli officials said their intelligence assessments indicate that Mr. Sinwar is more interested in inflicting pain on Israel than uplifting the Palestinian people. </p><p>“He’s not calculating the impact on human beings or property,” said Ted Singer, a recently retired senior C.I.A. official who worked extensively in the Middle East. “He is calculating on bringing the Israelis down a notch and freeing Palestinian prisoners.”</p><h2 id="link-36521e0d">‘It Was Horrific’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>More than 270 Palestinians died during a mission to rescue Israeli hostages in the Nuseirat neighborhood of Gaza on June 8.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jehad Alshrafi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Hamas also hides hostages among Palestinian civilians, with devastating consequences.</p><p>In early June, Israel planned <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/world/middleeast/israel-mission-hostages-nuseirat.html" title="">a mission to rescue four of the dozens of living hostages</a> who remain in Gaza. But civilians in the densely populated Nuseirat area proved a complicating factor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>The Israelis sent in rescue vehicles on June 8, and when one was damaged, Hamas militants moved in on it. A firefight broke out, and commandos called in the Israeli air force, which began striking the neighborhood.</p><p>The hostages were ultimately rescued. But more than 270 Palestinians were killed, according to the Gazan health ministry, though it has proved impossible to determine with certainty how many were Hamas fighters and how many were<span>  </span>innocent bystanders. </p><p>Many Palestinians are angry at Israel for conducting the raid. But others said they knew that Israel would try to rescue its people, no matter the toll.</p><p>“I’m totally against mixing prisoners and civilians,” said Kareem, a lawyer who spoke on the condition that only his first name be used to avoid retribution from the Hamas authorities. “We saw what the operation resulted in. It was horrific. A very high price.”</p><p>According to Israeli and American officials, intelligence intercepts show that Hamas leaders have ordered their fighters to kill hostages if it appeared that Israeli troops were moving in and could potentially rescue them. Earlier this month, Abu Obeida, the spokesman of Hamas’s military wing, suggested that militants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/01/world/hostages-strike-israel-gaza-war/e3d85fd8-cbfe-5732-9c84-432967c02ef2?smid=url-share" title="">had been given such orders</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Israeli officials said they believed that was what happened last month. On Aug. 29 or 30, according to an Israeli intelligence assessment, Hamas militants holding six hostages in the tunnels below the Tel Sultan area of Gaza detected an Israeli military patrol above them. Israeli military officials said they believed that Hamas scouts or a camera revealed the Israeli soldiers’ movements.</p><p>Acting on the standing orders not to allow hostages to be liberated, the militants executed their captives and fled the tunnel, according to Israeli officials. The soldiers above ground continued their patrol, not knowing they had come close to the hostages.</p><p>The Israeli military said that the entrance to the tunnel was located inside a child’s bedroom.</p><p>“A military force doesn’t do” what Hamas did, said Jonathan R. Cohen, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt. “They’re a terrorist organization with a military structure. That’s a terrifying thing.”</p><h2 id="link-3b7c54e7">A Hold on Power</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli and American officials say Hamas has tried to stop looting in Gaza, but often with brutal tactics.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fatima Shbair/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><p>To break Hamas’s control of Gaza, Israeli officials say they need to destroy not just its military power but also its ability to function as a government. Critics of Israel have questioned that strategy, which they say hurts ordinary Palestinians.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>But nearly a year into the war, the civilian government still functions.</p><p>Mr. Thawabteh, the director general of the Hamas-run government media office, said the government still employs thousands of people, helps distribute aid and organizes Friday prayers. Security services continue to try to enforce the law, he added.</p><p>Government-run emergency committees help secure aid and maintain order, Mr. Thawabteh said.</p><p>“The government in Gaza is living through a time of challenges,” he said. “But it’s still in place carrying out its duties every day.”</p><p>Hamas is not the only group active in Gaza. Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a Hamas ally that participated in the Oct. 7 terror attacks, remains strong. Armed gangs and neighborhood committees operate throughout the territory, with some also making threats and carrying out revenge attacks.</p><p>American officials say the groups operate with the implicit blessing of Hamas, though its precise level of oversight and control of them varies from group to group.</p><p>But Mr. Sinwar is the unchallenged leader of Gaza. While his day-to-day control of the government is attenuated, as he tries to avoid being captured or killed by Israel, he still sets the broad goals and policies for Gaza, according to officials briefed on the intelligence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>Aid agencies trying to deliver humanitarian relief to Gaza acknowledge Hamas’s continued control. Aid convoys must coordinate their efforts with local Hamas leaders, or risk the aid not getting through.</p><p>Efforts to have Gazans who are aligned with the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority help secure aid convoys have fallen apart. American officials say Hamas hostility and threats on those convoys shut down the effort.</p><p>Looting has afflicted several Gazan cities after Israeli forces pulled out. Some of the looters may have been hungry people trying to feed their families. Others may have had more base motivations.</p><p>Israeli and American officials say Hamas has tried to stop the looting, but often with brutal tactics.</p><p>In some instances, according to U.S. officials, people accused of looting have been shot in the leg.
