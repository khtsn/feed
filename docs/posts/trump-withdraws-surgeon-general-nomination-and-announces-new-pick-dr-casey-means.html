Kennedy Jr., to ensure a successful implementation of our Agenda in order to reverse the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and ensure Great Health, in the future, for ALL Americans,” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to the Make America Healthy Again movement.</p><p>Dr. Means, a wellness influencer who earned a medical degree from Stanford and frequently casts doubt on the American medical system, is the co-author of “Good Energy,” a book about chronic illness. The book, which she wrote with her brother, argues that metabolic dysfunction is at the root of a chronic disease epidemic. Dr. Means has pointed to rising rates of infertility, obesity, diabetes, depression and other conditions as signs that the United States is undergoing a health crisis, and pointed at environmental factors and the food system as possible culprits.</p><p>Her brother, Calley Means, is a top adviser to Mr. Kennedy, and the siblings have been prominent supporters of Mr. Kennedy’s policy efforts. They became especially popular among conservatives after they appeared on Tucker Carlson’s podcast last August, and Mr. Trump and Joe Rogan discussed them in October on Mr. Rogan’s podcast.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>When Mr. Kennedy was sworn in as the new health secretary, Dr. Means wrote on X that he “has a vision for the future that aligns with what I want for my family, future children, and the world.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Means is expected to work closely with Robert F.

She is the co-founder of Levels, a digital health company that uses continuous glucose monitoring to help track metabolic health.</p><p>Mr. Trump said Dr. Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor, would work with Mr. Kennedy “in another capacity” at the health and human services department.</p><p>Dr. Nesheiwat was scheduled to appear before the Senate health committee on Thursday, but her nomination ran into trouble on two fronts. Laura Loomer, a conservative activist whom Mr. Trump has listened to on other personnel matters, called for a new surgeon general nominee, arguing Dr. Nesheiwat “is not ideologically aligned” with the president. Reports have <a href="https://lastcampaign.substack.com/p/trumps-surgeon-general-pick-distorted" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also raised questions</a> about the veracity of Dr. Nesheiwat’s résumé.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>She is the sister-in-law of Michael Waltz, who served as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser until last week.
