Trump has named as his special envoy to the Middle East, was in a jam.</p><p>The year was 2018 and Mr. Witkoff’s co-investor in a Manhattan hotel project had been <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/malaysian-financier-low-taek-jho-also-known-jho-low-and-former-banker-ng-chong-hwa-also-known" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">indicted</a> by the Justice Department on fraud charges. A plan to convert the hotel into luxury condominiums was also on hold. But there was a two-part rescue of sorts from the kind of real estate angels that New York property investors have increasingly turned to.</p><p>First, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund expanded its stake in the troubled hotel, Park Lane, which sits at the southern edge of Central Park. Then, in an even more crucial move, the Qatar Investment Authority last year dispatched $623 million as a leveraged buyout of Mr. Witkoff and his partners.</p><p>The transactions — involving two oil-rich sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East — are a hint of the enormous flow of dollars pouring into U.S. real estate firms from entities associated with countries like Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For Mr. Witkoff, it will create complications as he takes up his new job and will soon be negotiating with leaders of nations that are past, and potentially future, lenders to or buyers of his family real estate projects.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff, who did not respond to requests for comment, has not indicated whether he intends to step down from his post as chairman and co-chief executive of Witkoff Group, which he runs with his son Alex Witkoff.</p><p>“Steve will be an unrelenting Voice for PEACE, and make us all proud,” Mr. Trump said in <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/c90db6a955ba1084/be7e9872-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his announcement</a> of his intention to name Mr. Witkoff to his new post.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Witkoff, who has no diplomatic experience, have not yet disclosed the terms of Mr. Witkoff’s new assignment.</p><p>If he formally took a federal job, he would be required to step down from his real estate company and file a financial disclosure form detailing all of his holdings. In addition, he would be prohibited under federal law from taking any official action that could directly benefit his personal finances. He might also be required to sell off certain investments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But Mr. Witkoff might claim that he is simply working as a nongovernmental adviser to Mr. Trump. This would allow him to potentially continue to do business with Middle Eastern investors, even as he advises the White House on U.S. diplomacy in the region. The Trump transition team did not respond when asked how this would be handled.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff is slated to speak <a href="https://b.tc/conference/mena" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">next month</a> at a cryptocurrency conference in Abu Dhabi. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/technology/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html" title="">helped set up</a> the cryptocurrency company the Trump family recently launched, World Liberty, and his sons Alex and Zach are <a href="https://static.worldlibertyfinancial.com/docs/us/gold-paper.pdf#page=10" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also co-founders</a> there.</p><p>The organizers of the crypto conference have already identified Mr. Witkoff as a “special envoy to the Middle East,” even though the Trump administration has not yet started.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-2c8ef352">‘If Trump Can Do It’</h2><p>In Mr. Trump’s circle, there are already several examples of aides who went on to secure multibillion-dollar investments from Middle Eastern leaders after serving as part of the Trump administration, including Mr. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Kushner, in fact, played a very similar role as the one Mr. Witkoff has been tapped to take over, helping the first Trump administration negotiate an agreement, called the Abraham Accords, that led to normalization of relations between Israel and two of its neighbors, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jared Kushner, President-elect Donald J.

He visited Doha, the capital of Qatar, <a href="https://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/steven-witkoff-founder-of-witkoff-group-speaks-on-a-panel-news-photo/2152513217" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in May</a> to participate in an economic forum alongside a top government official who regulates real estate projects in the country to talk about the opportunity for new projects in the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Qatar is very, really impressive,” <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiN2bfMo_CJAxV-MlkFHbTwEeoQtwJ6BAgMEAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3_G9rW47B-w&amp;usg=AOvVaw0KcNIIZ1m8fCI_9MiSk6jt&amp;opi=89978449" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Witkoff said</a> during his appearance at the real-estate forum, adding later in his remarks: “Tourism is up.

First, the Manhattan luxury condo market took a downturn, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-28/manhattan-developer-ices-plans-for-central-park-luxury-condos" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and by 2016</a> Mr. Witkoff put the conversion plans on hold.</p><p>Two years later, Mr. Low was indicted by the Justice Department on charges of embezzling billions of dollars from 1MBD, Malaysia’s investment development fund, and for using some of this money to make his own investments, including his share of the Park Lane Hotel. Other alleged corrupt investments by Mr. Low included a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1106931/dl#page=26" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$27 million pink diamond necklace</a> and even <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1106931/dl#page=16" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his role in backing</a> Hollywood films like “The Wolf of Wall Street,” according to the Justice Department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>No questions ever emerged about Mr. Witkoff during this investigation. Mr. Low was just an investor to him. “Little did we know we’d face circumstances like this,” Mr. Witkoff <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/nyregion/park-lane-hotel-jho-low.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> after the criminal case emerged. (Mr. Low <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/business/jho-low-1mdb-malaysia.html" title="">remains a fugitive</a> and has not been brought to trial.)</p><p>The U.S. government soon moved to seize the Park Lane Hotel as part of an effort to recover some of the assets, and involvement with Middle Eastern investors in the property accelerated.</p><p>First, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company increased its stake in the hotel, adding another $140 million, to help block <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1214041/dl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an effort by the federal government</a> to take over the hotel and secure a <a href="https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentDetail?doc_id=2019060400190006" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new loan</a> to restructure debt on the building.</p><p>That is when the Qatar Investment Authority entered the picture, through the aptly named <a href="https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentDetail?doc_id=2023081800357001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Central Acquisition Company</a>. The authority purchased the Park Lane for $622.9 million, buying out Mr. Witkoff.</p><h2 id="link-6bb03484">‘Massive Involvement’</h2><p>These investments came as no surprise.</p><p>Sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East — a relatively tiny area of the world — represent about $5 trillion, or more than 40 percent of the money in government-owned accounts, according to <a href="https://globalswf.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Global SWF</a>, which tracks these funds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><a href="https://www.qia.qa/en/portfolio/Pages/default.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Qatar</a>’s fund alone, with a combined total of nearly $800 billion in assets under management. has been on a buying spree in Manhattan, pouring an estimated <a href="https://therealdeal.com/magazine/february-2024/the-riyals-in-real-estate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1 billion</a> into real estate in New York City last year, according to The Real Deal, a real estate trade magazine.</p><p>The Middle East-based funds have become vital players not just in the real estate industry, but also in venture capital and private equity firms across the United States, although the sovereign wealth firms often do not publish details on where they are putting their money.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump and Mr. Witkoff have been friends and business partners for more than two decades.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“Massive involvement, just massive,” said Salar Ghahramani, a Pennsylvania State University law professor who studies the industry’s involvement in the United States. “They have grown exponentially in terms of assets.”</p><p>The Gulf state sovereign wealth firms, Mr. Ghahramani added, have in many cases become increasingly political, as well, using their wealth to help promote their own foreign policy goals. He pointed to, as an example, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which financed the upstart professional league LIV Golf and then sponsored a series of golf tournaments at courses owned by the Trump family. The government there, in an effort to diversify its economy and burnish its reputation, has <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/saudi-arabia-sportswashing-investment-sports/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spent billions</a> in recent years on professional sports teams and events.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Mr. Kushner has already demonstrated how profitable serving as an adviser to Mr. Trump on Middle East matters can be.
