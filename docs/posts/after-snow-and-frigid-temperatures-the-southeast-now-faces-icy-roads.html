The effects of the storm were not over, they told residents, and driving remained a hazard on untreated roads still frozen with slippery ice.</p><p>While temperatures briefly rose above freezing in parts of Louisiana, southern Alabama and Mississippi, nighttime temperatures plummeted in areas including Georgia, northern Florida and coastal communities in the Carolinas, causing snow and ice to refreeze on roads. Morning commuters faced an increased risk of black ice, the slick patches that can form unpredictably and almost invisibly because they blend in with the asphalt.</p><p>“Ice is ice, and it will present a hazard to motorists if they’re not prepared,” Richard Bann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The threat is worse in a region that is unaccustomed to severely cold weather, and where snow plows are not regularly well stocked. Temperatures as low as 12 degrees Fahrenheit were possible on Thursday morning in parts of Southern Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Florida panhandle, according to the National Weather Service, which issued an extreme cold warning for the area through midmorning. </p><p>The storm has already disrupted the region, with scores of schools canceling classes this week, airports delaying or canceling flights and travel becoming nearly impossible. Hundreds of flights were canceled through Thursday morning and several Southeastern airports paused operations. </p><p>Charleston International Airport in South Carolina closed down on Wednesday because of ice and snowy conditions, and it was not clear early Thursday when it would reopen. At New Orleans International Airport, all flights departing before noon on Thursday were canceled, although airlines were planning to resume operations in the afternoon. </p><p>Tallahassee International Airport in Florida and the regional and international airports in Mobile, Ala., were expected to restart operations on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Fueled by a whirling mass of Arctic air, the storm has also killed at least 10 people in Texas, Alabama and Georgia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>And cities received record amounts of snow: Mobile reported 7.5 inches; Pensacola, Fla., received 7.6 inches, breaking its three-inch record from 1895; and New Orleans saw eight inches, more than Anchorage got this month.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/multimedia/23nat-winter-storm-south-mgfw/23nat-winter-storm-south-mgfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/multimedia/23nat-winter-storm-south-mgfw/23nat-winter-storm-south-mgfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/multimedia/23nat-winter-storm-south-mgfw/23nat-winter-storm-south-mgfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A city street dusted with snow.

In a statement, the Tallahassee Police Department confirmed its officers had arrived to the scene of the wintry chaos after people had complained of being hit in the head with snowballs.
