The effects of the storm were not over, they told residents, and driving remained a hazard on untreated roads still frozen with slippery ice.</p><p>While temperatures briefly rose above freezing in parts of Louisiana, southern Alabama and Mississippi, nighttime temperatures plummeted in areas including Georgia, northern Florida and coastal communities in the Carolinas, causing snow and ice to refreeze on roads. Morning commuters faced an increased risk of black ice, the slick patches that can form unpredictably and almost invisibly because they blend in with the asphalt.</p><p>“Ice is ice, and it will present a hazard to motorists if they’re not prepared,” Richard Bann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The threat is worse in a region that is unaccustomed to severely cold weather, and where snow plows are not regularly well stocked. Temperatures as low as 12 degrees Fahrenheit were possible on Thursday morning in parts of Southern Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Florida panhandle, according to the National Weather Service, which issued an extreme cold warning for the area through midmorning. </p><p>The storm has already disrupted the region, with scores of schools canceling classes this week, airports delaying or canceling flights and travel becoming nearly impossible. Hundreds of flights were canceled through Thursday morning and several Southeastern airports paused operations. </p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
