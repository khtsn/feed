    <h1>Trump Aides Evacuated Offices After Prank Sparked Bugging Fears</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Watergate this was not.</p><p>Last week, the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee offices in West Palm Beach, Fla., were abuzz with talk of listening devices and espionage, possibly by a foreign government. The police were called and the offices were closed for a forensic search.</p><p>The reality was more Charlie Chaplin than John le Carré.</p><p>A plastic prank device that can be purchased on Amazon for $13.97 was the cause of the problem.</p><p>A police report from the West Palm Beach police department, obtained by The New York Times, detailed the incident. Devices were found on Thursday after people heard beeping under a staff member’s desk at the Trump campaign offices. When Trump officials searched, they found additional devices, for a total of three.</p><p>“FOUND POTENTIAL LISTENING DEVICES // HEARD BEEPING BY DESKS // INTERNAL SECURITY ALSO FOUND DEVICE,” the police report reads. The person making the report, according to the document, “THINKS THEY HAVE FOUND LISTENING DEVICES ‘BUGS; IN THE OFFICE.’”</p></div></div>
