    <h1>Kremlin Says U.S. Will Release a Russian in American Custody</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>American officials had no immediate comment.</p><p>Mr. Fogel, who had spent more than three years in prison in Russia, returned to the United States from Moscow on Tuesday on a private jet with Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East envoy, whose portfolio has expanded to include Russia and its war in Ukraine.</p><p>He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-white-house-fogel-russia.html" title="">greeted at the White House</a> by Mr. Trump, whom he praised and thanked for arranging his release. </p><p>While the White House referred to Mr. Fogel’s release as an “exchange,” it was not immediately clear who, or what, the Kremlin would get out of the deal. </p><p>Mr. Fogel, 63, had worked at the Anglo-American School of Moscow for almost 10 years before being arrested at a Moscow airport in August 2021. </p><p>He was found to have been traveling with cannabis, which his lawyer has said was intended to alleviate back pain. Mr. Fogel was found guilty in June 2022 for the Russian authorities said was engaging in “large-scale drug smuggling” and sentenced to 14 years at a labor camp.</p></div></div>
