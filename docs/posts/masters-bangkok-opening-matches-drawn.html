		<p>The opening matches for the Swiss stage of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> have been drawn. They are as follows:</p>



<p>The draw was conducted following the conclusion of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2276/champions-tour-2025-emea-kickoff" target="_blank">EMEA Kickoff</a>, with Vitality&#39;s win over Liquid marking the end of the last Kickoff tournament.</p>

<p>To conduct the draw, the eight attending teams were split into two pools based on their Kickoff placement. Pool A consisted of the four Kickoff winners as the number one seeds from their region, while Pool B consisted of all the runner ups as the number two seeds. Teams from Pool A were then drawn against teams from Pool B.</p>

<p>Additionally, no regional matchups were allowed in the first round of Swiss. This came into play, as DRX was originally drawn to face T1. Since both teams are from Pacific league, T1 was swapped with Sentinels to remedy the issue.</p>
