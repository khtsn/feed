Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and his family were forced to flee from the governor’s official residence early Sunday after an arson attack severely damaged the mansion.</p><p>The authorities arrested a man who they said had broken into the mansion in Harrisburg, Pa., and thrown objects into the home that started at least two fires and caused significant damage. No one was injured in the attack.</p><p>The man, who they identified as Cody Balmer, 38, has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism and other offenses.

They were rushed to safety while firefighters extinguished the flames, he said. The F.B.I. was assisting in the investigation, he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat, rose to prominence last year when he was on the short list of possible running mates for Kamala Harris, the party’s nominee for president. He helped oversee the law enforcement response to the assassination attempt against Donald J. Trump in Butler, Pa., who was then campaigning for president.</p><p>The 51-year-old governor, who has said that there is too much vitriol in American politics, noted that the attack on the residence occurred shortly after his family and others members of the local Jewish community had celebrated the first night of Passover in the state dining room.</p><h2 id="link-760e3e42">The suspect admitted starting the fire, officials said.</h2><p>The authorities said surveillance footage showed a person checking out the governor’s mansion before scaling a fence and using a hammer to break a window on the south side of the residence. He threw an object into the house, igniting a fire, the Dauphin County District Attorney said in a statement.</p><p>He then broke into the building through a window on the east side and threw at least one more object into the house, starting another fire, before fleeing, the district attorney said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Once state police became aware of a security breach on the property, they set out looking for an intruder, officials said.
