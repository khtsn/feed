The Russian prison service said four guards had been killed and three injured in the attack.</p><p>Four of the attackers were killed by snipers as the Russian commandos stormed the prison late Friday afternoon, ending the mutiny. It was unclear how many inmates had joined the revolt.</p><p>“Criminals were liquidated during a special operation to free hostages in IK-19,” Volgograd’s governor, Andrei Bocharov, <a href="https://t.me/rgn_34/6965" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a Telegram post</a>, referring to the facility by its Russian initials.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The mutiny is the latest attack attributed to Islamist militants in Russia, underlining the Kremlin’s difficulties in stemming domestic terrorism amid a prolonged war in Ukraine, which has recently spilled into Russian territory.</p><p>The state news agency TASS reported that at least some the attackers were natives of Central Asia, a predominantly Muslim region that has long been the main source of labor migrants in Russia. Two attackers came from Uzbekistan and another two from Tajikistan. Three of those men were serving time on drug charges and another for manslaughter, TASS reported.</p><p>Videos verified by The Times showed men brandishing a handmade black flag with Islamic references written in Arabic walking around the prison’s courtyard. In one video, an attacker holds a knife to the throat of a bleeding guard, who is seen in another video slumped against the wall.</p><p>Speaking to the camera, another inmate blames the revolt on the guards’ alleged abuse of Muslim prisoners, the broader discrimination faced by Muslims in Russia and the Russian government’s aggression against Muslims abroad, including in Syria. The Russian Army backs the Syrian government in a civil war against the Islamic State, among other factions, an alliance that has prompted calls for revenge from Islamist groups.</p><p>The inmate claimed that guards were taking away Muslim prisoners’ books and prayer mats, and forcing them to shave, disregarding their religious beliefs.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“This is the revenge for all our Muslim brothers,” he said. “Wake up and join the jihad.”</p><p>The videos first appeared on message boards associated with the Islamic State, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, a private organization that specializes in tracking extremist groups. They were later picked up by Russian social media sites.</p><p>The inmate claimed the mutineers had controlled the entire IK-19, a maximum-security prison, which can house 1,200 inmates, and held “many” hostages.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Russian law enforcement officers in Surovikino, Russia, on Friday after inmates seized hostages at the prison.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The mutiny prompted an unusually rapid response from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who said during a regular meeting of Russia’s National Security Council on Friday that he had been briefed on the attack by the head of the country’s prison service. </p><p>In June, gunmen simultaneously attacked Christian and Jewish places of worship in the predominantly Muslim Russian region of Dagestan, killing 22. It was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/world/europe/russia-attack-dagestan.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">deadliest terrorist attack in the region</a> in 14 years.</p></div></div><div><div><p>A week earlier, armed prisoners claiming affiliation with the Islamic State took several guards hostage in a pretrial detention center in Rostov, another region of southern Russia. Security forces stormed the facility hours later, killing the attackers and freeing the hostages.</p><p>And in March, members of Islamic State from Tajikistan staged the deadliest terrorist attack in Russia in more than a decade, killing nearly 150 people at a Moscow concert hall venue.</p><p>The government and state media have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/24/world/europe/russia-moscow-concert-hall-attack.html?searchResultPosition=8" title="">played down the Islamist affiliation of the attackers</a> in all those cases, including the Friday mutiny.</p><p>Since invading Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin has tried to blame all major acts of violence in the country on Kyiv or its Western backers, usually without providing evidence. Analysts said this narrative was an attempt to rally the population behind the war and deflect responsibility from the domestic intelligence agencies, which have shifted their resources to Ukrainian threats, real or imagined, since the invasion.</p><p>Mufti Damir Muhetdinov, the chairman of a pro-Kremlin group, the Religious Council of Muslims, echoed this narrative on Friday. In a statement, Mufti Muhetdinov said the attack in Volgograd could have been planned in the West to stoke religious strife in Russia and damage its relations with Muslim nations. He did not provide evidence.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ilya Yashin, a Russian opposition leader who spent two years in Russian jails, said on Friday that the government’s focus on quashing domestic dissent to the war had diverted its focus from fighting Islamic terrorism, which has plagued the country since the 1990s.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ilyayashin/status/1826971858899472661?s=46&amp;t=K3SvXH3kNhMXe_RXbMaO0w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a message posted on X</a>, formerly Twitter, Mr. Yashin said the prison’s terrorism watch lists today included thousands of inmates who had been deemed susceptible to extremism or terrorism because they had commented on antiwar social media posts, sent money to pro-Ukraine or antiwar organizations, or participated in antiwar protests.</p><p>“The lists include a great number of absolutely peaceful people,” he wrote. “The real bloodthirsty criminals are often simply ignored.”</p><p>Malachy Browne<!-- --> and <!-- -->Aritz Parra<!-- --> contributed reporting from London, and <!-- -->Eric Schmitt<!-- --> from Washington.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anatoly Kurmanaev covers Russia and its transformation following the invasion of Ukraine.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anatoly-kurmanaev">More about Anatoly Kurmanaev</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/islamic-state">Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Women’s Safety in India: </strong>The rape and murder of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/asia/india-women-safety-rape.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">a trainee doctor at a hospital in Kolkata</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/asia/india-women-safety-rape.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article"> </a>has raised uncomfortable truths about a country that wants to be a global leader.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Plant Messiah’</strong><strong>: </strong>Carlos Magdalena, whose botanical adventures have shades of Indiana Jones, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/europe/carlos-magdalena-flowers-royal-botanic-gardens-kew.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">was a driving force in saving the world’s smallest water lily</a> and finding the largest one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Old Bombs, Deep Lakes</strong><strong>: </strong>Switzerland is offering $58,000 in prize money for ideas to remove munitions from the depths, in case they start polluting.
