That has prompted investors to rethink the large returns they are expecting on the heady valuations of companies like Nvidia, whose equipment powers the most advanced A.I. systems, as well as the enormous investments that companies like Google, Meta and OpenAI are making to build their A.I. businesses.</p><p>U.S. markets tumbled at the open, with the S&amp;P 500 slumping more than 2 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 3.5 percent. Tech stocks also dented markets in Europe and Japan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The pain was concentrated at companies at the forefront of the A.I. boom, including the multitrillion-dollar behemoths that drove the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/business/stock-market-2025-predictions.html" title="">largest back-to-back annual gains</a> for U.S. markets since the 1990s. Investors have fretted about whether the rally has gone too far, leaving little room for error at the small group of tech firms that now dominates the market.</p><p>For those waiting for something to shake the faith in tech valuations, DeepSeek could be the start of a new phase in how investors think about A.I., said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. He called the latest reports of increased competition in the industry a “big slap in the face” for investors that could reset the way they calculate risk.</p><p>In addition to Nvidia, other chipmakers like Arm, Broadcom and Micron, and semiconductor equipment specialists like ASML recorded substantial declines in value.</p><p>DeepSeek unveiled its new system last month but grabbed the tech world’s attention with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research paper</a> last week detailing how it built the technology. Its emergence “serves as a reminder that competition in the global A.I. arena is intensifying, and Nvidia may not be in the pole position forever,” Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Bank, <a href="https://www.home.saxo/en-gb/content/articles/equities/chinas-deepseek-could-this-be-a-turning-point-for-us-tech-27012025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a research note.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/27/multimedia/27stocks-jtpz/27stocks-jtpz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/27/multimedia/27stocks-jtpz/27stocks-jtpz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/27/multimedia/27stocks-jtpz/27stocks-jtpz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man at the New York Stock Exchange holding a tablet standing amid large computer screens and TV monitors." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/27/multimedia/27stocks-jtpz/27stocks-jtpz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/27/multimedia/27stocks-jtpz/27stocks-jtpz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/27/multimedia/27stocks-jtpz/27stocks-jtpz-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/27/multimedia/27stocks-jtpz/27stocks-jtpz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/25df4912-a7a9-565c-81c0-250f698962f3" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Monday’s moves cast a cloud over the markets as Meta, Microsoft and others prepare to present their latest quarterly earnings this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Seth Wenig/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Shares of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/technology/meta-data-center.html" title="">Meta</a>, which last week announced a big jump in its spending plans for data centers, the huge warehouses of computers that power artificial intelligence, fell about 1 percent. Google’s parent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/technology/google-ai-agent-gemini.html" title="">Alphabet</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/technology/microsoft-quarterly-revenue-profits.html" title="">Microsoft</a>, which have also bet heavily on A.I., fell 3 percent. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/technology/trump-openai-stargate-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">Oracle</a>, which is a partner in a joint venture with OpenAI and SoftBank unveiled at an event with President Trump last week, fell 8 percent. SoftBank’s stock also shed more than 8 percent of its value in Tokyo.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The moves cast a cloud over the tech giants as Meta, Microsoft and others prepare to present their latest quarterly earnings this week. Looking past their bumper profits in the past, analysts could aim pointed questions at executives about financial prospects in the future under stiffer global competition.</p><p>(The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two tech companies have denied the suit’s claims).</p><p>The turmoil also hit the stocks of utility companies that have opened new lines of business serving the voracious power needs of data centers. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/business/energy-environment/constellation-energy-calpine.html" title="">Constellation Energy</a> plunged 20 percent.</p><p>U.S. Treasury bonds rallied, as they often do when investors seek havens during times of turbulence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump has promised to accelerate the production of American-made A.I. to compete against China for global leadership in the technology. On Thursday, he signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> aimed at “removing barriers” to the development of artificial intelligence. As the U.S. government works to maintain the country’s lead in the A.I. race, it is trying to limit the number of powerful chips, like those made by Nvidia, that can be sold to China and other rivals.</p><p>While acknowledging the potential of DeepSeek’s systems, analysts at Bernstein noted that their “initial reaction does not include panic.” Any computing capacity freed up by more efficient A.I. systems would be absorbed by fast-growing demand, they said: “We are still going to need, and get, a lot of chips.”</p><p>Danielle Kaye<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jason Karaian is the business news director, based in London.
