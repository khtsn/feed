It was the third such attack in roughly as many months, heightening concerns among experts about the potential for a nuclear disaster.</p><p>The agency said that the Russian strikes had hit electrical substations crucial for Ukraine’s three operational nuclear plants to transmit and receive power. While no direct damage to reactors was reported, all of them reduced output as a precautionary measure and one was disconnected from the grid.</p><p>“Ukraine’s energy infrastructure is extremely fragile and vulnerable, putting nuclear safety at great risk,” Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the agency, the I.A.E.A., said in a <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-262-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement released late Thursday</a>.</p><p>Russia has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-attack.html" title="">targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure</a> since the war’s first winter two years ago, in an effort to collapse its grid and make life miserable for its citizens. For most of that time, attacks focused on thermal and hydroelectric plants, along with their transmission facilities, causing widespread blackouts across the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Still, Ukraine’s grid did not collapse, mainly because much of its power generation relies on nuclear plants, which had been largely spared from air assaults.</p><p>Russia’s strategy of destroying substations connected to nuclear power plants is newer and appears intended to collapse Ukraine’s last major power generation capacity, experts say. The attacks against the substations began in late August, the I.A.E.A. reported.</p><p>The substations are essential because they distribute power from the reactors to the rest of the country. Ukraine’s three operational nuclear plants, a total of nine reactors, provide about two-thirds of the country’s power generation capacity today, according Shaun Burnie, a nuclear expert at Greenpeace Ukraine. A fourth nuclear plant, near the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, was captured by the Russian forces at the beginning of the war.</p><p>The substations also have a second, no less critical function: They deliver electricity to the nuclear plants that is needed to cool the reactors and spent fuel. “Loss of cooling function at one or more reactors would inevitably lead to nuclear fuel melt and large-scale radiological release,” Greenpeace warned in a note shared with The New York Times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fixing a power plant damaged by a Russian missile strike at an undisclosed location in Ukraine on Thursday.

They said that “further damage to Ukraine’s electricity system could lead to an electricity blackout which would increase the risk of operating nuclear reactors losing access to the grid for powering their safety systems.” Such an event, the statement said, could lead to a serious nuclear disaster.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Ukrainian authorities have tried to highlight the new threat in recent months. President Volodymyr Zelensky <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84MZJM7jw4U&amp;ab_channel=UnitedNations" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the United Nations General Assembly in September</a> that Russia was planning potential catastrophic attacks on Ukraine’s “nuclear power plants and the infrastructure, aiming to disconnect the plants from the power grid.”</p><p>In response, the Ukrainian government agreed with the I.A.E.A. in September to deploy monitoring missions to substations linked to nuclear plants, to assess the damage and try to prevent further attacks. The agency <a href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/documents/gov2024-63.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visited seven substations this fall</a>, documenting “extensive damage” and concluding that the grid’s ability “to provide a reliable off-site power supply” to nuclear plants had been “significantly reduced.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
