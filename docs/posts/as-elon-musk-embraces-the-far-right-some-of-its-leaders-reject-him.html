In another <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1600944669009281024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>, Ms. Loomer, who had been booted from the platform in 2018 for writing an anti-Muslim message, complimented Mr. Musk’s commitment to “free speech.”</p><p>Ms. Loomer is now sharing a different message about Mr. Musk. She and a prominent group of right-wing figures — many of whom have enjoyed more visibility on the platform, renamed X — are increasingly raising alarms about Mr. Musk’s influence over President-elect Donald J. Trump and what they characterize as his willingness to silence critics on his social network.</p><p>Apart from Ms. Loomer, high-profile conservatives including Charlie Kirk and Stephen K. Bannon have started speaking out against Mr. Musk or his policy positions. Batya Ungar-Sargon, the conservative opinion editor of Newsweek, recently called Mr. Musk a “shill” who censors opponents. Mike Davis, a lawyer close to Mr. Trump, <a href="https://x.com/mrddmia/status/1872510662246813857" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Mr. Musk</a> on social media to “stay in your lane.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Their criticism followed X’s moves to suspend or otherwise restrict dozens of accounts that raised concerns about Mr. Musk and blocked links to articles about him, citing violations of its terms of service. Over the weekend, Mr. Musk drew further ire from conservatives for using his X account to attack Nigel Farage, an ally of Mr. Trump and the head of Britain’s far-right Reform UK party.</p><p>Mr. Musk, 53, has rapidly vaporized some of the good will he built with Mr. Trump’s supporters after campaigning heavily for the Republican presidential candidate last year. Some right-wing personalities who championed Mr. Musk’s foray into Republican politics now say they feel deceived and worry that their agenda may be sidelined in favor of his own.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
