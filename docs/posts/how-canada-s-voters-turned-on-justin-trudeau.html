Trump and his acolytes.</p><p>He burst onto the international scene in 2015, a newly elected young leader of Canada. </p><p>And he spent the next decade building a brand around being a feminist, an environmentalist, a refugee and Indigenous rights advocate, pursuing the same message of change and hope as Barack Obama.</p><p>While he drew fawning reviews in the news media — including over his poster boy looks — his honeymoon with Canadians really lasted only about two years; by 2017, a series of controversies had already tarnished his picture-perfect image.</p><p>His party went on to lose the popular vote in two elections, in 2019 and 2021, requiring him to form minority governments propped up by a small opposition party. That support, too, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/world/canada/trudeau-liberal-party-agreement.html" title="">has now evaporated</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Today, Mr. Trudeau finds himself — like other Western leaders — facing an angry constituency and losing control.</p><p>He will soon either call elections that he’ll most likely lose, or he’ll step down as leader of his party and as prime minister, and let a different leader take the Liberals to the ballot box next year.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
