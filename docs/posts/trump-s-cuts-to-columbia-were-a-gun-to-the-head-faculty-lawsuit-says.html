The Trump administration’s actions “have created instability and a deep chilling effect on college campuses across the country,” the statement said.</p><p>Todd Wolfson, the president of the A.A.U.P., a faculty rights group, said in the statement that the funding cuts were part of a larger effort to target campus free speech, which would have consequences beyond Columbia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The Trump administration’s threats and coercion at Columbia are part of a clear authoritarian playbook meant to crush academic freedom and critical research in American higher education,” Mr. Wolfson said.</p><p>The funding cuts have imperiled vital scientific and public health research that contributes to the “prosperity of all Americans,” the groups said. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/nyregion/columbia-research-grants-trump.html" title="">cuts have effectively terminated numerous projects</a>, including research into early cancer detection, the effects of Covid-19 on pregnancy and links between diabetes and dementia.</p><p>The lawsuit names as defendants several federal agencies and officials, including the Justice Department, the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services. The funding cuts “represent an existential ‘gun to the head’ for a university,” the complaint said.</p><p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html" title="">Columbia capitulated to several of the Trump administration’s demands</a>, pledging that the university would overhaul its campus security protocols, protest policies and Middle Eastern studies department.</p><p>The federal government has not agreed to restore Columbia’s funding. Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service, which is part of the General Services Administration, one of the agencies calling for changes at the university, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-response.html" title="">said that Columbia’s policy changes</a> were “early steps” and a “positive sign.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Several of the agencies named in the lawsuit did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. Spokespeople for two of them, the General Services Administration and the Justice Department, declined to comment.</p><p>A number of Columbia professors have opposed the Trump administration’s efforts to punish the university and some students for pro-Palestinian protests. On Monday, at least 50 faculty members gathered outside the university’s gates to protest the cuts and the school’s response. Some held signs proclaiming, “Protect Academic Freedom” and “Columbia Fight Back.”</p><p>Reinhold Martin, the president of Columbia’s A.A.U.P. chapter and a professor of architecture, said in the joint statement that faculty members had a responsibility to speak up.</p><p>“The integrity of civic discourse and the freedoms that form the basis of a democratic society are under attack,” Mr. Martin said. “We have to stand up.”</p><p>The Trump administration faces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/trump-administration-lawsuits.html" title="">a slew of lawsuits challenging budget freezes</a> across the federal government. But the actions at issue in this suit are different, according to Orion Danjuma, counsel at Protect Democracy, because the administration’s letter to the university represents a “ransom note” demanding “key changes about the way it operates.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Danjuma added that he was not aware of other instances of the government canceling grants to force policy changes at a private institution.</p><p>“That is all new, and the damage is quite severe,” he said.</p><p>The lawsuit also argues that the administration violated provisions of Title VI, a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting discrimination in institutions that receive federal funding. The administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/nyregion/columbia-trump-administration-funding-fight.html" title="">has cited Title VI as justification</a> for its decision to cut Columbia’s funding, but the suit argues that the administration failed to comply with some of Title VI’s requirements.</p><p>Some of the steps the administration failed to follow, the suit asserts, include holding a hearing, providing evidence and giving the university the opportunity to voluntarily comply with the White House’s demands. These requirements were created, the groups argued in the statement, to “prevent the government from exercising too much unfettered control over funding recipients.”</p><p>The administration has started to scrutinize dozens of other colleges and universities. Last week, the White House announced that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-to-pause-175-million-for-university-of-pennsylvania-over-transgender-policy.html" title="">suspend $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania</a> because of the school’s policies on transgender students’ participation in sports.</p><p>“They have said essentially — sort of said with glee — that they’re planning to bankrupt a host of other universities that they perceive as being enemies to their preferred viewpoint,” Mr. Danjuma said. “So we know that this is not the end, this is the beginning of a broader attack on civil society and higher education.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alyce McFadden is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alyce-mcfadden">More about Alyce McFadden</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/american-federation-of-teachers">American Federation of Teachers</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>In the Ring, His Parents’ Money Doesn’t Matter:</strong> Sean O’Bradaigh grew up in a world of Manhattan privilege, but private schools and ski vacations have nothing on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/nyregion/in-the-ring-it-doesnt-matter-how-much-money-his-parents-have.html">dream of being a professional boxer</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Subway Ninja’:</strong> In the lowest moment of Selwyn Bernardez’s life, he attacked a stranger with a sword.
