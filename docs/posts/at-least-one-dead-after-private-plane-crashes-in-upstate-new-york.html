Ms. Salvatore did not say how many people had been killed or if there were any survivors. The two passengers have not been identified.</p><p>A private plane of the same model departed Westchester County Airport in White Plains, N.Y., shortly after 11:30 a.m., flying north toward Hudson before turning east at about noon, according to the tracking site Flightradar24. Minutes later, the craft disappeared from the site near Copake, a small town bordering Taconic State Park near the Massachusetts border.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That plane was registered to a company based outside Boston, according to F.A.A. records.</p><p>Ms. Salvatore said that, in addition to officers from the sheriff’s department, personnel from the New York State Police and a local fire department responded to the scene. Law enforcement officials received a 911 call about the crash at around noon, she said.</p><p>At that time, the weather in the area was mostly mild, with overcast skies and wind gusts up to 26 miles per hour, <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/data/obhistory/KPSF.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the National Weather Service</a>.</p><p>Snow and moisture on the ground were hampering response efforts, Ms. Salvatore said.</p><p>“It’s in the middle of a field and it’s pretty muddy, so accessibility is difficult,” she said.</p><p>It was not immediately clear Saturday afternoon what had caused the plane to crash, Ms. Salvatore said, but local law enforcement planed to conduct interviews in the neighborhood to learn more.</p><p>The F.A.A. and the National Transportation Safety Board are also investigating the crash, according to the aviation agency’s statement.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alyce McFadden is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
