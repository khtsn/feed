Trump’s campaign surveyed likely voters in swing states about what political messages stuck with them.</p><p>Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s message, these voters said, centered on how Mr. Trump mishandled the coronavirus pandemic and was unfit for office. But for Mr. Trump, those surveyed echoed more than a dozen different messages, including his false claims about the virus, his third Supreme Court nomination and complaints that he deserved a Nobel Peace Prize. Just 3 percent of the voters recalled something specific Mr. Trump had said about Mr. Biden.</p><p>Now, some Trump advisers and allies say privately they are concerned that the dynamic may be repeating itself four years later. They worry that Mr. Trump’s impetuousness and scattershot style on the campaign trail needlessly risk victory in battleground states where the margin for error is increasingly narrow.</p><p>At a time when his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, has stepped up her attacks on him as “unstable,” Mr. Trump has struggled to publicly hone his message by veering off script and ramping up personal attacks on Ms. Harris that allies have urged him to rein in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“When he’s good, he’s great, and when he’s off message, he’s not so great,” said David Urban, a Trump adviser. “I don’t think anyone is really changing their mind at this point, but when he distracts from his biggest, broadest messaging, it’s counterproductive because the Harris campaign uses it to turn out their voters.”</p><p>During a speech on Saturday in California, he described mail-in ballots as “<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/sx0eJoe5XsK_hj2AIL7cTdaUVfHIsYMynxbwXi9UBh45Eec55hzBROSn-Tb6ZAjuveFvC0ibe0idQhY_dXLlQn0R51M?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=3184.02" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">so corrupt</a>,” reviving one of his false attacks on the 2020 election results, and did a play-by-play of his internal thoughts when he watched SpaceX, Elon Musk’s spaceflight company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/science/space-starship-launch-landing.html" title="">fly a rocket</a> back onto its launch site.</p><p>On Sunday, in response to a question on Fox News about the possibility of foreign adversaries’ meddling in the election, he reverted to autocratic language by saying “the bigger problem is the enemy from within.” On Monday, he halted a town-hall event in suburban Philadelphia after five questions when two people in the crowd needed medical attention. He spent roughly the next half-hour playing D.J., swaying and grooving in front of his crowd to a playlist he curated from the stage. “Let’s just listen to music,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/trump-town-hall-dj-music.html" title="">said</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>When his Pennsylvania event was interrupted, Mr. Trump decided to play D.J. for his audience and swayed to the music while onstage. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Last week, he canceled a CBS interview on “60 Minutes,” in which he and Ms. Harris were both scheduled to appear — and has not stopped talking about it. He complained about it during events in Detroit and Reno, Nev., and again on Monday in a social media <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113304060401145581" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post at 1:12 a.m.</a></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the Economic Club of Chicago on Tuesday, he answered a question about whether he would break up Google by complaining about a Justice Department lawsuit against Virginia election officials. When he was reminded the question was about Google, he said he “called the head of Google the other day” to grouse about the difficulty of finding positive news stories about his campaign on the company’s search page.</p><p>During the same event, Mr. Trump suggested his digressions were part of a communication strategy when his interviewer tried to focus on a question.</p><p>“You’ve got to be able to finish a thought because it’s very important,” Mr. Trump told the interviewer, John Micklethwait, the editor in chief of Bloomberg News. “This is big stuff we’re talking about. You can’t go that quickly.”</p><p>Mr. Micklethwait pointed out that Mr. Trump had started talking about reserve currency and then moved to a story about President Emmanuel Macron of France, among other digressions. “It’s called ‘the weave,’” Mr. Trump said, using a phrase he often uses to describe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/us/elections/trump-speeches-weave.html" title="">his speaking style</a>, as he waved his hand in front of him to suggest he was connecting various dots.</p><p>Ms. Harris and her campaign have gone on the offensive by using Mr. Trump’s rambling against him, attacking him in ads, in speeches on the campaign trail and in interviews.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Internal Harris campaign research showed that one of the most effective ways to persuade voters to support the vice president was by portraying Mr. Trump as unstable and Ms. Harris as a steady leader who would strengthen America’s security, according to two Harris officials who insisted on anonymity to describe private data.</p><p>In the past two weeks, the Harris campaign has flooded the airwaves in battleground states with a pair of television ads to underscore these themes. One spot features <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/harris-ad-former-trump-aides-unfit.html" title="">warnings from Mr. Trump’s former top defense officials</a> to paint him as “too big of a risk.” Another features endorsements for Ms. Harris from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobWPTtxziQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bipartisan group of national security officials</a>.</p><p>“Even former Trump administration officials agree there’s only one candidate fit to lead our nation — and that’s Kamala Harris,” the narrator says.</p><p>The Harris campaign criticized Mr. Trump’s appearance at the Economic Club of Chicago, saying he displayed “unstable behavior” and was “angry and unfocused as he rambled on and on.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“No one has ever been more dangerous to this country than Donald Trump,” Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said on Monday at a campaign event in Wisconsin.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Harris campaign criticized Mr. Trump’s appearance at the Economic Club of Chicago, describing him as “angry and unfocused.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Vondruska for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Harris said the former president was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WWnKBnHAP8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quite unstable and unfit</a>” during an interview on Monday with The Shade Room, a digital entertainment publication. In a second interview that day with the independent Black journalist Roland Martin, Ms. Harris pointed to Mr. Trump’s false claims that Haitian migrants were eating their neighbors’ pets.</p><p>“This man is dangerous,” she said.</p><p>Anna Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, which is supporting the Trump campaign, said Mr. Trump’s “message is clear and consistent: President Trump’s agenda for America’s working men and women will fix our broken economy to lower costs and secure the border to make our communities safe.” </p><p>In Prescott Valley, Ariz., on Sunday, Mr. Trump’s scripted remarks hewed tightly to the anti-immigration message that has become central to his campaign. He stayed on track for the first half-hour of the event before taking a more scenic route to the finish.</p><p>After about 25 minutes, he told the crowd he wanted to tell “<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5136900/user-clip-quick-story" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one quick story</a>” about a friend with a car plant in Mexico.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But he never finished his tale. Instead, he lost the thread one minute later as he complained that if he mispronounced one word he would be accused of being “cognitively impaired.” Then, he botched the phrase by saying President Biden was the one who was “cognitively repaired” and referred to the election as three and a half months away, not three and a half weeks.</p><p>About 20 minutes later, Mr. Trump seemed ready to wrap up his speech. He promised the crowd would see him again soon and said he was thinking about residents on the East Coast suffering after the recent storms.</p><p>“So in closing,” Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5136904/user-clip-closing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">continued</a>, “I just want to say Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist rated even worse than Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas.”</p><p>He proceeded to speak for 17 more minutes.</p><p>Taylor Robinson<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael C.
