By Sunday, firefighters had suppressed the flames and contained the blaze around roughly a quarter of its perimeter to prevent it from spreading, officials said at a news conference on Sunday. The wind gusts that fueled the flames on Saturday had slowed to 25 miles per hour on Sunday.</p><p>But strong air currents combined with dry conditions in the <a href="https://pb.state.ny.us/central-pine-barrens/overview/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Long Island Pine Barrens</a> could yet pose a problem, said Lewis Scott, the second assistant chief of the Westhampton Beach Fire Department.</p><p>“The weather is still a very significant concern and threat to us. We are hoping for some moisture to come in,” Chief Scott said at the news conference. “It’s not looking like that in the very near future.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Fire danger risk also remained high in the Hudson Valley on Sunday, <a href="https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/wildfires/fire-danger-map" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation</a>.</p><p>The cause of the Long Island wildfire is still under investigation, the authorities said. Detectives from the Suffolk County Police Department have interviewed 911 callers, deployed drones and flown in helicopters to determine whether arson played a role.</p><p>Wildfires periodically sweep through the Pine Barrens, <a href="https://www.pinebarrens.org/bridge-to-the-barrens/fire-keeps-the-pine-in-pine-barrens/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an ecosystem that depends on fire</a> in order to flourish. But the proliferation of the <a href="https://dec.ny.gov/nature/animals-fish-plants/southern-pine-beetle" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">southern pine beetle</a>, a species native to the southern United States that kills pines and leaves behind bone-dry tree bark, might have also contributed to the rapid spread of the fires this weekend.</p><p>“There are dead trees all over because of them,” said Edward P. Romaine, the Suffolk County executive, who said thousands of trees in the area have succumbed to the insect over the last decade. “I am gravely concerned about the health and survival of the Pine Barrens as a result of that.”</p><p>By Saturday evening, at least 600 firefighters and emergency service workers had extinguished three of the fires, and the Westhampton fire was 50 percent contained.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Two structures were burned, and one firefighter had been hospitalized with second-degree burns to the face, Mr. Romaine said. Another firefighter suffered a head injury.</p><p>An HH-60W Jolly Green II helicopter from the 106th Rescue Wing and three New York Army National Guard helicopters based in Ronkonkoma helped out with the response, the New York National Guard said in a news release.</p><p>Fire trucks and crews from the Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base in Westhampton Beach were also deployed. The base was evacuated as a precautionary measure, the National Guard said.</p><p>Bill Dalton, a former chief of the Westhampton Beach Fire Department who was helping coordinate his department’s response, said several departments had deployed brush trucks, which are smaller fire trucks designed to fight wildfires.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Drones were mobilized to get a bird’s-eye view of the fires, which stretched in a seven-mile radius in the area around Westhampton and Eastport on the South Shore.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The New York State Police said on Saturday that all lanes of Sunrise Highway were closed eastbound between Exit 62 and Exit 64. County Road 31 southbound was also closed, according to the Southampton Police Department.</p><p>By early Sunday morning, both roads had reopened, <a href="https://511ny.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to data</a> from the state’s Department of Transportation.</p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a <a href="https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1898499537544659153" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state of emergency</a> on Saturday afternoon, she said on social media. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/08xp-wildfires-tfjh/08xp-wildfires-tfjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/08xp-wildfires-tfjh/08xp-wildfires-tfjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/08xp-wildfires-tfjh/08xp-wildfires-tfjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A huge plume of gray smoke is visible in the distance.
