Putin, keeping in line with their party’s traditional hawkish views about the United States’ role in upholding freedom and democracy around the globe. For years, that also translated into strong support within the G.O.P. for aiding Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.</p><p>But recently, as President Trump has cozied up to Mr. Putin and moved to normalize relations with Russia, Republicans who once vowed to uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia-republicans.html" title="">have stayed silent or moderated their tone</a>. Mr. Trump has proposed that Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/world/europe/ukraine-minerals-us-deal-rejected.html" title="">trade away</a> a 50 percent stake in its mineral resources, an idea its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, rejected last week.</p><p>On Wednesday, as representatives of the United States and Russia met for their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html" title="">most extensive conversation in years</a>, to agree to work on a peace settlement without Ukraine’s presence and to discuss the possibility of American oil companies doing hundreds of billions of dollars in business in Russia, several Republican senators dismissed the talks as preliminary.</p><p>Here’s a look at some of their statements, then and now.</p><h2 id="link-6e5925f2">Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina</h2><p><strong>What he said:</strong> “If you’re worried about being too provocative about Russia, stop worrying. Stop worrying. <a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/public-affairs-event/sens-graham-and-blumenthal-on-designating-russia-as-state-sponsor-of-terrorism/643853" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">You are not too provocative</a> — we need to up our game when it comes to Russia.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p> Mr. Graham made those remarks last June while introducing a bipartisan resolution to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, a label currently reserved for North Korea, Syria, Cuba and Iran.</p><p>He has often called Mr. Putin a “thug,” and previously compared him to Hitler. Mr. Graham has also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w3QZl7no3g" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called for</a> the Russian leader to be assassinated: “Vladimir Putin is not a legitimate leader; he is a war criminal that needs to be dealt with.”</p><p><strong>What he is saying now:</strong> Last week at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh-toxJYNSY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Munich Security Conference</a>, Mr. Graham praised Mr. Trump as a strong leader who could “get a good deal for Ukraine.” </p><p>He also voiced support for a deal Mr. Trump proposed that would grant the United States a 50 percent interest in all of Ukraine’s mineral resources in exchange for American support — the offer that Mr. Zelensky has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/world/europe/ukraine-minerals-us-deal-rejected.html" title="">rejected</a>.</p><p>“I don’t care if they meet Putin in Cleveland,” he said of the Trump administration. “I don’t care if they talk, I don’t care if they go on vacation. It doesn’t matter to me what you do as long as you get it right.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-22b2cc36">Senator John Thune of South Dakota</h2><p><strong>What he said: </strong>“America cannot retreat from the world stage. American leadership is desperately needed now more than I think any time in recent history, and we need to make sure that Ukraine has the weaponry and the resources that it needs to defeat the Russians.”</p><p> Last March, Mr. Thune pushed for the passage of a Ukraine aid bill and stressed that if the United States did not arm Ukraine that Russia would cinch a victory in Ukraine and “roll into a NATO country,” igniting a conflict that could involve American troops.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator John Thune of South Dakota previously pushed for the passage of a Ukraine aid bill and stressed that if the United States did not arm Ukraine that Russia would cinch a victory and “roll into a NATO country.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We’re going to be sending American sons and daughters,” he said in an interview on <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/sen-john-thune-on-the-2024-race-gop-leadership-and-funding-for-ukraine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PBS News Hour.</a></p><p><strong>What he is saying now: </strong>This week, Mr. Thune, now the majority leader, <a href="https://x.com/ChadPergram/status/1891977518485500200" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told reporters</a> that the conflict has “dragged on” and that the United States needed to “bring an end to the war.”</p><p>Of Ukraine, <a href="https://x.com/ChadPergram/status/1891977518485500200" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>, “at some point, they’ve got to be part of that conversation.”</p><p>“This thing’s dragged on for three years now. We need to bring an end to the war, and at some point they’ve got to be part of that conversation. So hopefully they’ll figure out a path forward that brings the war to an end, that maintains a sovereign Ukraine, and prevents the further incursion of Russia in that region, the world, in Europe.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-438b803c">Senator Jim Risch of Idaho</h2><p><strong>What he said: </strong>“Putin is not going to stop with Ukraine” if he wins the war. “If we end up in war with Russia, what we’re spending here is a drop in the bucket by comparison. I deal with this every day and it’s on my mind every day.”</p><p>Mr. Risch, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has called the Russian invasion of Ukraine a “challenge” confronting the United States and said that the nation should “<a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/rep/release/risch-on-second-anniversary-of-russias-brutal-invasion-of-ukraine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deny Russia a victory</a>.” Ahead of a vote on an aid package to Ukraine in<span>  </span>2023, Mr. Risch gave a <a href="https://www.idahopress.com/opinion/columnists/malloy-risch-fulcher-split-on-ukraine-aid/article_4fa5776a-9dd2-11ee-a85a-3fbce8ab1ab6.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">full-throated</a> defense of <a href="https://idahodispatch.com/op-ed-risch-fulcher-split-on-ukraine-aid/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">funding aid and arms</a> to the nation.</p><p>He also blamed President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for not being able to articulate the need for aiding Ukraine.</p><p><strong>What he is saying now: </strong>Mr. Risch has called the peace talks <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/senate/senate-republicans-foreign-policy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“a work in progress</a>” and said he would give the Trump administration “space” to figure out how to negotiate.</p><p>“But obviously, the Ukrainians have to be there — and the Europeans for that matter, too.”</p><h2 id="link-565fe1aa">Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa</h2><p><strong>What she has said:</strong> “The United States, Ukraine and the free world have the will and the means to stop Vladimir Putin’s tyranny.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Ernst <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgiayT-flLQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke on the Senate floor</a> in<span>  </span>2022 after joining a bipartisan delegation to Europe less than one month after Russia invaded Ukraine, and declared that Mr. Putin’s “best days are behind him.”</p><p>She criticized the Biden administration, for its actions early in the war, as attempting to appease Mr. Putin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa criticized the Biden administration for its actions early in the war attempting to appease Vladimir V.
