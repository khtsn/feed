But the recent strikes have prompted fears that the truce could unravel.</p><p>The Israeli military said the latest strike, in the Dahiya area in Beirut’s southern suburbs, had targeted a member of Hezbollah who had directed and assisted Hamas in planning a “significant and imminent” attack against Israel.</p><p>Israel attacked because the person posed an “immediate threat,” the military said on social media. It added that the Dahiya area was a key stronghold for Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party backed by Iran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hezbollah made no immediate comment on the strikes on its semiofficial page on Telegram, a social media platform.</p><p>On Friday, the Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/middleeast/israel-beirut-evacuation-hezbollah.html" title="">launched airstrikes in the same area</a>, and ordered residents in a densely populated neighborhood to evacuate. The attack was hours after rockets were fired at northern Israel from Lebanese territory.</p><p>Hezbollah denied any involvement in that attack on Israel and said it remained committed to the cease-fire. The Israeli military said it had targeted a site that stored Hezbollah’s drones.</p><p>Also on Friday, at least three people were killed in separate Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones at Israeli positions, in solidarity with its Palestinian ally, after Hamas led an attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, igniting the war in Gaza. The fighting escalated into full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah, with an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
