He said he saw little risk of such an intervention.</p><p>But President Trump, speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland about the canal on Sunday, said that “we’re going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen.”</p><p>The State Department’s <a href="https://pa.usembassy.gov/secretary-rubios-meeting-with-panamanian-president-mulino/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summary of the meeting</a> in Panama City, Mr. Rubio’s first with a foreign leader since becoming secretary of state, struck a tone that was sometimes aggressive. It said Mr. Rubio had told his host that Mr. Trump had made a “preliminary determination” that China’s government exercised control over the canal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable and that absent immediate changes, it would require the United States to take measures necessary to protect its rights under the treaty,” the State Department spokeswoman, Tammy Bruce, <a href="https://pa.usembassy.gov/secretary-rubios-meeting-with-panamanian-president-mulino/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in the summary</a>. The statement referred to Mr. Trump’s assertion that the Chinese connection to the canal violates a treaty meant to ensure its neutrality. </p><p>Ms. Bruce did not specify what those measures might be. Asked last month whether he would rule out putting military force behind his threats to reclaim the canal, which the U.S. controlled for nearly a century, Mr. Trump declined to do so.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
