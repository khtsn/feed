No it’s not. It’s a big, messy, delightful ensemble piece. So as you prepare to take this big leap into real life, here’s a little advice, If you’re willing to listen to a frog. Rather than jumping over someone to get what you want, consider reaching out your hand and taking the leap side by side because life is better when we leap together. Yeah, Jim, in the early days, he had a hand in literally everything I did. I know that you will stay connected to your families, your friends and your dreams because life’s like a movie. Write your own ending. Keep believing. Keep pretending you’ve all done just what you set out to do. And you’re just getting started. Thank you, University of Maryland. Thank you for having me. And congratulations to the Class of 2025. Yay!</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/23/multimedia/23xp-kermit-mhvz/23xp-kermit-mhvz-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Kermit took the podium in a muppet-size formal cap and gown on Thursday to deliver a commencement speech at the University of Maryland, the alma mater of his creator, Jim Henson.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Stephanie S.

Some wondered if the speech, penned by a Muppets writer and voiced by the puppeteer Matt Vogel, was an effort by the university to sidestep the difficult issues confronting American higher education, like the Trump administration’s crackdown on federal funding and cancellation of some international student visas.</p><p>The University of Maryland said it had chosen Kermit to deliver its commencement address to <a href="https://president.umd.edu/articles/announcing-our-2025-commencement-speaker" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">honor</a> the legacy of Mr. Henson, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/17/obituaries/jim-henson-puppeteer-dies-the-muppets-creator-was-53.html" title="">died in 1990</a>.</p><p>Kermit had plenty of words of wisdom, and some ribbing, for the Class of 2025 from a muppet’s life of swamp-swimming and hanging out on Sesame Street. One piece of advice, he said, was sharing life with the right people — even a spotlight-hogging pig. (Miss Piggy, Kermit <a href="https://x.com/CBSMornings/status/1925610712300150911" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> “CBS Mornings” before his address, was not among the crowd but “summering on a beach somewhere exotic.”)</p><p>From the lectern on Thursday, he said, “Life is not a solo act; no, it’s not. It’s a big, messy, delightful ensemble piece, especially when you are with your people.” He called on the graduates to help each other whenever possible. “Life is better when we leap together,” he said. </p><p>Kermit has hit the public speaking circuit before, including delivering the commencement speech in 1996 at Southampton College, then part of Long Island University. His friends on Sesame Street, from <a href="https://www.kidzsearch.com/kidztube/sesame-street-grovers-graduation-speech-elmotivation_a57dec951.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grover</a> to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=296572881366901" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cookie Monster,</a> have also delivered their own addresses to graduating classes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He told students to stay connected to their loved ones and to their dreams, “no matter how impossible they seem.”</p><p>“Life is like a movie. Write your own ending,” he said. “Keep believing, keep pretending.”</p><p>He finished by leading the audience in a singalong to “Rainbow Connection.” </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabella Kwai is a Times reporter based in London, covering breaking news and other trends.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
