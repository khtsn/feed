That is down from 2.5 percent in July and slightly softer than economist forecasts. It was the slowest annual inflation reading since early 2021.</p><p>After stripping out volatile food and fuel prices for a better sense of the underlying inflation trend, a “core” price index was a bit more stubborn on an annual basis. The core measure came in at 2.7 percent, up from 2.6 percent previously and in line with what economists had expected. But comparing prices from month to month, core inflation slowed to a modest 0.1 percent in August.</p><p>Altogether, the report offers further proof that price increases are swiftly fading. Already, that has allowed the Fed to begin to lower interest rates from a more than two-decade high of 5.3 percent. After raising borrowing costs sharply and then holding them at a high level to slow the economy and weigh down inflation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/business/economy/fed-reserve-interest-rate-cut.html" title="">officials voted last week</a> to cut rates by a larger-than-usual half percentage point. Policymakers also signaled that more rate cuts are coming, as long as inflation continues to fade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Fed’s pivot is already helping to bring down <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/business/mortgage-rates-fed-rate-cut.html" title="">mortgage rates</a>, and it could slowly trickle through the economy to stop the job market from slowing more markedly. Central bankers are trying to pull off a rare “soft landing,” in which they cool conditions enough to wrangle price increases without tempering them so much that unemployment spikes and the economy falls into a recession.</p><p>There were some signs that the economy may be pulling back — but not crashing — in the details of Friday’s report. Consumer spending, which makes up a big part of overall economic activity, grew more slowly in August, the data showed. And personal incomes picked up less than expected.</p><p>Fed officials have been struggling to figure out what is happening with the economy, as overall growth and consumption numbers look strong but the job market slows.</p><p>“While a softening labor market suggests a weakening of economic activity, other economic measures suggest ongoing strength,” Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in a <a href="https://minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/why-i-supported-cutting-rates-last-week" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent essay</a>. But overall, “it seems as though a continuation of inflation moderation and economic resilience is the most likely scenario,” he added.</p><p>Friday’s inflation figures come after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/business/cpi-inflation-august.html" title="">Consumer Price Index</a> report earlier this month also cooled. That measure, which provides a more timely reading on inflation using a different methodology, is now down to 2.5 percent from a peak of 9.1 percent in 2022. The Personal Consumption Expenditures measure <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCEPI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">peaked</a> at a more muted 7.1 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, suggested during an interview on CNBC last week that he might be willing to cut rates more rapidly if inflation slows notably in the months ahead.</p><p>“If the data starts coming in soft and continues to come in soft,” he said, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/business/economy/fed-rate-cuts-jobs-inflation.html" title="">he would be willing</a> “to be aggressive on rate cuts to get inflation closer to our target of 2 percent.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
