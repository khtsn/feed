Less than five months have passed since Syrian rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad, putting a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/syria-civil-war-rebels.html" title="">sudden end</a> to the Assad family’s brutal half-century reign. The new Syria, liberated Syria, is still rising to its feet.</p><p>But what that new nation will come to look like is an open question. While many Sunni Muslim Syrians have embraced the country’s new leaders, who espouse a conservative version of Islam, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/world/middleeast/maaloula-syria-christian-muslim-relations.html" title="">religious minorities</a> who felt protected or empowered during Mr. al-Assad’s rule greeted the takeover with anxiety.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/20/multimedia/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/20/multimedia/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/20/multimedia/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Three people in a dark room, gathered in front of a wall and shelf holding candles." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/20/multimedia/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/20/multimedia/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/20/multimedia/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/20/multimedia/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq/20int-syria-easter-02-tcjq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b69c2bd3-6bc5-5f97-9a7e-c60022d66c79" decoding="async" width="600" height="429"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Worshipers at the Orthodox Armenian Church in Damascus.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Young people who attend Al Zeitoun church in the city streets on Saturday night.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Easter, for Syria’s historically persecuted Christians, was therefore something of a test. How would the new government led by President Ahmed al-Shara, a former Al Qaeda member who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/middleeast/syria-president-ahmed-al-shara.html" title="">says he has moderated</a> and who has promised inclusivity and tolerance, handle one of Christianity’s most important holidays? Would it pass as peacefully as it had under Mr. al-Assad, who courted minority support with his secular outlook?</p><p>In the end, it was like any other Easter — at least in Damascus, the capital. The city’s ancient heart is a historically Christian quarter known as Bab Touma, which houses churches of at least a half-dozen different denominations. Purple banners and crosses festooned the neighborhood on Good Friday, and people carried lit candles the night of Holy Saturday, on their way to celebrations that lasted until early morning.</p><p>On Sunday morning, crowds of people dressed in their Easter best headed to church down cobblestone streets, the children to be rewarded with chocolate and red-dyed Easter eggs that would stain their lips pink. Young church scouts later led processions through the same streets, waving religious banners and the new Syrian flag, drumming and blaring trumpets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“I feel secure — nothing has changed,” said Angela Ammeyan, 40, who had crowded into the courtyard of an Orthodox Armenian church that lies just off the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/world/middleeast/a-link-straight-to-syrias-ancient-past-endures-as-war-creeps-closer.html" title="">Street Called Straight</a>, of biblical fame.

That, she said, had reassured her and other Christians who had initially felt uneasy about openly celebrating the holiday.</p><p>“This is a rebirth for Syria,” Ms. Ammeyan said.</p><p>But others were reserving judgment.</p><p>The celebrations might have been supported in the capital, but it was not clear whether Christians in the rest of Syria felt as free to practice openly, said Kivork Kivorkian, 80, head of a community committee at the Armenian church.</p><p>“Outside of Damascus, we don’t know,” he said.
