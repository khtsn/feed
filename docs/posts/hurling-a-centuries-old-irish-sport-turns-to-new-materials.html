The formidable, three-foot-long sticks are core to the game, which to an outsider can look like a cross between baseball, lacrosse and rugby. They are used not only to pass the ball, but also to carry it, and of course to score, either by whacking the ball over the goal’s crossbar or whipping it into the net below.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But when the country’s elite players took the field in Dublin in July, the hurleys in the hands of some of them were made of an innovative material not native to the island: bamboo.</p><p>After hundreds of years of players using ash hurleys almost exclusively, the shift has been born of necessity. A disease known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/magazine/dead-forests-and-living-memories.html" title="">ash dieback</a> has decimated forests across Europe and is expected to wipe out 90 percent of Ireland’s ash trees within the next two decades.</p><p>For a traditional sport like hurling, woven deeply into the fabric of Irish life, the prospect was alarming, threatening the very heart of the game. But the early adapters of the new sticks had good news.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sanding down a bamboo hurley in the making.

He and his father eventually settled on a bamboo composite imported from Asia, and in 2020, they launched their “Bambú” hurley — using the Irish word for the plant.</p><p>At least nine players in the championship match last month used bamboo hurleys made in Ireland by his company, Torpey.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Although the use of bamboo hurleys is still not widespread, the embrace of the ash substitute at the pinnacle of the sport should help ease the inevitable transition — and so ensure the survival of hurling, featured in ancient Irish folklore and whose mythical origins date back more than 3,000 years. After centuries of nonstop play in many communities in Ireland, hurling began dying out early in the 19th century, with the game continuing only in rural pockets.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Spectators at the hurling match in Ballyagran.

In smaller villages, hurling often has a rich local history, a passionate following and a place at the heart of the community.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>On a sunny evening in late summer, a crowd gathered in the village of Ballyagran, County Limerick, as two local teams squared off. Children ran the perimeter of the field with small hurleys in hand, skillfully smacking the sliotar, the hard ball used in the sport, off the wide end of the stick as they watched the match.</p><p>“I suppose hurling is in our blood,” said Joe O’Kelly, leaning against a fence on the sideline of the game. “For some of these players, the hurley is like an extension of their arm.”</p><p>Mr. O’Kelly, who volunteers with the local G.A.A., said he wasn’t entirely sold on the idea of bamboo, which is still used by just a small fraction of players.</p><p>“It’s a good thing they are trying it,” Mr. O’Kelly added. “But it’s hard to replace the ash.”</p><p>Playing that night was Seán Finn, 28, something of a celebrity in hurling circles for his part in a series of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/sports/limerick-hurling-nickie-quaid.html" title="">recent championships won by Limerick</a>. He had tried bamboo hurleys, but reverted to ash, explaining that he was a bit of a traditionalist.</p><p>“I’m using the ash for give or take 20 years,” Mr. Finn said. “I never really warmed to the bamboo.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-18"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David Fitzgerald, a Clare player, says he prefers a hurley made of bamboo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Seán Finn, a star of Limerick hurling, says he’s sticking with hurleys made of ash.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>There are still dozens of small hurley makers dotted across the country, working out of sheds and primarily using ash. One of these makers, Willie Bulfin, 64, crafts the hurleys Mr. Finn uses.</p><p>In Mr. Bulfin’s workshop, tucked alongside his home in rural Limerick, the pale sawdust collects in small clouds around his hands as he smooths the surface of a hurley. For the past 24 years, Mr. Bulfin has been making them by hand.</p><p>“I’d still be hoping there’s another few years in it for me,” Mr. Bulfin said, speaking warmly of the relationships he has built with local players.</p><p>Hand-drawn hurley templates scrawled with the names of players and their exacting specifications are stacked on his workbench.

Landowners like John Reardon, 72, planted seedlings on his family farm in Limerick in 1998 under the program. He saw it as an investment his children could benefit from when the trees matured.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>John Reardon planted 20,000 ash trees on his property, but they are being wiped out by disease.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A decades-old leaflet from the Irish government encouraging landowners to grow ash trees.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“I planted 20,000 trees,” Mr. Reardon said, “and in the first five years, they had to be minded, like children.”</p><p>Then, in 2012, around the time he expected his trees to begin returning a profit, ash dieback was first found in Ireland. An airborne, fungus-like disease, it cuts off the circulation of the tree, and it begins to rot from the inside out.</p><p>The view across Mr. Reardon’s forest now has a touch of the apocalyptic — bare trees with leaves long fallen sway like lines of ghosts, their bark covered in dark lesions. The sight stretches for acres. </p><p>“It’s over, we are finished as far as hurleys are concerned,” Mr. Reardon said of his trees, adding. “If I was a crying sort of person, I would be in tears.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Megan Specia reports on Britain, Ireland and the Ukraine war for The Times.
