It’s front and center again as investors contend with a Trumponomics crackdown on immigration, a rising trade-war risk and a potential bonanza of tax cuts.</p><p><strong>An important inflation measure comes out at 10 a.m. Eastern:</strong> the Personal Consumption Expenditures index report. It’s the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge and one of the last big data releases of the year that the central bank will consider as it ponders when to lower borrowing costs further. (Next week’s jobs report is another.)</p><p><strong>Donald Trump’s latest trade threats show how uncertain the outlook could be. </strong>Since the president-elect this week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/economy/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">vowed to impose tariffs</a> on Canada, China and Mexico — the United States’ three biggest trade partners — analysts have been gaming out the potential impact. Economists fear that it could add bottlenecks and costs to supply chains <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/what-trumps-new-tariff-threats-mean-for-the-u-s-economy-f0e4e69a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and reignite inflation</a>, and that it could scramble the Fed’s policy on interest rates.</p><p><strong>A worst-case scenario from Deutsche Bank economists:</strong> that core P.C.E. next year would jump by an additional 1.1 percentage points if the Trump tariffs were fully enacted. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>Is the tariff talk an opening salvo for trade negotiations, or a fait accompli?</strong> That uncertainty can be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/business/dealbook/trump-economy-bonds.html" title="">felt in the $28 trillion market for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds:</a> Yields hit a four-month high this month, though they are down on Wednesday. Yields climb when prices fall, and have been especially sensitive to concerns that fiscal policy could fuel inflation.</p><p><strong>Here’s what to watch for in Wednesday’s P.C.E.:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Core P.C.E., which excludes volatile food and food prices, is forecast to <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/economy/forecasts-october-pce-report-show-uptick-inflation-broader-improvement-trend-intact" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">come in at 2.8 percent</a> on an annualized basis. That would be 0.29 percent above September’s reading.</p></li><li><p>Such a rise would represent a second straight month of inflation trending higher, putting the level further above the Fed’s 2 percent target. The report “should show another ‘bump in the road’ on the path to 2 percent inflation,” Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup, wrote in an investor note this week.</p></li><li><p>The culprits are thought to be shelter inflation — especially house prices, with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-new-home-sales-tumble-two-year-low-october-2024-11-26/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mortgage rates soaring</a> — and used car prices, as well as higher portfolio management fees.</p></li></ul><p>Futures traders on Wednesday were pricing in roughly 60 percent odds of a Fed rate cut next month. But their calculations have been volatile in recent months, and a surprisingly hot number could cause a shift in thinking once again.</p><p>That said, the minutes from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/26/fed-officials-see-interest-rate-cuts-ahead-but-only-gradually-minutes-show-.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this month’s Fed rate-setting meeting</a> showed that central bank officials were still confident in their effort to bring inflation down, and that they saw more rate cuts on the horizon. Left unsaid was how many.</p><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>Thousands begin to return to southern Lebanon as a cease-fire takes effect.</strong> The U.S.-backed deal took effect on Wednesday and appears to be holding, even as the Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/27/world/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-cease-fire/here-is-the-latest-on-the-cease-fire-in-lebanon?smid=url-share" title="">shelled two villages in the area</a>. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, says the 60-day truce will help Israel to rebuild its arsenal while trying to isolate Hamas and focus on Iran.

The Biden administration has called for Google to be forced to spin out its Chrome browser, but Trump has signaled that he’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-google-monopoly-china.html" title="">skeptical about forcing the company to break up</a>.</p><p><strong>Starbucks is said to cut staff bonuses.</strong> Most corporate employees who qualify will get only about 60 percent of their annual reward, the worst since 2020, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-26/starbucks-sbux-bonuses-fall-after-worst-sales-year-since-the-pandemic?srnd=homepage-americas" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reports</a>. The reduced bonus pool reflects deeper troubles at the coffee chain after it missed expectations in the third quarter and as Brian Niccol, its new C.E.O., tries to reverse a sales slump.</p><h2 id="link-75b2760c">Trump’s economic team takes shape </h2><p>Donald Trump has rounded out the picks for his economic team, choosing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/us/politics/kevin-hassett-nec-trump.html" title="">Kevin Hassett</a> to head the National Economic Council and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/business/economy/jamieson-greer-trade-representative.html" title="">Jamieson Greer</a> to lead the Office of the United States Trade Representative.</p><p>Both served in his first administration and are seen as pragmatic, making them known quantities as Trump looks for officials to put in place <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/economy/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">a tariffs</a> and tax agenda that has already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/business/dealbook/trumps-tariff-markets.html" title="">rattled global markets</a> and allies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Hassett has been a vocal defender of Trump’s economic policies. </strong>He served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers until 2019 and pushed hard for Trump’s sweeping tax cuts in 2017. Trump is expected to extend them when many of them expire next year, and has promised more cuts.</p><p>Hassett has long argued for tax cuts as a way to bolster the middle class, and his analyses lent them credibility amid pushback from other economists.</p><p><strong>But some Trump supporters are wary of Hassett’s views on immigration. </strong>Hassett has said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/us/politics/choice-of-pro-immigration-economic-adviser-riles-trumps-base.html" title="">immigration bolsters economic growth</a> and has previously said that the United States should <a href="https://www.aei.org/articles/america-needs-workers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">double its intake</a> of immigrants. That hasn’t sat easily with those in Trump’s inner circle pushing for a major cut in immigration numbers.</p><p><strong>Greer was chief of staff to the U.S. trade representative during Trump’s first term. </strong>He worked under Robert Lighthizer, who led the push to use tariffs to force American companies to decouple with China. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-27/trump-s-trade-chief-advocates-strategic-decoupling-from-china?srnd=homepage-americas" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Greer has backed</a> that tough view and was part of the negotiating team with Beijing, as well as the discussions that led to a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement. (Lighthizer might still get a role in the administration, with Trump wanting him as a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/bob-ligthizer-trade-czar-trump-cabinet-baf10387" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trade czar</a>.)</p><p><strong>Who will take point on trade? </strong>Trump said in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113511235978420631" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media post</a> last week that Howard Lutnick, the C.E.O. of Cantor Fitzgerald that he tapped for commerce secretary, would get responsibility for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>The picks make clear Trump priorities.</strong> Trump is seeking to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/us/politics/trump-cabinet-america-first.html" title="">build a cabinet</a> that partners those with traditional business community interests (think <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/business/scott-bessent-wall-street-treasury.html" title="">Scott Bessent</a> as Treasury secretary, Lutnick at commerce) with economic nationalists and national security hawks (Marco Rubio as secretary of state) who are especially tough on China.</p><p>Lower taxes and tough trade tactics will be the overarching goal — and tariffs may be used as more than a negotiating tactic. “His core aim is dominance (both his own and America’s), and tariffs are a favored means for achieving it,” Arthur Kroeber, head of research at Gavekal Research, wrote in a note on Wednesday.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-74a8afb1">A Thanksgiving standout </h2><p>Turkey?

But turmoil in the oil market and human rights concerns hang over the kingdom’s bid for the world’s single largest sporting event, Vivienne Walt reports for DealBook.</p><p><strong>The event will be the crown jewel in a push into global sports. </strong>Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s all-powerful crown prince, has used investment in sports to further his country’s commercial and diplomatic reach and build links with Wall Street.
