Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty and denied the charges against him.</p><p>After his arrest, Mr. Paul was charged with felony possession of cocaine and marijuana. In May, after a plea deal, he was entered into a six-month pretrial drug intervention program that would allow him to avoid jail time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Records from Miami-Dade Criminal Court indicate that Mr. Paul completed the program earlier this month.</p><p>“Mr. Paul’s case was formally dismissed Tuesday, in its entirety,” Brian H. Bieber, a lawyer for Mr. Paul, said in a statement. “All charges have been dropped and the case is closed.”</p><p>Mr. Paul first came to wide public notice in February, when he was named in a sprawling lawsuit filed against Mr. Combs by Rodney Jones Jr., a producer known as Lil Rod who had worked on Mr. Combs’s most recent album. In that suit, which accused Mr. Combs of making unwanted sexual contact with Mr. Jones, and of forcing him to hire prostitutes and participate in sex acts with them, Mr. Jones called Mr. Paul a “mule” who transported drugs and guns for Mr. Combs.</p><p>Mr. Paul’s lawyer, Mr. Bieber, did not respond to a request for comment about the accusations against him in Mr. Jones’s suit.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-sisario">More about Ben Sisario</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
