    <h1>FDA Bans Red Dye 3 in Foods, Linking It to Cancer in Rats</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Beginning in 2027, companies would have to start removing the dye from their products. Imported foods would also have to lose the additive to be sold in the United States.</p><p>Although the dye is still used in hundreds of products, many companies have been switching to other food colorings, a move that accelerated after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/health/california-ban-red-dye-food.html" title="">California in 2023 became the first state</a> to ban Red 3 along with three other food additives that have been linked to disease. The dye has also been linked to health concerns for children.</p><p>In announcing the ban, the agency downplayed the risks to humans, saying that researchers had not found similar cancer risks in studies involving animals other than male rats. Claims that the use of Red Dye No. 3 “in food and in ingested drugs puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information,” Jim Jones, the F.D.A.’s deputy commissioner for human foods, said in a statement.</p><p>Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy and federal affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group, said food and beverage companies would comply with the agency’s decision. “Revoking the authorized use of Red No. 3 is an example of the F.D.A. using its risk and science-based authority to review the safety of products in the marketplace,” she said.</p><p>First approved for use in food in 1907, Red Dye No. 3 was banned in cosmetics in 1990 by U.S. regulators. At the time, <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/red-3-federal-register-1990/175a4e8c8fd3dbd6/full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the F.D.A. cited</a> an industry-conducted study that found that the chemical caused thyroid cancer in male rats but estimated that it <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-04-22-9002030888-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">might cause cancer</a> in fewer than one in 100,000 people. Along with prohibiting the dye in cosmetics, the agency <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070809080710/https://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/CONSUMER/CON00063.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pledged to do the same</a> with food.</p></div></div>
