Consumer advocates said the F.D.A.’s decision to revoke the authorization was long overdue, given the agency’s decision in 1990 to ban the chemical for use in cosmetics and topical drugs.</p><p>Under federal rules, the F.D.A. is prohibited from approving food additives that cause cancer in humans or animals.</p><p>“This is wonderful news and long overdue,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, one of several organizations that petitioned the agency to take action on the additive. “Red Dye 3 is the lowest of the low-hanging fruit when it comes to toxic food dyes that the F.D.A. should be addressing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Beginning in 2027, companies would have to start removing the dye from their products. Imported foods sold in the United States would also have to remove the additive.</p><p>Although the dye is still used in hundreds of products, many companies have been switching to other food colorings, a move that accelerated after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/health/california-ban-red-dye-food.html" title="">California in 2023 became the first state</a> to ban Red 3 along with three other food additives that have been linked to disease. The dye has also been linked to health concerns for children.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
