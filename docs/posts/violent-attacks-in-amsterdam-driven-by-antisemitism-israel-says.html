Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office <a href="https://x.com/IsraeliPM/status/1854748574757650787" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the sending of the two rescue planes. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s national security minister, <a href="https://x.com/itamarbengvir/status/1854726175718821953" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that</a> Israeli officials were working with the Dutch authorities to investigate the episode.</p><p>The Dutch police said in a <a href="https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2024/november/8/05-57-aanhoudingen-rondom-de-voetbalwedstrijd-ajax---maccabi-tel-aviv-fc.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Friday that 57 arrests were made in connection with the unrest, some of which took place at or near the Johan Cruyff Arena, where Ajax, Amsterdam’s soccer team, was playing against Maccabi Tel Aviv, of Israel. Its statement did not mention antisemitism or say whether anyone was targeted in the violence.</p><p>The clashes, which began Thursday, happened in areas where people had gathered, some in support of the Israeli team and others to protest its arrival, the police statement said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hundreds of Maccabi supporters gathered in Amsterdam’s center early Thursday afternoon, where the atmosphere was initially tense but gradually became calmer, the police said in the statement. Ten people were arrested there before the game, the police said, mostly on charges of disrupting the public order.</p><p>At another square called Anton de Komplein, which is near the stadium, people protesting the arrival of Maccabi Tel Aviv clashed with the military police after trying to make their way to the stadium. Amsterdam’s mayor, Femke Halsema, had earlier prohibited the protest from happening at the stadium and ordered it to take place at that square.</p><p>About 30 people were arrested in that confrontation on charges of disrupting the public order and setting off fireworks at the police, the police said.</p><p>A <a href="https://x.com/iAnnetnl/status/1854664685469028610" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> verified by Reuters showed a crowd of more than a dozen men appearing to attack someone on an Amsterdam street near the city center early Friday.
