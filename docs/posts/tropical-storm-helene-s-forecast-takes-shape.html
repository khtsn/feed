    <h1>Tropical Storm Helene’s Forecast Takes Shape</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The storm is also forecast to become a major hurricane, meaning that it could be a Category 3 or higher, with wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. This, too, could change, with some outliers showing a more vigorous storm and some showing a weaker hurricane or even a tropical storm.</p><p>One thing forecasters are growing confident of, Mr. Cangialosi said, is that this storm will be a vastly large hurricane, possibly similar in size to Irma and Katrina, which caused widespread damage. That means the storm surge, wind and rainfall effects will extend well away from the center, particularly on the east side.</p><p>A storm this size could potentially put large populations, like those living in the Tampa Bay area, at risk for damaging winds and surge that they didn’t experience during Idalia, a 2023 storm with a similar track and intensity as what is forecast for Helene. Idalia was much smaller. It also means that damaging winds may reach farther inland to cities like Tallahassee.</p><p>Like Francine a couple of weeks ago, Helene faces a deadline. If it doesn’t become a hurricane by Wednesday morning, it might not have enough time to reach Category 3 strength before making landfall.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida warned people about the uncertainty of the forecast models. “It’s important that people don’t get wedded to these cones,” he said. You could be out of the cone, he added, “and still have major impacts.” Speaking from the state’s emergency operations center in Tallahassee, Mr. DeSantis said the fact that the National Hurricane Center forecast a major hurricane — Category 3 or higher — before the storm even formed indicated that it could quickly intensify in the deep, warm Gulf waters.</p></div></div>
