In January, the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, solidified a lead of more than 20 percentage points over the Liberals in polls, with many voters frustrated with Mr. Trudeau’s stewardship.</p><p>But that gap is rapidly closing. Mr. Carney’s ascent seems to have been turbocharged by the fact that many Canadians are seeking an expert in the economy rather than a politician.</p><p>Mr. Poilievre has understood the political potency of Mr. Trump’s threats for Canadians and has started promoting himself as anti-Trump, even though many Trump supporters also like Mr. Poilievre and the two men have some ideological affiliations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Pierre Poilievre’s plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,” Mr. Carney said on Sunday. “Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.”</p><p>Last week, several polls showed that the Liberals under Mr. Carney could tie with or even narrowly defeat Mr. Poilievre’s Conservatives.</p><p>Darrell Bricker, a seasoned pollster, researcher and chief executive of Ipsos Global — Public Affairs, an opinion research and consultancy firm, said he had never seen such a stark and swift political shift anywhere in the world.</p><p>The election is very much up for grabs, Mr. Bricker added, and Mr. Carney’s challenge will be to avoid trying to be something he’s not: a politician.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“Actually, the act of governing is the Carney campaign,” Mr. Bricker said. “His proposition is ‘I’m the man who can manage in a crisis.

Next up are 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum exports to the United States scheduled to go into effect on Wednesday.</p><p>Financial markets are in turmoil amid the uncertainty, damaging Canada’s economy.</p><p>Mr. Trump, in conversations with Mr. Trudeau, has made it clear that his list of economic grievances is long and includes industries such as dairy and banking, where the United States faces barriers to competing in Canada.</p><p>Mr. Trump and his advisers have also raised issues that cut to the very heart of Canada’s sovereignty, including revising a border treaty and water-sharing agreements between the two nations.</p><p>The collection of threats amounts to a watershed moment for Canada.</p><p>“Donald Trump has put unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell, on how we earn a living,” Mr. Carney said on Sunday. “He’s attacking Canadian workers, families and businesses.
