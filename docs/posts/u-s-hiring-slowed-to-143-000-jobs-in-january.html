In combination with his early moves to impose tariffs with threats of more to come — which could push up inflation — the sturdy wage and job gains make it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will resume easing interest rates for at least the next few months, or longer.</p><p>The central bank’s first cut, back in September, now appears to have led to a surge in hiring that officials may not feel they need to repeat if it means adding to price pressures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We don’t expect the Fed to cut rates this year anymore,” said Bradley Saunders, a North America economist at Capital Economics, who had earlier expected two rate cuts in 2025. “Since the tariff news and how hawkish Trump has shown himself to be, we’ve decided that’s no longer the case.”</p><p>Reinforcing that view, the University of Michigan’s <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consumer sentiment index</a> fell for the second month in a row, with expectations for future inflation skyrocketing. Although surveys of business sentiment brightened after the election, that hasn’t historically translated into hiring, and import duties may put a damper on many companies’ expansion plans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="revisions-payrolls-23jim" data-id="100000009975502" data-source-id="100000009975502"><div slug="revisions-payrolls-23jim" data-sourceid="100000009975502" id="embed-id-100000009975502">

The surge in immigration over the past three years contributed millions of workers, but new arrivals have been slowing since the Biden administration clamped down on asylum claims last summer. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has been working to sever the flow almost entirely, and to expel many of those who have become eligible to work.</p><p>That’s why Stephanie Roth, chief economist at the investment analysis firm Wolfe Research, doesn’t expect the unemployment rate to rise further this year.</p><p>“The economy should be largely fine, labor demand should be decent if that’s the case, and 3.5 million people are going to lose their visa statuses over the next two years,” Ms. Roth said. “It’s going to tighten labor supply.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The likely impact on native-born workers remains unclear, however, given that recent immigrants tend to perform <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/business/economy/immigration-trump-economy.html" title="">complementary roles</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/business/economy/trump-immigration-inflation-prices.html" title="">can expand</a> the overall labor pie. And the labor force participation rate for both immigrants and native-born people in their prime working years — ages 25 to 54 — has remained near the postpandemic peak it reached last summer, which was the highest rate since 2000.</p><p>One place where the lack of immigrants may eventually be felt is Los Angeles, which will need people to help clear debris and rebuild from January’s wildfires. For now, the Labor Department said that neither that disaster nor widespread snowstorms had a “discernible effect” on its surveys.</p><p>A January decline in the private sector <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AWHAETP" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">average workweek</a> nationwide, to a low point not seen since March 2020, could be evidence that the city’s workers weren’t able to put in full time hours in the face of dense smoke and blocked highways. But the impact may also have been muted by the fact that the fires didn’t hit the region’s major employment centers, and its entertainment professions have already been in a bit of a slump.</p><p>Nicole Chen is a member of one of them — animation. She’s a storyboard artist, working in stints of three months to a year for studios that produce cartoon shows. Fewer of those projects have been financed in recent years, and the demand for people like her has been eroded by outsourcing and <a href="https://animationguild.org/ai-and-animation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a>. Now in a long stretch without a gig, she often goes out to lunch with friends in similar situations.</p><p>“There are just tons of talented people who are out of work because there’s no jobs,” said Ms. Chen, 33. “I do see people saying, ‘Am I not good enough?’ And I’m like, ‘But everybody you know is unemployed, it’s not you.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>And being out of work has been getting more arduous. Although it dropped in January, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UEMPMEAN" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">average duration of employment</a> had jumped sharply in the second half of 2024.</p><p>“That’s going to chip away at confidence, and it snowballs,” said Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist for the French bank Société Générale. “Consumers slow down and businesses say, ‘I don’t need as many workers as I thought.’ I think that’s a danger going forward.”</p><p>For now, businesses are hiring steadily but carefully. That includes Johnathon Bush, who runs a wholesale bakery in Chicago called Not Just Cookies. He has taken on a couple of large clients recently and moved into a bigger space to crank out their orders, so he needs to expand beyond his five core employees. But his ingredient costs remain unpredictable — egg prices can wipe out a baker’s profit margins — and rising wages mean that the stakes of each hire are greater.</p><p>“I’m going to start with two because I want to make sure that everything’s good with the new business,” Mr. Bush said. “I’ve learned to hire very, very slow to improve the chances of success with a person. You just have to be very careful because it is a lot more costly to bring on people.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lydia DePillis reports on the American economy.
