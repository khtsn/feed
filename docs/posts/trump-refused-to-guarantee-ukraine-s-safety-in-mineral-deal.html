However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/trump-ukraine-cabinet.html" title="">Trump insisted that he would not provide security guarantees in return</a> — rebuffing Zelensky’s central demand.</p><p>A draft of the minerals agreement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/world/europe/us-ukraine-minerals-deal-security.html" title="">obtained by The Times</a> included new language that stated that the U.S. “supports Ukraine’s effort to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.” But, Trump said: “I’m not going to provide security guarantees beyond very much,” adding that “we’re going to have Europe do that.”</p><p>Trump’s comments were just one portion of a wide-ranging meeting in which he sought to frame his first month of his term as a sweeping success. He also praised Elon Musk, who declared at the meeting that “America will go bankrupt” without his team’s aggressive efforts to reduce the size of the federal government.</p><p>Trump also touted his plans to balance the federal budget (he said “we’ll be very close,” despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/21/upshot/house-gop-budget-blueprint.html" title="">plans to add to the deficit</a>), promoted his idea for a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/nyregion/trump-gold-card-visa-europe.html" title="">gold card</a>” visa (which, for a $5 million fee, could lead to permanent residency) and suggested that he had picked Dan Caine as his next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in part, because of his nickname (“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/trump-dan-caine-joint-chiefs-chairman.html" title="">Razin</a>”).</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-486b29ca">Republicans look to reverse the push for electric cars</h2><p>The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are trying to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/climate/republicans-california-waiver-electric-cars.html" title="">repeal California’s ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered cars</a> by 2035. The state’s plan is considered among the country’s most ambitious climate policies.</p><p>However, environmental groups and California officials argue that the Republican plan is unlawful because it seeks to withdraw a commonly used waiver that the Government Accountability Office determined in 2023 was not under Congress’s authority.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marlean Ames, a straight woman who twice lost positions to gay workers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Megan Jelinger/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2dae89dd">Justices appeared poised to overturn a discrimination ruling</h2><p>Supreme Court justices across the ideological spectrum agreed today that a lower court had gone badly astray in requiring a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/supreme-court-reverse-discrimination.html" title="">higher burden of proof for members of majority groups in discrimination cases</a>. The justices were hearing arguments over an employment discrimination suit filed by a straight woman who twice lost positions to gay workers.</p><p>Some conservative groups had hoped the case would yield a major statement on efforts to diversify the workplace. Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that the resulting opinion could be more modest: “Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, whether it’s because you’re gay or because you’re straight, is prohibited,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A dispensary in New York City.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">José A.
