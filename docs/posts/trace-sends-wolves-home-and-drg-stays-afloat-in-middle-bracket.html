</span>, which saw the latter pull off a near-upset against the Champions attendees in a back-and-forth three-map series.</p>



<p>In 2024 and 2025, Wolves and Trace both spent time as one of the &#34;best of the rest&#34; in China. Trace enjoyed a strong end to 2024, qualifying for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024/playoffs" target="_blank">Champions Seoul</a> and finishing in the playoffs of the event, and continuing that momentum into 2025 with a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025/swiss-stage" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> appearance. Trace disappointed in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2359/vct-2025-china-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> while Wolves had a breakout campaign to qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>, where they finished third.</p>

<p>The series opened on Trace&#39;s pick of Abyss. Both teams opted for the Yoru-Waylay &#39;mosquito comp&#39; Duelist pairing, but made different choices in the agents rounding out their respective comps. Both teams went with Astra and Sova, but Trace opted for <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4770/fengf">
		FengF	</a>
</span> on Breach while Wolves had <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/6022/yosemite">
		yosemite	</a>
</span> on Veto.</p>

<p>Early on, Wolves looked to disrupt Trace. After losing the opening pistol round, a five-man force-buy of Stingers ended unsuccessfully. After settling its economy, Wolves settled into a groove, ending its attack half up 7-5. Trace opened the second half with another 3-0 run, but soon after ran into trouble. The Trace attack was often found fighting against the clock, unable to time its executions with players being picked off away from the rest of the team.  </p>

<p>While Trace hit match point first in a race to the finish line, Wolves refused to go down thanks to the performance of yosemite, who dropped a map-high 30 kills en route to a 14-12 win. </p>

<p><em>Who else but <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7849/siufatbb">
		SiuFatBB	</a>
</span> to wrap things up for Wolves on Abyss?</em></p>

<p>Wolves&#39; pick of Bind looked to make the series a quick one; in VCT play, Trace had not won on Bind since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2275/vct-2025-china-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Kickoff</a> of last year. Wolves entered the map winning four of the opening five rounds, but only managed six total rounds by the time their attack half finished. Trace&#39;s proactivity was its Achilles&#39; Heel on defense, but on attack, it became its strength. While it failed to convert its bonus following a pistol round win, Trace won five straight rounds from an 8-8 deadlock to cruise to a map win, carrying all of the momentum into the decider map.</p>

<p>While Wolves opted to keep <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/43007/qiutian">
		qiutiaN	</a>
</span> on Chamber heading into Split, Trace went for a double-Duelist look, with FengF on Raze and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/37494/kai">
		Kai	</a>
</span> on Neon. After playing Yoru on both of the previous maps, Kai exploded on Split, leading the way on Trace&#39;s attack half with an 18/6 scoreline. More importantly, though, his 8-1 record in first duels was key to opening up the map for Trace, who never looked down on Split. </p>

<p>While Wolves did their best to stage a late comeback, the distance to close was far too much, giving way to Kai and <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/10821/delb">
		deLb	</a>
</span>, who combined for 42 kills on the map, to close out a 13-6 win.</p>

<iframe type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/L3lnxAVAULc?si=mnufXfofl5VaoJrG&amp;clip=UgkxfO9YKQgaRGkUwUaCXEetLzFU9TF0YCdl&amp;clipt=EPvstwUY28G7BQ&amp;showinfo=0&amp;origin=https://www.vlr.gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p><em>Kai&#39;s last of many kills was the last of the series.</em></p>

<p>Kai&#39;s 62 kills across all three maps were the highest of all players in the match, while Trace IGL <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/36415/viva">
		Viva	</a>
</span>&#39;s 1.25 rating was second to none.</p>



<p>The second series of the day moved up to the middle bracket, where <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2648/vct-2025-china-ascension/playoffs" target="_blank">Ascenson</a> winners Dragon Ranger Gaming ended TYLOO&#39;s middle bracket run, sending them to the lower bracket to advance to the middle bracket&#39;s semifinals.</p>

<p>The series opened on DRG&#39;s pick of Corrode. While TYLOO had what could be described as a more meta double-Duelist, double-Controller comp, DRG went with an off-meta variation of the Omen-Viper pairing with Gekko and Cypher.</p>

<p>Beginning on defense, DRG appeared well-equipped to shut down TYLOO&#39;s Duelist pair, winning the first four rounds and showcasing a strong showing on defense, with more momentum rolling once <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/31753/spiritz1">
		SpiritZ1	</a>
</span> got an Operator in his hands. He and <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3741/vo0kashu">
		vo0kashu	</a>
</span> both had 12 kills apiece on </p>

<p>Up 8-4, DRG won the opening pistol round of its attack half, but disaster struck as TYLOO claimed an anti-eco. From there, the experienced DRG squad showed signs of imperfections, with mistakes and lapses in decision-making sending ultimates to waste and chipping away at its economy round after round. Two timeouts could only delay the inevitable for DRG, as TYLOO handed DRG its first loss on Corrode since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2499/vct-2025-china-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> of last year.</p>

<iframe type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/L3lnxAVAULc?si=VKVh5imWcSv_EQQ0&amp;clip=UgkxUncubYzbtCC2ZTJk2sq0DHwqotKIG927&amp;clipt=EPSX6wcYmOjuBw&amp;showinfo=0&amp;origin=https://www.vlr.gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

</span> and global ACS leader <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/36685/splash">
		splash	</a>
</span> heated up on defense to help TYLOO steal away DRG&#39;s map pick.</p>

<p>Following the trend of the previous series, TYLOO&#39;s map pick of Split was heavily attack-sided. DRG, starting on attack, appeared to flush any memory of Corrode rather quickly, breaking out to an early 8-0 lead, making it tough for the TYLOO economy to gather funds to put an Operator into slowly&#39;s hands. Facing a 9-3 halftime deficit, TYLOO managed to flip a force-buy into a round win, but that only delayed the inevitable as DRG convincingly won Split 13-6.</p>

<p>The decider map of Pearl promised intrigue, as it was set to be the first time that DRG played on the map in 2026. While TYLOO went with a double-Duelist comp with Killjoy, Astra, and Sova, DRG again opted for a more off-meta comp, with Phoenix and Tejo deployed alongside Neon, Vyse, and Astra.</p>

<p>TYLOO, backed by the ever-dangerous Splash, charged forward on attack, claiming the first four rounds of the map to force an early timeout from DRG head coach <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3532/nathand">
		NaThanD	</a>
</span>. The timeout resulted in DRG finding its answer on defense, playing with a greater sense of togetherness, walking into retakes with stronger numbers, and using vo0kashu&#39;s Vyse utility to shut down TYLOO&#39;s faster executes. DRG went on a run of five straight rounds, and after starting the map in sloppy fashion, entered halftime up 7-5.</p>

<p>While both teams flexed their own strengths in the post plant, with Killjoy and Tejo the prime suspects, what proved to be the difference was vo0kashu&#39;s Vyse Razorvines, which were effective in shutting down any fast-flood retakes that TYLOO wanted to use. DRG got out to a 4-0 run to start its attack side, reaching an 11-5 lead to put TYLOO on the ropes.</p>

<p>slowly found impact with his Operator the following round, but with DRG reaching match point soon after, the map was closed at a comfortable 13-6.</p>

<iframe type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/L3lnxAVAULc?si=suzB5czM8LrGdJHT&amp;clip=UgkxAY-N4z3alpSDHRXYIY4R4zkLmac_YsUf&amp;clipt=EOnL9goY_875Cg&amp;showinfo=0&amp;origin=https://www.vlr.gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p><em>DRG overwhelms the B site to reach match point.</em></p>

<p><span data-ref-id="18">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11524/nicc">
		Nicc	</a>
</span>&#39;s 50 kills led the way in what could be regarded as a well-rounded performance in the DRG win, as SpiritZ1 and vo0kashu added 49 and 46 of their own. For TYLOO, Scales&#39; game-high marks of 1.60 rating and 52 kills were not enough at the end of the day. </p>
