Hurricane warnings were in effect for counties in northeast Florida. People were boarding up homes in Orlando, nearly smack in the middle of the state. The Panhandle was likely the only region that would be spared any effects.</p><p>It is an extraordinary circumstance for the nation’s third most populous state to find itself in, as it continues to fill with more newcomers every day and sees no end to development.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Just make sure that if you are on the east coast of Florida, that you understand this is not just a west coast event,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said on Wednesday. He called the deployment of personnel and resources ahead of the storm the largest in the state’s history.</p><p>For many Floridians, as the storm drew near, life came more or less to a standstill. With 51 of 67 counties under a state of emergency, schools canceled classes up and down the peninsula. Airports, seaports and theme parks — including some of the busiest in the nation — closed. About 5.5 million people faced mandatory evacuation orders.</p><p>Avoiding Milton seemed impossible for Floridians.</p><p>Making matters worse: Florida was recovering from Hurricane Helene, a large, Category 4 storm that struck two weeks ago. Though Helene came ashore in the sparsely populated Big Bend region, its destructive storm surge caused significant damage to homes and businesses on barrier islands and in other coastal and low-lying areas up and down the Gulf Coast.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
