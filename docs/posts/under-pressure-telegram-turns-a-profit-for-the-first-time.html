The goal: to reassure them that the company remains a viable bet after its founder, Pavel Durov, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/technology/pavel-durov-telegram-detained-france.html" title="">arrested in France</a> in August on charges related to illicit activities on the platform.</p><p>In the conversations, Telegram told investors that it was tackling its legal troubles head-on by policing more user-generated content. The company also said it had paid down a “meaningful amount” of its debt, according to an investor in the talks who was not authorized to discuss confidential information.</p><p>Telegram has been under increasing scrutiny around the world this year for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/technology/telegram-crime-terrorism.html" title="">hosting illicit content</a> from child predators, drug traffickers and other criminals. The company also faces pressure another way: to prove it can make money.</p><p>For years, skeptics have questioned if a platform known for hosting toxic material could turn a profit. Unlike social media companies such as Meta, Telegram took an unusual business path: It did not raise money from venture capitalists, sell advertising based on user data or hire aggressively to accelerate growth. Instead, it relied on Mr. Durov’s fame and fortune to sustain its business, took on debt and barreled into the cryptocurrency market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Now Telegram is out to show it has found its financial footing so it can move past its legal and regulatory woes, stay independent and eventually hold an initial public offering. It has expanded its content moderation efforts, with more than 750 contractors who <a href="https://telegram.org/moderation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">police content</a>. It has introduced advertising, subscriptions and video services. And it has used cryptocurrency to pay down its debt and shore up its finances.</p><p>The result: Telegram is set to be profitable this year for the first time, according to a person with knowledge of the finances who declined to be identified discussing internal figures. Revenue is on track to surpass $1 billion, up from nearly $350 million last year, the person said. Telegram also has about $500 million in cash reserves, not including crypto assets.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
