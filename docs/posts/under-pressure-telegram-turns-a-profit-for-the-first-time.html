The goal: to reassure them that the company remains a viable bet after its founder, Pavel Durov, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/technology/pavel-durov-telegram-detained-france.html" title="">arrested in France</a> in August on charges related to illicit activities on the platform.</p><p>In the conversations, Telegram told investors that it was tackling its legal troubles head-on by policing more user-generated content. The company also said it had paid down a “meaningful amount” of its debt, according to an investor in the talks who was not authorized to discuss confidential information.</p><p>Telegram has been under increasing scrutiny around the world this year for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/technology/telegram-crime-terrorism.html" title="">hosting illicit content</a> from child predators, drug traffickers and other criminals. The company also faces pressure another way: to prove it can make money.</p><p>For years, skeptics have questioned if a platform known for hosting toxic material could turn a profit. Unlike social media companies such as Meta, Telegram took an unusual business path: It did not raise money from venture capitalists, sell advertising based on user data or hire aggressively to accelerate growth. Instead, it relied on Mr. Durov’s fame and fortune to sustain its business, took on debt and barreled into the cryptocurrency market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Now Telegram is out to show it has found its financial footing so it can move past its legal and regulatory woes, stay independent and eventually hold an initial public offering. It has expanded its content moderation efforts, with more than 750 contractors who <a href="https://telegram.org/moderation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">police content</a>. It has introduced advertising, subscriptions and video services. And it has used cryptocurrency to pay down its debt and shore up its finances.</p><p>The result: Telegram is set to be profitable this year for the first time, according to a person with knowledge of the finances who declined to be identified discussing internal figures. Revenue is on track to surpass $1 billion, up from nearly $350 million last year, the person said. Telegram also has about $500 million in cash reserves, not including crypto assets.</p><p>Telegram has nearly 1 billion users, including 12 million subscribers who pay about $5 a month for added features. More than half of its revenue this year came from advertising, the person said, after attracting larger brands such as Samsung. It also plans to expand ads within public channels that attract more than one trillion views a month. Telegram was valued at more than $30 billion earlier this year.</p><p>Telegram has been helped by cryptocurrencies in particular, two people said. The company sold hundreds of millions of dollars of digital assets this year, including Toncoin, a virtual currency that was partly built inside Telegram and is now run by outside developers. It has floated new crypto-focused ideas like allowing users to mine cryptocurrencies and exchange them through third-party applications on Telegram.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Pavel Durov, wearing all black, walks with a man wearing a jacket, scarf and backpack." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl/TELEGRAM-BIZ-pavel-hbjl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/cf8d0d88-06cc-5490-a2b5-f9cd4ecadf31" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, right, arriving at a Paris courthouse this month.

The 40-year-old, who has denied the charges in France, must remain there while under investigation and faces a possible jail sentence if convicted. He is Telegram’s sole owner and its driving force. The company does not have an independent board and has not publicly outlined a succession plan. If it is squeezed for cash or cannot develop a sustainable business model, that could force Mr. Durov to take on more debt or sell part of the company for the first time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Telegram has been expanding advertising in some of its channels. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sasha Maslov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Telegram’s business dilemmas trace back more than a decade.</p><p>In 2014, Mr. Durov was pushed out of his previous start-up, the Russian social network VKontakte, when he declined to hand over user data to the Russian authorities. After selling his stake in VKontakte, he used the estimated $300 million in proceeds to bankroll Telegram, pledging to maintain sole ownership and not take money from outside investors.</p><p>The arrangement gave Telegram, now in Dubai, independence. Under no pressure to generate revenue, Mr. Durov focused on privacy over advertising and other moneymaking products.</p><p>By 2017, Telegram was approaching 200 million users and its costs were soaring for back-end servers, product development and other items. Mr. Durov began exploring new financing options that would also allow him to maintain sole ownership of the company.</p><p>“We wanted to be independent,” he said in an April <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ut6RouSs0w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with Tucker Carlson. “We knew that our mission and our goals were not necessarily consistent with the goals of the funds that could be investing into us.”</p><p>His solution was crypto. In 2018, Telegram <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1729650/000095017218000060/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised</a> more than $1.7 billion by pledging to create its own digital currency that would be given to about 170 wealthy investors. The funds were to be used partly to develop blockchain technology for making digital transactions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Investors included the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/technology/telegram-cryptocurrency-gram.html" title="">Silicon Valley venture capital firms</a> Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital. Others were the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/roman-abramovich-russian-oligarch-sanctions.html" title="">Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich</a> and Jan Marsalek, an executive at the payment processing firm Wirecard who was later accused of being a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/world/europe/bulgarian-spying-charges-uk-russia.html" title="">Russian spy</a> and is wanted for fraud and other crimes, according to documents seen by The New York Times.</p><p>The crypto deal was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/technology/telegram-cryptocurrency-gram.html" title="">success</a> — but in 2020, Telegram was forced to abandon it after <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-146" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Securities and Exchange Commission</a> said it violated federal securities laws and posed a risk to retail investors.</p><p>Telegram agreed to return the money, but had already spent nearly a third of the cash, according to an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-146" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">S.E.C. announcement</a> and a person familiar with the investigation. Telegram offered its backers a partial refund or a promise to repay them with a 10 percent profit at a later date.</p><p>Several investors sued. Adding to their anger, Telegram was paying Mr. Durov an annual salary of roughly $12 million from 2018 to 2020, according to records seen by The Times. A private settlement was eventually reached. (Telegram said Mr. Durov’s salary is now 1 UAE dirham a year, worth about 25 cents.)</p><p>Around then, Telegram <a href="https://t.me/durov/142" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced its first major efforts</a> to generate revenue, including through advertising. Large brands were reluctant to advertise on a platform known for hosting terrorist propaganda and far-right extremists, though smaller advertisers joined.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Maria Vasileva, 30, who lives in Thailand, said she used Telegram ads to find new subscribers for channels she operates on the platform teaching data analytics. Ads are more successful in countries where Telegram has a large audience, like Russia and Ukraine, she said, but “in other countries, advertisers still need to be convinced about Telegram’s benefits.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Durov at a crypto conference in Dubai in April.

He promoted a bond offering by promising investors a 10 percent discount on an eventual public offering of the company.</p><p>In several rounds of bond offerings from 2021 to this year, Telegram raised about $2.4 billion from investors including sovereign wealth funds in the United Arab Emirates. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, also owns some Telegram bonds, according to Bloomberg data.</p><p>The bondholder who recently spoke with the company said they were attracted by Telegram’s large user base and growth. Prices for Telegram’s bonds fell after Mr. Durov’s arrest, but have since mostly recovered, a sign the market thinks the company can pay back the money.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In March, Mr. Durov talked up a potential Telegram stock listing to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8d6ceb0d-4cdb-4165-bdfa-4b95b3e07b2a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Financial Times</a>, with the expectation it would happen by early 2026. But plans changed this summer when he was arrested in Paris.</p><p>Telegram declined to comment on I.P.O. plans and said it “remains fully owned by Mr. Durov, who has neither the desire nor the need to sell any equity.”</p><p>Some investors remain wary. Two U.S. hedge funds said they had reviewed the company’s finances, but opted against backing it, concerned it would not stabilize its business amid the regulatory and legal scrutiny.</p><p>Telegram said it would pay back investors on time. Its crypto holdings have recently been bolstered by the incoming Trump administration’s embrace of digital currencies.</p><p>Mr. Durov, who has stayed mostly quiet about the accusations against him, has been working out of a Paris hotel since August. He often promotes Telegram’s new business features to his more than 13 million followers on the platform, along with occasional life advice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>“Split a big task into smaller parts, organize them in the right sequence — and you’ll get through,” he said in October.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Paul Mozur is the global technology correspondent for The Times, based in Taipei.
