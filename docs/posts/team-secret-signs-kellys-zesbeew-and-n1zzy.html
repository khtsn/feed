With stuffed animals and wrestling shoes dangling from their backpacks, they made their way up a stairway into the Bronx Combat Factory.</p><p>The second-story boxing gym is the home of the <a href="https://luchawrestlingclub.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lucha Wrestling Club</a>, where dozens of girls come to practice alongside sweaty men sparring in a boxing ring and pounding heavy bags.</p><p>“If you’re practicing in a gym like this, you know you’re going to be working hard and fighting hard,” said Josh Lee, who founded the club a year ago to support the growing number of girls competing on high school teams in the Bronx.</p><p>In 2013, so many girls were joining boys teams that New York City <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/already-competing-with-the-boys-girls-get-their-own-wrestling-league/" title="">started</a> one of America’s first all-girls high school wrestling leagues, with 16 teams and about 220 wrestlers. That has since grown to 21 teams and 395 wrestlers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Bronx is a hotbed, with six public school teams, more than any other borough in the city. Harry S. Truman High School in the Co-op City section of the Bronx has been a powerhouse, winning three consecutive team championships before taking second on May 10 to Curtis High School from Staten Island.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the girls’ wrestling team from Samuel Gompers Industrial High School, in the South Bronx, before a meet in Brooklyn.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.

They unrolled them next to heavy bags and martial arts equipment.</p><p>The club’s coach, Enas Ahmed, herself a former Olympic wrestler, ran the girls through takedown drills and conditioning exercises, including back arches, push-ups, crab-walk sprints, lunges and squat thrusts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Push yourselves.

Some, like Anaiya Pagan, 18, were cutting pounds to make their weight classes for postseason tournaments, which include the city individual championships this weekend.</p><p>Anaiya sweated through layers of workout gear, her hood tied tightly to make her sweat more. With drawn cheeks and dry lips, she said she was determined to lose her last few pounds of “water weight” to make the 115-pound class.</p><p>Since joining the team at Samuel Gompers Industrial High School in the South Bronx last year, she said wrestling had become her passion and had “definitely kept me away from ’hood stuff.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Now a senior, Anaiya’s plan is to get out of New York, wrestling for New Jersey City University in relatively bucolic Jersey City. “I grew up hearing gunshots in my neighborhood, and I don’t want to hear that anymore.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Anaiya Pagan, a member of the Gompers team, has been cutting pounds to make her weight class for postseason tournaments.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.

But off the mat, especially in the Bronx, the state’s poorest county, practices and matches can have a decidedly different feel. Wrestlers often travel by subway or bus, and pass through metal detectors to enter schools.</p><p>Space is scarce. At the Taft Educational Complex, where Mr. Lee founded a high school girls’ team in 2013, he said his wrestlers had to move bulky lunch tables out of the way to practice in the cafeteria.</p><p>Mr. Lee does not schedule Lucha practices at night, out of concern for the girls’ safety. He said one recruit was unable to wrestle this year after being shot in the arm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pearl Fletcher, the Gompers coach, founded the team last year after raising money for uniforms and travel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.

Lucha also teaches girls to use wrestling to focus, empower and discipline their lives.</p><p>Lucha wrestlers are primarily Black and Hispanic. Many are immigrants or first-generation Americans and would be the first in their families to attend college.</p><p>At a recent practice, Emma Randall, head coach of Columbia University’s women’s wrestling club, spoke to the Lucha members about applying to colleges. One wrestler from the Truman girl’s team now wrestles at Columbia and Ms. Randall visits tournaments and practices in the city to scout more recruits.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-17"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kent J.

During a break, Saniyaa said she grew up partly in family homeless shelters. While settled now, she said, “I don’t travel much and rarely get out of New York, so just getting on a bus to go upstate to a tournament is eye-opening.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The donations also go toward paying Ms. Ahmed, who competed for Egypt in the 2016 and 2020 Olympics.</p><p>All but two of the girls’ wrestling teams at New York City public high schools are coached by men, and Mr. Lee was adamant about hiring a female head coach.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Fletcher said wrestling could be a hard sell for girls at first, but that team spirit eventually kicked in.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.

She founded the team last year after raising $2,000 for uniforms and travel, and most important, recruiting enough girls.</p><p>“It can be hard for a guy to sell girls on joining a girls’ wrestling team,” said Ms. Fletcher.</p><p>“I would tell girls, ‘Half you guys are trying to fight all the time anyway, so why not do it as a sport? You get to beat people up legally and you lose weight while doing it,’” she said. “I would tell them that it’s a healthy outlet that gives you the discipline to persevere.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Several Lucha members said wrestling had helped them lose weight, gain confidence and focus on their futures.</p><p>Angiee Atlixqueno, a senior at A. Philip Randolph Campus High School, said wrestling had helped her lose more than 30 pounds. Now at a lean 138, she is entering the U.S. Air Force in June.</p><p>“When I told the recruiters I was a wrestler, they said they would recommend me for Special Forces,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Corey Kilgannon is a Times reporter who writes about crime and criminal justice in and around New York City, as well as breaking news and other feature stories.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Beekeeper Charged With a Genocidal Secret:</strong> Faustin Nsabumukunzi lived quietly in New York.
