Trump’s most ferocious allies for years, defending him during his two impeachments, amplifying his lies about the 2020 election and rallying behind his comeback campaign.</p><p>On Monday, her loyalty paid off: In one of the first major personnel announcements for his second term, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-stefanik-un-ambassador.html" title="">Mr. Trump said he would nominate</a> Ms. Stefanik as his ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p>Ms. Stefanik, 40, would bring relatively little diplomatic or foreign policy experience to the role, beyond having served as a member of House national security committees.</p><p>But in five terms representing the North Country of New York, she has made history several times over, beginning when she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at the time. Ms. Stefanik is currently the most senior woman in House Republican leadership, serving as chair of the House Republican Conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Her foreign policy views track with Mr. Trump’s. A staunch supporter of Israel, she has repeatedly <a href="https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/9/stefanik-statement-on-un-s-disgraceful-antisemitic-resolution-against-israel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused the U.N.</a> of being plagued by “antisemitic rot” and proposed blocking funding for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/magazine/unrwa-gaza-war.html" title="">the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees</a>.</p><p>At home, her viral face-offs with Ivy League presidents over rising antisemitism on their campuses helped lead to several of them losing their jobs.</p><h2 id="link-36976d4a">An establishment acolyte turned MAGA warrior</h2><p>Few figures have better <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/us/politics/elise-stefanik.html" title="">embodied the rapid evolution of the Republican Party</a> under Mr. Trump than Ms. Stefanik.</p><p>After graduating from Harvard, she joined the George W. Bush administration as a domestic policy aide, helped write the Republicans’ 2012 party platform and prepared Representative Paul D. Ryan for that year’s vice-presidential debate.</p><p>In 2014, Ms. Stefanik <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/nyregion/in-upstate-new-york-house-race-republican-makes-her-youth-a-selling-point.html" title="">won her House seat</a> at age 30, flipping a Democratic-held district by running as a millennial moderate. Once in Congress, she eventually secured seats on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, and was a protégé of Mr. Ryan, who became speaker before falling out with Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Stefanik, too, initially kept the disruptive president at an arm’s length. But beginning in 2019, as Democrats prepared to impeach Mr. Trump for the first time, she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/us/politics/elise-stefanik.html" title="">undertook a dramatic transformation</a> that brought her ever closer to the center of his orbit.</p><p>She embraced many of the conspiracy theories undergirding Mr. Trump’s claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. In 2021, when House Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/12/us/politics/liz-cheney-trump-republicans.html" title="">ousted Liz Cheney</a> as their conference chairwoman for repudiating Mr. Trump’s election lies, Ms. Stefanik stepped in as her successor.</p><p>She also adopted Mr. Trump’s pugilistic style. Speaking at his rally at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q9lB_43F1k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Madison Square Garden</a> last month in the presidential campaign’s closing days, she warned of “illegals swarming our streets,” blamed Democrats for kneecapping the police and accused them of undertaking a never-ending “witch hunt” against Mr. Trump.</p><p>Others have used the post — which comes with <a href="https://streeteasy.com/building/50-united-nations-plaza/ph40h" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a taxpayer-funded penthouse apartment</a> in Manhattan — as a step toward higher office.</p><h2 id="link-5c385821">A breakout voice on antisemitism</h2><p>Ms. Stefanik’s rightward turn has infuriated Democrats. But after the House’s hearings about antisemitism on college campuses since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza, even some liberals found themselves giving her grudging compliments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/07/us/politics/elise-stefanik-antisemitism-congress.html" title="">most memorable moment</a> came during a hearing of the Committee on Education and the Workforce last December. Ms. Stefanik asked the presidents of several elite universities, including her alma mater, what sounded like a straightforward question.</p><p>“Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard’s rules on bullying and harassment?” she asked.</p><p>The dispassionate, lawyerly answers about context and free speech that were offered in response set off a firestorm about discrimination on elite campuses that jumped beyond the conservative base.</p><p>The impact was hard to ignore. The testimony at that hearing and a subsequent one helped accelerate the resignations of the presidents of three of the nation’s most prestigious schools: Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and eventually Columbia.</p><p>Ms. Stefanik, in turn, was named <a href="https://time.com/6965201/elise-stefanik/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of Time’s 100 most influential people</a> of 2024.</p><p>“The world heard,” Ms. Stefanik recounted during the Madison Square Garden rally. “You’re fired!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>After the hearings, Ms. Stefanik began stepping out more assertively on some foreign policy issues, especially in support of Israel. She traveled to Jerusalem in May <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/19/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas-rafah?smid=url-share#in-israel-stefanik-denounces-biden-and-praises-trump" title="">to address the nation’s Parliament</a>, using the global stage to attack Democrats as insufficiently supportive of Israel’s war in Gaza.</p><p>She would most likely be among the country’s most vocal defenders at the U.N. if confirmed. She has also supported the United States taking a harder line against China. And after initially supporting Ukraine’s war effort, Ms. Stefanik opposed the latest multibillion-dollar aid package to the war-torn nation.</p><h2 id="link-1a886bba">What will happen to her House seat?</h2><p>Ms. Stefanik’s nomination as U.N. ambassador will have to be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate. But if she were confirmed, her ascension would lead to a special election next year and would temporarily thin Republicans’ ranks in the House.</p><p>That possibility was enough to give one of Mr. Trump’s biggest supporters, Elon Musk, pause. “Elise is awesome, but it might be too dicey to lose her from the House, at least for now,” <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1855838083054538961" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote</a> on his social media platform, X.</p><p>Democrats on Monday quickly began assessing their chances of flipping the seat. The party has performed well in recent special elections across the country, but winning this one, should it become vacant, could be exceedingly difficult.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The upstate New York district stretches from the outskirts of Albany to the Canadian border, encompassing some of the state’s most conservative rural counties and much of the Adirondack Mountains. Ms. Stefanik <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-new-york-us-house-21.html" title="">defeated her Democratic opponent, Paula Collins</a>, last week by 25 percentage points.</p><p>Ms. Collins said on Monday that she would be interested in running again in a special election. The names of other potential Democratic candidates were already circulating, including Assemblyman Billy Jones.</p><p>Republicans were discussing several possible candidates of their own, including State Senator Daniel G. Stec; Assemblymen Robert Smullen and Chris Tague; and Joe Pinion, a conservative activist who lost a bid for U.S. Senate in 2022.</p><p>In the meantime, Republicans in Washington were already jockeying to replace Ms. Stefanik in House leadership.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Fandos is a Times reporter covering New York politics and government.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-fandos">More about Nicholas Fandos</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/elise-stefanik">Elise Stefanik</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/united-nations">United Nations</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israeli Attacks:</strong><strong> </strong>Israel’s military struck a house in northern Gaza where displaced families were sheltering, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/middleeast/gaza-jabaliya-israel.html">killing at least 34 people</a>.
