Three of Valencia’s subway lines have collapsed, and train service will be suspended for three weeks, said Óscar Puente, the transport minister.</p><p>Assessing the damage in Valencia, Mr. Puente said “the entire regional road network is seriously damaged.”</p><p>As communities remain cut off, the authorities have deployed security forces to guard against looting. The national police said they had arrested 39 people in an operation in which the authorities recovered “a multitude of stolen items.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Thousands of trucks and cars were abandoned on streets and highways, buried in thick layers of mud, as underpasses were filled with water. Their owners were stranded in makeshift shelters, unable to make it home. Dead bodies were trapped in some vehicles, the Transport Ministry said.</p><p>Victims of the flooding in Valencia will receive a minimum of 6,000 euros, about $6,500, as part of a €250 million aid package <a href="https://twitter.com/carlos_mazon_/status/1851907550398001278" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced by</a> Carlos Mazon, the leader of the Valencia region.</p><p>Toni Zamorano, 59, sat on the ground outside a basketball hall in Valencia that had been turned into a dormitory. He was driving home when his car filled with water on Tuesday night. He pushed his door open and jumped into the water. Within a few minutes, he saw that his car had been completely covered in water and was floating away.</p><p>“I started swimming, walking, swimming,” he said. He was alone on a stretch of flooded highway, with the water up to his chest, as sofas, computers and cars floated by.</p><p>“Cars were like boats,” he said. “I honestly thought it was all over.”</p><p>Mr. Zamorano lives in the village of Sedavi, a few kilometers south of Valencia. He has not been able to make it home yet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“I don’t know what I’m going to find,” he said. “My whole town must be devastated, and I don’t know what my home is like.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Spending the night at a makeshift emergency shelter in an Ikea store south of Valencia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manaure Quintero/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Hernandez, 56, did not make it to his mother’s funeral. His wife eventually managed to cling onto a lamppost, but he did not, and was carried away. He tried to grab floating tires and poles until he managed to enter a bus that was stuck in the stream. The upper part of the bus was still dry, and he took off his wet clothes and wrapped himself in its curtains.</p><p>At about 4 a.m. on Wednesday, rescuers came for him. For hours, he had no idea what had happened to his wife.</p><p>He did not have his cellphone, and none of the emergency workers he spoke to had any information. Mr. Hernandez and his wife have known each other since they were both children, and they had been married nearly 30 years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Finally, on Wednesday morning, he called his brother, and got the news he was waiting for: She was alive. She also blamed him for not holding onto the lamppost as she did, and drifting away in the current, his brother said.</p><p>If she was complaining about him “It’s a sign she is doing well,” Mr. Hernandez said with a laugh, as he stood smoking outside a sports hall while wearing a sweater from the local basketball team that the rescuers had given him.</p><p>Inside, the eight courts had been turned into a dormitory, with dozens of mattresses laid geometrically below the backboards still bearing a score from the last game played there, 24.</p><p>Nuria Molio, 51, her brother, and her father were sitting together on one of the mattresses. They had just come out from an oncology checkup on her 84-year-old father when water came gushing into their car.</p><p>Rescuers had to extract them with a rope so that they would not be swept away. They spent the night under a bridge in the highway, with other dozens of people in their damp clothes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“I was afraid that the water would take us all,” Ms. Molio said.</p><p>Leaders around the world, particularly in Europe, sent messages of support as images of Spain’s devastation spread.</p><p>“I want to express my closeness to the people of Valencia,” Pope Francis said. “I am close to them in this moment of catastrophe. I pray for them.”</p><p>Mark A.
