His wife eventually managed to cling onto a lamppost, but he did not, and was carried away. He tried to grab floating tires and poles until he managed to enter a bus that was stuck in the stream. The upper part of the bus was still dry, and he took off his wet clothes and wrapped himself in its curtains.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>At about 4 a.m. on Wednesday, rescuers came for him. For hours, he had no idea what had happened to his wife.</p><p>He did not have his cellphone, and none of the emergency workers he spoke to had any information. Mr. Hernandez and his wife have known each other since they were both children, and they had been married nearly 30 years.</p><p>Finally, on Wednesday morning, he called his brother, and got the news he was waiting for: She was alive. She also blamed him for not holding onto the lamppost as she did, and drifting away in the current, his brother said.</p><p>If she was complaining about him “It’s a sign she is doing well,” Mr. Hernandez said with a laugh, as he stood smoking outside a sports hall while wearing a sweater from the local basketball team that the rescuers had given him.</p><p>Inside, the eight courts had been turned into a dormitory, with dozens of mattresses laid geometrically below the backboards still bearing a score from the last game played there, 24.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Nuria Molio, 51, her brother, and her father were sitting together on one of the mattresses. They had just come out from an oncology checkup on her 84-year-old father when water came gushing into their car.</p><p>Rescuers had to extract them with a rope so that they would not be swept away. They spent the night under a bridge in the highway with other dozens of people in their damp clothes.</p><p>“I was afraid that the water would take us all,” Ms. Molio said.</p><p>Lynsey Chutel<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emma-bubola">More about Emma Bubola</a></span></p></div></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
