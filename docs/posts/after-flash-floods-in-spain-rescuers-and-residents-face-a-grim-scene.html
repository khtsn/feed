The leader of the main opposition party, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, also visited the areas.</p><p>“We are not going to leave the people of Valencia on their own,” Mr. Sánchez said after visiting an emergency coordination center there. He also urged people to stay home, “because in that way we will be saving lives.”</p><p>Members of the Emergency Military Unit, civil guards and police officers were participating in the search-and-rescue operation, Mr. Sánchez said. </p><p>King Felipe VI of Spain also instructed the Royal Guard to join the search-and-rescue operation. “All of us join this shared pain,” the king said.</p><p>At least 155 people had been confirmed dead in the Valencia region alone, the emergency coordination center in Valencia said in a statement. Regional governments in Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia said three people had died in those regions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In and around the city of Valencia, the regional capital, water had gushed into ground-floor apartments, trapping some people. It flooded shopping centers, dog shelters and even a nursing home, killing some of its residents.

Three of Valencia’s subway lines have collapsed, and train service, including a high-speed link to Madrid, may be suspended for as long as three weeks, said Óscar Puente, the transport minister.</p><p>Assessing the damage in Valencia, Mr. Puente said “the entire regional road network is seriously damaged.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The authorities have deployed security forces to guard against looting. The national police said they had arrested 39 people in one operation and recovered “a multitude of stolen items.” </p><p>Thousands of trucks and cars were abandoned on streets and highways, buried in thick layers of mud. Their owners were housed in makeshift shelters, unable to make it home. Dead bodies were trapped in some vehicles, the Transport Ministry said.</p><p>Toni Zamorano, 59, sat on the ground outside a basketball hall in Valencia that had been turned into a dormitory. He was driving home when his car filled with water on Tuesday night. He pushed his door open and jumped into the water. Within a few minutes, he saw that his car had been completely covered in water and was floating away.</p><p>“I started swimming, walking, swimming,” he said. He was alone on a stretch of flooded highway, with the water up to his chest, as sofas, computers and cars floated by.</p><p>“Cars were like boats,” he said. “I honestly thought it was all over.”</p><p>Mr. Zamorano lives in the village of Sedavi, a few kilometers south of Valencia.

His wife eventually managed to cling onto a lamppost, but he did not, and was carried away. He tried to grab floating tires and poles until he managed to enter a bus that was stuck in the stream. The upper part of the bus was still dry, and he took off his wet clothes and wrapped himself in its curtains.</p><p>At about 4 a.m. on Wednesday, rescuers came for him. For hours, he had no idea what had happened to his wife.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He did not have his cellphone, and none of the emergency workers he spoke to had any information.

She also blamed him for not holding onto the lamppost as she did, his brother said.</p><p>If she was complaining about him, “it’s a sign she is doing well,” Mr. Hernandez said with a laugh, as he stood smoking outside a sports hall while wearing a sweater from the local basketball team that the rescuers had given him.</p><p>Inside, the eight courts had been turned into a dormitory, with dozens of mattresses laid geometrically below the backboards.</p><p>In Madrid, Ana de la Cuadra frantically exchanged text messages with members of her family, who were trapped in Catarroja, a town in southern Valencia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“They’ve warned that another wave of water may come,” Cristina de la Cuadra, her sister, said via text messages, accompanied by videos of rivers water gushing down the street. “We are in bad shape, without water or electricity.”</p><p>Soon after, she switched off her phone to conserve its battery.</p><p>Mark A.
