    <h1>James Carville: Why I’m Certain Kamala Harris Will Be President</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Money matters, and Ms. Harris has it in droves.</strong></p><p>More reality: Money matters in politics. If this weren’t the case, somebody would be wasting an awful lot of time raising it. Take it from Lindsey Graham, who is whining that Republicans <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/10/19/were-getting-creamed-graham-bemoans-harris-huge-fundraising-advantage-on-hannity/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are getting creamed</a> in fund-raising. He’s not wrong to complain, since Ms. Harris is processing Cheddar like a Wisconsin cheese factory.</p><p>Since joining the race, the vice president has raised an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/elections/kamala-harris-fund-raising.html" title="">eye-boggling $1 billion</a>, and last quarter one of her fund-raising committees reeled <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/16/trump-vs-harris-fundraising-race-harris-biggest-campaign-fund-takes-in-nearly-twice-as-much-as-trumps-committees/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in $633</a> million — dwarfing what Mr. Trump raised with two committees combined. All this cash not only effectively offsets the flow of money funneling in for Mr. Trump from some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/magazine/trump-donors-silicon-valley.html" title="">tech billionaires</a>, but it has also given Ms. Harris the resources she needs to persuade swing voters with ads and to organize on the ground. With her field operation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/us/politics/trump-harris-campaign-ground-game.html" title="">moving like a tremendous machine</a>, it seems likely there has never been a greater disparity in voter contact efforts. Mr. Trump can run all the high-profile TV ads he wants painting Ms. Harris as extreme, but what’s less discussed is that she is more than fighting back with ads reminding voters of how Mr. Trump betrayed his oath of office after the 2020 election and ended a woman’s right to choose. She is strapped with the necessary cash to forcefully remind suburban women and voters in the middle that Mr. Trump is, in fact, the extremist candidate.</p><p><strong>It’s just a feeling.</strong></p><p>My final reason is 100 percent emotional. We are constantly told that America is too divided, too hopelessly stricken by tribalism, to grasp the stakes. That is plain wrong. If the Cheneys and A.O.C. get that the Constitution and our democracy are on the ballot, every true conservative and every true progressive should get it too. A vast majority of Americans are rational, reasonable people of good will. I refuse to believe that the same country <a href="https://www.si.edu/spotlight/mlk?page=4&amp;iframe=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that has time and again overcome its mistakes</a> to bend its future toward justice will make the same mistake twice. America overcame Mr. Trump in 2020. I know that we know we are better than this.</p><p>Now, I don’t mean for my prediction of a Harris victory to breed complacency. We still have days of vital work to do. I say all this because a movement that marches with hope is 1,000 times as thunderous as a movement that marches with dread.</p><p>For the past <a href="https://www.politico.com/video/2019/06/13/trump-elevator-president-068293" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decade, Mr. Trump has infected American life with a malignant political sickness</a>, one that would have wiped out many other global democracies. On Jan. 6, 2021, our democracy itself nearly succumbed to it. But Mr. Trump has stated clearly that this will be <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123345/trump-wont-run-again-2028-election" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the last time</a> he runs for president. That is exactly why we should be exhilarated by what comes next: Mr. Trump is a loser; he is going to lose again. And it is highly likely that there will be no other who can carry the MAGA mantle in his wake — certainly <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/jd-vance-audition-trump-heir-apparent.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not his running mate.</a></p></div></div>
