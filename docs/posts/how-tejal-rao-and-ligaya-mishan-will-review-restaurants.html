I’m Tejal Rao, and I’m also your new chief restaurant critic at The New York Times. This is the first time that The Times has national critics and this is the first time that we’re revealing ourselves. So when Pete Wells stepped down, I texted him and I said, I pity the poor writer who will follow in your footsteps. And it’s you. And it’s us. I think it is unrealistic in this day and age to maintain anonymity short of being a CIA agent. I really don’t know how we could do that. How do you feel about not being anonymous anymore? I’ve essentially been anonymous since 2012. I was anonymous for so long that I kind of have a weird relationship with photos of myself. Hey, I like that photo. Oh good. I’m so glad. What a nice feeling. I love the idea of not playing the game of anonymity. The thought of connecting with readers or readers knowing who we are and being able to see our faces and trust us like that feels really exciting to me. I mean, I’ll always make reservations under a different name. I’ll always kind of be discreet when I’m going into places. So fake name, fake credit card. Well, real credit card but- So we need to create entire fake identities sort of like the Russian sleeper cells. Yes, like Olive Palooza. It came from one of my favorite novels. I combined the names of two different characters, and I’ve used it for years. I used to think that part of the fun of being a restaurant critic was that you got to dress up and pretend to be someone else. I think that we have to somehow find a way to remain grounded, so that even if we are recognized, we have to know what the experience of an ordinary customer who isn’t a critic, what is that like? I love the idea of criticism being like a team project. It makes so much sense. America is big. This is a really big and ambitious shift for The Times to cover restaurants nationally, and it would be kind of an impossible task for one person. Part of the fun of there being two of us is that we can talk about everything that’s happening, not just in our respective cities, but in the country, even the world. All these trends in dining and what they say about this moment in time. Restaurant criticism can show readers something about a place and a people and a community and politics In piece after piece you’re building this portrait. We’ve got to learn the whole language of the city as well as this particular restaurant, because how can you understand a restaurant unless you understand the whole landscape it’s in. You’re telling a story about everything that surrounds it. Geography and price point and cuisine like that national diversity is so exciting to me right now.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/10/arts/TL611-video-thumb/video-thumb-scoop-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Ligaya Mishan and Tejal Rao are the new restaurant critics at The New York Times, succeeding Pete Wells.

Most recently, Rao has been a California-based critic at large, writing broadly about food culture. Mishan was an Eat columnist for the Times Magazine and a writer at large at T magazine. She also wrote the Hungry City restaurant column from 2012 to 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/dining/11FD-CRITIC-EXPLAINER/00FD-TK-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/dining/11FD-CRITIC-EXPLAINER/00FD-TK-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/dining/11FD-CRITIC-EXPLAINER/00FD-TK-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Ligaya Mishan, left, wearing a black shirt, and Tejal Rao, in a black blazer and white shirt, pose in a studio portrait." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/dining/11FD-CRITIC-EXPLAINER/00FD-TK-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/dining/11FD-CRITIC-EXPLAINER/00FD-TK-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/dining/11FD-CRITIC-EXPLAINER/00FD-TK-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/dining/11FD-CRITIC-EXPLAINER/00FD-TK-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ad915e2b-1e27-540b-bf45-78edeac4c630" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ligaya Mishan, left, and Tejal Rao.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tony Cenicola/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-f4563f8">Why Does The Times Need Two Critics?</h2><p>For decades, the restaurant critic for The Times focused almost exclusively on New York City, writing weekly reviews and notebooks and awarding star ratings to individual restaurants. But with subscribers in every state, and great restaurants in each of them, we’ll now use two critics to deliver starred reviews of restaurants all over the country. The idea is to expand upon the work we started with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-restaurants-america.html" title="">the Restaurant List</a>, our annual national roundup of the 50 places our staff is most excited about, and our lists of the best restaurants in cities like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-restaurants-los-angeles.html" title="">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-restaurants-chicago.html" title="">Chicago</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-san-francisco-restaurants.html" title="">San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-restaurants-philadelphia.html" title="">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-restaurants-austin.html" title="">Austin, Texas</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-41cf013c">Who Does What?</h2><p>Rao will be dedicated entirely to the national dining scene. Mishan will split her time between reviewing the best and most newsworthy restaurants in New York City and covering the rest of the country with Rao. The goal is to capture particular moments in American dining — the restaurants that are most interesting, exciting and emblematic of our times.</p><h2 id="link-361eb6bf">With All That Travel, Will There Be Fewer New York Reviews?</h2><p>New York is one of the world’s great restaurant cities. It’s where The Times built its authority on the subject of where best to eat. We have no plans to back away from that, and in fact will offer even more New York restaurant coverage. In the coming months, we’ll start publishing brief, starred reviews from other Times critics. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/where-to-eat-new-york-city" title="">The Where to Eat newsletter</a> will continue to send restaurant recommendations to subscribers’ inboxes every week. And, of course, we’ll keep producing The Times’s annual list of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/dining/best-nyc-restaurants.html" title="">the 100 Best Restaurants in New York City</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photo of Pete Wells and other critics pinned to a board at Gertie in Brooklyn.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Liz Clayman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-5b8b6bcd">Aren’t Times Restaurant Critics Meant to Be Anonymous? Their Faces Are in the Video at the Top of This Page!</h2><p>Yes, indeed. No disguises, distorted voices or blurred faces. In a break with Times tradition, the new chief critics won’t attempt to hide their faces publicly — the internet has made such subterfuge all but impossible. Previous critics did it to avoid special treatment when they were dining at restaurants, though as Pete Wells can tell you, a restaurant on the lookout for critics will just about always spot them in the room. Critics at many other publications have already abandoned the quest for anonymity.</p><p>This change opens up bigger possibilities for how we cover restaurants in The Times. Rao and Mishan will appear in videos on our site, talking about criticism, the restaurants that excite them and how they do their work. Audiences want to know who’s making their recommendations, to put faces to names, to get a sense of their tastes and who they are. We hope these videos will do so, and help bring a new level of transparency and immediacy to our criticism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-12d278e6">But Won’t Restaurants Spot the Critics and Give Them Special Treatment?</h2><p>The critics can still do a great deal to eat at restaurants undetected, using aliases when they make reservations and pay the bill. (The Times pays for every meal the critics eat. The critics do not accept invitations to dine from publicists or restaurants. They book reservations the way everyone else does.)</p><p>It is true that there are things restaurant staff members can do once they realize a critic is in their restaurant. Service can be more attentive (though that’s not always a good thing); the critic can be seated at a great table; the kitchen can cook each dish twice (at least) and send out the best versions in generous portions. These are reasons Times critics visit restaurants many times when they’re awarding stars — to get a sense of how dishes and service fluctuate from meal to meal.</p><p>Ultimately, good restaurant criticism derives from the taste, expertise and point of view of the person doing it. Our critics’ job is to eat and describe the food as they experience it, and to contextualize each restaurant in a broader landscape. They seek the delicious, and help people understand the meals and restaurants that delivered it.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Food and Dining</h2><h3>Keep tabs on dining trends, restaurant reviews and recipes.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Saving Money on Groceries</strong>: Food costs continue to fluctuate, so we asked readers if they’ve changed how they shop and cook. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/article/readers-grocery-budget-recommendations">Here are some of their smart, money-saving tips</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Closing </strong><strong>Bar Tab</strong><strong>s:</strong> To the chagrin of bartenders, many 20-something bargoers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/business/gen-z-bar-etiquette.html">prefer to close out and pay after every single drink</a>, no matter how many they might order during an outing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving a Cockney Staple</strong>: Shop owners in the U.K. are fighting to win government protection for pie and mash, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/dining/london-cockney-pie-mash.html">a working-class meal with deep roots</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Wine Starter Pack:</strong> Strip away the talk and you’ll find wine is just delicious fun.
