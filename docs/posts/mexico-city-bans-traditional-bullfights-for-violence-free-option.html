It will allow for what proponents call “bullfighting without violence,” in which rules determine how long a bull can be in the ring and limit bullfighters to using only capes.</p><p>“My heart always beats for animal welfare,” said Xochitl Bravo Espinosa, a Mexico City legislator who helped spearhead the effort.</p><p>But Ms. Bravo Espinosa said that legislators tried to find a balance in which the bullfights could go on, albeit modified, so that people who made a living off the industry could continue working. She pointed to people who sell gear and food around La Plaza México, the largest bullfighting arena in the world, which opened in 1946 in the heart of the city and seats 42,000 people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Bullfighting proponents denounced the legislation, protesting outside the Mexico City legislature’s building on Tuesday morning. </p><p>“This is just the beginning of a fight for our bullfighting,” four bullfighting groups <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHWmi3XyKQN/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a joint statement later in the day.</p><p>Raúl Pérez Johnston, a lawyer for Tauromaquia Mexicana, a national bullfighting organization, said in an interview that there were a number of remaining questions about the implementation of the law, which is expected to go into effect in the coming days, and that the group planned to challenge it legally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A young supporter of bullfighting joins a demonstration in support of the custom outside Mexico City’s legislative building, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ginnette Riquelme/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHMPyIfpoC9/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> leading up to Tuesday’s vote, La Plaza México said that the proposal to alter bullfighting was “a clear threat against one of the most deeply rooted cultural traditions in our country.” It said the changes “completely distort the essence and go against the heart and origins of this tradition.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Bullfighting was at the center of a major legal fight over its return to Mexico City just last year. A human rights group successfully convinced a federal judge in 2022 to approve a suspension of bullfights at La Plaza México. But arena officials appealed the decision, and Mexico’s Supreme Court <a href="https://elpais.com/mexico/2023-12-06/la-suprema-corte-avala-el-regreso-de-las-corridas-de-toros-a-ciudad-de-mexico.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revoked the suspension</a>, paving the way for bullfights to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/world/americas/bullfighting-mexico.html" title="">return with much fanfare</a> in January 2024.</p><p>Bullfighting, spread by Spain throughout its colonies in Latin America in the 1500s, has faced a mounting, existential crisis over the years.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://anoet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/festejos-2022.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a steady decline</a> over the decades because of prohibitions and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/world/europe/bullfighting-spain-coronavirus.html" title="">deepening opposition</a>, the practice continues in at least five other countries beside Spain and Mexico: France, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, where a ban doesn’t begin <a href="https://apnews.com/article/colombia-bullfighting-ban-a7b7d0a8f87abef0e79c4eec693af574" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">until 2027</a>. </p><p>Mexico’s first recorded bullfight was in 1526, and over 300 bullfighting plazas remain. But since 2013, five of Mexico’s 31 states have prohibited bullfights.</p><p>The battle over bullfighting has come to symbolize a larger culture war between tradition and more modern views on animal cruelty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>According to Mexico City’s legislature, 168 bulls and steers were killed at La Plaza México in 2019. Proponents of the tradition have argued that represents a very small percentage of all bulls born in Mexico and that the bullfighting industry creates tens of thousands of jobs in the country.</p><p>The new legislation decreed that bullfighters will only be allowed to use the traditional large cape and the smaller red one to lure the bulls. It also determined that individual bull fights last only 15 minutes, with only six such bull fights per event.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An animal-rights demonstrator carries a sign that reads in Spanish “A real festival does not need blood,” outside Mexico’s City’s legislative building, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ginnette Riquelme/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mayor Clara Brugada of Mexico City, who proposed the violence-free option, <a href="https://x.com/ClaraBrugadaM/status/1902035239901286888" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">welcomed</a> Tuesday’s vote with “great happiness.” In recent days, Ms. Sheinbaum said she, too, was in favor of the violence-free bullfights and <a href="https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/sheinbaum-reitera-respaldo-a-clara-brugada-por-proponer-corridas-de-toros-sin-violencia-es-un-avance-muy-importante-dice/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> them “a very important step.”</p><p>Some animal rights groups also applauded the legislation — but argued it hadn’t gone far enough.</p><p>“Bloodless bullfighting is just the beginning,” <a href="https://x.com/BeAnimalHeroes/status/1902076947594666372" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Animal Heroes, an organization that started a “Mexico Without Bullfighting” campaign six years ago. “We will continue fighting until we achieve its total abolition.”</p><p>Ms. Bravo Espinosa, the legislator, said that within seven months, the city government will issue the new bullfighting regulations, with input from all sides, on exactly how the new bull events can be held.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>James Wagner covers Latin America, including sports, and is based in Mexico City.
