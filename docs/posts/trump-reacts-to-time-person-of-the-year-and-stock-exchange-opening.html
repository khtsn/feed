In 1985, Ronald Reagan became <a href="https://nyti.ms/3ZNYxSB" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the first sitting president</a> to perform the task, telling the crowd that his policies would expand the nation’s economy and that “we’re about to turn the bull loose.”</p><p>Though Mr. Trump’s political rise has been enabled by appeals to the American working class, the son of a Queens real estate developer made his name as a swaggering incarnation of high-rise Manhattan luxury — a fact that is somewhat easier to remember with Mr. Trump presiding over the nerve center of American capitalism, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/12/trump-rings-bell-at-nyse-to-cheers-of-usa-as-wall-street-ceos-business-leaders-look-on.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promising to slash corporate tax rates</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And if the opening bell was sweet for Mr. Trump, doing so against a glossy image of himself on the cover of Time must have made it that much sweeter — as the president-elect has had a lifelong interest in the now-faded emblem of a gilded age of American media.</p><p>In 2016, after his first Person of the Year win, Mr. Trump said that he had grown up reading the magazine. He first appeared on its cover in 1989 with the headline, “This Man May Turn You Green With Envy — or Just Turn You Off. Flaunting It Is His Game, and Trump Is his Name.” In 2015, Mr. Trump <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/674587800835092480" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed frustration on Twitter</a> that he had not been named Person of the Year (it went to Germany’s Angela Merkel), and predicting he would never win.
