Fleming, the chief executive of the J. Paul Getty Trust. “When we asked people to participate, it was like pushing on an open door.”</p><p>Called the LA Arts Community Fire Relief Fund, the effort aims to support “artists and arts workers in all disciplines who have lost residences, studios, livelihoods or have otherwise been impacted by the devastating Los Angeles fires,” the organization said.</p><p>The fund will be administered by the <a href="https://www.cciarts.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Center for Cultural Innovation</a>, an arts support organization.
