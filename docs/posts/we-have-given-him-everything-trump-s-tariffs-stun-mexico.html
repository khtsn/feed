Little did it matter that Mr. Trump had announced that very day that he would go ahead with the planned taxes.</p><p>“I am still incredulous,” said Mr. Presburger, director of sales at Preslow, a family-run apparel business in Mexico. “We know by now that Trump pressures you so you give him what he wants. We have given him everything and he has not let loose of his grip.”</p><p>In response to Mr. Trump’s threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on Mexican products, Mexico made a major effort: Leaders agreed to send more than two dozen alleged cartel heads to be tried in the United States, a departure from the government’s previous stance on extraditions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>President Claudia Sheinbaum dispatched thousands of National Guard troops to the state of Sinaloa, the hub of fentanyl trafficking, where they seized vast amounts of the synthetic opioid and busted hundreds of laboratories.

Even the financial markets held steady in Mexico.</p><p>Mexico’s economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, <a href="https://x.com/m_ebrard/status/1895542036264337569" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> to social media on Friday, “Mexico and the United States have a great future working together,” with three thumbs-up emojis. Business leaders across the country shared the same optimism until Monday.</p><p>José de Jesús Rodríguez, president of Mexico City’s chamber of commerce, said Mr. Trump’s decision surprised him, particularly in light of the American leader’s suggestion that he would not impose tariffs if Mexico produced results on migration and drug trafficking. The results it delivered included a barrage of high-level arrests and the handover of the 29 accused drug bosses that the U.S. government had long sought to get on its own soil.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But Mr. Trump, whose criticism of Mexico had focused on illegal fentanyl, shifted his terms on Monday, saying that Canada and Mexico needed to relocate automotive factories and other manufacturing to the United States. “What they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,” he said.</p><p>“It is extremely disappointing and frustrating,” Mr. Rodríguez said. “The United States broke their word, and it dictates the future of our commercial relationship.”</p><p>“It’s time for us to look to other regions,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The BMW Group Plant in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.

Canada also announced reciprocal tariffs.</p><p>“We don’t want to enter into a trade war,” she said. “That only affects the people.”</p><p>Ms. Sheinbaum’s approval ratings in Mexico have soared, with many praising her coolheaded approach to handling Mr. Trump, who called her a “wonderful woman.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But the trade wars that are now underway will test not only that relationship but how much the government can insulate its economy and its population from chaos and pain.</p><p>Mr. Presburger, the Preslow sales director, said that he still hoped the tariffs wouldn’t last more than a few days, or that Mr. Trump would change his mind. Otherwise, “it will be disastrous for Mexico.”</p><p>The United States buys more than three quarters of Mexico’s exports, and tariffs will hit manufacturing, agriculture and other businesses, immediately disrupting the supply chain and most likely raising the cost of Mexican goods sold in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Trucks line up near the Mexico-U.S. border before going through the Otay commercial crossing in Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guillermo Arias/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Just hours before the tariffs went into effect, Manuel Sotelo, president of the association of transporters of Ciudad Juárez, said the uncertainty hovered over the many who truck goods into the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He said if tariffs applied to all Mexican products, they would affect everyone. But if they also applied to raw materials coming from businesses on the border, “then the situation is going to get worse for the region.”</p><p>He said the transportation industry could not last even a week if trade were frozen.</p><p>When Mr. Trump hit Mexico with tariffs during his first term, it carried out a surgical response, targeting the retaliatory tariffs at products that were produced in Republican states considered part of Trump’s base — such as Kentucky bourbon.</p><p>The tariffs were lifted after about a year.</p><p>Preparing for the worst, Mexican business owners and trade groups were already starting to scramble.</p><p>Antonio Lancaster, president of the council of industrial chambers of the state of Jalisco, one of the largest exporters of food and beverages — including tequila — to the United States, said the chambers’ leaders were already in talks with the state and federal government about plans to bolster local production and pursue other export markets.</p><p>“We saw this coming, and this means we will pursue a rearrangement of our exports,” Mr. Lancaster said.
