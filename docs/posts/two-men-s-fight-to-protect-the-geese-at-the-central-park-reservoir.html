He tried to stop it.</p><p>He reached out to animal rights organizations and wrote letters to various government agencies. He got nowhere.</p><p>Then in December, he met Larry Schnapf, a tough-talking environmental lawyer, who spotted Mr. Dorson admiring the birds and introduced himself. Mr. Dorson told him about the nest destruction. Mr. Schnapf, in his 40-year legal career, had mostly focused on redeveloping contaminated properties but had picked up the occasional pro bono passion project. “I told him I take on quixotic pursuits,” Mr. Schnapf said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Now, they are teaming up to protect the eggs of a small population of Canada geese that nest around the reservoir, a popular attraction for joggers and bird watchers. The battle will undoubtedly be uphill: They are lobbying multiple government agencies during a fraught time in aviation where bird strikes are one of many concerns, on behalf of a bird often described as a <a href="https://dec.ny.gov/nature/animals-fish-plants/nuisance-wildlife-species/canada-geese" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nuisance</a> because of its honking cries and the droppings it leaves on lawns, parks and golf courses.</p><p>The men say they appreciate the importance of protecting planes. But they are seeking to exempt the Central Park Reservoir from the egg destruction program so that it can serve as a sanctuary for the nesting geese. They argue that Central Park is far enough from the area’s airports that the geese do not pose a major problem. </p><p>Mr. Schnapf said he plans to send a cease-and-desist letter to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees five major airports in the region, including Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport and LaGuardia Airport. The agency works with an arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the safety program. “I think this is all unlawful,” he said. “These are protected animals.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Larry Schnapf, left, and Edward Dorson met at the Central Park Reservoir and bonded over their love of the humble Canada goose.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Angelina Katsanis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Port Authority officials did not comment on the advocacy plans of the two men. But they stressed that government efforts like those underway in Central Park were part of creating safer conditions for air travel.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Managing wildlife risks — especially from resident Canada geese — near our airports is a life safety imperative and essential to maintaining safe operations,” said Laura Francoeur, the Port Authority’s chief wildlife biologist.</p><p>Although Canada geese are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, authorities have obtained a waiver to control the population. The birds, which can weigh as much as 19 pounds and have a wingspan up to 5.5 feet, according to the <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Canada_Goose/id" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a>, can get sucked into plane engines and bring an aircraft down.</p><p>Between 2008 and 2023, there were 451 aviation accidents involving commercial aircraft in the United States, with a total of 17 caused by bird strikes, producing five injuries and no fatalities, according to the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/StatisticalReviews/Pages/CivilAviationDashboard.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Transportation Safety Board</a>.</p><p>New York City tightened its grip on Canada geese in 2009, after a collision with a flock caused US Airways Flight 1549, piloted by Chesley B. Sullenberger III, to lose both its engines shortly after it took off from LaGuardia. The plane was forced into an emergency water landing in what is now commonly known as the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/us-airways-flight-1549" title="">miracle on the Hudson</a>.”</p><p>The event prompted the Port Authority to ask the Department of Agriculture for help. In 2010, federal wildlife workers took on the management of Canada geese populations <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/press_releases/11-48pr.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">within seven miles</a> of the city’s major airports, including in city parks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Schnapf calls the current rules an overreach, since Federal Aviation Administration guidelines call for wildlife management only within <a href="https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/150-5200-33C.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five miles of airports</a>. A Port Authority spokeswoman said the agency honors all federal regulations, including addressing wildlife hazards within five miles of airports. But she added that the agency will often go beyond that radius when specific threats arise.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A nest that recently had eggs removed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Angelina Katsanis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><a href="https://wildlife.faa.gov/search" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Data from the F.A.A.</a> shows that Canada geese strikes at LaGuardia and Kennedy Airports have remained consistent over the last two decades, with between zero and four instances per year.</p><p>Canada geese thrive in people-friendly landscapes, and their population has boomed throughout North America over the last four decades. Many geese have become so comfortable in parks and other green spaces, like the reservoir, that they have stopped migrating, becoming year-round residents.</p><p>There are about 228,000 resident Canada geese in New York State, up from 150,000 in 2002. The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation would like to see that number shrink to 85,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The two men fighting for the Central Park Reservoir’s resident geese were both born in the Bronx, are similar in age and diet (one is a vegetarian, the other a vegan). But the similarities more or less end there.</p><p>Mr. Dorson, 77, an <a href="https://www.edwarddorson.com/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accomplished underwater photographer</a> and conservationist with a background in the arts, is a soft-spoken lover of hard-to-love animals — he helped start a <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/pacific-islands-band-together-on-a-shark-sanctuary/" title="">shark sanctuary</a> in Palau, in Micronesia. Mr. Schnapf, 72, is a fast-talking, fast-acting networker who is not afraid to make noise.</p><p>“I told Ed,” he said, “you’ve got to rattle the bureaucracy.”</p><p>Mr. Dorson and Mr. Schnapf are hoping to meet with officials from the Port Authority, the Central Park Conservancy and the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the reservoir, among other decision makers.</p><p>”All we’re trying to do is get them to talk to us, so we can come up with a plan so at least some of those eggs can be hatched,” Mr. Schnapf said.</p><p>Mr. Dorson admitted that, right now, “I don’t see too many people like me who are worried about the geese.”</p><p>“But maybe 10 years from now, when there are no geese here, then people might feel the loss,” he said. “I’d like to change that.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hilary Howard is a Times reporter covering how the New York City region is adapting to climate change and other environmental challenges.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Flourishing World of Central Park</h2><h3>This verdant tourist destination is a pleasure ground for locals, too.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>36 Hours in Central Park:</strong> With its endless trails, hidden nooks, museums and nearby night spots, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/travel/things-to-do-in-36-hours-in-central-park-new-york.html">the park is a hub for </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/travel/things-to-do-in-36-hours-in-central-park-new-york.html">both thriving activities and where one can find</a> a more tranquil, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/travel/100000003118087/36-hours-central-park-new-york.html">timeless Manhattan</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Harlem Meer Center: </strong>The new center, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/nyregion/central-park-harlem-meer-center.html">opening early in 2025</a>, will replace the Lasker Rink and Pool and will serve the largely Black and Latino communities surrounding the northern end of the park.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flaco’s Kingdom</strong>: Before his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/24/nyregion/flaco-eurasian-eagle-owl-nyc.html">demise</a>, the Eurasian eagle-owl’s escape from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/nyregion/flaco-owl-central-park-zoo-dead.html">Central Park Zoo</a> and subsequent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/nyregion/flaco-owl-central-park-zoo.html">life on the loose</a> captured the public’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/nyregion/flaco-outlaw-kakutani.html">attention and hearts</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shakespeare Hits the Road: </strong>To many people, Central Park in the summer equals Shakespeare in the Park.
