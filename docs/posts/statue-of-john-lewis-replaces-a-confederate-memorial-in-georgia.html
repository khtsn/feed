In 2019, a plaque was installed that said the memorial promoted white supremacy and the obelisk was removed in 2020.</p><p>Before Mr. Lewis, a Democrat, was elected to Congress, he had risked his life for the civil rights movement. He was one of the original <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/freedom-riders-john-lewis-work.html" title="">13 Freedom Riders</a> who rode buses across the South in 1961 to protest segregation on public transportation and was a founder of the<em> </em>Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which coordinated sit-ins.</p></div></div><div><p>He helped organize the March on Washington and helped lead hundreds of demonstrators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/us/selma-john-lewis-memorial.html" title="">across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala.</a>, in 1965 to demand voting rights. At the march in Selma, a trooper fractured Mr. Lewis’s skull with a club after troopers attacked the nonviolent demonstrators.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Lewis was a Civil Rights giant who represented Georgia in Congress for 17 consecutive terms.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Makela for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The statue of Mr. Lewis, sculpted by the artist Basil Barrington Watson, who was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and moved to Georgia in 2002, will officially be unveiled on Aug. 24.</p><p>The sculpture stands where a Confederate monument was put in place in 1908 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The organization was behind the creation of Confederate memorials and monuments and played a key role in promoting the Lost Cause narrative of the Civil War, which downplays or ignores the role of slavery as the war’s cause.</p><p>The obelisk was one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/28/us/confederate-statue-removal.html" title="">at least 230 Confederate symbols</a> to be removed, relocated or renamed after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis in 2020.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Amid calls to take down the obelisk in Decatur, a DeKalb County judge said <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/breaking-confederate-monument-decatur-appears-coming-down/1SfeR7g7YZdScfGI5NVfSJ/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in June 2020</a> that it was a public nuisance and should be removed and put in storage.</p><p>Local groups had previously urged for the memorial to be removed, including in 2017 after a woman was killed protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., but officials said that state law blocked them from taking it down.</p><p><a href="https://dekalbhistory.org/blog-posts/the-monument-that-sparked-a-movement/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In 2019</a>, the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners installed a plaque near the monument that provided context for the memorial and said it had “bolstered white supremacy and faulty history.”</p><p>“This monument and similar ones also were created to intimidate African-Americans and limit their full participation in the social and political life of their communities,” the plaque read in part.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Lewis, right, with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., third from right, on a march to the courthouse in Montgomery, Ala., in 1965.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Several groups suggested that a statue of Mr. Lewis be erected where the Confederate obelisk had stood and the task force agreed.
