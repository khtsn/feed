Suddenly, the clinical trial was on hold.</p><p>“They were ready to enroll,” said Alanna Caffas, the chief executive of the Veterans Health Foundation, which administers the trials. “They had the lab kits on site. They had the drug to dispense. But they couldn’t get the clinical research coordinator renewed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>While Trump administration officials have promised to preserve core patient services, initial cuts at the V.A. have nonetheless spawned chaotic ripple effects. They have disrupted studies involving patients awaiting experimental treatments, forced some facilities to fire support staff and created uncertainty amid the mass cancellation, and partial reinstatement, of hundreds of contracts targeted by Mr. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb/00dc-va-cuts-pitt-cqtb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/1ff72b7d-ba97-5ae3-8ad2-3f3afc372e02" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The research office at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Pittsburgh, seen on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The changes have shaken the veterans department, which stands out in the labyrinth of agencies and offices under siege by Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk.</p><p>It is in many ways a natural target for reform — a bureaucratic behemoth with roughly 480,000 employees, some 90,000 contracts and a documented history of scandals and waste. But it also treats 9.1 million veterans, provides critical medical research and, according to some studies, offers care that is comparable to or better than many private health systems. Even Project 2025, the conservative governing blueprint assembled by Trump allies, said the V.A. had transformed into “one of the most respected U.S. agencies.”</p><p>The V.A. is also one of the most politically sensitive departments in the government, serving a constituency courted heavily by Republicans, including Mr. Trump, who has made overhauling the agency a talking point since his 2016 campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Now, with V.A. Secretary Doug Collins vowing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/veterans-affairs-cuts-trump.html" title="">much deeper round of cuts</a> — eliminating some 80,000 jobs and reviewing tens of thousands of contracts — some Republican lawmakers are warning that the tumultuous process risks undoing recent progress.</p><p>G.O.P. lawmakers questioned Mr. Musk about the cuts during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-republican-senators.html" title="">a closed-door meeting last week</a>, with Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican, telling reporters afterward that, although improvements can be made, “we want to make sure veterans get the care they need.”</p><p>This account of the early days of DOGE-led cuts inside the V.A. is based on more than two dozen interviews with hospital administrators, current and recently terminated employees, heads of independent foundations that support the veterans’ health system, government contractors and research scientists. Many agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because they want to continue to serve veterans or hope to be reinstated in their jobs, and feared retribution from the Trump administration.</p><p>Among the 2,400 employees fired from the V.A. since Mr. Trump’s inauguration are workers who purchase medical supplies, schedule appointments and arrange rides for patients to see their doctors. Many are veterans themselves. All were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-federal-workers-fired-rehired.html" title="">“probationary” employees</a>, meaning they were relatively new on the job and had fewer legal protections. Some may be reinstated, pending court action.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>James Stancil, an Army veteran who stocked supplies for emergency and spinal injury care at a V.A. hospital in Milwaukee, said he and nearly half his shift of supply technicians lost their jobs last month.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>James Stancil, an Army veteran, in his apartment in Milwaukee last week.

Mr. Kasperowicz said the extension would allow for a “comprehensive assessment of ongoing research initiatives to evaluate their impact on Veteran health care.”</p><p>Mr. Collins appeared to bring some of his concerns about the agency’s future to a Cabinet meeting last week, asking Mr. Musk to be strategic in his government-shrinking process, The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-power.html" title="">previously reported</a>.</p><p>In public, however, Mr. Collins has expressed enthusiastic support for the effort. He has also exempted about 300,000 “mission critical” workers from being cut , including medical professionals like doctors and nurses.</p><p>“But we will be making major changes,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=juRR9-ojusA&amp;feature=youtu.be" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. “So get used to it.”</p><h2 id="link-e73cc6d">Research Disruptions</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Doug Collins, the secretary of veterans affairs, has vowed to cut 80,000 more positions, roughly 15 percent of the current work force.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Although the Veterans Affairs Department is better known for the health care it provides, conducting scientific research is one of the agency’s core missions, offering veterans early access to cutting-edge treatments that are still in clinical trials.</p><p>With 170 hospitals nationwide — and patients who tend to volunteer for studies at higher rates than civilians — the V.A. has pioneered studies that often seek to enroll large numbers of patients at multiple sites across the country.</p><p>Some of the agency’s research focuses on conditions that disproportionately afflict veterans like traumatic brain injury, spinal cord and blast injuries. But the V.A. is also credited with landmark discoveries such as aspirin’s ability to prevent heart attacks, the first cardiac pacemaker and the nicotine patch.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s Jan. 20 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/hiring-freeze/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> freezing government hiring cut off many of the V.A.’s critical research staff midway through studies, said Rashi Romanoff, the chief executive of the National Association of Veterans’ Research and Education Foundations, an association that supports partnerships between the veterans department and nonprofits.</p><p>If their appointments are not renewed, “any work with the V.A. must be suspended; they can’t have contact with patients; they have no access to data,” Ms. Romanoff said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. Romanoff estimated that some 200 research staff members involved in 300 or more trials were at risk of being cut off during the first 90 days following the federal hiring freeze, threatening to disrupt trials providing treatment to some 10,000 veterans if no action is taken. Scientists are already considering moving trials to other institutions, which will mean veterans are no longer first in line for participation, and could cause millions of dollars in research funds to go to waste, she said.</p><p>In Pittsburgh, at least 20 research staff involved in more than a dozen studies have a specific type of appointment that comes without compensation from the V.A. The disrupted projects included three offering new drugs for lung and other cancers.</p><p>Mr. Kasperowicz said the 90-day extensions include research staff jobs in an effort to maintain “continuity of all research efforts” while the V.A. assesses the value of the research. He said the department would reach out to the Pittsburgh medical center “to ensure they understand this policy.”</p><h2 id="link-308fcbd">Struggle Over Contracts</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk with Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, at the White House on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The V.A. has long struggled to maintain oversight over its spending, including a vast network of contracts worth some $67 billion per year, according to the agency. A report by the agency’s inspector general’s office noted “improper and unknown” payments totaling <a href="https://www.vaoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2024-05/vaoig-24-00510-167.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$3.2 billion</a> in fiscal year 2023.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In an initial push in late February, the V.A. tried to cancel roughly 875 contracts. The list of cuts was “provided” by DOGE, according to emails reviewed by The Times, with a directive that “terminations should begin as quickly as possible.”</p><p>“No more paying consultants to do things like make Power Point slides and write meeting minutes!” Mr. Collins <a href="https://x.com/SecVetAffairs/status/1894426832641913204" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a social media post announcing the cuts.</p><p>But senior V.A. officials were soon making frantic appeals to roll some of them back.</p><p>In an email, one official wrote that the contracts on the termination list included over 100 that “were deemed to be mission critical,” adding that their cancellation would “lead to catastrophic mission failure for essential veteran programs or health care operations.” The email highlighted services like sterilizing medical equipment, maintaining boilers and generators, filling prescriptions and overseeing human clinical trials, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/25/veterans-affairs-contracts-canceled/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some of which were previously highlighted by The Washington Post</a>.</p><p>Within minutes, Dr. Steven Lieberman, the acting under secretary for health, underscored the message. “Please reconsider the decision being made,” Dr. Lieberman wrote in an email reviewed by The Times.</p><p>Early the next morning, the V.A. tried to pump the brakes.</p><p>“ALL — PLEASE HALT ANY CONTRACT TERMINATIONS THAT ARE IN PROGRESS,” another official wrote, highlighting his words in yellow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>But many contractors had already been notified that they were losing their work, emails show. By the next week, the V.A. had managed to walk back some of the terminations, saying it would <a href="https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-to-terminate-585-non-mission-critical-or-duplicative-contracts/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancel</a> 585 of the original contracts.</p><p>One that was spared was a contract for maintaining imaging machines in a Midwest hospital, which would have had to halt all scans as soon as the machines came due for inspection.</p><p>The hospital fought successfully to reinstate that contract. But it is still pushing to rescind the cancellation of other service contracts, such as one for technicians who order medical supplies, an administrator at the hospital said.</p><p>Mr. Kasperowicz, the V.A. spokesman, said that the contracts that were canceled “were identified through a deliberative, multilevel review” involving senior department leaders and contracting officials.</p><p>So far the V.A. has refused to reinstate some contracts because the work does not involve direct interaction with patients or their families, emails shared with The Times show.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>But one hospital administrator said many positions are critical even if they do not entail direct patient care — such as those who purchase medical supplies.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The V.A. facility in Indianapolis where Ms. Duncan worked.
