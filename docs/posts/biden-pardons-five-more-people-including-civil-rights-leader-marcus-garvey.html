    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In its announcement, the White House highlighted his contributions, including creating the Black Star Line, the first Black-owned shipping line and method of international travel, and founding the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which celebrated African history and culture.</p><p>The White House also cited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday will be observed on Monday, describing Mr. Garvey, who died in 1940, as “the first man of color in the history of the United States to lead and develop a mass movement.”</p><p>Among those to receive pardons, which wipe records clean of convictions, is Darryl Chambers, a gun violence prevention advocate who was previously convicted of a nonviolent drug offense and sentenced to 17 years in prison in 1998; Ravi Ragbir, a well-known advocate for immigrants who was convicted of a nonviolent offense in 2001; and Don Scott, a lawyer who served his sentence for a nonviolent drug offense and went on to be elected to the Virginia legislature in 2019, and became the first Black speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates last year.</p></div></div>
