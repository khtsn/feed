Judge Xinis also set a hearing for 1 p.m. on Friday to discuss the next steps in the case.</p><p>But shortly before 9:30 a.m., the Justice Department asked Judge Xinis to postpone the deadline for its written filing until Tuesday and push off the hearing until Wednesday. Department lawyers said, among other things, they needed more time to review the Supreme Court’s order.</p><p>In an order of her own, Judge Xinis gave the government until 11:30 a.m. to file a written version of its plans, but refused to change the schedule for the hearing.</p><p>Clearly frustrated, she reminded the Justice Department that the administration’s “act of sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador was wholly illegal from the moment it happened.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Moreover, she said the department’s request for additional time to study a four-page Supreme Court order “blinks at reality.”</p><p>While the Supreme Court’s ruling appeared at first blush to be a victory for Mr. Abrego Garcia and his family, it contained a line that Trump officials could ultimately use to double down on their position that they cannot be forced to bring him back from El Salvador.</p><p>In their decision, the justices never defined what they meant by “facilitate and effectuate” his return, sending that question back to Judge Xinis to flesh out.</p><p>Indeed, the justices cautioned Judge Xinis that when she clarifies the steps the White House should take, her decision needed to be made “with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.”</p><p>Trump officials, throughout this case and others, have asserted that judges should not be able to intrude on the president’s right to manage foreign policy.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
