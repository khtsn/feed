In recent years, he led a rebranding effort of an organization once known for deadly insurrections: building a large coalition, softening its radical positions, and pitching it as the answer to the politics of patronage that has brought only hardship to many of the island nation’s roughly 23 million people.</p><p>Early results showed Mr. Dissanayake leading with around 40 percent of votes amid high turnout, estimated at 75 to 80 percent. His closest competitor had received about 35 percent of the votes cast.</p><p>At least three senior leaders of his opposition, including Sri Lanka’s current foreign minister, had already put out messages congratulating him on his imminent victory, as dawn broke on overnight vote counting that is continuing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But it will be hours still before his victory could be confirmed, as the results will most likely require another round of counting that includes voters’ second and third choices.</p><p>In Sri Lanka’s ranked choice election system, voters can mark one candidate on their ballot or list three candidates in order of preference. If no candidate gets 50 percent or more of the vote, a second round of counting factors in the preferences of voters whose first choice did not make it to the top two.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Election officials carrying ballot boxes to a counting center in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Navesh Chitrakar/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At the end of a peaceful and orderly vote on Saturday, the government made a surprise announcement of an overnight curfew as the counting continued. But a statement of support from Mr. Dissanayake’s camp suggested it was a coordinated effort to prevent violence, rather than anything sinister.</p><p>It is the first time a presidential election in Sri Lanka has appeared genuinely multipronged, in contrast to a history of direct competition between coalitions formed by the two parties that have dominated ever since the nation became a republic in 1972.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While officially more than 30 candidates were contesting, the majority of the votes were split among three front-runners.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/world/asia/sri-lanka-rajapaksa.html" title="">popular protest movement</a> that forced the powerful Rajapaksa clan out of power in 2022 threw the political landscape wide open, the anger reshaping the dynamics down to the local level.</p><p>Before its fall, the Rajapaksa government had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/world/asia/sri-lanka-basil-rajapaksa.html" title="">become a family affair,</a> with various relatives serving as president and prime minister, as well as helming several ministries and key positions. But its fall has been so thorough that Namal Rajapaksa, the family’s 38-year-old political heir and presidential candidate in the current election, was a distant fourth or fifth, with a single-digit share of the votes, based on the early trends.</p><p>Ranil Wickremesinghe, the 75-year-old political survivor who stepped in as interim president after Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country when protesters surrounded his home, has helped stabilize the country and negotiated a bailout package with the International Monetary Fund.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>As interim president, Ranil Wickremesinghe helped stabilize the country after widespread protests ousted the previous president in 2022. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dinuka Liyanawatte/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But Mr. Wickremesinghe was also trailing far behind in Saturday’s vote, with his roughly 17 percent of the votes putting him in third place — a sign of anger over his austerity measures that have pinched the poor hard, and of his lasting public image as part of the discredited old guard.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The main contender for runner-up was Sajith Premadasa, the opposition leader, who was formerly in Mr. Wickremesinghe’s party before a messy public split. His share of the votes in the early trends was about 35 percent.</p><p>Mr. Dissanayake positioned his National People’s Power coalition, built around his old J.V.P. party as its largest partner, as the best positioned to deliver the public demands of the protest movement for cleaning up Sri Lanka’s deeply entrenched political patronage and corruption. He brought in new faces at the top, and focused on reaching out to and mobilizing women, who were particularly hard hit by the economic collapse. He also softened his own party’s old radical Marxist messaging.</p><p>His efforts appeared to have resonated with a tired public ready for change.</p><p>“I’m voting for the Compass this time,” said Saman Ratnasiri, 49, an auto-rickshaw driver in Colombo, referring to the election symbol of Mr. Dissanayake’s coalition. He said he had never voted for Mr. Dissanayake before, but he wanted to give his outfit a shot after other leaders had failed him.</p><p>“If we don’t get it right this time also, then I might as well forget about this country,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The government made a surprise announcement of an overnight curfew as vote counting continued late into Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ishara S.
