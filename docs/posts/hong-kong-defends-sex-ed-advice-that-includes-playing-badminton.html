What should he do?</p><p>In Hong Kong, the authorities advise the young man to continue studying or to seek a diversion, including badminton, to avoid premarital sex and other “intimate behaviors.”</p><p>Critics, including lawmakers and sex educators, say that the Chinese territory’s new sex education materials are regressive. But top officials are not backing down, and the standoff is getting kind of awkward.</p><p>“Is badminton the Hong Kong answer to sexual impulses in schoolchildren?” the South China Morning Post newspaper <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3275787/badminton-hong-kong-answer-sexual-impulses-schoolchildren-we-ask-experts" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked in a headline</a> over the weekend.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Hong Kong teenagers find it all pretty amusing. A few said on social media that the officials behind the policy have their “heads in the clouds.” Others have worked it into sexual slang, talking about “friends with badminton” instead of “friends with benefits.”</p><p>The sex ed materials were published last week by the Education Bureau <a href="https://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-development/kla/pshe/references-and-resources/ces/support_materials_S3/M3.1%20(Part2)%20Sexuality_e_2023%20Dec_clean.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a 70-page document</a> that includes worksheets for adolescents and guidance for their teachers. The document emphasizes that the lessons are not designed to encourage students to “start dating or having sexual behaviors early in life.” It also advises people in a “love relationship” to fill out a form setting the limits of their intimacy.</p><p>“It is normal for people to have sexual fantasies and desires, but we must recognize that we are the masters of our desires and should think twice before acting, and control our desires instead of being controlled by them,” the document says.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hong Kong Education Bureau</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The curriculum, which replaces an older one, explains that while some adolescents masturbate, sexual impulses can generally be controlled by avoiding “publications or media” that stimulate them.</p></div><div><div><p>It also recommends exercise and other activities that “draw attention away from undesirable activities,” and warns students to dress appropriately and avoid wearing “sexy clothing” that could lead to “visual stimulation.”</p><p>Critics are wary, saying that the guidelines are irresponsible. Diana Kwok, professor of gender studies at the Education University of Hong Kong, told the South China Morning Post that the authorities should not emphasize the need to control sexual development, but instead teach young people how to face or understand it.</p><p>“I think it’s like having your head in the clouds to suggest that middle school students avoid sexy outfits or play badminton when they’re sexually aroused,” Doreen Kong, a Hong Kong lawmaker, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yukfoonkong/posts/pfbid0fwmg4UsJb2HMzofTB8UQ53XBRLdvsykws6Qg4eyKfB1ELSctafpxLmGVZKzQYFpGl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on Facebook</a>.</p><p>Officials aren’t flinching. Christine Choi, the education secretary, framed the guidance on Sunday as a kind of moral imperative and a way of protecting young people, particularly those who are 12 to 14.</p><p>“We should teach them to take responsibility for themselves correctly, to understand how to take care of themselves and respect others,” she <a href="https://news.tvb.com/tc/local/66caa5583e8dd4000d139e64/%E6%B8%AF%E6%BE%B3-%E8%AC%9B%E6%B8%85%E8%AC%9B%E6%A5%9A%E5%85%AC%E7%B6%93%E7%A4%BE%E7%A7%91%E6%8E%A8%E8%A6%AA%E5%AF%86%E9%97%9C%E4%BF%82%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC%E8%A7%80%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90-%E8%94%A1%E8%8B%A5%E8%93%AE%E9%9D%9E%E4%BF%9D%E5%AE%88%E5%86%80%E4%BF%9D%E8%AD%B7%E9%9D%92%E5%B0%91%E5%B9%B4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a television interview</a>. “When they grow up, they will face a more complex society and environment.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>John Lee, Hong Kong’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/08/world/asia/hong-kong-john-lee.html" title="">leader</a>, described the materials as good for the territory’s long-term future on Sunday. “I think that social culture has to be created collectively,” he said.</p><p>It was not immediately clear on Monday how the Education Bureau developed the sex ed materials. The bureau did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did two local nonprofits whose work the bureau cited in its footnotes, or a local association of sexuality educators, researchers and therapists.</p><p>Young people in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan often use slang to talk about sex, just like their peers around the world. If your date asks if you want to go back to their place to “watch my cat do back-flips,” don’t say you weren’t warned.</p><p>Now, thanks to Hong Kong’s Education Bureau, new slang is in play. The sentence “I want to play badminton with you” will never be the same again.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Olivia Wang is a Hong Kong-based reporter and researcher who covers mainland China and Hong Kong.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/olivia-wang">More about Olivia Wang</a></span></p></div><div><p>Mike Ives is a reporter for The Times based in Seoul, covering breaking news around the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mike-ives">More about Mike Ives</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
