                  <p>&#34;I was expecting to be in the top 10 in like three months or something,&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/23685/zweih" data-tooltip-id="uid544619663">Ivan <span>&#34;⁠zweih⁠&#34;</span> Gogin</a> told HLTV after the series. &#34;I hoped that we were going to make at least one playoff of a big tournament in the first season.</p>
                  <p>&#34;But we already did two of them and now we are in the grand final. It feels crazy, not gonna lie, because I came to a top 16 team, and now we are in the top 3 for two months. It&#39;s insane.&#34;</p>
                  <p>A best-of-five against the winner of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/9565/vitality" data-tooltip-id="uid636342494">Vitality</a> vs. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6248/the-mongolz" data-tooltip-id="uid645732329">The MongolZ</a> stands in the way of a second big trophy for the young squad, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13776/jame" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1687025930">Jame</a> stating that he&#39;d like to play <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/9565/vitality" data-tooltip-id="uid636342494">Vitality</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/23685/zweih" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid544619663">zweih</a> admitting that it will be the team&#39;s most difficult test yet.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I&#39;m not really thinking much about our opponent,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;m not feeling scared of them. I just think it will be the hardest game we played in the last two months.&#34;</p>

                  <p><strong>Has it ever happened to you that you were this favored by the crowd?</strong></p>
                  <p>(chuckles) Probably not. I was never really in this position when I was in Spirit. I wasn&#39;t thinking about the crowd at all. Yesterday, I was hearing a lot of boos, and now they were cheering for us because MOUZ eliminated NAVI. That was feeling kinda cool, but it didn&#39;t really change something critical, I would say.</p>
                  <p><strong>I wanted to ask you about round 6 on Dust2, when Jame called for you to push Middle and you ended up waiting behind the door for the B guys to come out, and Jame ended up planting in the last second. Can you explain what the plan of that round was and whether it was the plan for him to end on B?</strong></p>
                  <p>It wasn&#39;t Jame&#39;s plan. It was my call. I called it myself when I understood that they were waiting for me in doors and window. I understood that if I wait a bit, I would have some free kills, and that&#39;s what happened. Spinx thought we were going for an A split or Short pop, and he went through Window to Mid, and I killed him, and Jimpphat was low HP on B.</p>
                  <p>I didn&#39;t call for Jame to rotate, it was nota&#39;s call, but that I stayed, that was my call.</p>

                  <p><strong>You got slammed on the T side of Inferno in the previous matchup, and it was looking like it was heading that way again. What was the change towards the end that finally helped you win the game?</strong></p>
                  <p>We didn&#39;t really change a lot of our gameplay, but nota was feeling Banana a lot better than in the previous game, and it helped us a lot. We didn&#39;t receive as much damage from HE grenades as we did in the previous game, and I think that was the main reason why we won.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>We need to prepare really well for all five maps because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna be three or four, I hope it&#39;s gonna be five and we&#39;re gonna win 3-2</p>

                  <p><strong>Jame was talking about wanting to play Vitality. You haven&#39;t played them yet with PARIVISION, but you&#39;ve played them before on Spirit. What do you think about how that game would go?</strong></p>
                  <p>I&#39;m not really thinking much about our opponent. I&#39;m not feeling scared of them. I just think it will be the hardest game we played in the last two months. We just need to prepare better for this game than the previous ones because it&#39;s a best-of-five. We need to prepare really well for all five maps because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna be three or four, I hope it&#39;s gonna be five and we&#39;re gonna win 3-2.</p>
                  <p><strong>You joined this team two months ago, at a time when they impressed at the Major, but they were not considered to be one of the elite teams. Now you&#39;ve won one tournament and made another final. Did you expect this kind of a quick rise after joining this team?</strong></p>
                  <p>I said it in a previous interview that I was expecting to be in the top 10 in like three months or something. I hoped that we were going to make at least one playoff of a big tournament in the first season. But we already did two of them and now we are in the grand final. It feels crazy, not gonna lie, because I came to a top 16 team, and now we are in the top 3 for two months. It&#39;s insane.</p>
