The arches are made from glazed terra-cotta on the lower floors, before switching to painted aluminum with bronze extrusions on higher floors. The building resonates with nearby buildings like Grand Central Terminal, the Fred F. French building and the Century Association next door, said James von Klemperer, the president and design principal at KPF.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rendering of the building, which is adorned with arches and setbacks, both nods to classic New York City architecture.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Binyan Studios</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rendering of one of the rooms in the amenity suite, which is on the 88th floor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Binyan Studios</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The building has office space on the ninth through 34th floors and residences from the 42nd to 80th floors. Two floors above and below the lobby and retail space, there will be a members club called Moss, featuring a dining program in collaboration with the Union Square Hospitality Group, helmed by Danny Meyer, along with other amenities like a spa and athletic club. And on the 88th floor — named because it’s 880 feet high — residents will have access to an amenity suite, complete with a solarium, a game room with a vintage billiards table and a private dining room.</p><p>“We took the top floor of the building, which is the most valuable residential floor, and turned it into a common amenity,” said Ian Klein, senior vice president and the head of development at Rabina. “Whether you’re buying on the 40th floor or the 70th floor, you can still go up and enjoy that view.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The building is slated to be complete in 2026. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Sales for the residences, which are one- to four-bedrooms, were launched earlier this year by Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group and started at $1.7 million for a one-bedroom. As of last week, 70 percent of units were sold, according to a publicist for the building.</p><p>The design of the residences are about “really great quality, like a blank canvas,” said Ms. Charles, the co-founder of Charles and Co. “If you think about furniture like the clothes on the body, you’re creating a healthy body to be dressed.”</p><p>The offices, however, are meant to feel like an extension of the home, with private, gender-neutral restrooms, outdoor space on nearly all the floors, separate HVAC systems on each floor and even windows that open — in case you need some fresh Midtown air. When designing the offices, Ms. Charles had to rethink her approach, especially because she started the initial process before the pandemic and the rise of remote work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An estimated 2,500 construction workers will have worked on the job site by the time the project is complete. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>By the time the project is complete, an estimated 2,500 construction workers will have worked on the job site, said Chris Koehnken, a project executive at Suffolk, with a typical day having 300 to 325 people on site. But now that the building is topped out, which means that the highest concrete floor is finished, the crane can come off and the elevators can start, Mr. Koehnken said.</p><p>“It’s also a sign of things to come, like we’re there,” he said. “We’re in a new phase of the project and a lot more activity on site, but we’re that much closer to the end of the tunnel.”</p><p><em>These interviews have been edited for clarity.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>James von Klemperer stands on the outdoor space of a future office floor. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-37494382">James von Klemperer, KPF, president and design principal</h2><p>I think all tall buildings, especially, have a kind of responsibility that goes beyond the program and the site. Because once you emerge into the skyline in a significant way, which this building will, the skyline is almost viewed, I think, by us New Yorkers as public property. If you put up a terrible profile on the skyline, everybody has to look at it from uptown, downtown, Long Island, New Jersey. And it’s very subjective, but we feel we should be doing something to grace the skyline, not to give it some defect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ian Klein stands outside in the unfinished building, with the Empire State Building behind him. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-442206c3">Ian Klein, Rabina, senior vice president and head of development</h2><p>A first-order principle for us was: Don’t do a glass and metal curtain wall building, which is what everyone expects you to do in Midtown. I think that was somewhat prompted by the residential because we wanted to give it somewhat of a more comfortable feel. But I think it was also just a reaction against what people identify as a somewhat commodified form of real estate development — to try and do something that felt distinctive and unique and also kind of human.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vicky Charles stands near one of the building’s arched windows.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-2f31208f">Vicky Charles, Charles &amp; Co., interior designer</h2><p>When things don’t feel comfortable, it’s a subconscious thing. Sometimes that might just be the lighting is too bright or too harsh or the colors are too cold. You can’t really describe why you don’t like it, but it just doesn’t feel quite right. We just wanted to make sure that same language comes through in all the spaces, that it’s softer, it’s warmer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chris Koehnken stands on the construction bridge on the 75th floor. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-2e531fba">Chris Koehnken, Suffolk, project executive</h2><p>The nice thing with these projects is you look at them, and I can stand there and identify: ‘I remember how that was a challenge or this was a challenge, and what we had to change here; or what this originally was and now how it looks.’ Those are the things I get out of when I look at a building. It’s a sense of accomplishment that there might have been some issues getting there, but we ultimately solved the riddle.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matt Yan is a real estate reporter for The Times and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matt-yan">More about Matt Yan</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The State of Real Estate</h2><h3>Whether you’re renting, buying or selling, here’s a look at real estate trends.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Rent or Buy?:</strong> Investing time and money in a home is especially complicated these days. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/16/realestate/rent-or-buy-home-quiz.html">We spoke with three families about how they made their choice</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Hunt:</strong> Unable to afford an apartment of his own in London, a longtime renter and his friend decided to pool their resources for a two-bedroom flat. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/10/realestate/london-apartment-home-sale.html">Here’s what they found for under £1 million</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A New Wedding Trend: </strong>More couples are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/realestate/wedding-registry-home-buying.html">adding a house fund to their wedding registries</a> to raise cash to buy a home, eschewing traditional gifts like small appliances and linens.</p></li><li><p><strong>Living Small</strong><strong>: </strong>When sharing a weekend house in upstate New York with friends didn’t work out quite as planned, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/realestate/weekend-home-sullivan-county-ny.html">a couple built a separate 710-square-foot house next door</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask Real Estate:</strong> Do you have questions about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/realestate/rent-stabilized-apartment-rules.html">rent-stabilized apartments</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/realestate/when-can-you-alter-a-landmark-building-and-when-cant-you.html">landmark buildings</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/realestate/why-are-your-property-taxes-higher-than-your-neighbors.html">property taxes</a> or other New York real estate issues? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/ask-real-estate">We’ve got answers</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
