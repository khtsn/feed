    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The luxury jet touched down in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, on a mission to collect hundreds of pounds of illicit gold.</p><p>On board was a representative of a ruthless paramilitary group accused of ethnic cleansing in Sudan’s sprawling civil war, the flight manifest showed. The gold itself had been smuggled from Darfur, a region of famine and fear in Sudan that is largely under his group’s brutal control.</p><p>Porters grunted as they heaved cases filled with gold, about $25 million worth, onto the plane, said three people involved with or briefed on the deal. Airport officials discreetly maintained a perimeter around the jet, which stood out in the main airport of one of the world’s poorest countries.</p><p>After 90 minutes, the jet took off again, landing before dawn on March 6 at a private airport in the United Arab Emirates, flight data showed. Its gleaming cargo soon vanished into the global gold market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As Sudan burns and its people starve, a gold rush is underway.</p><p>War has shattered Sudan’s economy, collapsed its health system and turned much of the once-proud capital into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/africa/sudan-khartoum-darfur-war.html" title="">piles of rubble</a>. Fighting has also set off one of the world’s worst famines in decades, with 26 million people facing acute hunger or starvation.</p><p>But the gold trade is humming. The production and trade of gold, which lies in rich deposits across the vast nation, has actually surpassed prewar levels — and that’s just the official figure in a country rife with smuggling.</p><p>Indeed, billions of dollars in gold are flowing out of Sudan in virtually every direction, helping to turn the Sahel region of Africa into one of the world’s largest gold producers at a time when prices are hitting record highs.</p><p>But instead of using the windfall to help the legions of hungry and homeless people, Sudan’s warring sides are wielding the gold to bankroll their fight, deploying what U.N. experts call “<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/10/sudan-faces-one-worst-famines-decades-warn-un-experts#:~:text=GENEVA%20(17%20October%202024)%20%E2%80%93,25%20million%20civilians%20in%20the" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">starvation tactics</a>” against tens of millions of people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Gold helps pay for the drones, guns and missiles that have killed tens of thousands of civilians and forced 11 million from their homes.

Instead, it is turning out to be their downfall. It even helps explain why the war started — and why it is so hard to stop.</p><p>“Gold is destroying Sudan,” said Suliman Baldo, a Sudanese expert on the nation’s resources, “and it’s destroying the Sudanese.”</p><p>The civil war pits the nation’s military and what remains of the government against their former ally, a paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces.</p><p>The group’s commander, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, is a camel trader turned warlord whose forces grew especially powerful after they seized one of Sudan’s most lucrative gold mines in 2017.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It’s nothing, just an area in Darfur that belongs to us,” he told The New York Times in a 2019 interview, trying to downplay its significance.</p><p>The mine became the cornerstone of a billion-dollar empire that transformed his armed group, the R.S.F., into a formidable force. General Hamdan later sold the mine to the government for $200 million, helping him buy even more weapons and political influence.</p><p>But that wealth and ambition <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/world/africa/sudan-generals-coup-civilian-rule.html" title="">led to a standoff</a> with the Sudanese military, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/sudan-khartoum-military.html" title="">paving the way for the civil war</a> that has all but destroyed the country.</p><p>The fight for gold only intensified when the war broke out in 2023. In one of his opening salvos, General Hamdan seized back the mine he had sold to the government. Weeks later, his fighters marched on the national gold refinery in the capital as well, making away with $150 million in gold bars, the government says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00gold-add-bhlt/00gold-add-bhlt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00gold-add-bhlt/00gold-add-bhlt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00gold-add-bhlt/00gold-add-bhlt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man in khaki military dress sits in a wide leather armchair." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00gold-add-bhlt/00gold-add-bhlt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00gold-add-bhlt/00gold-add-bhlt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00gold-add-bhlt/00gold-add-bhlt-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00gold-add-bhlt/00gold-add-bhlt-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/a7b8284a-0d26-5c69-889d-8630b3458bcd" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lt.

It has bombed R.S.F. mines, while ramping up gold production in areas still under government control, often by inviting foreign powers to do the mining. Sudanese officials have been negotiating gun and gold deals with Russia and are seeking to woo Chinese mining executives. They even share a gold mine with Gulf leaders accused of arming their enemies.</p><p>The war’s foreign sponsors play both sides as well.</p><p>President Vladimir V. Putin has long heralded Russian gold mining in Sudan, and his country’s Wagner Group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/05/world/africa/wagner-russia-sudan-gold-putin.html" title="">worked with the military and its rivals</a> even before they went to war.</p><p>Now that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/world/africa/russia-wagner-africa-corps.html" title="">Wagner’s boss is dead</a>, killed in a plane crash <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/23/world/europe/prigozhin-wagner-plane-crash-russia.html" title="">after his brief mutiny</a> against Russia’s military leaders, the Kremlin has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/world/africa/russia-wagner-africa-corps.html" title="">taken over the group’s business</a> and appears to be pursuing gold on either side of the front line, partnering with the R.S.F. in the west and the nation’s army in the east.</p><p>The United Arab Emirates is also lighting both ends of the fuse. On the battlefield, it backs the R.S.F., sending it powerful drones and missiles in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/world/africa/uae-sudan-civil-war.html" title="">covert operation under the guise</a> of a humanitarian mission.</p><p>Yet when it comes to gold, the Emiratis are also helping to fund the opposing side. An Emirati company, linked by officials to the royal family, owns the largest industrial mine in Sudan. It sits in government-controlled territory and delivers a chunk of money to the army’s cash-strapped war machine — yet another example of the dizzying array of alliances and counter-alliances fueling the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An official Emirati photograph shows aid arriving for Sudanese refugees.
