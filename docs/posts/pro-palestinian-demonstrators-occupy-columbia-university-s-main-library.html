After chanting pro-Palestinian slogans for about an hour, some of the protesters <a href="https://x.com/shoshanaaufzien/status/1920203837555487153?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tried</a> to leave but were prevented by a row of Columbia public safety officers.</p><p>A university spokeswoman said that the disruption was limited to a single reading room. Demonstrators were being asked for identification before they would be permitted to disperse, a statement from Columbia said. The statement added that the protesters would face consequences.</p><p>“It is completely unacceptable that some individuals are choosing to disrupt academic activities as our students are studying and preparing for final exams,” the statement said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Public security officers evacuated students not involved in the disruption from the library, which was filled with people studying. A Police Department spokesman said that about 60 people were involved in the protest as of 4 p.m. Hundreds of onlookers gathered outside the library.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The scene at the library grew more chaotic as the day progressed, and at least one protester was taken out of the building on a stretcher.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Just before 5:20 p.m., a group of seven students was released through the back exit of the library on 114th Street. They were free to go, presumably after having their identification checked. A few minutes later, a protester was brought out in handcuffs by the university’s public safety department, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html" title="">now employs several dozen peace officers</a> who are empowered to make arrests.</p><p>The scene became increasingly chaotic. A building fire alarm began sounding at 5:35 p.m. before going quiet a few minutes later. Some protesters still in the library shouted through megaphones to the crowd outside. There appeared to be at least one injury, with a protester taken out on a stretcher through the back entrance of the library. The person was covered with a white sheet to conceal their identity and had an ice pack held up to their arm.</p><p>The pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia has splintered over the past year. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/columbia-protests-justice-department.html" title="">Columbia University Apartheid Divest</a>, the group that once attracted a wide array of antiwar protesters, has become smaller but more extreme in its rhetoric. Its leaders, who do not publicize their identities, publish manifestoes supporting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/nyregion/columbia-pro-palestinian-group-hamas.html" title="">armed resistance</a> by members of groups that United States considers terrorist organizations.</p><p>The person for whom demonstrators renamed the library on Wednesday is a Palestinian revolutionary icon who was accused by Israel of planning a large-scale attack and was killed by Israeli forces in 2017. Part of the statement that demonstrators published on Wednesday called on students “to propagate the successes of the heroic Palestinian armed resistance in weakening Israel and U.S. imperialism and inspiring anti-imperialist struggles around the world.”</p><p>Anvee Bhutani<!-- --> and <!-- -->Sharla Steinman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon Otterman is a Times reporter covering higher education, public health and other issues facing New York City.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Beekeeper Charged With a Genocidal Secret:</strong> Faustin Nsabumukunzi lived quietly in New York.
