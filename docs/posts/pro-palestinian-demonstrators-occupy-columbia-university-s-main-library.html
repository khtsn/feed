The university has been under enormous pressure to stem disruptive pro-Palestinian protests, particularly those that call for an end to the state of Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was not clear whether the protest would be a brief demonstration or a lengthy occupation of the library. The protests at Columbia last spring came to a head when students and others entered Hamilton Hall, a campus building, in late April, leading the school’s president at the time to call in the police about 24 hours into the occupation.</p><p>On Wednesday, the demonstrators pushed past a library security guard shortly after 3 p.m., carrying tote bags and backpacks, before heading up the stairs to the main reading room, <a href="https://x.com/edenyadegar/status/1920196848523833405?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> posted on social media showed.
