Yet for many Americans, Wednesday may have been the first time they had heard Mr. Kennedy’s distinctive raspy voice; he has spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological condition that causes certain muscles in the voice box, or larynx, to spasm. </p><p>Mr. Kennedy will face additional questions on Thursday from the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. But the Finance Committee hearing is more important, because the Finance Committee is the panel that will vote on whether to send Mr. Kennedy’s nomination to the Senate floor for a vote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here are five takeaways from Wednesday’s session.</p><h2 id="link-6d3c56b0">Mr. Kennedy appears to have won over most Republicans.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and a doctor, has not said how he will vote.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Perhaps all but one. Republicans seemed by and large to support Mr. Kennedy. At least two whose votes were in doubt — Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Senator Todd Young of Indiana — asked questions that suggested they would support Mr. Kennedy.</p><p>“I think you’re handling yourself well,” Mr. Tillis told Mr. Kennedy, before asking him an easy one: “Are you a conspiracy theorist?” Mr. Kennedy replied that it was a pejorative that had been applied to him, “mainly to keep me from asking difficult questions of powerful interests.” Mr. Young asked Mr. Kennedy whether he would work to restore public trust in public health institutions; Mr. Kennedy said he would, through “radical transparency.”</p><p>But there is still at least one very important Republican to watch: Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the Senate Health Committee. Mr. Cassidy, a doctor, has not said how he will vote. He has been generally supportive of public health initiatives. After he met Mr. Kennedy, he said they had a “frank discussion” — Washington code for a disagreement. Mr. Cassidy said on Wednesday that he wanted to withhold judgment on Mr. Kennedy until after the Health Committee hearing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h2 id="link-528f560">He displayed a lack of expertise about key programs he would oversee.</h2></p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>1:27</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><p>transcript</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“President Trump has sworn to protect Medicare. Republicans are exploring reforms to Medicaid that could help pay for Trump administration priorities. With this context, what will you do about dual eligibles?” “About —” “Dual eligibles.” “Well, dual eligibles are not right now served very well under the system. Those are people who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. And I suppose my answer to that is to make sure that the programs are consolidated, that they’re integrated and the care is integrated.” “How do you propose that we integrate those programs? Does Medicare pay more, Medicare pay less? Medicaid pay more, Medicaid pay less? How do we do that?” “Well, I’m not exactly sure because I’m not in there. I mean, it is difficult to integrate them because Medicaid is — Medicare is under a fee for service. It’s paid for by employer taxes. Medicaid is fully paid for by the federal government. And it’s not fee for service. So I do not know the answer to that. I look forward to exploring options with you.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/us/politics/Kennedy-medicare-medicaid-embed-cover/Kennedy-medicare-medicaid-embed-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Kennedy seemed confused about two of the large programs that would be under his purview as health secretary: Medicare, the government insurance program for older Americans, and Medicaid, the federal-state partnership that covers low-income people. Under questioning by Mr. Cassidy, he said he would like to integrate the two programs. Mr. Cassidy asked him how he would do it.</p><p>“I do not know the answer to that,” Mr. Kennedy conceded. “I look forward to, uh, exploring options with you.” At another point, he said of Medicaid: “The premiums are too high, the deductibles are too high, and everybody’s getting sicker.” But except in very rare cases, Medicaid enrollees do not pay either of those types of fees.</p><p>Calley Means, a health care entrepreneur who has been an adviser to Mr. Kennedy and was instrumental in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/us/politics/donald-trump-robert-kennedy-jr-partnership.html" title="">connecting him to Mr. Trump</a>, dismissed Mr. Kennedy’s stumbles, saying that senators were focusing on minutiae that Mr. Kennedy could easily learn, while Mr. Kennedy was focused on the big picture — improving health for all Americans.</p><p>“They’re speaking different languages,” Mr. Means said after the hearing of the senators and Mr. Kennedy.</p><h2 id="link-249baede">Mr. Kennedy cannot escape his shifting statements, especially on vaccines.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>0:20</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><p>transcript</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“News reports have claimed that I am anti-vaccine or anti- industry, I am neither.

Even some of Mr. Kennedy’s allies concede that the focus on vaccines, in the news media and among lawmakers, could derail his confirmation. Mr. Kennedy tried on Wednesday to change the subject. It was telling that Del Bigtree, his former communications director and also a fierce critic of vaccines, was seated in the back of the room with the general audience, while healthy-eating advocates were up front with Mr. Kennedy’s family.</p><p>Democrats came prepared with a number of Mr. Kennedy’s past statements and pushed him hard, including on abortion. Mr. Kennedy’s positions on that issue have been all over the map. He ducked questions about whether he would support attempts to sharply restrict the abortion pill mifepristone, a policy goal of abortion opponents. But overall, he said, he would support Mr. Trump’s anti-abortion agenda.</p><p>That drew a sharp rebuke from Senator Maggie Hassan, Democrat of New Hampshire, who noted that when Mr. Kennedy came to her state as a presidential candidate in 2023, he described himself as “pro-choice” and said the government did not have “any business telling people what they can or cannot do with their body.” She wanted to know what had changed.</p><p>“When was it that you decided to sell out the values you’ve had your whole life in order to be given power by President Trump?” Ms. Hassan asked sharply. Mr. Kennedy sidestepped the question, saying, “I agree with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-12"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>0:35</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><p>transcript</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>I agree with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy.

In 2018, two infants in Samoa died after being vaccinated against measles, prompting the government to temporarily suspend its measles vaccination program.

And for all of his talk about follow the science and his promise that he won’t interfere with those of us who want to vaccinate his kids, the bottom line is the same: Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars while he does it.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/29vid-RFK-Hearing-Embeds-72984-cover/29vid-RFK-Hearing-Embeds-72984-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/rfk-hpv-vaccine-merck.html" title="">ethics and financial disclosure statements,</a> released last week, Mr. Kennedy said he would continue to collect fees for cases in which he referred clients to <a href="https://www.wisnerbaum.com/toxic-tort-law/robert-f-kennedy-jr-/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wisner Baum</a>, a law firm that is suing Merck over its Gardasil vaccine.
