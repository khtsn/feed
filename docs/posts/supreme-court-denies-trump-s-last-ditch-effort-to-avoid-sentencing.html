Trump’s emergency bid to halt his criminal sentencing in New York, all but ensuring it would proceed as planned on Friday.</p><p>In a brief unsigned order, a five-justice majority noted that Mr. Trump was not facing jail time and that he could still challenge his conviction “in the ordinary course on appeal.”</p><p>Although Mr. Trump had argued that being sentenced 10 days before his inauguration would distract from the presidential transition, the majority held, “The burden that sentencing will impose on the president-elect’s responsibilities is relatively insubstantial.”</p><p>Four of the court’s conservative justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh — noted dissents without providing reasons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The court’s decision means Mr. Trump will face sentencing for 34 felony counts of falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal that had endangered his 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>After a series of unsuccessful legal maneuvers in New York State courts, the former and future president had hoped to prevail before a friendlier audience: a Supreme Court with a 6-to-3 conservative majority that includes three justices Mr. Trump appointed during his first term.</p><p>But the court opted to stay out of the case for now, despite having come to Mr. Trump’s rescue in a string of other recent matters. In July, the justices granted former presidents broad immunity for their official acts, undermining a separate criminal case against Mr. Trump in Washington.</p><p>The court’s show of independence in the New York case — less than two weeks before the inauguration — capped the former and future president’s frenzied campaign to stave off the embarrassing spectacle of a sentencing. After months of delay, the sentencing will now formalize Mr. Trump’s conviction, cementing his status as the first felon to occupy the Oval Office.</p><p>Almost any other defendant would have been sentenced by now. But<strong> </strong>ever since a jury convicted Mr. Trump in May on all 34 counts he faced, Mr. Trump’s lawyers have lodged a flurry of filings seeking to unwind the conviction, or at least block the sentencing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>They intensified the effort even after the judge overseeing the case recently signaled that he would spare Mr. Trump jail time, or any other substantive punishment, making any sentencing largely symbolic.</p><p>The sentencing is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. Friday in the same Lower Manhattan courtroom where Mr. Trump’s trial took place last spring. The president-elect has indicated he plans to appear virtually.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Protess is an investigative reporter at The Times, writing about public corruption.
