Besides news articles, the agreement also encompasses material from NYT Cooking, The Times’s food and recipe site, and The Athletic, which focuses on sports.</p><p>This is the first instance of The Times agreeing to a licensing arrangement with a focus on generative A.I. technology.</p><p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">The Times sued OpenAI</a> and its partner, Microsoft, for copyright infringement, accusing the tech companies of using millions of articles published by The Times to train automated chatbots without any kind of compensation. OpenAI and Microsoft have rejected those accusations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Financial terms of the licensing deal with Amazon were not disclosed.</p><p>“The deal is consistent with our long-held principle that high-quality journalism is worth paying for,” Meredith Kopit Levien, the chief executive of The Times, said in a note to staff. “It aligns with our deliberate approach to ensuring that our work is valued appropriately, whether through commercial deals or through the enforcement of our intellectual property rights.”</p><p>Amazon’s use of editorial content from The Times could extend to the Alexa software found on its smart speakers. In some instances, excerpts from Times reporting will include attribution and a link back to The Times’s website. Material from The Times will also be used to train Amazon’s proprietary A.I. models, the company said.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment beyond what was in the statement issued by The Times.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/business/media/media-openai-chatgpt.html" title="">News organizations have wavered</a> on how to contend with the rapid emergence of A.I. technology, elements of which have been developed by software programs that ingest the content of millions of online news stories.</p><p>Even as The Times pursued litigation against OpenAI, other news outlets — including Axel Springer, Condé Nast and News Corp, among others — entered into licensing agreements to receive revenue in exchange for the use of their materials. The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/washington-post-inks-deal-chatgpt-openai-1236197747/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agreed to a deal</a> with OpenAI last month.</p><p>Amazon itself has been playing a bit of catch-up in the A.I. race.</p><p>When OpenAI <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/technology/ai-chat-bot-chatgpt.html" title="">released ChatGPT in late 2022</a>, kicking off the A.I. boom, Amazon was caught flat-footed, much like Google, Meta and Apple.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Chatbots like ChatGPT are driven by what scientists call <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/technology/google-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">neural networks</a>, mathematical systems that can learn skills by analyzing huge amounts of digital data. By pinpointing patterns in vast troves of Wikipedia articles, news stories and chat logs, for instance, these systems can learn to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/science/artificial-intelligence-ai-gpt3.html" title="">generate humanlike text</a> on their own, including poems, term papers and computer programs.</p><p>Like Google, Microsoft, and Meta, Amazon had the computing power needed for the task. As the world’s largest cloud computing company, it ran a vast network of data centers filled with the specialized computer chips used to train A.I. systems. But it lacked some of the talent needed to build the most sophisticated systems, and the company had not prioritized the technology to the degree of OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft.</p><p>Last June, Amazon inked a deal with a key A.I. start-up called Adept, bringing on many of its employees, including its founder, David Luan. Amazon paid Adept at least $330 million to license its technology, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/technology/ai-start-ups-google-microsoft-amazon.html" title="">three people with knowledge of the transaction said</a>.</p><p>Amazon later inked a similar deal with another important start-up called Covariant, bringing on its top talent including its co-founder Pieter Abbeel, a professor of robotics at the University of California at Berkeley, who previously worked for OpenAI.</p><p>Mr. Luan and Dr. Abbeel are now leading an Amazon research lab that aims to build “artificial general intelligence,” or A.G.I., shorthand for a machine that can do anything the human brain can do. This ambitious goal is also the stated aim of OpenAI and other leading research labs, such as Google DeepMind. Data licensed from The Times could help fuel the efforts of Amazon’s A.G.I. lab. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In addition to its own A.I. work, Amazon has established a close partnership with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s chief rivals. Over the past two years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/technology/amazon-anthropic-ai.html" title="">the tech giant has invested $4 billion in the start-up</a>.</p><p>Amazon’s investment in Anthropic is not just a simple equity stake. Much like Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI, it gives Amazon access to Anthropic’s A.I. systems — and commits Amazon computer power to the start-up. Amazon also receives an early shot at making Anthropic’s A.I. models available to customers of its cloud computing service.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
