As Ms. Diallo fled the village, one of many engulfed by violence in Burkina Faso, she recognized her husband’s masked killers: They were neighbors.</p><p>Burkina Faso, a nation that once prided itself on tolerance and peaceful interethnic relations, is now home to one of the deadliest conflicts in West Africa. Since the current military leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traoré, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/02/world/africa/burkina-faso-coup-france-russia.html" title="">seized power in a coup in 2022</a>, he has escalated a war against Islamist insurgents that has now killed tens of thousands of people and displaced nearly three million others.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>To beef up the ranks of his embattled military, Captain Traoré’s government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/world/africa/burkina-faso-extremists-coup.html" title="">recruited tens of thousands of men</a> into a civilian militia, known as the Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland. The militia was created by a previous leader to protect communities against the insurgents. But under Captain Traoré, it has spread unchecked violence and pitted local populations against each other, with minority ethic groups being brutally targeted in what some analysts fear will lead to a civil war.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Niornigue camp, where more than 6,000 Burkinabe asylum seekers are taking refuge in northern Ivory Coast.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Acts of violence against local populations involving militiamen have more than doubled since Captain Traoré’s coup, according to data compiled by the <a href="https://acleddata.com/data/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project</a>. The militiamen have carried out executions, forced disappearances or looting every six days on average, the data shows.</p><p>Arming civilians who have poor training and little respect for human rights and then giving them near total impunity is not unique to Burkina Faso.</p><p>In northeast Nigeria, members of a civilian militia assisting the country’s fight against Boko Haram have been accused of sexual violence, child recruitment and summary executions.

Ivory Coast has accommodated the largest number of them, about 65,000, in government-run asylum centers and host communities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced women drawing water from a well at the Niornigue camp.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Because most of the Qaeda-affiliated insurgents waging a war in Burkina Faso are from the Fulani ethnic group, Fulani civilians have often been accused of collaborating with the jihadists and are disproportionately targeted by the militia. <a href="https://www.megatrends-afrika.de/assets/afrika/publications/policybrief/MTA_PB22_2024_Quidelleur_Distributing_Weapons_and_War_on_Terror_in_Burkina_Faso.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Researchers</a> have described the militia’s violence — and the state’s complicity in it — as “a public policy.”</p><p>There is a direct connection between the scaling up of the Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland under Captain Traoré and the “targeting of Fulani populations and the massive influx of refugees in Ivory Coast,” said Jean-Baptiste Zongo, an independent security analyst from Burkina Faso living in Ivory Coast.</p><p>Refugees in Ivory Coast shared memories of abuses they faced “on the other side,” speaking in whispers that were muted by rain battering iron roofs. Housseinou and Hassan Ly, twin brothers and teachers of the Quran, said they had fled northern Burkina Faso in September 2023 after civilian militiamen abducted their uncle and killed their brother on the side of the road.</p><p>“Our country is in crisis, and the current authorities think that giving people weapons to kill an entire group is the solution,” said Ali Barry, 30, a Fulani nurse who said he fled his village in December 2022 after militiamen executed several neighbors and his brother.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A neighborhood where some Burkinabe refugees were staying in Ouangolodougou, Ivory Coast.

But the influx<span>  </span>in northern Ivory Coast, the country’s poorest area, is testing its celebrated spirit of “Akwaba,” or hospitality.</p><p>“Right or wrong, the asylum seekers, who are mostly Fulani, are stigmatized,” said Paulin Yéwé, a security and defense adviser in Ivory Coast who works for the president and oversees the accommodation of refugees in the north.</p><p>Even in the relative safety of Ivory Coast, refugees live in dire conditions. The World Food Program has halved a monthly stipend, to $7.50 from $15 per registered refugee in Ivory Coast, because of dwindling funds. Most refugee children do not go to school.</p><p>“We were initially afraid because there were so many of them,” said Fabaraka Ouattara, the chief of Linguékoro, a village in Ivory Coast that has accommodated about 300 refugees. “They said they were fleeing war, but we didn’t know whether they were coming with weapons.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Diallo preparing lunch at the home her father rented this year in Ivory Coast after fleeing Burkina Faso.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>On a recent morning, Ms. Diallo, whose husband was killed in the courtyard, prepared okra and cassava dough in a home in Ivory Coast rented by her father, who fled Burkina Faso earlier this year with 12 other family members.

Once they joined the V.D.P., she said, neighbors stopped greeting Fulani families. Then the raids and the killings started.</p><p>Ms. Diallo’s father, Sékou Diallo, said the militiamen were increasingly targeting other ethnic groups, too, like the Mossis and Lobis. “They would come at night. We’d wake up in the morning and a man would have disappeared — Fulani or not,” he said.</p><p>Ms. Diallo lowered her head as her father spoke. She did not bury her husband because she could not go back to her village without risking death.
