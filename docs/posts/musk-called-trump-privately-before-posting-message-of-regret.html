</span> earning them a spot in playoffs.</p>

<p>“Sorry you drew us,” were <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1265/johnqt">
		johnqt	</a>
</span>&#39;s words to BLG <a href="https://youtu.be/Wve6Rgsqhf4?si=45DhrejrDw9QZ2w6&amp;t=161" target="_blank">before the match</a>, confident that his team was going to be able to take down their second Chinese team of the tournament.</p>

<p>True to johnqt&#39;s words, Sentinels ended up taking the win, but it was by no means a walk in the park. Both teams took their map pick, with BLG winning Icebox 13-9, and Sentinels winning Sunset 13-5. This left Lotus as the decider, where Sentinels narrowly found a 13-9 victory.</p>

<p>The series first went to BLG&#39;s map pick of Icebox. Reminiscent of their match against Wolves, Sentinels started out on the back foot. The underdogs of BLG were in control the entire first half, with the combination of <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4885/whzy">
		whzy	</a>
</span>&#39;s fearless entries and the rookie <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/48878/rushia">
		rushia	</a>
</span>&#39;s consistent impact helping them ride up to an 8-4 half.</p>

<p><em>rushia singlehandedly wins BLG the bonus round.</em></p>

<p>Sentinels started to find their footing on their attack side, but with <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/40845/levius">
		Levius	</a>
</span> stealing away the pistol round, the 10-4 lead proved too much for Sentinels to overcome.</p>

<p>The next map was Sunset, a map that Sentinels had previously dominated in 2024. With it only just coming back into the map pool, this was Sentinels&#39; first time on the map this year. As it would turn out, they hadn&#39;t missed a beat as they thrashed BLG to the tune of a 13-5 win. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4004/zekken">
		zekken	</a>
</span> boasted a 1.70 rating on Neon after having a relatively quiet Icebox on Omen.</p>

<p><em>johnqt shows why Sunset is Sentinels&#39; home turf.</em></p>

<p>This left Lotus to decide the series. Sentinels rode their Sunset momentum to a pistol win, but Levius stole away round two by winning three duels with a Ghost. From there, whzy&#39;s Operator helped rack up the score for BLG to take a 7-5 lead at the half. </p>

<p><em>An absolutely mad push gets whzy a collat.</em></p>

<p>Sentinels were down, but not out yet. Similar to on Icebox, they began to shine on their attack side. zekken stepped up to the plate to deliver a masterclass on Raze, putting up a 2.05 rating in the second half, as Sentinels banged out eight rounds to close out the series.</p>

<p>Earning redemption for their disappointing exit at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok/swiss-stage" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>, Sentinels will move on to the playoffs. BLG will have to win their next game to qualify for playoffs, or else their tournament run will end in the Swiss stage.</p>
