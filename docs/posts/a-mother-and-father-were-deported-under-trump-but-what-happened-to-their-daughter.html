Officials said in a statement that the child was removed from her parents and from the manifest of her mother’s deportation plane for her own “safety and welfare.”</p><p>The Trump administration claims the girl’s parents are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, but it has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/americas/trump-migrants-deportations.html" title="">not offered evidence to back this up</a>.</p><p>The girl, known to many in her family as Antonella, is one of several children who have been swept up in President Trump’s immigration crackdown in recent days. At <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/us/politics/us-citizen-children-deported-honduras-trump.html" title="">least three children</a> who are U.S. citizens were sent to Honduras this month with their mothers, decisions protested by the families’ lawyers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In the case of the Venezuelan toddler, the girl’s mother, Yorely Bernal, 20, had entered the United States with her partner, Maiker Espinoza, and their child in May 2024, while President Joseph R.

But separations continued to take place in limited instances during the Biden administration when officials believed there was a threat to the child.</p><p>It is unclear why officials separated the family members last year. Record searches indicate that neither parent has a criminal record in Venezuela or Peru, where they lived for several years, or in the United States, beyond their immigration offenses. In the United States the couple has lived only in immigration detention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 2022, Mr. Espinoza, now 25, was arrested in Peru on an allegation of domestic violence, but the case was closed and he never faced trial, according to records.</p><p>U.S. officials sent Mr. Espinoza to El Salvador on March 30 on one of five planes carrying Venezuelan men to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/world/americas/bukele-abrego-garcia-elsalvador-prison.html" title="">a maximum-security prison</a>.
