Inflation has come down substantially and economic growth remains relatively robust, particularly for the United States. But the outlook for 2025 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/economy/trump-us-economy.html" title="">remains murky</a>, as President-elect Donald Trump’s policy changes could affect the economy in unpredictable ways.</p><p>These nine charts showcase major trends shaping business and the economy — and what to watch in the new year.</p><h2 id="link-748067b">Stock market highs (upon highs)</h2><p>At the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/business/dealbook/inflation-economy-stocks-year-in-charts.html" title="">end of 2023</a>, the S&amp;P 500 was surging toward a new high. In January, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/business/stock-market-record.html" title="">finally reached it</a>, driven in part by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/22/business/magnificent-seven-stocks-tech.html" title="">“Magnificent Seven” tech stocks</a>: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs 57 times this year, with some especially large surges after the election, though the rally has slowed in recent weeks (more on that later).</p><h2 id="link-2bfc0a25">A year of rate cuts</h2><p>A global cool-down in inflation, and with it, anticipation of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/business/economy/central-bank-interest-rates.html" title="">easing of monetary policy</a>, have also helped fuel the blockbuster stock market.</p><p>For the past couple of years, monetary tightening was the name of the game in nearly all major economies, as central bankers raised policy rates to tame surging inflation. This summer and fall, many advanced economies began to cut rates for the first time since the pandemic.</p><p>In September, the Fed followed suit with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/business/economy/fed-reserve-interest-rate-cut.html" title="">half-point rate reduction</a>, an unusually large move and a clear signal that they were turning their attention from combating inflation to protecting the job market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The Fed’s recent moves, however, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/business/dealbook/trump-fed-congress-markets.html" title="">made clear</a> that inflation risks are back. On Dec. 18, the Fed announced its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/fed-meeting-interest-rates.html" title="">third</a> rate cut of the year, a quarter-point reduction as expected. But Fed policymakers dialed down expectations for cuts next year, suggesting that it would make just two rate cuts by the end of 2025.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The announcement, along with the range of uncertainty in the Fed’s forecasts (one Fed official expects no cuts at all next year, while another expects five), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/stock-market-fed-rate-cut-forecast.html" title="">sent markets tumbling</a>.</p><h2 id="link-38c2833">Bonds tell a less optimistic story</h2><p>On the heels of the Fed news, the yield on a 10-year Treasury note jumped to its highest level since May.</p><p>Treasury yields also spiked in September and early November, even after the Fed first started cutting rates and stocks were soaring after Trump’s victory. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage, which tends to trend in the same direction, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/fed-mortgage-rates.html" title="">also went up</a>. This may seem paradoxical, given the Fed’s rate cuts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But investors in assets like 10-year Treasuries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/bond-market-trump.html" title="">are thinking about</a> what’s going to happen to growth and inflation over months or years. Higher yields could indicate that investors are anticipating higher inflation in the future for longer-term investments.</p><p>Some of the same factors that have fueled a Trump rally in stocks — enthusiasm for his policies of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/briefing/trump-tax-plans.html" title="">tax cuts</a>, deregulation, stimulative government spending and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/business/dealbook/trump-tariffs-inevitable.html" title="">tariffs</a> — could be cause for concern among bond investors. Such investors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/business/dealbook/trump-economy-bonds.html" title="">may worry</a> that Trump’s economic plans would increase the federal deficit, and with it, inflation.</p><h2 id="link-22c8e4f8">Trump’s tariff threats</h2><p>During the U.S. presidential campaign season, both candidates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/politics/trump-harris-tariffs.html" title="">expressed support for tariffs</a> as an essential tool for protecting American manufacturers from Chinese and other global competitors.</p><p>A few weeks after winning the election, Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/economy/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">announced</a> that he would impose tariffs on all products coming into the United States from Canada, Mexico and China on his first day in office. During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on some imports, particularly those coming from China, causing China’s share of imports to fall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-14"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="imports-dealbook" data-id="100000009891177" data-source-id="100000009891177"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">The U.S. imports the most from Mexico, China and Canada</h2></header></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Sweeping tariffs could start a trade war if countries retaliated with tariffs of their own. Studies <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26610/w26610.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have shown</a> that the cost of tariffs are often passed on to American consumers, leading to higher inflation.</p><h2 id="link-618f86ed">A divided economic outlook</h2><p>Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/business/economy/consumer-sentiment-trump.html" title="">see the potential effects of Trump’s policies differently</a>. Consumer sentiment among Republicans soared after Election Day, according to the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey. For Democrats, it plummeted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-16"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="consumersentiment-dealbook" data-id="100000009891176" data-source-id="100000009891176"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Consumer sentiment by party identification</h2></header></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“Throughout this month’s interviews, Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation,” Joanne W. Hsu, who runs the University of Michigan Survey, said in a statement.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation,” she said.</p><h2 id="link-7188fe4d">Bitcoin is back</h2><p>The crypto boom has highly correlated with Trump’s victory. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet”; the day after he won, Bitcoin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/technology/bitcoin-election-trump.html" title="">surged</a> to a record high.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-20"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="bitcoin-dealbook" data-id="100000009891175" data-source-id="100000009891175"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Price of Bitcoin skyrocketed over the last few months</h2></header></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Then, earlier this month, the price of a single Bitcoin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/technology/bitcoin-price-record.html" title="">rose to $100,000</a> for the first time, an astonishing turnaround after its price dropped below $17,000 in 2022 after the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange.</p><p>But, like the stock market, Bitcoin is volatile, perhaps making it more of a speculative asset than a currency. After hitting an all-time high above $108,000 this week, its price has since dropped below $100,000. “It’s not a competitor for the dollar,” Jay Powell, the Fed chair, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-oLfaksWj4o?si=XFp-oqZVY58lHJrj&amp;t=1735" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said this month</a> at the DealBook Summit. “It’s really a competitor for gold.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-7a6df0e3">Nvidia’s astronomical growth</h2><p>Nvidia, which this year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/technology/nvidia-most-valuable-company.html" title="">briefly overtook</a> Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable company, also stands to gain from the crypto boom.
