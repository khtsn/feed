But they cautioned that conclusion may yet change.</p><div><p>A few hours later, Israel’s forces launched a series of new airstrikes early Saturday on buildings in the same neighborhood, known as the Dahiya, after warning residents to flee, the military said. The strikes were intended to destroy weapons.</p><p>Killing Mr. Nasrallah would be a major escalation in Israel’s rapidly expanding campaign against Hezbollah over the last two weeks, which has threatened to spiral into an all-out regional war. Fears have grown that Hezbollah’s backer, Iran, might be drawn into the fight, further destabilizing the Middle East.</p><p>The Israeli airstrikes came shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel gave a defiant speech at the United Nations General Assembly, vowing to continue the fight against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon despite international calls for a cease-fire. He said defeating Hezbollah was essential to Israel’s survival and called the group “a terror army perched on our northern border.”</p><p>Lebanon’s health ministry said at least six people were killed and more than 90 injured by the Israeli strikes on Friday evening, but the toll was expected to rise. Emergency workers were still searching through the rubble even as Israel struck again.</p><p>“They are residential buildings,” the health minister, Dr. Firass Abiad, said. “They were filled with people.”</p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>White House watching:</strong> President Biden was briefed by his national security team and is receiving regular updates on the latest developments in the Middle East, according to a statement from the White House on Friday evening that said he had directed the Pentagon to assess and adjust U.S. force posture in the region “as necessary.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Fighting through night: </strong>On Friday night, Hezbollah said it had targeted the northern Israeli city of Safed with a rocket salvo, as well as Sa’ar, a kibbutz near Israel’s northern border.<strong> </strong> There were no immediate reports of deaths or serious injuries. </p></li><li><p><strong>Emergency departures:</strong> Najib Mikati, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, will cut short his meetings at the U.N. General Assembly in New York to travel back to Beirut after the Israeli attacks on the city’s suburbs, according to a statement from his office. Mr. Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, returned to Israel on Friday evening, the Jewish Sabbath, a highly unusual move that underscored the gravity of the situation after the latest strikes south of Beirut targeting Hezbollah leaders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran’s ire: </strong>Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called an emergency meeting of the Supreme National Security Council on Friday night in response to reports that Mr. Nasrallah was the target of the strike, two Iranian officials with knowledge of the meeting said. Ibrahim Azizi, the head of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council said that Israel “has opened the gates of hell against itself” with its strike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Lebanon in comments to Iranian state television. He said the “axis of resistance” — the regional militia backed by Iran — were better coordinated and armed than ever and “will respond with force at the right time.”</p></li><li><p><strong>War in Gaza:</strong> The Gazan Health Ministry said on Friday said that 39 people had been killed and 86 injured by the Israeli military in the previous 24 hours. The ministry, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths, said that the toll in Gaza since the war began last year had risen to more than 41,530 people killed, with more than 96,000 injured.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="52" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzEyNjM1N2I2LTAzNzMtNWNjMi04NWRjLTMyYWUzZTkzYzYwYQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/27/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas#at-least-four-large-apartment-buildings-were-destroyed-by-israeli-strikes-videos-show" data-source-id="100000009727249"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-27T23:54:06.064Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 27, 2024, 7:54 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/autossell/27-vid-Beirut-strike-aftermath/27-vid-Beirut-strike-aftermath-superJumbo.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>A Times analysis of verified videos, photos and satellite imagery from Friday night’s strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs shows that at least four residential buildings on one street were destroyed in the attacks targeting Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah.</p><p>Three of the buildings were completely flattened, while another collapsed, with the upper floors partially intact. <a href="https://t.me/QudsNen/125041" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Footage</a> recorded on top of the debris of one flattened building shows significant damage to at least four more surrounding buildings.

About 100 yards away, two neighboring buildings that were approximately the same size were also hit. The strikes destroyed nearby vehicles and left craters in the streets about 700 feet away.</p><p>A <a href="https://x.com/manniefabian/status/1839690743524335984" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> filmed during the strikes and posted on Telegram showed several distinct smoke plumes. An enormous cloud of smoke rose from the area where The Times identified four destroyed buildings, and one large plume of smoke rose from areas slightly to the east of the buildings. Multiple additional explosions are heard and seen in the video; the extent of the damage from the strikes is not yet clear.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="51" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-Capsule2"><hr/><h3 id="link-3521414d"><span><strong>Latest Images From Israel and Lebanon</strong></span></h3><div data-testid="cardDeck"><section aria-label="Gallery" data-testid="Gallery"><div><ol><li><figure><figcaption><p>Mourning the deaths of 15 family members after an Israeli airstrike hit a building in Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, on Friday.</p></figcaption></figure><span>Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><figcaption><p>An Israeli air defense system intercepting rockets fired from Lebanon.</p></figcaption></figure><span>Jalaa Marey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></li><li><figure><figcaption><p>The Israeli strikes Friday targeted Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah.</p></figcaption></figure><span>David Guttenfelder</span></li><li><figure><div><svg width="100%" height="100%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"></svg></div><figcaption><p>Video verified by The New York Times shows the aftermath of Friday&#39;s attacks in southern Beirut.</p></figcaption></figure><span></span></li><li><figure><div><svg width="100%" height="100%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"></svg></div><figcaption><p>The scene of an Israeli strike Friday in Beirut. </p></figcaption></figure><span>Reuters</span></li><li><figure><figcaption><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel speaking Friday at the U.N.

The official briefed a group of reporters from mostly U.S. news organizations, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military strategy and intelligence, following the strike and the speech of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the U.N. General Assembly.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/27/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas#israel-struck-after-learning-of-a-hezbollah-leadership-meeting-officials-say" title="">Five other Israeli officials</a> told The New York Times that Israeli intelligence agencies’ initial assessment is that Mr. Nasrallah has been killed. But they cautioned that assessment was preliminary and might yet change.</p><p>Mr. Nasrallah is a singular figure who over the course of his 32 years leading Hezbollah has been fixated on building up the group, with the help of Iran, to destroy Israel, the first official said. His death, the official added, could deal a decisive blow to the group’s political and military organization in Lebanon, and to any further plans for violence by Iran.</p><p>Israel assessed that the strikes this week in Lebanon, which killed hundreds of people, had destroyed about half of Hezbollah’s rocket and missile capacity, the official said. It was impossible to independently confirm the official’s assertion.</p><p>The militant group has amassed an enormous arsenal over many years with the help of Iran.</p><p>Fears have grown after the strikes on Friday that Iran and its militia proxies could be drawn into the fight and further destabilize the Middle East. The Israeli official urged the U.S. government to stand firmly alongside Israel in order to present a united front for deterrence.</p><p>On Friday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken warned that the choices countries made in the coming days would shape the region.</p><p>“The events of the past week, and the past few hours, underscore what a precarious moment this is for the Middle East and the world,” Mr. Blinken said at a news conference in New York after a week of diplomacy at the U.N. General Assembly. “Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism. The way it does so matters.”</p><p>A second senior Israeli official said in the same briefing with reporters that Israel had never told U.S. officials that it would agree anytime soon to a cease-fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. He said there had been a misunderstanding between officials from the two countries after initial discussions on Monday that led to the White House’s announcement of a 21-day <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/us-cease-fire-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">cease-fire proposal</a> supported by France and other European nations, along with Arab countries, on Wednesday night.</p><p>That Israeli official said they had expected those countries to present a cease-fire proposal as a starting point for rounds of discussions, and that important conditions had not been worked out, such as how Iran would be prevented from sending more rockets and missiles to Hezbollah during those 21 days to replace the destroyed arms.</p><p>American officials have told reporters since Wednesday that the Biden administration would not have put forward the proposal if they had not gotten signals in private talks with Israeli officials that Israel would agree quickly to the cease-fire proposal.</p><p>“The most important thing to do through diplomacy is to try first to stop firing in both directions, and then to use the time that we would have in such a cease-fire to see if we can reach a broader diplomatic agreement,” Mr. Blinken said on Friday at the news conference.</p><p>Since the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel last October, Hezbollah has been launching rockets and missiles into northern Israel in support of its ally, forcing about 60,000 Israelis to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-displaced.html" title="">leave their homes</a>. Israel has retaliated with attacks mostly in southern Lebanon, in turn forcing tens of thousands of residents there to flee.</p><p>The first Israeli official in the briefing said Israel must not allow Hezbollah or any other hostile force to set a precedent of forcing Israelis to permanently abandon parts of the country. Israel now has the advantage and momentum in Lebanon, the official said, and should keep acting forcefully to capitalize on that.</p><p>Ronen Bergman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Tel Aviv.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="47" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2IxODZmZTQ2LTI1YjktNTY2NC1hNDYzLWIwOGEyZjA0Mzg3OA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/27/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas#israel-struck-after-learning-of-a-hezbollah-leadership-meeting-officials-say" data-source-id="100000009727233"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ronen-bergman"><img alt="Ronen Bergman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/16/multimedia/author-ronen-bergman/author-ronen-bergman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/16/multimedia/author-ronen-bergman/author-ronen-bergman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/16/multimedia/author-ronen-bergman/author-ronen-bergman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-27T22:59:44.409Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 27, 2024, 6:59 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Buildings destroyed by Israeli airstrikes south of Beirut, Lebanon, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ibrahim Amro/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Israel’s attempt to kill Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, on Friday came after its government received information indicating he had just convened a leadership meeting at an underground facility south of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, according to five Israeli officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence.</p><p>The officials said Israeli intelligence agencies had been aware of the facility, under four residential buildings in a densely populated neighborhood south of Beirut, and the government ordered airstrikes based on real-time information indicating Mr. Nasrallah had gone there.</p><div><p>Based on that information, and based on the large amount of ordnance fired at the site, including weapons designed to destroy bunkers, and the intelligence gathered from inside Hezbollah since the attack, the initial assessment of Israeli intelligence agencies is that Mr. Nasrallah has been killed, the officials said.

But they cautioned that assessment was preliminary and might yet change.</p><p>It was the first time that Mr. Khamenei had convened the Supreme National Council, the group that responds to national security threats, domestic and international, and shapes foreign and national policy, for an emergency meeting since July 31, when Israel assassinated a top Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran.</p><p>The meeting came as Masoud Pezeshkian, the Iranian president, and the foreign ministry issued statements strongly condemning Israel’s attack, calling it “an undeniable war crime,” without naming Mr. Nasrallah.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Khamenei leading a prayer over the coffins of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and his bodyguard in a photograph released by state media in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“Iran will follow up on the Zionist’s latest crime and stand by the people of Lebanon and the resistance,” Mr. Pezeshkian said in a statement.</p><p>Privately, though, Iranian officials expressed concern that the absence of a statement from Hezbollah on Mr. Nasrallah’s status portended bad news, the three Iranian officials said. The cellphones of Iranian officials across the country beeped with text messages and phone calls asking variations of the same question: Any news from Sayyed? It was a reference to Mr. Nasrallah by his nickname and religious title.</p><p>Iran also requested an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a forum of Muslim countries, to discuss the attack.</p><p>Speaking to the U.N. Security Council on Friday, Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, accused the United States of being an accomplice to the Israeli attack, saying both countries should be held accountable.</p><p>“Netanyahu and his companions have become so viciously emboldened to dream of repeating their carnage in Lebanon and pushing the entire region into a full-scale war,” Mr. Araghchi said, referring to Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. “It is very clear that they are counting on U.S. support for their sinister campaign of terror and destruction.”</p><p>As Iran assesses how to respond to Israel, it faces a familiar problem: how to establish deterrence without encouraging all-out war. Analysts said that targeting Mr. Nasrallah escalated the standoff between Israel and Iran and its proxy militias to a new, more dangerous level.</p><p>Until now, Iran has refrained from letting Israel drag it into an open war, analysts said. That posture is likely to continue.</p><p>“Iran’s position seems to be that if Israel wants war, it’ll get it at the time of Iran’s choosing,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group. Mr. Vaez said that Israel had decapitated Iran’s regional allies in the past, and instead of eliminating the threat, it has fed radicalization, enabling Iranian recruitment to continue.</p><p>At midnight in Tehran, the Iranian capital, supporters of the government protested in the city’s Palestine Square, waving Palestinian flags and Hezbollah’s yellow flags while chanting, “Revenge, revenge,” Iran’s state television showed.</p><p>Around 1 a.m. in Iran, state television was putting senior officials and military commanders, including the anti-Western ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, a member of the Supreme National Council, on air to reassure viewers that Hezbollah would survive even if its most senior leaders were killed.</p><p>Ronen Bergman<!-- --> contributed

Hezbollah has become both a political organization that holds sway in fractured Lebanon and an army equipped with ballistic missiles that can threaten Tel Aviv.</p><div><p>The leader of the strongest militant group that Iran has helped to create in the region, Mr. Nasrallah has extended its reach well beyond Lebanon. Hezbollah fighters were instrumental in shoring up the government of President Bashar al-Assad next door in Syria when it was threatened by a popular uprising that started in 2011. Designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Hezbollah has helped to train Hamas fighters, as well as militias in Iraq and Yemen.</p><p> Mr. Nasrallah is known, according to Arab tradition, as Abu Hadi or father of Hadi, after his eldest son, who was 18 when he died, in September 1997, in a firefight with the Israelis. Mr. Nasrallah has at least three other children.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Nasrallah on a large poster in Beirut in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>He has long called for the liberation of Jerusalem and referred to Israel as “the Zionist entity,” maintaining that all Jewish immigrants should return to their countries of origin and that there should be one Palestine with equality for Muslims, Jews and Christians.</p><p>Mr. Nasrallah is believed to live modestly and rarely socializes outside Hezbollah’s ruling circles, eschewing public appearances and the telephone since the 2006 war against Israel. That war, which was set off when Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers during a cross-border raid, ended after 34 days of combat with both sides declaring victory. Afterward, Hezbollah was lauded across the Arab world, and took on an increasingly active role in conflicts around the region. </p><p>Mr. Nasrallah is a powerful orator with a robust command of classical Arabic. He laces his speeches with references to restoring lost Arab virility, a message that resonates across the region.</p><p>He comes across as less dour than most Shiite clerics, partly because of his slight lisp and a propensity to crack jokes. He has never pushed hard-line Islamic rules, like veils for women.<span>  </span>The state within a state that he helped build with Iranian and expatriate financing as Lebanon struggled to emerge from a long civil war includes hospitals, schools and other social services.</p><p>Born in 1960 in Beirut, Mr. Nasrallah grew up in a mixed neighborhood of impoverished Christian Armenians, Druse, Palestinians and Shiites. His father had a small vegetable stand.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of Hezbollah watched a televised speech by Mr. Nasrallah in 2018, urging them to participate in forthcoming elections.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>He studied briefly in a seminary in Qum, Iran, in 1989 and considered Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution<span>  </span>to be the model for Shiites to end their traditional second-class status in the Muslim world.</p><p>In 1983, suicide bombing attacks against first the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, then the barracks of American and French peacekeepers, killed at least 360 people, including 241 American service members. The murderous attacks were claimed by the Islamic Jihad Organization, considered a precursor to Hezbollah, and some of those suspected of planning it later became top commanders under Mr. Nasrallah.</p><p>Security around Mr. Nasrallah has long been extraordinary, particularly given that an Israeli rocket incinerated his predecessor. When he granted a rare interview to The New York Times in 2002, the reporter and photographer were blindfolded and driven around the southern suburbs of Beirut for a short time before the meeting. His security team then inspected absolutely everything that would enter the room, even unscrewing the pens to make sure that they contained only ink.</p><p>Hezbollah has exchanged artillery barrages with Israel since the war in Gaza started, but has been hesitant to bring its full arsenal to bear, given that many Lebanese, weary of grinding economic problems and general chaos, do not want another war.</p><p>On Sept. 19, in his most recent televised remarks, he blamed Israel for the exploding pagers and walkie-talkies that killed dozens of his foot soldiers and wounded several thousand more in the days before. “This retribution will come,” he said. “Its manner, size, how and where — these are things we will certainly keep to ourselves, in the narrowest circles even among us.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Watching a speech by Mr. Nasrallah this month in Beirut.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="27" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMGE0ZmEwMjctMmZjZi01N2JiLTliNzAtMWQ1ODFkMzM5OTQ2"><div id="0a4fa027-2fcf-57bb-9b70-1d581d339946" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/27/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas#0a4fa027-2fcf-57bb-9b70-1d581d339946"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farnaz-fassihi"><img alt="Farnaz Fassihi" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-27T19:04:28.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 27, 2024, 3:04 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called an emergency meeting of the Supreme National Security Council at his home compound, according to two Iranian officials with knowledge of the meeting.
