    <h1>At Least Four Apartment Buildings Were Destroyed by Israeli Strikes, Videos Show</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>All four of the destroyed structures were residential buildings along the same street. Two neighboring apartment buildings that were at least seven stories tall were hit. About 100 yards away, two neighboring buildings that were also at least seven stories were also hit.</p><p><a href="https://t.me/QudsNen/125041" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Footage</a> recorded on top of the debris of a flattened building also shows significant damage to several surrounding buildings. The blasts tore the facades off the lower floors and blew out many of the windows. The strikes destroyed nearby vehicles and left craters in the streets about 700 feet away.</p><p>A <a href="https://x.com/manniefabian/status/1839690743524335984" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> filmed during the strikes and posted on the social media app Telegram showed several distinct smoke plumes. An enormous cloud of smoke rose from the area of the four destroyed buildings identified by The Times, and one large plume of smoke rose from areas slightly to the east of the buildings. Multiple additional explosions can be heard and seen in the video.</p><p>The extent of the damage from the strikes was not yet clear.</p></div></div>
