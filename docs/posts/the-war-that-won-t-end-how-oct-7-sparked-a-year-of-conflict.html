The first goal essentially precludes the second: Hamas’s surviving commanders in Gaza, led by Yahya Sinwar, are believed to be hiding alongside hostages, making it hard for Israeli soldiers to capture or kill them without harming their own citizens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Hamas seeks mainly to survive the war as a movement, a modest goal that allows it to weather a level of destruction that might have caused others to surrender. In World War II, Japan surrendered after suffering widespread devastation while France did so to avoid such harm. Hamas has done neither, as its leaders attempt to set off a regional conflict that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-gaza-war.html" title="">endangers Israel’s long-term future</a>.</p><p>The war also continues because of the way each side is waging it. Hamas is fighting as a guerrilla force, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/world/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israel-fighting.html" title="">hiding in a vast network of tunnels</a>, making it hard for Israel to deal a decisive blow. And when Israel has seized parts of Gaza, it has in most cases given up those gains by refusing to hold the ground.</p><p>The two men driving many of these dynamics are Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Sinwar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-12"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jacquelyn Martin/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmud Hams/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In Israel, Mr. Netanyahu’s grip on power relies on several far-right lawmakers who have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-netanyahu-ceasefire.html" title="">threatened to collapse</a> his fragile coalition government if he ends the war without destroying Hamas. At least in part, that dependency has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-gaza-politics-war.html" title="">prevented Mr. Netanyahu</a> from agreeing to a hostage-release deal.</p><p>In Gaza, it was Mr. Sinwar who oversaw plans for the raid that started the war. It is his tolerance for the ensuing destruction and large civilian death toll that has allowed Hamas to fight on even as much of Gaza lies in ruins and his top military commanders are dead. And it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/world/middleeast/gaza-war-hamas-yahya-sinwar.html" title="">his insistence on a permanent cease-fire</a>, coupled with Mr. Netanyahu’s on a temporary one, that has prevented any truce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Both sides appear to have decided that they will not go back to how things were before Oct. 7. Hamas’s leaders have said the prewar dynamic of endless Israeli occupation must be disrupted regardless of the human cost. Israel feels far more vulnerable after the deadliest day in its history and has decided it can no longer tolerate groups dedicated to its destruction on its borders.</p><p>“This war won’t end because nobody is willing to blink,” said Thomas R. Nides, the United States ambassador to Israel until shortly before the Oct. 7 attack. “In the meantime, everyone is losing — hostages and their families, innocent Palestinians, Israelis displaced from northern Israel, Lebanese civilians. And it’s truly tragic.”</p><h2 id="link-2f2fceb2">October: A Hidden Enemy</h2><p>The first sign that Israel might struggle to achieve a conventional military victory came in the hours after its forces invaded Gaza on Oct. 27.</p><p>Israel sent more than 20,000 troops to capture Gaza City and its hinterland, accompanied by hundreds of tanks, after Israeli warplanes had spent nearly three weeks pounding Gaza with one of the deadliest aerial campaigns of the 21st century. In a traditional encounter on the battlefield, Israel’s invasion force would have swiftly devastated Hamas’s military wing.</p><p>Instead, Hamas’s fighters were nowhere to be seen. Their commanders appeared to have made a strategic decision to avoid giving Israel the chance to deliver a knockout blow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Eitan Laub, an Israeli officer tasked with capturing a cluster of buildings close to the border, imagined that his battalion would face fierce resistance.

Hamas’s gunmen were largely hiding in a tunnel network, hundreds of miles long, that extended under homes, schools, hospitals and United Nations facilities. Wearing ordinary clothes that made it hard to distinguish them from civilians, the fighters would emerge suddenly from those tunnels to shoot at Israeli soldiers and attach mines to their tanks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The result was a campaign of attrition. By hiding underground, Hamas was able to blunt much of Israel’s technological superiority, forcing it to expend considerable time searching for trapdoors, booby-traps and secret tunnels and exploding them.</p><p>As a result, the Israeli military had yet to capture key areas of Gaza City by the time the sides agreed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/23/world/europe/israel-hamas-ceasefire.html" title="">a brief cease-fire and hostage release deal</a>, nearly a month later. Each day of the cease-fire, Israel released roughly 10 Palestinian prisoners for every hostage freed by Hamas.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-released-thursday.html" title="">Some of those hostages</a> were handed over at a plaza at the heart of Gaza City. Through that approach, Hamas displayed how much control it still exerted there.</p><h2 id="link-7eaab85f">November: Sinwar’s Shift</h2><p>If there was a moment when it became clear the war would not end soon, it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/01/world/middleeast/01gaza-israel-fighting-resumes.html" title="">the day that cease-fire collapsed</a> in late November.</p><p>Until then, no one was sure how far Israel would advance or how long Hamas would hold out. Diplomats and negotiators assumed it would be possible to repeat the brief cease-fire, perhaps several times.

Israel refused, assuming bad faith, and unwilling to set a precedent by giving up on the women.

As Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters fought for control of the site, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/world/middleeast/gaza-al-shifa-hospital.html" title="">ruined hospital</a> was a jolting testament to the astonishing toll the war had taken on civilian life.</p><p>The facade was scorched with soot, punctured by scores of shells and bullets.

In between, Israel had left the hospital, allowing Hamas to reestablish it as a nerve center for its operations. To expel Hamas again, Israeli commandos returned in late March, setting off a 12-day battle that wrecked most of the buildings that had survived the first raid.</p><p>This counterproductive pattern has been replicated in scores of places across Gaza throughout the war.

Israel had agreed to withdraw from Gaza during a cease-fire and showed more flexibility on allowing displaced Palestinians to return to homes in northern Gaza, two concessions that pleased Hamas.</p><p>At least 30 hostages would be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, as well as a surge in humanitarian aid for millions of Gazans.</p><p>Then Mr. Netanyahu changed his mind. As mediators prepared to fly to Rome, hoping to finalize the deal at a summit on July 28, the prime minister instructed his negotiating team to make <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">several new, last-minute demands</a>, according to diplomats, Israeli officials and a copy of the demands reviewed by The Times.
