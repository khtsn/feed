Those targets were applauded at the time as industry-leading by some analysts and investors.</p><p>In the meantime, though, oil and natural gas prices have risen. And some areas of green energy in which BP invested, notably offshore wind, have fared poorly, especially in the United States.</p><p>The Trump administration, which favors fossil fuels, has also altered the investment and operating environment for energy companies.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stanley Reed reports on energy, the environment and the Middle East from London.
