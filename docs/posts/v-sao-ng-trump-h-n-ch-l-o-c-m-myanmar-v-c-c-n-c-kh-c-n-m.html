This is the 78th Tony Awards ceremony.</p><p>Here’s how to watch:</p><h2 id="link-1a030ceb">What time does the show start?</h2><p>The televised portion of the ceremony starts at 8 p.m. Eastern (5 p.m. Pacific) at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. The broadcast is scheduled to last three hours.</p><h2 id="link-3b3fe01a">Where can I watch?</h2><p>The main event, with prizes for plays, musicals and performers, will be televised on CBS. For those without network television, it’s a bit more complicated: In the United States, it will stream on Paramount+, but only Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers can stream it live, via their local CBS affiliate; otherwise it can be streamed on demand starting the next day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-24763ba9">Who is hosting?</h2><p>The broadcast ceremony will be hosted by Cynthia Erivo, a powerhouse singer best known for starring as Elphaba in the “Wicked” films. She is a Tony winner herself, for a 2015 revival of “The Color Purple.” The broadcast will feature performances by 11 of this past season’s Broadway musicals, as well as by the original cast of “Hamilton” in honor of that show’s 10th anniversary. The presenters will include Oprah Winfrey, Charli D’Amelio, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson, Adam Lambert and Keanu Reeves.</p><h2 id="link-4e988a79">Is there a non-broadcast portion of the ceremony?</h2><p>Yes. There is a preshow ceremony, starting at 6:40 p.m. Eastern, at which many of the awards for creative teams will be handed out. That event will be hosted by Darren Criss and Renée Elise Goldsberry, and can be streamed free on Pluto TV (click on the “Live Music” channel in the “Entertainment” category).</p><h2 id="link-2326bcf1">What’s eligible?</h2><p>The 21 plays and 21 musicals that opened on Broadway between April 26, 2024, and April 27, 2025, are eligible for awards this year. Prizes will be granted in 26 competitive categories. The most-nominated shows are the musicals “Buena Vista Social Club,” “Death Becomes Her” and “Maybe Happy Ending,” with 10 nominations each.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Paulson is the theater reporter for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
