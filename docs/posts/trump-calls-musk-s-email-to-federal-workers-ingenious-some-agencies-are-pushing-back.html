    <h1>Trump Calls Musk’s Email to Federal Workers ‘Ingenious.’ Some Agencies Are Pushing Back.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“They don’t mean that in any way combatively with Elon,” he said, suggesting that those responses were prompted by concerns about security at agencies like the F.B.I. “They’re just saying there are some people that you don’t want to really have them tell you what they’re working on last week. But other than that, I think everyone thought it was a pretty ingenious idea.”</p><p>The split among advisers came just two days before Mr. Trump is set to convene his first full cabinet meeting of his second term at the White House on Wednesday. Eight years ago, his first cabinet meeting turned into a session of gushing, “dear leader” praise for Mr. Trump as his top aides extolled, as one put it, the “blessing” of working for the president.</p><p>That could still happen again on Wednesday. People in Mr. Trump’s current orbit have repeatedly sung his praises in recent weeks. After a meeting with Russian officials last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said over and over again that “Trump is the only leader who can bring peace to Ukraine.”</p><p>Since Mr. Trump took office, his most senior officials have aggressively implemented the president’s demand for a smaller government, free of what Republicans call “woke” ideology. Thousands of employees have been fired or put on leave. Entire agencies, like the U.S. Agency for International Development, have been all but shuttered. Remote workers have been told to return to the office or be fired.</p><p>But the response to the email suggests that there may be limits to how far Mr. Musk, acting on Mr. Trump’s behalf as the leader of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, can push the bureaucracy.</p><p>Emails to several members of the White House press office, including Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, did not receive a response.</p><p>Madeleine Ngo<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nicholas Nehamas<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington, and <!-- -->Kate Conger<!-- --> from San Francisco.</p></div></div>
