At today’s hearing, the judge said he was trying to establish whether the government had defied his order. He made no ruling, but he told the Trump administration to return to his court on Friday to argue over the merits.</p><p>A Justice Department lawyer insisted at the hearing that the Trump administration did not violate the order. He also repeatedly refused to answer the judge’s questions, citing “national security concerns.”</p><p>The administration had previously argued that the planes carrying the deportees, including suspected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/world/americas/tren-de-aragua-gang-venezuela.html" title="">Venezuelan gang members</a>, had already left U.S. soil by the time the judge ordered them to turn around on Saturday. The judge appeared skeptical of that reasoning. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The White House also argued that the judge did not have the authority to stop the deportations, saying that the president had broad powers to quickly expel immigrants under an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/alien-enemies-act-trump.html" title="">18th-century law meant for wartime</a>.</p><p>The legal battle was the latest, and perhaps most serious, flashpoint yet between the administration and the federal courts, which have sought to curb many of the president’s executive actions. President Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, indicated today that the president planned to continue such deportations despite the court’s order — an action that could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/us/constitutional-crisis.html" title="">thrust the country into a constitutional crisis</a>.</p><p>“We’re not stopping,” Homan said. “I don’t care what the judges think.”</p><p>In a separate case, a professor at Brown University was deported, even though she had a valid visa and a court order temporarily blocking her expulsion. The reason, according to the Department of Homeland Security, was that she had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/rasha-alawieh-brown-university-doctor-deported-hezbollah.html" title="">attended a Hezbollah leader’s funeral in February</a>.</p><h2 id="link-45b6d1ea">In other politics news:</h2><ul><li><p>Dan Bongino arrived at the F.B.I. today as its second-in-command, cementing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/bongino-patel-fbi-trump.html" title="">major shift at the nation’s premier law enforcement agency</a>.</p></li><li><p>Corporate leaders thought Trump viewed tariffs as a negotiating tool. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/trump-tariffs-auto-industry-corporate-executives.html" title="">They’re realizing that he’s a true believer.</a></p></li><li><p>Disagreement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/elbridge-colby-pentagon-trump.html" title="">over a Pentagon nomination</a> has become a proxy for the battle over how America should wield its power and influence globally.</p></li><li><p>Trump claimed that Biden’s pardons are “void” because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/autopen-pardons-biden-trump.html" title="">his use of an autopen</a>.</p></li><li><p>At town halls, Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/republicans-town-halls.html" title="">found uncertainty and anxiety</a> about Trump’s agenda.</p></li><li><p>Some Republicans are trying to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/climate/biden-clean-energy-tax-credits-trump.html" title="">rebrand clean energy</a> as a step toward Trump’s promise for “energy dominance.”</p></li><li><p>The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/polls/donald-trump-approval-poll-tracker.html" title="">began a new effort</a> to track public opinion, starting by collecting all <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls.html" title="">polls of Trump’s approval rating</a>.</p></li><li><p>Quiet conversations about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/democrats-president-2028-buttigieg-newsom-walz.html" title="">next race for the White House</a> are already underway.</p></li></ul><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“We want to see if we can bring that war to an end,” President Trump said on Sunday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L.
