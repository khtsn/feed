His colleagues saw some reason for hope that a wider war could be averted, given that Israel attacked only military targets on Saturday, he added.</p><p>“It seems that people are hopeful that soon the situation will be back to normal,” he told The New York Times when reached by telephone.</p><p>“The vibe is not normal, though, at the moment,” he said. “People are experiencing different emotions: Some are worried, some indifferent and some are even happy, because they believe that Israel attacks will humble the regime a bit.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Soheil, like other Iranians reached by The Times on Saturday, asked not to be identified by his full name for fear of retribution.</p><p>Iranian officials and the state news media played down the Israeli attack, calling the damage “limited” and claiming that Iran’s air defense had intercepted the strikes.</p><p>Israel did not strike sensitive sites related to Iran’s nuclear program or oil production facilities in retaliation for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah" title="">large barrage of ballistic missiles that Iran fired at Israel</a> this month. And while the attack marked a new escalation between the two archrivals, it appeared to be calibrated to stop short of all-out war.</p><p>After the attack was completed, Iran did not immediately threaten to retaliate, but it did say that it had the right to do so.</p><p>On state television on Saturday, reporters around Tehran, the nation’s capital, cheerfully proclaimed that all was well. Live shots showed a vegetable market and morning rush-hour traffic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But for some residents, it was a night of little sleep and high anxiety as the sounds of explosions kept them up.</p><p>Maryam Naraghi, an Iranian journalist, said she had heard “the sound of bombs and explosions” from her home in Tehran.</p><p>Houri, a 42-year-old mother of two in Tehran, said in a telephone interview that after a night of loud explosions and consoling her children, she was anxious about what lay ahead for Iranians, many of them having grown weary of conflict and years of economic hardship.</p><p>She said her husband had stayed glued to satellite television and social media all night for updates on the attacks because Iran’s state news media offered little information.</p><p>Yashar Soltani, a journalist, said he had woken up in Tehran to the sounds of an attack that seemed to be nearby.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I saw very big lights in the sky,” he said.</p><p>The attack on military bases and other targets in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran Provinces lasted only a few hours and was over by about 5 a.m., Israeli officials said.</p><p>As the sun rose on Saturday, people in Iran tried to go on with their day as usual, hoping that a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/world/middleeast/israel-iran-attack-war.html" title="">wider war could be avoided</a>.</p><p>Shadi, a 41-year-old living in Tehran, said she had not heard any of the explosions overnight.</p><p>“We people of Iran are victims of all these political games,” she said. “We have experienced so much that we all have become somehow numb.”</p><p>Farnaz Fassihi<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>10</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>A Very Nervous Night in Iran, And in the Morning, Some Hope<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
