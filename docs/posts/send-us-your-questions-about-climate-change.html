It Could Alter the Oceans.</h2><p>In a quiet patch of forest in Nova Scotia, a company is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/climate/oceans-rivers-carbon-removal.html" title="">building a machine</a> designed to help slow global warming by transforming Earth’s rivers and oceans into giant sponges that absorb carbon dioxide from the air.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When switched on later this year, the machine will grind up limestone inside a tall green silo and release the powder into the nearby West River Pictou, creating a chalky plume that should dissolve within minutes.</p><p>The effect could be potent, scientists say. Rivers contain carbon dioxide that is constantly escaping into the air, where it traps heat and warms the planet. But adding limestone converts some of that carbon dioxide into a stable molecule that instead stays underwater and washes into the sea, where it should remain trapped for thousands of years. <em>— Brad Plumer and Raymond Zhong</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/climate/oceans-rivers-carbon-removal.html" title="">Read the full article</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><h2 id="link-3df7d4cf">Should you buy a hybrid or an E.V.?</h2><p>For many car buyers, hybrids seem like a great compromise between gasoline and electric vehicles. Hybrids, which combine internal combustion engines and electric motors, produce less pollution and use less fuel than conventional automobiles. And, owners never need to worry about running out of battery power on a lonely highway.</p><p>While hybrids do save money for some people, that’s not always the case. And many experts and environmental groups are critical of hybrids, saying that the fuel savings are exaggerated and that they don’t cut greenhouse gas emissions as much as needed to slow global warming. Here’s what to know if you’re in the market. <em>— Jack Ewing</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h3 id="link-4c1687aa"><span><strong>More climate news:</strong></span></h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/michael-regan-epa-environmental-justice-lawsuit/679941/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Atlantic examines</a> the Environmental Protection Agency’s uneven efforts on environmental justice initiatives under its administrator, Michael Regan.</p></li><li><p>A goal to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030 is within reach, with some big caveats, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/embargoed-climate-goal-triple-global-renewable-energy-by-2030-within-reach-iea-2024-09-24/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Energy Agency reported</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/10/methane-emissions-increase-climate/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Washington Post reports</a> that emissions from methane, one of the most powerful greenhouse gases, are rising at a record rate, and that food systems are a larger culprit than fossil fuels.</p></li><li><p>Underground fires, both in the Arctic and in warmer locales like Brazil, are becoming more common, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-underground-wildfires/?srnd=green" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reports</a>, and they have a big effect on emissions.</p></li></ul><section data-id="100000009087865" data-testid="capsule-block"><hr/><p><strong>Thanks for being a subscriber.</strong></p><p>Read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/climate-fwd" title="">past editions of the newsletter here</a>.</p><p>If you’re enjoying what you’re reading, please consider recommending it to others.
