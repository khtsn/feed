			<p>It&#39;s always been like that </p>
<p>Edit: Also to add on to this. Of course &#34;we&#39;ve always done it like this&#34; is not an argument for why it&#39;s good.</p>
<p>The thing is, the final four are usually held in a different, bigger arena from the rest of the tournament. Booking such an arena is expensive, and so you&#39;ll want to minimise the time you have there.</p>
<p>Also, matches on three days in a row have not really proven to be a real disadvantage for teams. On the contrary: we&#39;ve seen plenty of lower final winners win the grand final as well, despite the map ban disadvantage. </p>
<p>That deep into the tournament, it&#39;s less about prep and more about resilience, form and momentum. Winning that LF and then playing the GF on the next day can actually be quite the advantage for a lot of teams.</p>		</div></div>
