    <h1>How Biden Changed His Party</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>President Biden has never exactly been a liberal Democrat or a conservative Democrat. He has instead stayed in his party’s mainstream. When the party moved right in the 1990s, he moved with it. When it moved left in the 2010s, so did he.</p><p>But Biden has not simply gone with the Democratic flow. Over his more than 50 years in politics, he has periodically shown strong opinions about how his party should change — and helped it do so.</p><p>Last night in Chicago, Biden took a big step in his long political goodbye, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-convention.html" title="">delivering a 52-minute speech at the Democratic convention</a>. In today’s newsletter, I’ll examine how Biden’s presidency shaped his party — and consider whether Kamala Harris is likely to continue these shifts. I think three points are key.</p><h2 id="link-5a2f3786">1. Biden’s neopopulism</h2><p>Biden has always understood the class resentments that many Americans feel. (If you haven’t read Robert Draper’s profile of Biden for The Times Magazine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/magazine/joe-biden-president-legacy.html" title="">I recommend it</a>, including the section in which Biden analyzes George W. Bush.)</p></div></div><div><div><p>Biden’s political career began in 1972, when he defeated an incumbent Republican senator in Delaware even as Richard Nixon won a landslide. Biden ran as a subtly different kind of Democrat, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/20/briefing/biden-2024.html" title="">a more working-class image</a> than the party’s presidential nominee that year, George McGovern. Biden simultaneously distanced himself from the liberal fervor of the 1960s and portrayed himself as an economic populist. He criticized both draft dodgers and “millionaires who don’t pay any taxes at all.”</p><p>Five decades later, Biden became the most populist Democratic president in modern times. This positioning wasn’t just about his background, either. Populism has recently gained a new appeal, thanks to the failure of the market-based economic policies of the past half-century — which are often known as neoliberalism — to deliver broad-based prosperity.</p><p>Instead of focusing on trade deals, Biden tried to build up American manufacturing. He joined a picket line with autoworkers and appointed labor-friendly regulators. He gave Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. He cracked down on “junk fees.” He tried to end decades of gentle antitrust regulation.</p><p>Biden devoted much of his speech last night to this agenda. He claimed to have rebuilt “the backbone of the middle class.” He said, “We finally beat big Pharma,” and “Wall Street didn’t build America, the middle class built America.” When the crowd chanted, “Union Joe,” he replied, “I agree. I’m proud.”</p></div></div><div><p>These economic policies are largely popular even though Biden is not. If the Democratic Party’s shift away from neoliberalism — toward what I’ve called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/19/briefing/centrism-washington-neopopulism.html" title="">neopopulism</a> — continues, Biden’s presidency will be a major reason. And Harris’s initial economic proposals suggest that much of the shift will continue if she wins.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At a picket outside a General Motors facility in Belleville, Mich.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pete Marovich for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-6a83ecda">2. Bipartisanship lives</h2><p>Biden loves to talk about how he has proved his doubters wrong, sometimes with a dash or two of hyperbole. Yet there is at least one aspect of his presidency for which he deserves to gloat: his surprising success at passing bipartisan legislation.</p><p>He has signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure, semiconductor chips, Ukraine aid and TikTok — as well as on anti-Asian hate crimes, the aviation system, the electoral process, gun violence, the Postal Service, same-sex marriage and veterans’ health. In a polarized Washington, Biden has demonstrated that bipartisanship remains possible.</p><p>“Remember, we were told we couldn’t get it done?” he asked in last night’s speech.</p><p>He drew on his long Senate career to help pass these bills. He refused to treat the Republican Party as the enemy and remained upbeat — and often in the background — even when negotiations stalled.</p><p>Would Harris show similar patience? And would congressional Republicans be willing to work with her? It’s hard to know.</p></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-6375ff05">3. A new cold war</h2><p>Biden’s signature line about foreign policy is that the world is witnessing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/briefing/biden-united-nations.html" title="">a struggle between democracy and autocracy</a>. You can quibble with the details, but his basic point is correct.</p><p>U.S. allies are mostly democracies — including Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Australia, Mexico and Canada. The countries that treat the U.S. as an enemy are autocracies — China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. Increasingly, these autocracies are collaborating with one another.</p><p>Biden has defined the United States as the leading player in an alliance to combat autocracy. “Who can lead the world other than the United States of America?” he asked last night.</p><p>As president, he confronted China economically and promised to defend Taiwan. He rallied a pro-Ukraine coalition after Russia invaded. He withdrew from Afghanistan — chaotically — partly because of its limited strategic importance. He abandoned his initial reluctance to work with Saudi Arabia, an autocratic ally, and embraced it as a counterweight to Iran. He continued to embrace Israel for similar reasons, despite the death and destruction in Gaza.</p><p>Biden’s foreign policy is based on the idea that the world has entered a new cold war (even if he rejects the term). And Harris? Her campaign has said little about foreign policy or her worldview. Maybe that will start to change in Chicago this week.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joe Biden announces his candidacy for president in 1987. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Keith Meyers/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-6bc7d7ff">More on the convention</h2><ul><li><p>“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/politics/biden-democratic-national-convention-speech.html" title="">America, I gave my best to you</a>,” Biden said in a speech that also criticized Donald Trump. </p></li><li><p>Biden called picking Harris as his running mate the best decision of his career.
