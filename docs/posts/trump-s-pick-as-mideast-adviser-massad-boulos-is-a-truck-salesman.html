Mr. Trump called him a “highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the international scene.”</p><p>The president-elect even lavished what may be his highest praise: a “<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113578355420867250" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dealmaker.</a>”</p><p>In fact, records show that Mr. Boulos has spent the past two decades selling trucks and heavy machinery in Nigeria for a company his father-in-law controls. The company, SCOA Nigeria PLC, made a profit of less than $66,000 last year, corporate filings show.</p><p>There is no indication in corporate documents that Mr. Boulos, a Lebanese-American whose son is married to Mr. Trump’s daughter Tiffany, is a man of significant wealth as a result of his businesses. The truck dealership is valued at about $865,000 at its current share price. Mr. Boulos’s stake, according to securities filings, is worth $1.53.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As for Boulos Enterprises, the company that has been called his family business in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/19dec434-1837-4e64-aa88-b7d7864e54b4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Financial Times</a> and elsewhere, a company officer there said it is owned by an unrelated Boulos family.</p><p>Mr. Boulos will advise on one of the world’s most complicated and conflict-wracked regions — a region that Mr. Boulos said this week that he has not visited in years. The advisory position does not require Senate approval.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/12boulos-2-vgwp/12boulos-2-vgwp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/12boulos-2-vgwp/12boulos-2-vgwp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/12boulos-2-vgwp/12boulos-2-vgwp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man walks past a fence outside a truck dealership." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/12boulos-2-vgwp/12boulos-2-vgwp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/12boulos-2-vgwp/12boulos-2-vgwp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/12boulos-2-vgwp/12boulos-2-vgwp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/12boulos-2-vgwp/12boulos-2-vgwp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/4ffdba0e-020c-5e84-abe3-dcacdda0159d" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Trucks and heavy machinery in the forecourt of SCOA Nigeria PLC, the dealership Massad Boulos runs in Lagos, on Wednesday.
