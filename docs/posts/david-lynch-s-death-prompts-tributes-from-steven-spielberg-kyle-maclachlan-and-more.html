In his caption, MacLachlan thanked Lynch for his career, saying the director plucked him “out of obscurity” to cast him as Paul Atreides in the 1984 adaptation of “Dune.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“What I saw in him was an enigmatic and intuitive man with a creative ocean bursting forth inside of him,” MacLachlan wrote. “He was in touch with something the rest of us wish we could get to.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/david-lynch-remembered-steven-spielberg-1236276104/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement to Variety,</a> the director Steven Spielberg praised Lynch as a “singular, visionary dreamer who directed films that felt handmade.”</p><p>“I got to know David when he played John Ford in ‘The Fabelmans,’” Spielberg said in his statement. “It was surreal and seemed like a scene out of one of David’s own movies. The world is going to miss such an original and unique voice. His films have already stood the test of time and they always will.”</p><p>The actress Lee Grant, who appeared in “Mulholland Drive,” posted on X that she first became fascinated by Lynch’s work in the ’90s, because the production manager of a film she was working on built the shooting schedule around the “Twin Peaks” broadcast so no one on the crew would have to miss it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Years later, when offered the chance to work with him for a day, I jumped at the opportunity to see how a mind like that directed,” she wrote in <a href="https://x.com/TheLeeGrant/status/1879968618013970810" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post on X.</a> “It was a day on ‘Mulholland Drive.’ He was, in actuality, a one of a kind artist.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The director Jane Schoenbrun, who has previously discussed the influence of Lynch’s work on their film “I Saw the TV Glow,” compared Lynch to the novelist Franz Kafka and the painter Francis Bacon, saying that all three dedicated their lives to “opening a portal.” “He was the first to show me another world, a beautiful one of love and danger I sensed but had never seen outside sleep,” they wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/sapphicspielbrg/status/1879963537071824932" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“David Lynch, RIP.
