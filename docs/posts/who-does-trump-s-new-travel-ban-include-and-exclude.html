And it limits travel from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.</p><p>Here are some of the exemptions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Green card holders: </strong>People with green cards — individuals who have a pathway to U.S. citizenship — are exempted from the ban. When a travel ban was introduced by Mr. Trump during his first term in 2017, chaos and confusion ensued at airports. The Department of Homeland Security had to put out a statement clarifying that green card holders could enter the country. This time, the administration is making that exemption clear in the order itself.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual citizens: </strong>People who are American citizens but also hold citizenship with a banned country are exempt under the order.</p></li><li><p><strong>Those seeking visas through connections to U.S. family members: </strong>Immigrants from the banned countries who seek visas through connections to their spouses, children, or parents who are American citizens will still be able to apply for them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Certain athletes: </strong>Athletes and coaches traveling to the United States to take part in major sports events, along with their families, will still be allowed into the country. The United States is one of the hosts of the World Cup in 2026, and Los Angeles is the site of the Summer Olympics in 2028. This exception will allow soccer players from targeted countries, like Iran, which has already qualifed, to enter the United States for the World Cup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Refugees granted asylum: </strong>Those who have been admitted as refugees or were granted asylum are exempted under the order.</p></li><li><p><strong>Afghans who helped the U.S.:</strong> The order exempts Afghans who seek to enter the U.S. under a special visa program for those helped the U.S. government during the two decades of war after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iranians fleeing religious persecution: </strong>Iranians who are escaping the country because they belong to a religious minority, like Christianity, are also exempted.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Emergency Abortions</strong><strong>:</strong> The Trump administration announced that it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-emergency-abortion-rule.html">revoked a Biden administration requirement</a> that hospitals provide emergency abortions to women whose health is in peril, including in states where abortion is restricted or banned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crucial Global Vaccination Programs: </strong>The Trump administration’s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/health/trump-budget-global-health-polio.html">eliminates funding for programs that provide lifesaving vaccines</a> around the world, including immunizations for polio.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump and Antisemitism:</strong> President Trump’s effort to punish Harvard over antisemitism is complicated by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-antisemitism.html">extensive history of amplifying white supremacist figures and symbols</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Science Funding: </strong>Thousands of scientists, academics, physicians and researchers have responded to the administration’s executive order about “restoring a gold standard for science,” which puts Trump’s political appointees in charge of vetting scientific research and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/climate/executive-order-gold-standard-science.html">gives them the authority to “correct scientific information</a>.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Kennedy Center: </strong>Ticket sales and subscription revenue at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/arts/music/kennedy-center-ticket-sales-subscriptions.html">fallen sharply since President Trump made himself chairman</a>, according to data compiled by employees that was obtained by The Times.</p></li><li><p><strong>Musk and Trump</strong>: Elon Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/technology/elon-musk-criticizes-republican-legislation.html">lashed out against the far-reaching Republican bill</a> intended to enact Trump’s domestic policy agenda.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data on Food Stamp Recipients: </strong>In response to a federal lawsuit, the Agriculture Department said it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-administration-personal-data-food-stamp-recipients.html">would refrain, for now</a>, from demanding that states turn over the personal information of people receiving assistance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Can America Make Things Again?</strong>: Trump wants to revive factories, using tariffs as a tool.
