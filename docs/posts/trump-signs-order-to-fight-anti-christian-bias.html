    <h1>Trump Signs Order to Fight ‘Anti-Christian Bias’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critics said the order and the task force turned the nation’s traditional understanding of religious freedom, established by the First Amendment and reinforced by decades of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/17/us/clinton-signs-law-protecting-religious-practices.html" title="">laws</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/us/politics/supreme-court-religion.html" title="">Supreme Court decisions</a>, on its head by singling out a particular religion.</p><p>“Rather than protecting religious beliefs, this task force will misuse religious freedom to justify bigotry, discrimination and the subversion of our civil rights laws,” Rachel Laser, the president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said in a statement.</p><p>She added, “If Trump really cared about religious freedom and ending religious persecution, he’d be addressing antisemitism in his inner circle, anti-Muslim bigotry, hate crimes against people of color and other religious minorities.”</p><p>Mr. Trump said he would also convene a new presidential commission on religious liberty, which he called “a very big deal.” He also plans to create a new faith office in the White House led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/02/us/politics/paula-white-trump.html" title="">the Rev. Paula White</a>, a televangelist and longtime faith adviser to Mr. Trump whose populist interpretation of the Gospel has proved divisive among Christians.</p><p>During his remarks Thursday, Mr. Trump condemned the conviction of an anti-abortion activist who attended the prayer breakfast, Paulette Harlow. She was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/final-defendant-sentenced-federal-conspiracy-against-rights-and-freedom-access-clinic" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sentenced to prison in May</a> for blocking access to an abortion clinic. Mr. Trump pardoned Ms. Harlow <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/trump-pardon-abortion-clinic-activists.html" title="">and other anti-abortion demonstrators</a> days after taking office.</p></div></div>
