number of captives the Israeli military has freed out of the approximately 250 abducted in the Hamas-led attacks last Oct. 7.</p><p>Several other hostages’ bodies have been recovered in military operations, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/08/14/admin/israel-hostages-released" title="">scores of women and children were released</a> during a weeklong cease-fire with Hamas last November. More than 100 captives still remain in Gaza, at least 30 of whom are believed to be dead.</p><p>The operations to free hostages by force have often resulted in high death tolls in Gaza.

The soldier was identified as Pvt. Ori Megidish, 19.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Dec. 12:</strong> Two hostages <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/12/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-bodies-gaza.html" title="">were found dead</a> and their bodies repatriated to Israel, the military said. The operation to locate them resulted in the deaths of two Israeli service members.</p><p><strong>Dec. 15: </strong>Israeli troops shot and killed three hostages whom they mistook for Palestinian militants. The three — Yotam Haim, Samer Talalka and Alon Shamriz — had emerged shirtless from a nearby building, waving a white flag, according to the military. The shootings shocked the country and heightened fears that more captives could be unintentionally hit by Israeli fire.<span>  </span></p><p><strong>Feb. 11, 2024: </strong>Israeli security forces said they had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/11/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostages-rescued.html?smid=url-share" title="">freed two hostages</a> being held in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.

Israel put the total number of dead at around 100. Neither toll distinguished between civilians and combatants.</p><p>The New York Times found that Israeli strikes that were part of the rescue operation had destroyed or damaged at least 42 buildings. The areas hit included apartment buildings and a crowded market, helping to explain the high death toll.</p><p><strong>Aug. 20:</strong> Israel said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-bodies-recovered-gaza.html" title="">retrieved the bodies of six hostages</a>, five of whom were previously known to be dead.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">Israel-Hamas War News</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israel-Hezbollah Tensions:</strong> Amid fears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, the two sides mounted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-hamas-gaza-iran.html">biggest round of cross-border strikes</a> since the war in Gaza began.
