His lawyer, Gerald King, said that Mr. Sigmon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/execution-firing-squad-south-carolina.html" title="">chose to be shot</a> because he had concerns about South Carolina’s lethal injection process.</p><p>If the execution is carried out, Mr. Sigmon will be the first inmate killed in such a manner in the state’s history. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1606/death-penalty.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Polls</a> show that a majority of Americans favor the death penalty, but many view the firing squad as an archaic form of justice. But as lethal injection drugs have become harder to obtain — and have at times resulted <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/21/1144188268/executions-2022-botched-lethal-injection" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in botched executions</a> — several states have recently legalized firing squads as an execution method.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Utah is the only state that has used a firing squad in modern times; in addition to 2010, it did so <a href="https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/documents/ESPYyear.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in 1996 and 1977</a>.</p><p>Mr. Sigmon is to be executed in the death chamber at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia, S.C., the state capital, shortly after 6 p.m.</p><p>Mr. Sigmon will be strapped to a metal chair that sits above a catch basin in a corner of the room, according to the state’s protocols, and his lawyer will read his final statement. A hood will then be placed over his head. The South Carolina Department of Corrections <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25549744-firing-squad-protocol/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that “a small aim point will be placed over his heart by a member of the execution team.”</p><p>The metal chair is 15 feet from a wall with a rectangular opening. Behind the wall will be a three-person firing squad facing Mr. Sigmon through the opening, according to the Department of Corrections.</p><p>Because of a shield law passed in 2023, little is known about the firing squad members. According to a spokeswoman with the Department of Corrections, they train every month, year-round. A 2022 <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25549744-firing-squad-protocol/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news release</a> about renovations to the death chamber said that the firing squad consists of Department of Corrections employees who volunteer to take part. They will shoot a type of ammunition often used in police rifles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>After the warden reads the execution order, the firing squad will shoot through the opening at the “aim point” on Mr. Sigmon’s heart. Witnesses sit in chairs along one wall of the chamber behind bullet-resistant glass. According to the department, witnesses can see the inmate, but not the firing squad’s rifles through the opening.</p><p>Three other states — Mississippi, Oklahoma and Idaho — allow the firing squad as a secondary method of execution, to be used only if a lethal injection drug cannot be obtained. In Idaho, the State Senate recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/death-penalty-firing-squad-idaho-botched-execution-b8a0a54e2ee00fb86237ea4fad084317" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> that would make death by firing squad the primary method.</p><p>The firing squad became legal in South Carolina in 2021, after the state passed a law that allowed death by electric chair or firing squad as options for people on death row. Inmates sued the state, claiming that both methods were cruel, corporal or unusual punishments, which are prohibited by the state Constitution.</p><p>The South Carolina Supreme Court, which is dominated by Republican appointees, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/firing-squad-death-penalty.html" title="">ruled last year</a> that both methods are legal, writing that neither could be considered cruel or unusual because prisoners choose their method.</p><p>Since that ruling, the state’s Department of Corrections has executed three people, all of whom chose to be killed by lethal injection. But Mr. King said that Mr. Sigmon had chosen a firing squad because of his concerns about South Carolina’s process with the lethal injection drug, pentobarbital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. King has argued in court that the Department of Corrections has not shared basic facts about the drug that one “would want to know to feel confident that they’ll work as intended,” such as how it is stored, how quickly it expires and how it has been tested. South Carolina does not make its lethal injection protocol public.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections said last month that it had turned over all information about the drug in litigation and that the agency had “sworn to the effectiveness” of it.</p><p>Lindsey Vann, the executive director of the nonprofit Justice 360, represented two inmates in the state, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/us/south-carolina-firing-squad-moore.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" title="">Richard B. Moore</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-execution-marion-bowman-lethal-injection-6ea9748c15f815e01249b6d706b0fb7e" title="https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-execution-marion-bowman-lethal-injection-6ea9748c15f815e01249b6d706b0fb7e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marion Bowman Jr</a>., whose recent executions by lethal injection did not go as planned.</p><p>Ms. Vann said that in both instances, a second dose of pentobarbital was administered 10 minutes after the first, and that in both cases, the men did not die for more than 20 minutes after the procedure began. (Mr. Moore <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/us/south-carolina-firing-squad-moore.html" title="">initially</a> chose to be executed by a firing squad, but changed his mind after the state procured lethal injection drugs.)</p><p>Mr. King said Mr. Sigmon felt that “the firing squad is what is left, given what he knows about the electric chair, and what he doesn’t know about lethal injection.” Mr. King said his client was feeling a “mix of fear and frustration.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Everything about this barbaric, state-sanctioned atrocity — from the choice to the method itself — is abjectly cruel,” Mr. King said in a statement.</p><p>Mr. Sigmon’s lawyers have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review his case and issue a stay of execution. In case that is not granted, Mr. Sigmon has also asked Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, for clemency, though the governor has not granted that to a prisoner on death row since the state restarted executions last year.</p><p>Mr. Sigmon’s lawyers have said that he suffered from an inherited mental illness and childhood brain damage. Those factors, they have argued, contributed to him murdering the Larkes with a baseball bat. After he killed them, Mr. Sigmon tried to kidnap his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>The victims’ grandson, Ricky Sims, told <a href="https://subscribe.greenvilleonline.com/restricted?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenvilleonline.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Flocal%2F2025%2F03%2F03%2Fsouth-carolina-set-to-execute-death-row-inmate-brad-sigmon-on-march-7%2F79743557007%2F&amp;gps-source=CPROADBLOCKDH&amp;itm_source=roadblock&amp;itm_medium=onsite&amp;itm_campaign=premiumroadblock&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;sltsgmt=1010_A&amp;theme=twentyfour&amp;hideGrid=true&amp;gnt-eid=control" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Greenville News</a> that Mr. Sigmon needed to pay for what he had done. “He took away two people who would have done anything for their family,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.
