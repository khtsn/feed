Thursday’s decision came <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/business/european-central-bank-interest-rates.html" title="">just five weeks after a cut at the bank’s previous meeting</a>, and on the day that a report showed the eurozone’s inflation rate <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-17102024-ap" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slowing to 1.7 percent in September</a>, falling below the bank’s 2 percent target for the first time in more than three years.</p><p>“The disinflationary process is well on track,” policymakers said in a statement.</p><p>After years of trying to force inflation down with high interest rates, central bankers around the world are walking a tightrope as they consider how quickly to cut interest rates. Lowering rates too fast could reignite simmering inflationary pressures, but keeping rates too high for too long risks slowing the economy substantially and inflation becoming too weak.</p><p>In recent weeks, policymakers have suggested that rate cuts could be more aggressive as inflation has slowed and economic growth has been lackluster. Last month, the U.S. Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/business/economy/fed-reserve-interest-rate-cut.html" title="">cut rates by a half-point</a>, paving the way for quicker or bigger rate cuts in Europe, analysts said. On Wednesday, traders increased their bets that the Bank of England would pick up the pace of its rate cuts after data showed inflation in Britain fell to 1.7 percent in September, below the bank’s 2 percent target.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The European Central Bank’s back-to-back rate cut, the first since 2011, was almost ruled out a few weeks ago. Policymakers at the bank had emphasized that they would take a cautious approach to cutting rates because of stubbornly high inflation in the services sector, which is stuck at about 4 percent. Traders had been betting that the bank would wait until December to cut interest rates again. But at the beginning of October, Christine Lagarde, the president of the E.C.B., said that the latest economic data was making officials more confident that inflation would return to their target “in a timely manner.”</p><p>At the same time, the eurozone’s economic growth has remained weak and fallen short of the bank’s projections. Consumer spending has not picked up as expected, even as incomes have been bolstered by lower inflation. The risks to the region’s economy are tilted to the downside, the bank said last month.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eshe Nelson is a reporter based in London, covering economics and business news for The New York Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eshe-nelson">More about Eshe Nelson</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
