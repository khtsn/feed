Three months later, Hillside’s school district hired him for a newly created, <a href="https://core-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/documents/asset/uploaded_file/3984/HPS/4751548/Minutes_4-25-2024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$80,000 job</a> teaching homebound students.</p><p>He was sentenced in August to six months in prison, federal records show. But that did not stop the school district from giving Mr. Salters, 62, a <a href="https://core-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/documents/asset/uploaded_file/3984/HPS/4774273/Agenda_August_29__2024__Final_.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">second job</a>: club adviser at a middle school.</p><p>There is no possibility that the district was unaware Mr. Salters had admitted to willfully failing to file taxes; his criminal defense lawyer, Raymond Hamlin, is also the school board’s lawyer.</p><p>Even in a state known for political patronage and corruption, the post-plea appointments to two taxpayer-funded jobs — and Mr. Salter’s continuing role as Hillside’s Democratic leader despite being in prison — are striking. And at a moment when New Jersey <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/nyregion/new-jersey-political-scandals.html" title="">politics are at a crossroads</a>, they highlight the challenge facing those seeking to upend the old ways of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/nyregion/tammy-murphy-new-jersey-political-machine.html" title="">wielding power</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“People keep stealing our watch and telling us what time it is,” said Dahlia Vertreese, Hillside’s mayor.</p><p>It is not clear if Mr. Salters is being paid while in prison; district officials refused to respond to questions about his job status or salary history. But his post-conviction hiring demonstrated the degree to which political patronage can sideline sensible policy decisions.</p><p>Mr. Salters entered prison on Oct. 1, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons. He is expected to remain there through March, making it unclear how he could have been hired to fulfill a teaching or advising role during the current school year.</p><p>Ms. Vertreese, a Democrat, has openly opposed Mr. Salters’s political influence in the 22,000-person township, 20 miles west of Manhattan. And residents of Hillside said the district’s decision to hire Mr. Salters has exposed how a broken system permits political power brokers to operate with impunity.</p><p>Political corruption in New Jersey has been the dominant theme of the race to replace Robert Menendez, the state’s former Democratic senator who was convicted in July of peddling his influence for bribes of gold, cash and a Mercedes-Benz. Two lawsuits, including one filed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/nyregion/new-jersey-senate-race-ballot-design.html" title="">Representative Andy Kim</a>, the Democratic nominee for the Senate seat, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/29/nyregion/new-jersey-election-ballot-challenge.html" title="">upended a mainstay</a> of party politics — a ballot design known as “the line” — that for decades has given leaders like Mr. Salters outsize power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The practice allowed county leaders to give preferred candidates a prominent spot on primary ballots — placement that <a href="https://scholarship.shu.edu/shlj/vol48/iss1/3/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies have shown</a> affords an often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/nyregion/menendez-tammy-murphy-senate-new-jersey.html" title="">insurmountable advantage</a>. A federal judge and an appeals court have deemed it unconstitutional.</p><p>“Time and again, New Jersey gives us examples of officeholders, candidates and party officials who do not have the best interests of voters and constituents at heart,” said Brett Pugach, a lawyer involved in both federal suits. “Rather, they are selected either based on personal relationships or to fulfill the private interests of party leaders.”</p><p>The school district’s superintendent, Erskine Glover, and business administrator, David Eichenholtz, did not reply to emails, calls or a public records request for information about Mr. Salters. But three people familiar with Hillside’s employment process, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they fear retribution, said Mr. Salters remains a district employee.</p><p>Mr. Hamlin said he was barred from discussing any employee’s job status. He also instructed board of education members not to discuss the matter after they were contacted by a New York Times reporter.</p><p>Commenting on behalf of Mr. Salters and the school board, Mr. Hamlin did say there was nothing in New Jersey law to preclude Mr. Salters from continuing to work for Hillside — or serving as its Democratic Party leader.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Whatever public employment he may or may not have,” Mr. Hamlin said, “there is no legal prohibition against him holding public employment.”</p><p>Asked whether he expected Mr. Salters to step down as the township’s <a href="https://unioncountydems.com/our-party/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Democratic chairman</a>, he said, “I don’t see why he would.”</p><p>The leader of the Democratic Party in Union County, which includes Hillside, is no ordinary citizen.</p><p>Nicholas Scutari, a state senator, has been <a href="https://www.insidernj.com/live-blog-union-county-democratic-committee-special-convention/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Union County’s chairman</a> since 2018. He held on to his county leadership role the next year with Mr. Salters’s support, and in 2021 he became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/nyregion/steve-sweeney-durr-nj-election.html" title="">Senate president</a>, making him one of three men in Trenton whose support is needed for most political appointments and all legislation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“If he’s incarcerated, I think it would make it pretty difficult to do the job,” Nicholas Scutari, the Democratic Senate president, said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matt Rourke/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Scutari said he was unaware that Mr. Salters was in prison.</p><p>As for the teaching position, he said, “If he’s incarcerated, I think it would make it pretty difficult to do the job.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Vertreese, 47, was elected mayor in 2017 on a ticket backed by Mr. Salters, who each election cycle runs a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/gf91a75a6HwsyLEu/?mibextid=KsPBc6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slate of school board</a> and council candidates. She said they soon parted ways.</p><p>Mr. Salters was charged with <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/union-county-man-indicted-tax-and-fraud-charges" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tax and wire fraud</a> by the U.S. attorney’s office in the District of New Jersey in 2020.</p><p>The next year, he helped to open a new school in Hillside with $2.4 million in <a href="https://unionnewsdaily.com/news/hillside/gov-murphy-welcomed-to-schools-ribbon-cutting-ceremony-in-hillside" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state funds</a>; the school’s <a href="https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1441131156708020224" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ribbon cutting</a> drew Mr. Scutari and Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat who at the time was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/nyregion/murphy-wins-nj-governor.html" title="">campaigning for re-election</a>.</p><p>Many serious crimes, including murder and sexual assault, would automatically disqualify a potential school employee from being hired, according to <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/title-18a/section-18a-6-7-1c/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state law</a>. Tax fraud is not on the list of disqualifying offenses, and a spokeswoman for the State Department of Education referred questions to the district, which has full control over hiring.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Murphy’s spokesman said the governor did not believe Mr. Salters should be a paid school employee, or a Democratic chairman, while in prison.</p><p>Hillside students, the majority of whom are Black or Latino, <a href="https://rc.doe.state.nj.us/2022-2023/district/summary/39/2190" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lag behind their peers</a> in much of the rest of Union County. Roughly 42 percent of students are proficient in English, and 18 percent are proficient in math, well below the statewide averages.</p><p>Ms. Vertreese said her efforts to publicize new recreation options for students have been blocked by Mr. Salters and his allies in the schools.</p><p>“People focus so much on the cities,” she said. “But the majority of New Jersey are these little, small, tiny towns — where no one is paying attention.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tracey-tully">More about Tracey Tully</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Overlooking Adams’s Issues:</strong> New York’s business elite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/05/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-nyc-business.html">embraced Eric Adams in the 2021 mayor’s race</a>, and continued to back him since he took office even as his legal problems mounted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving a Hardcore Haven:</strong> ABC No Rio, a vital, dangerous and confrontational art space on the Lower East Side, fought with New York City for decades. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/nyregion/abc-no-rio-gentrification-nyc.html">Did it just win?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>New York’s ‘One-Man Innocence Project’:</strong> Jon-Adrian Velazquez spent years in Sing Sing for a shooting he did not commit, helping others seek their freedom along the way. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/nyregion/jon-adrian-velazquez-exoneration-conviction.html">Now, he has finally been exonerated</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>What It Costs:</strong> Why does <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/nyregion/nyc-soft-gel-nail-extensions-price.html">this rainbow gel manicure</a> (with a chrome finish) cost $255?
